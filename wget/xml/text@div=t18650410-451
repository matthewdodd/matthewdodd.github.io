I am a Chemist, living in Commercial-street, White<lb></lb>chapel—I know the prisoner—in August last I employed him to collect money for me, and also to summon a man named Elsniger in the county-court—a short time after he wrote to me this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I believe that to be in his handwriting.</p>

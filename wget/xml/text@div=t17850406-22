               <p>On Tuesday the 8th of March, I was called on, by a friend of mine, who informed me the prosecutor's window was in danger; I stepped over the way, and I had not been there above a minute or two, before I observed the prisoner struck his arm through the glass of the shop window; I saw him take something out of the window; I immediately collared him, and took him within three doors of the place; there was another man standing near; I took the prisoner, and carried him to the prosecutor's shop; but before I took him, two others had joined him; I did not find the rings.</p>
               <p>Court. Did it appear to you that he broke the window wilfully? - Yes, Sir, he placed himself there on purpose.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was coming along the Strand, going into the city; I saw four men about the door, and I informed Mr. Langston, and I desired him to cross the way, and I would go on the other side; as soon as he crossed the way the window smashed; but I did not see that; I helped him to secure the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you saw the prisoner at the window? - No, Sir, I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was examined at the Justice's, he said I was round the window.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you say he is not one of the four men? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dermer. I found the rings at the door, directly after the alarm; the case was found by a woman stranger, in a line just by; she is not here; it was brought directly.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060035"></xptr>How many rings did you find loose? - Thirteen.</p>
               <p>Are they gold rings? - Yes; and one silver buckle.</p>
               <p>Are you able to swear to any of these rings? - Yes, I can swear to them all.</p>
               <p>Is there any mark upon them? - No.</p>
               <p>If they had been found any where else could you have sworn to them? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you only judge from the circumstances that they must have been yours? - Yes; the buckle I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Langston. I forgot to mention to the Court that the man's hand bled when I brought him into the shop.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was going to my aunt's, in the Strand, and that gentleman came up, and there was a bustle, and he said I was one; I said, I will go in with you.</p>
               <p>How came your hand bleeding? - This button broke off my breeches, and there was a pin in it; but there was no cut in my hand, it was a scratch; here is my hand now.</p>
               <p>What way of life have you been in? - I am a shoemaker.</p>
               <p>How old are you? - Twenty three.</p>
               <p>Have you been working lately in your business? - My master died before I was out of my time; I work for myself translating; I have not a witness in the world; I have been a soldier in the Middlesex Militia three years.</p>
               <p>If you had behaved well in that capacity I am sure your officer would have appeared for you? - I did behave well indeed, Captain Taylor is my Captain, in the Westminster Middlesex Militia.</p>

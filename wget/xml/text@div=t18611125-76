On the morning of 20th October, at 8 o'clock, I received information that a robbery had been com<lb></lb>mitted, and I went to Commercial-road, Peckham—I there saw the prisoner carrying a basket, going towards London—I knew where he lived; he was about seven hundred yards from his own house, and about three hundred yards from the house which was broken into—I stopped him and asked him what he had in the basket—he said, "I am not obliged to tell you"—I was in plain clothes—I said, "I am a police-officer, and I wish to know what you have got in the basket"—he then put the basket down and said, "They are old clothes, If you want to know"—I saw the table cloth, and said, "It's good clothes; it is the produce of a robbery"—there was some straw on the top of the basket, and I lifted that up—I found three petticoats, six shifts, a table cloth, and a number of other articles, some wearing apparel, &amp;c.—this is the basket and things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner then said, "A rob<lb></lb>bery! I know nothing about a robbery; I found this in a field by the Duke of Sussex, when I was going to market"—I then took him to the station, left him in charge, and went and searched his house, at 4, Park-buildings, Park-road, Peckham—I there found three aprons, two pairs of stays, two pairs of drawers, six napkins, three shawls, a writing desk, a paint box, and a box of surgical instruments, all claimed by the lady of the house that was broken into—I took the articles to the station; showed them to the prisoner, find told him I had found them in his house—he said two men had brought them in at half-past 5 in the morning—he said he did not think it was all right, and he packed them in a basket and was going to take them to the police-station—I told him he was going the wrong way to the police-station—he said he did not know where it was, and was going to try to find it—he was going quite the contrary way—he was going from his house, towards London—I then went to the house of Mr. Shevier, 37, Park-place, Peckham—that is about two hundred yards from the prisoner's house I believe—there are gardens at the backs of the houses, so that a person could get across; but it was not so in this case, they have to go a round-about way to get into the main road—I found at Mr. Shevier's that the</p>

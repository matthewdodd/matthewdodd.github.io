             sworn.</p>
               <p>I had the care of Mr. Adams's house in Hatton-street. The prisoner came to the house, I think it was on the 9th of September last. I told him I had nothing to ask<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180014"></xptr> him to eat, but if he would come and take a bit of dinner at such a time he was welcome, which he did. He went afterwards to sleep on the end of the dresser. I said he seemed very sleepy, he might go if he would and lie down on the bed where he used to lie; that was in a dark closet where the chest with the clothes was kept. After that he came down again and went into the garden; I happened to turn round. He brought in a coat upon his arm, which he had laid down with his hat, when he came in; that coat was gone and missing; that coat and his hat. I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>How long might he stay in this dark room? - I believe it might be about three hours.</p>
               <p>Did he go away? - Yes, without saying any thing. I saw him come out of the garden; I thought he was gone into the fore kitchen. Missing the coat and hat I went to see; he was not there; and when I went up stairs he was gone. I went into the dark room and found the chest open, and there was nothing left in it.</p>
               <p>Did you miss any thing else? - Yes, some tablecloths.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the chest was locked or open? - It seldom was locked; I had not opened it all the summer.</p>
               <p>Had not other people during the course of the summer been in the house besides the prisoner? - Yes, there was a char-woman at that very time cleaning down the house.</p>
               <p>Of course she had occasion to go up stairs and into all parts of the house? - She had. The woman was not in that place to take any thing.</p>
               <p>How do you know that; was she never out of your sight? - Yes, she was.</p>
               <p>Was this room locked? - No.</p>
               <p>Then when she was out of your sight she might go into this place as well as any where else, how long did she continue in the house? - A long while after he was gone.</p>
               <p>Did she come the next day? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see her go away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you observe her carry any thing away with her? - She did not.</p>
               <p>Did she go out while the prisoner was there? - No, only for a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Where is this room? - Up stairs from the kitchen on the ground floor. When he went into the garden he came down and went through the kitchen; when he came in he went up stairs again.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to this woman about missing any thing? - I did not; I did not know what was gone. I said to her, this chest is open, have you been in here? She said she had not.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Adams. How long was you from home? - About three weeks or a month.</p>
               <p>To Smith. Your master was from home three weeks or a month? - Yes.</p>
               <p>During that time had not other persons been in the house with you? - Yes; to drink tea with me.</p>
               <p>And went freely about the house? - No, they never did.</p>

I had put the knife and fork in a drawer, he could not get at them; he left them for the reckoning.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - In an orange-coloured coat and waistcoat, and had on a pair of black breeches and a large horseman's coat.</p>

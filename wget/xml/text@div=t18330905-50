            . I live in Tower-street, Seven Dials. On the 16th of July, I went in the evening to see Simmons's exhibition of wax-work - I am in the habit of taking snuff - I had my snuff-box when I went there - I staid about three-quarters of an hour, and as I came out of the last room I missed my snuff-box - there were a great many people there, but I did not observe any one in particular - when I came out and had got five or six doors down <placeName id="t18330905-50-crimeloc299">Holborn</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Had you the box when you went into this place? A. Yes, I am sure I had; I missed it before I came out - I did not notice the prisoner there - when I came out I saw the prisoner and another person with him, but the prisoner had the box - it was between nine and ten o'clock, but I saw him looking at my box by the light of a shop - I saw a box in his hand which afterwards proved to be mine - I saw it was a black box; I should have known it if I had seen the picture - I was never married; I have gone by the name of Ann White.</p>

            . I was with the prosecutirx - I did not see the box in her possession at the exhibition, but I afterwards saw the prisoner on the opposite side with a box in his hand - I crossed and took him by the collar; the person who was with him ran away - the prisoner dropped the box when I charged him with having it, and I gave him in charge of a policeman; the person belonging to the house went into the area and handed up the box - the prosecutrix saw it, and said in the prisoner's presence, it was her's - it was given to the policeman, who is now in Whitecross-street for debt - it had an oil painting on it; I should think it cheap at 6d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. A grainer -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050035"></xptr>I have known the prosecutrix fourteen or fifteen months; I am often out with her in the evening when my work is done; I do not live with her - I saw a box in the prisoner's hand; he put it behind him and dropped it when I accused him of having it.</p>

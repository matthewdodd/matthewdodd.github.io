                  </hi>. I live in Sheffield-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields—I am assist<lb></lb>ant to a dress-maker—I was at Greenwich fair on the night of the 19th of April with a female companion—I missed her, and while I was looking for her I met with Mr. Watkins—we then went to the Mitre tavern—there was a great crowd—it was just as the fair was over—we were just against the coffee-room door, when the prisoner put his head in my face, and at the same time he drew the pin out of the gentleman's scarf—I caught hold of him by his handkerchief, and called for a police-constable—I kept the prisoner, with the assistance of the crowd, till the police-constable came—I afterwards saw the pin picked off the floor—it was given to me—I handed it over to the person at the bar—I believe this to be it.</p>

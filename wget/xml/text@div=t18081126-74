On the 21st of October, it might be one o'clock, I was going over to Covent Garden, I had a pair of boots tied with a string over my shoulder, going round James street, Covent Garden, I met the prisoner Hart, she asked me whether I would take a walk home with her; I said I had no objection; I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260046"></xptr>home with her; I had not been home with her five minutes, sitting down in a chair by the fire, before she took the boots off the drawers in her room where I had put them; she went off with them; I followed her to the door and lost sight of her; I returned back to the room and stopped there till about nine in the morning then I left the room and went down to the water side; and about half past eleven I walked up to the house again to see if I could find her.</p>

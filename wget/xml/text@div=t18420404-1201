I went out that Saturday afternoon, leaving about eight pairs of Clarence boots hanging upon the door-post—I returned at nearly twelve o'clock at night, and two pairs were gone—I found them at the station that night—one pair has my stamp upon them—I am certain of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I know Mr. Wright's shop in the Kingsland-road About half-past eleven o'clock that evening, I was crossing the road, and saw a man cut a pair of Clarence boots from the door—I followed him quietly for twenty yards without giving any alarm, and then he gave them to the prisoner who stood against a gateway, about twenty yards from the shop, with his apron open ready for them, and he received them in his apron—it was very dark—he could see the shop from where he was—the man who gave them him returned towards the shop—I heard a whistle is the direction he had gone, and the prisoner immediately crossed the road—I followed him—he went in the direction the other had gone, I caught hold of him upon the pavement, and two pairs of boots dropped out of his apron—I gave him in charge with the boots—I am sure the man only cat off one pair when I saw him.</p>

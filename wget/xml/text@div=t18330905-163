               <p>CHARLES SEYFFERT. I live at No. 52, Westbourne-street, Pimlico. I am a collector of the post-horse duty; the prisoner is my own son - he came to me on Saturday, the 13th of July, to the gate in the <placeName id="t18330905-163-crimeloc901">King's road</placeName>

               <p>Q. At the time you applied to the constable, had the prisoner any weapon in his hand? A. Yes, a fork; the <rs id="t18330905-163-viclabel902" type="occupation">policeman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18330905-163-victim1570 t18330905-163-viclabel902"></join> saw it in his hand, and he told him if he came near him he would stick him, and that made him afraid to touch him; it went on till a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening, and then I spoke to sergeant Benton, and told him how my son was - he was raving mad; he has been in several asylums; he was at the Hanwell nineteen weeks; and at Tottenham eight weeks; he cut his throat there; and was strapped down at Nottingham eight weeks; and about a fortnight before this happened, he was in Tothill-fields prison for attempting to drown himself - he struck the park-keeper because he would not let him go into the park.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, you spoke to sergeant Benton - was the prisoner at that time making use of threats to you? A. Yes; he shut the half-hatch - I had got his mother away from him; Benton was coming to relieve, and the prisoner told me if I came in he would rip my b - y guts out; there was a stone on the board, and he sharpened a three-pronged fork - that was between eight and nine o'clock; I told Benton he was raving mad, and I wished him taken to a place of safety; and the moment Benton came up, the prisoner stabbed him in his left side with the fork - he left the fork in his side until Benton pulled it out; I saw it sticking in his side- Benton drew it out, and then seized the prisoner and took him into custody - he was most decidedly mad at the time - he has been subject to fits of insanity for five or six years; when he is quiet he is very well; he acted the same to other people as towards me - whenever he was without restraint, he is very violent - no offence had been given him at all; he said I had sold him for Â£800 and bought a whole row of houses with the money; I believe he is at this time sane - he is very rational at times, but goes off all of a minute; when he is right in his mind, he behaves very well - he is always fancying there is something after him when in his right senses; he is wavering, fancying he sees birds or something coming after him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I consider it impossible for him to see at the distance he stood off, whether anything was done at all; for fourteen policemen rushed on me directly - Benton struck me with a stick. Witness. I told Benton he could not do it by himself, and about three policemen came with him, but we were all within a yard of the door; nobody struck the prisoner - Benton would have disarmed him, but while his arm was up, he stuck him in the side.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He may say what he likes; he has been trying to put me away; he has tried to poison me; here is a man here who was rendering assistance, when I was taken to Hanwell on the 17th of April 1832, and kept there until August, 1833; Mr. Meycock helped to put the straight waistcoat on me, all he wishes is to have me confined; I would sooner have my life taken away, than be confined at all; I put Benton on his guard before he came up to me - every thing he has spoken is quite fabric.</p>

            . (Policeman B 10.) On the evening of the 13th of July, I was spoken to by Seyffert, at the collecting house, about ten minutes after nine o'clock; I went to the collecting house, the prisoner was standing in the toll-house, with this fork in his hand; and directly I made my appearance before the door, he came forward, and thrust the fork an inch and an half into my left side; I was not at all acquainted with his previous habits; I lost a great deal of blood; he came at me again directly, and I thrust at him, and secured him, and pulled him over the half-door; I took the fork out of my side, and gave him to one of my men to take to the station-house; I went to St. George's Hospital; he thrust the fork into my side, as hard as he could; I had my great coat on, and it came sideways through my great coat, or I should have sustained much more injury; he did it with all his strength; I have no doubt he intended to take my life if he could; I had not spoken to him; he had heard his father desire me to come to his assistance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Q. When you came up to me, did you ask me to come with you? A. No; I never spoke to you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said "No, I have not offened you, nor any of your men," you immediately took up your truncheon, and made a blow at me. Witness. When he was coming forward to stab me with the fork I had my truncheon drawn, and was going to strike his arm down, but somebody caught hold of my arm, and my truncheon fell down; I had not raised my arm to strike, until I observed his motion with the fork, and he had made a blow at me; it was in self-defence I raised my staff; he was making a thrust at me with the fork.</p>

            . I am a surgeon at St. George's Hospital. On Saturday the 13th of July, I was there and examined Benton, I found three small punctured wounds, about an inch and a half deep, between the fifth and sixth ribs; it appeared to be done by a fork like the one produced; it was not a dangerous wound, although such wounds are sometimes dangerous; it depends on the state of the body; I should think if he had not been protected by a great coat, and it had penetrated half an inch deeper, the lungs would have been wounded, which would have made it a much more dangerous case; I think a great coat likely to prevent that; it was between the ribs; I could pass a probe down across the wound; I dressed it and attended him about five days till all danger was over, and then he was attended by the surgeon of the division; I did not think all danger was removed till five days after; I should call it a punctured wound; it was done by stabbing, there was no cutting at all; it was a mere puncture not an incision or cut.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner four or five years, he was in a very bad state of mind; at times quite deranged; he is always so when he is subject to violent passions, and takes dislikes, and uses violence; most chiefly to his father and mother, and his nearest friends; I know of no provocation which he received on these occasions; I believe him a deranged madman; a raging<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050107"></xptr>madman at times; he is quiet and peaceable at other times; it comes on suddenly without any notice; his father and mother can always discover something in his countenance when it is coming on, he is kind to his family when he is not so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Clayton William Ward, who keeps a beer-shop in East-street, Walworth, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington. On Saturday night, the 28th of November, I was serving in the bar the whole evening, my husband being ill in bed—I remember the prisoners coming in together—they looked round the tap-room, said there was very little fire, and walked out again within five minutes—they had ordered something, but said, "Never mind," and went out—Hardiman walked into the tap-room again in five minutes, looked round, and walked out again—I went to bed about one o'clock—I locked the till, and put the key into my pocket—there was a considerable quantity of copper money in it, some of which I can positively swear to—about seven in the morning my boy alarmed me—I went down stairs, and found the tap-room window open—it is a double window—when I went to bed the sashes of that window were down—I found the till wide open, and a desk which had not been locked was ransacked, and a particular shilling of the reign of George the Second taken out—our premises are next to Mr. Keller's, whose yard comes near our window—any person in his premises could get over the fence, and open the window—we lost from 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in copper money, and not less than 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and about two pounds of cheroots—we gave information at the station, and on Sunday morning between ten and eleven, the policeman produced some money to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Dalton. Q.</hi> Will you swear I was in your house on Saturday after-noon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, there was a gentleman there when Hardiman came in—you came on Friday, and Saturday as well, I am positive of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. I was informed of this on the Sunday morning—I went and examined the premises—the thieves had entered at the back, by the tap-room window, and gone into the bar—the till had been forced open—MRS. Ward gave me information, and I went with another constable, and took the prisoners at No. 1, Pleasant-place, East-lane—we found Hardiman in bed, and Dalton concealed in the privy, both in the same house—the other constable found 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, under Hardiman's head in bed, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver was found on Dalton, at the bottom of his trowsers—I went back and searched the privy, and found 108 cheroots thrown down into the soil—MRS. Ward had described some money she could swear to—she saw it at the station—these three penny-pieces were under Hardiman's head—I found a piece of candle in Dalton's bed-room, and a small chisel.</p>

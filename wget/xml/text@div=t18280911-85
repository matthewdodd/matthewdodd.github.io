            . I am a bricklayer. On the 12th of July I was at William Brand's, in Coleman-street, assisting to move some goods to Vinegar-yard, City-road; the prisoner was employed to move them - he was to follow the van; he did not follow it, and when I came back I met the patrol, who said he had taken a rug out of the van - I went and found the rug, which ought not to have been taken out of the house; he said he was in distress, or he should not have taken it.</p>

            . I am an officer of Coleman-street. After the van was gone I met the prisoner, in Great Swan-alley, with the rug under his arm - when the van returned I found he had not been after it; he took us to his lodging, and we found the rug on the bed.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The plain truth is, my wife was employed to work for Mrs. Brand; she did not come home at ten o'clock - I went to inquire for her: Mrs. Brand said she was gone home - I went home, and met her coming back; Mrs. Brand asked me to come and help move the goods at one o'clock in the morning; I said I would - my wife had told me to go at three, but as I had to go at one, I thought it of no use to go to bed, and we went to Brand's house - I slept there, on Mrs. Brand's bed, while they packed the things, and then carried them down to the shop; I forgot the name of the street the van was going to, and not finding it, I went home.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that is in the handwriting of Mr. Hunt—I made out the bill, and Adams said he should like a receipt<lb></lb>stamp put on—I put one on, and signed it, and he gave me the cheque, and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of it—my account was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the cir<lb></lb>culars, and 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for stamps—I was induced to part with my money because I thought there were effects in the bank, and I should get the money—I paid the cheque into the Postmaster-General's the same night—the next morning Mr. Adams came and said Captain Hunt had sent him, and if I would give him back the cheque he would give me the money—I told him I had sent it to the General Post Office—in the afternoon this letter came: ("4th August, 1871. Miss Fiander. Madam. I find that a gentleman who faithfully promised me 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has not kept his word, and that the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque will therefore not be met, as my account has not been put in the condition I <hi rend="italic">expected</hi>, at the bank. I write to tell you Mr. Adams will call upon you to settle it to-morrow afternoon, so do not be put out about it.")—Adams came every day until the cheque came back—on the 15th August it was returned—I told him I had got it, and he asked me if I would let him have it—I said "Yes, if he would give me the money," but he had not got the money, and I did not show him the cheque—I never got back my money—this is another letter I received before the cheque was returned—it is in the prisoner's handwriting: ("I am very sorry you should have had any inconvenience about the cheque, but immediately I receive my money this week I will send yours round. Please give bearer letters for 'H. de V., Major R.' or 'Major Robinson."')—I did not see the prisoner from the time of parting with my money until he was in custody.</p>

I went to No. 27, Garnault-place, Clerken-well, which is the house of the prisoner's sister—I found the prisoner there, in the kitchen—I said to him, "You must come along with me, Mr. Pearce"—he said, "What charge have you got against me?"—I said, "The charge against you will be, returning to this country before the expiration of the term of your transportation"—he at first said, "I have never been out of England;" but on the way to the station, he said he thought he had done enough, and undergone hardships enough, in Van Diemen's Land and other places, during his period of transportation—he was a good deal in liquor—I have here a copy of the paper, which we received from Hobart Town, con<lb></lb>taining his description.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was read as follows:</hi> "At the period of the offence for which I was convicted I was suffering from the most acute pecuniary distress, with a wife and large family of children, a series of misfortunes; the most heavy was the death of my second wife, by which I lost an annuity of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with a great falling off, notwithstanding all my exertions in my occupation as reporter to the public press, brought about mainly the distress in question; previous to the commission of the offence, I had through life borne an irreproachable character; in early life, from 1818 to 1822, I held some most responsible appointments in Jamaica and other West India Islands; from 1829 to 1834 I held the appointment of Magis<lb></lb>trate's clerk and postmaster at Bong Bong in New South Wales; afterwards</p>

               <p>was superintendent of large farms at Bathurst, over the Blue Mountains, in the same colony; at the latter period I had a wife, and family of young children; the former, a most amiable partner, I had the misfortune to lose in 1838, leaving me with seven young children; my connections are most respectable; my late father was an officer of rank, and of very meritorious services; my eldest brother is at present a major in the Royal Marine corps; I was convicted in October, 1846; was three months in Millbank Peniten<lb></lb>tiary, at which period fears were entertained that my intellects would become impaired in solitary confinement; subsequently I was three years and two months in the <hi rend="italic">Warrior</hi> convict ship at Woolwich, during which period I was employed on the Government works in the dockyard; I was sent abroad in March, 1850; at Millbank and the Hulks I had the best possible character, as also on my arrival at Hobart Town, Van Diemen's Land, after a passage of four months—on my arrival I received a ticket of leave, which I retained until I left the colony, never having forfeited the game for a day by any kind of insubordinate conduct; my motive in leaving Van Diemen's Land was to proceed to the gold-diggings, in the hope I might be successful, and better the condition of my family at home, who are in very impoverished circumstances, but, although my exertions were very great in California, Victoria, and New South Wales, I was unsuccessful; it is true I made occasionally some money, but I was robbed of it on the road by armed bush-rangers, and frequently ill-used and robbed at Mel<lb></lb>bourne and Geelong by the worst of characters; I was shipwrecked twice, and once burnt out at sea, the first time in Torres Straits, between New, Holland and New Guinea, on a reef of coral rocks; upon this occasion I lost between 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, and all my luggage; eleven of us only got ashore, out of a ship's company of twenty-seven, chiefly Lascars, Malays, and Chinamen; after thirty days great suffering and privation, we were picked up by an American whaler, and ultimately reached Sydney, New South Wales; I was subsequently wrecked in a brigantine, called the <hi rend="italic">Triton</hi>, going from Melbourne to Adelaide, and lost all I possessed in the world, having another very narrow escape of my life; in returning from San Francisco to Melbourne in a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">White Squall</hi>, she caught fire about 350 miles from Tahiti (formerly called Otaheite), we were obliged to abandon her, and took to the boats, but a great number of the crew and passengers perished by fire and water, the survivors in the boats reaching Tahiti in about eight days, in a state of great exhaustion, many of whom died from the effects of the same; I had the misfortune to lose nearly all I possessed upon this occasion; on reaching Melbourne I was very ill, and went into the hospital; I left in about five weeks, intending to go again to Mount Alexander diggings, but owing to ill health, bad state of the roads from the floods, and limited means, I abandoned such; I had a twelvemonth before been to Ballarat, Mount Alexander, Forest Creek, Bendigo, and many other diggings, but at this time no police was organized, or gold escort troopers, consequently nearly all the unfortunate diggers were robbed of what they got, by hordes of bush-rangers, well mounted, and armed with revolvers and other weapons to the teeth; in returning to Melbourne from Forest Creek the last time, I was beat, stripped, and robbed of all I had, in the Black Forest, about half way between Melbourne and Mount Alexander; I left Melbourne in the brig, <hi rend="italic">Kestril</hi>, for Sydney, New South Wales, at which place I was acquainted with many respectable parties, some of whom I had known as far back as 1829, when I first went to Sydney with my</p>

               <p>wife and children; the <hi rend="italic">Kestril</hi> put in at some of the settlements of New Zealand, at one of which (Auckland), was laying a barque, bound for England, in want of hands; the temptation was great to reach my dear family, for which I had mourned ever since I met with my misfortune; I shipped myself as ordinary seaman and assistant steward; we left the settlement in July, with a miserable crippled ship's company, and made a very severe passage round Cape Horn in the winter season, we carried away masts, sails, rigging, boats, bulwarks, stauncheons, &amp;c., &amp;c., some of the crew were lost front the yards, and most of us were frost bitten; we put into Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, South America, to refit and provision; we proceeded on our passage, crossed the Equator, touched at Terceira, one of the Azores, for two days, and reached England in Sept., after a severe passage of four months and twenty-six days from New Zealand; under all the circumstances of my present unhappy condition, I humbly hope the legislature will humanely consider the long, severe, and various description of punishments I have undergone since my conviction; I would also most respectfully call the attention of the authorities to the fact, that the offence for which I have so severely suffered, was the fist deviation from strict rectitude during my life, and that I have never since, upon any occasion whatever, received a second sentence, even of the most minor description; it was only required of me, by the then regulations of the service, that I should serve five years upon the public works at Woolwich; on my embarkation for Van Diemen's Land, I had done three years and four months; if I had completed the remainder twenty months I should have been discharged from the dockyard a free man; I also humbly beg to state, at the time I left Van Diemen's Land, six years after my conviction, I was entitled, by the regulations of the service, to a conditional pardon, which would have left me at liberty to leave the colony without further restraint; I beg to state, that during the period of three years and four months I was at the hulks I worked in all the gangs in the dockyard; upon several occasions I received severe injuries, some of which requiring me to be sent to the hospital ship; I was ruptured by carrying heavy weights, the effects of which I have frequently felt since, and do to the present day; during the two periods when the cholera raged at the hulks, I attended upon the sick at the hospital ships; I humbly implore the Government will have compassion upon me, for the sake of my numerous and respectable family, for my great mental and bodily sufferings since my conviction, and for my present weakly, worn out, debilitated state of health, and award me a mild sentence; during my captivity and absence, my unfortunate wife has suffered from great desti<lb></lb>tution, and buried two of her children; she is again bereaved of me in a distressed condition, with her only surviving child, a little girl of ten years of age."</p>

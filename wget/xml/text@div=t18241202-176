On the 10th of November I lost four aprons and 2 handkerchiefs, from the kitchen. I had seen them in the course of the day before. There was a frock, apron, and handkerchief lost at the same time. We had been washing, and they were on the table, or in the window, dry, ready to fold. Maria Turner is a servant in the house - a shift of hers was missing. I saw my things a fortnight afterwards, and Mr. Rickard's; but not the shift. The prisoners were quite strangers to me. Our door is open sometimes in the day - there is a school in the house - the kitchen is on the ground floor.</p>

            . I had assisted in this wash, and saw the things that afternoon. I missed my shift between four and five o'clock - there were many other things in the wash. On the day of the robbery, the two prisoners came to master's house, with some potatoes, and I let them in - they put the potatoes in a cellar - I lighted them down - they could have got into the kitchen without my observing them, because I went up stairs.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. - I have all the things mentioned in the indictment - they were pawned at my house on the 10th of November, about four in the afternoon, by the prisoner Peckham, for 3 s. - he was in the shop about five minutes. I am sure of his person. I asked how many there were before I untied them - he said he did not know, for he had them from his sister, who had folded them up, and told him to bring them. I did not see the other prisoner at all.</p>

            . I apprehended Saunders on Thursday, the 11th of November; he said he had nothing to do with it, but in taking off his handkerchiefs. I found this handkerchief, the undermost of three, and Mr. Rickards said it was his. I could not perceive that it had any initials on it.</p>

               <p>PECKHAM'S Defence. The prisoner Sanders called and asked me whether I would assist him in carrying some potatoes to Chiswell-street, and said that he would give me something for so doing, and in Globe-lane, he met his sister. I went on with the potatoes, so that I could pay no attention to their conversation. We arrived at Chiswell-street with the potatoes, which we carried down stairs; he carrying one portion down, and myself the other. After coming away, I proceeded on while Sanders followed with the barrow - I turned round, and could not see Sanders. I went back a little distance, and there saw him sorting some things, but whose they were, and what they were I have no knowledge, nor can I form any idea how he became possessed of them; he requested me to pawn them, which I refused; he said I was a fool not to take them, as they were his own. I at length consented, not doubting but they were his own.</p>

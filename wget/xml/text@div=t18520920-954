                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 310). On 14th Sept. I was on duty near the East India Docks, and met the prisoner and another man—the prisoner was carrying this brass engine-bearing in a basket—I followed him into a beer shop—he then came out and stood at the door, and beckoned to a marine store dealer that I knew, and that caused me to have a strong suspicion he had something in the basket which was on his back—I felt it, it was heavy, and I said to him, "What have you got here?"—he looked at me, and said, "A bit of braes; my foreman gave it me to take to the foundry; come back to the beer shop, and I will show you"—I went back, he pointed out a man, and said, "That is my foreman"—I said to the man, "Is this your property in this basket?"—he made no answer—I said, "Come, let us know?"—he then said to the prisoner, "You take it where I told you"—I said, "If you are his foreman, why don't you come with him?"—he made no answer, and I said to the prisoner, "You were going to take it to a marine storeshop, and I shall take you to the station"—he said, "Don't take me there, and I will take it to the foundry, where I was ordered to take it"—he then took me to Mr. Stewart's brass founders, at Black wall—I there saw a gentleman belonging to the foundry, and asked him in the presence of the prisoner whether he had done any work for Mr. Peto, and whether he was casting anything for him—he said he had not done any work for him, and said, "Oh! that is stolen, no doubt; you be careful of the prisoner, and take him to the station house"—I took him to the station, and then went after the man he called the foreman, but I have not been able to find him—I have ascertained he was not in Mr. Peto's employ—I have compared this brass with an engine, and find the mark "Z" on it corresponds with a "Z" on the engine.</p>

On the 5th of June, at about nine o'clock in the morning, I took a walk across the fields to see the damages which had been done over night. When I came there I saw the prisoner, with a few boys, first on the roof of the house. It was then about nine o'clock in the morning; there were then many people in the house tearing the inside of the house down. The prisoner began pulling the tiles down and throwing them into the street; after they had cleared a good part of the tiles away, they threw the lead down, and then took each a piece of timber which the lead was nailed to and pushed down the parapet wall, till it was even with the lead, then they shoved the lead of the gutter off into the street; it was a very great weight. I went home then, and returned again in about half an hour. As I was going on an errand to Temple-bar, I saw the prisoner still at work upon the house. The mob were upon several parts of the house throwing and tearing down the timber; I looked at them for the space of an hour. I heard a mob in Grub-street talk of going to demolish an house in Christopher's-alley. I thought it then more prudent to return home, and so I went back again. As I was going home I saw the prisoner at Mr. Dillon's house, taking down a large window, which was difficult to pull down. The principal piece of timber, which went from one wall to the other, four of them took hold of it, the prisoner was one; he took hold of it, and broke the garret room in the middle. One was a barber, another appeared to be a jack tar, and the other was a twine spinner. They took hold of it in the middle and swayed it till they broke it in two, which brought down all the roof together into the street; that was all I saw the prisoner do.</p>
               <p>Who gave information about this prisoner? - I went to work in the afternoon, and told my shopmates, that I saw the prisoner Jonathan. We made a joke of it; it came to Mr. Taylor's ears. Mr. Taylor's and Mr. Dillon's houses were both beset.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - Yes, I have known him four years. It passed on till Wednesday, then, when I was going to see the ruins, some part of the mob said, d - n it we will have the clock-maker's house down next. That is the man I work with. I sent one of his apprentices to tell him that the mob were going to destroy his house. We sent word we would come into the house one by one backwards; we did so. There were a great many of the mob in the shop; they found we were too strong for them; they did not manage it that night nor the next day. On the Friday it began to be rumoured about, one of the apprentices told our master what I had seen the prisoner do. The neighbours had determined to prosecute all they knew who were concerned. My master asked me if if I had seen the prisoner, and what he was doing; I told him. He said he should be taken up. Some time after that I was called down out of the shop; there were three soldiers; they asked if I was the man who was to show them the prisoner. Then they bid me walk before them, and deliver the prisoner to them. We went towards the skittle-ground the prisoner uses; I went in half a minute before the soldiers. I called to the prisoner, who was lying upon a bench, Jonath an get up, for here are the soldiers coming to take you. He was lying in a narrow place; he endeavoured to make a run; a window pushed him back; the soldiers came up, saw who he was, and took him directly. The soldiers said, is this the man? I could hardly speak. My master said, is this the man? I said yes. Then the soldiers said, deliver him to us; and they took him away.</p>
               <p>What day was this? - This was on the 10th, the Saturday I believe.</p>
               <p>Had you heard any thing about the reward then? - I had not heard any thing of it till I got to the Artillery Ground, when I was sent for, which was about half an hour after he was taken; I knew him four years before. I am very sure the prisoner is the person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He offered Mr. Bull, the constable, that he would give him half the reward if he would appear against me - What dress was I in at the time you saw me? - He had a green coat on, and his own hair.</p>
               <p>Now he has a wig, has not he? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Do you know the house adjoining? - It goes in the name of Mr. Dillon but Mrs. Crook pays the taxes; she was housekeeper to them; they did not like to be troubled with it; the taxes are commonly paid in her name, but the house is called Mr. Dillon's; I was in the house at the time the mob came.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Dillon live in it? - Yes, till Saturday the 3d of June; the house was destroyed on the 4th and 5th.</p>
               <p>Why did Mr. Dillon leave the house on that day? - Because he had notice the mob would come to destroy it.</p>
               <p>In what condition was the house when the mob came? - In perfect good condition. I went out when the mob came in, and on the Tuesday it was quite down to the ground.</p>

               <p>I think it was last Thursday se'nnight I happened to go into the Fox alehouse, in Moorfields, for a pennyworth of beer; Crossley and two other people were there talking about the prisoner; knowing the prisoner I listened to their conversation. I heard Rodnor ask Crossley if he knew any body who was there? Crossley said, no, he did not know any person there. It exasperated me a little. I said to Crossley how can you be such a villain to swear against this man when you say you know nobody who was there.</p>

               <p>Had he sworn against him? - The man had been apprehended before this; I asked him how he could be so base to go and swear against this poor fellow when he did not see him there? He did not know directly what answer to make me; presently after he said, there! where do you mean? Why says I the place we are talking about; it was not the Artillery-house we were talking about; I did not hear him mention the Artillery-house, it was the place in White's-alley.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Was no mention made of the Artillery-house? - Not while I was there; it might be mentioned before I came in; I had no thought of being called here, if I had I might have taken more notice.</p>
               <p>This was after the prisoner was apprehended and Crossley had sworn to him? - Yes, when he said there! where do you mean? He seemed very angry; some words ensued on the matter. I thought it an unjust thing; he went away and said he would fix us all; I do not know that he had any right to say so of me.</p>
               <p>Court. What did he say when you said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280270"></xptr> they were talking of him? - I believe he was ashamed; he ran out of the house and said he would fix us all.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Have not you been threatening the witness since he came into court; I have been told you have? - Then you have been told a very false thing.</p>

               <p>Where did Edger mean? - At a place in Ropemakers-alley.</p>
               <p>That is not White's-alley? - White's-alley is a street which turns up in Ropemakers-alley.</p>
               <p>Dillon's house was not in Ropemakers-ally? - I do not know where Dillon's house was; that was the conversation between him and us.</p>
               <p>Do you know the house which is pulled down in White's-alley? - I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>How came Edger to ask Crossley whether he had seen either of them in Ropemakers-alley? - I cannot say what was the reason of his asking that question; the prosecutor came into the ale-house, the prisoner's mother had sent for him; they were talking of this, how the prosecutor could be so base to take a man up and swear against him without being sure.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are you one of those who called Crossley a Papist? - No.</p>
               <p>Did your hear him abused and called a Papist? - I do not remember his being called a Papist; there were some high words arose but nothing of abuse.</p>

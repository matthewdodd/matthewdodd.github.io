            . I live in Merlin's-rents, Shoe-lane. On the 29th of August, between five and six o'clock, I was sitting in the court nursing my child; Watson, who lodged in the court, was up in her room. A coach stopped at the end of the court. Smith ran up the court from the coach. Watson came down to him, and they both went together to the coach. I saw him take a bed out of the coach, and give it to her. She took it up stairs; then he took out a large parcel in a sack or sheet, and followed her up stairs. She lodged at No. 6. I saw Barber looking out of her window.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What was in the sack you do not know - A. No. I had seen Smith several times before, but never spoke to him. I understood that he lived with Watson. They were large bundles. He had top-boots on, which appeared soiled.</p>

            . I live at No. 6, Merlin's-rents, on the second floor. On Friday evening, the 29th of August, I was at tea, and saw Smith come up the court. He appeared in a great hurry, and went up to Watson, who lived above me, and called her; she followed him down the court. and presently she came up with a bed, tied in a blanket, and he brought a large white parcel; he returned and fetched a sack, which had red letters on it. Watson's is the back room on the third floor. Smith frequently came to see her. I have seen him go out early and late of a morning, but did not see him come home at night. I saw him on the stairs-one evening, and saw him go out next morning.</p>

               <p>THOMAS WILDEN. I am a constable. On Friday, the 29th, in consequence of information I went to Merlin's-rents, and was on the watch from five o'clock till nine. I was on the other side of Shoe-lane, and saw Watson pass me with something in her apron. I asked what she had there; she said a gown of her's and her sister's, which she had had some time. I asked where she lived. She said in Shoe-lane. I took her into Merlin's-rents, and found a piece of gingham on her. The officers brought Smith down stairs. I sent him to the watch-house. We went into the room with Watson, and asked which room she lived in. She said she sometimes slept in that room, pointing to the back room, third floor; and there we found the bed, a bag with red letters on it, full of calico, and a piece of sheeting. She said the bed was hers. Smith said he knew nothing about them.</p>

On the 18th of October the prisoner came in to ask for a bit of plaster for his leg, and said he had been wounded in the East Indies - I gave him a bit, and asked what part of the Indies he had been to; he said several parts - I asked him several questions, having an uncle in India; he said he was a watchmaker, and I showed him my watch - he said there was merely a wheel loose; he said he could do it, but not there; I said he should do it there- he said he could not, he threw down his pension-ticket, and said, "If I run away you can not only find me, but stop my pension;" I put it into the drawer, and soon after he came and said to my servant, "I am come for my pension-ticket," and he gave it to him.</p>

I keep the sign of the Man of War, at Poplar, I took the watch out of pawn for the prisoner - he told me to take it out and keep it for him, and he was to go with me to Chelsea to receive his pension, and then to satisfy me; I got it from a pawnbroker in High-street, Poplar, on the 19th of October - I gave the same watch to the officer, on the 22nd.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was not the prosecutor that gave it to me, it was his sister; I had done one for his servant before his face - I had the brooch of his sister, and took the parts of the watch in my hand, and showed them to her.</p>
               <p>MR. WYKES. The pin of the brooch was broken - he took that and the watch too; he did not return either of them - he had repaired one brooch, and this was a second one.</p>
               <p>MR. HAVERD. The prisoner gave this brooch to my wife, and said, the watch and brooch had been made a present to him by a lady in India, in return for saving her life from a tiger.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I repaired the brooch, and returned it to the lady - I said the watch was not right, and she told me to keep it; I had been with another man, and had some beer - I told Mr. Haverd I would not lose, the watch for ten times the value of it; I told him the officer who owned the watch, and the whole history of it.</p>

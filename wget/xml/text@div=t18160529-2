            , ESQ. I know the prisoner at the bar; she was in my service from the middle of February, 1815, to the middle of February, in the present year. I left town to go the Circuit, on the 3rd of July, in the last year; I left nobody else at my house but her; I left property to a very considerable amount in my house; I left a great deal in my bed room on the second floor; I was occasionally at my house in the course of the autumn; but did not return until the 19th of January; I had an express came down to the country, to inform me that there had been a fire, and when I came up to town the chest of drawers in my bed room was consumed; the whole of it had been apparently burnt; I afterwards discovered a vast quantity of things pledged; the whole of those mentioned in the indictment; I found them about March last. I first of all sent for the prisoner, and enquired of her particularly about the fire, in consequence of missing a quantity of table linen, which was kept in a different part of the house from where the fire was; and the prisoner said, she hoped I would take pains to find it out; she supposed they had been stolen in the fire, and it was very prejudicial to her character; and I then said, that I was going to Bow-street, or that I had been to Bow-street, and I never saw her after that; in a few hours she absconded. In the evening of that day, in consequence of the foreman of a Mr. Tate, a pawnbroker, living at No. 1, Cambridge-street, Golden-square, calling on me, I went to his master's house. and saw there a quantity of caps; I think six or eight. I also went to the house of a Mr. Daubrise, another pawnbroker, in Oxford-street, and found the curtains of the bed in my room, which was consumed; also a necklace, a watch, and a ring. These had been all in the chest of drawers which was burnt; the curtains were on the bed, (which was also consumed,) when I left town.</p>

            . I am a locksmith. I know the prisoner at the bar. I opened the locks of a chest of drawers in the two pair of stairs bed room; she sent for some things out of the country, which were in these drawers, but she had not got the keys.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not the lady's maid with me when I had the drawers opened?</p>
               <p>Witness. Yes, once; but I have opened several locks since that. I know Mr. Pollen's lady's maid; I remember opening a door once when she was present.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was the lady's maid with the prisoner ever when you opened the chest of drawers in the back room on the second floor?</p>
               <p>Witness. Yes, once she was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I wish to clear myself concerning the fire. I had to air all the mattrasses before the family came to town; the straw mattrass and the hair mattrass I aired, and put by; but I had to leave the white mattrass all night. I went up about five o'clock in the evening, but for fear of greasing the house, I did not take up any candle; I left a little fire in, and the white mattrass at the fire, and there was only breadth enough for a chair to stand between the fire and the bed, and the curtains were hanging over the mattrass. I then shut the drawing room window shutters, and all the shutters, and then went down stairs into the kitchen, and I never went up stairs from that time until a gentleman knocked at the door, and gave me the alarm of fire; he said, my good woman, your house is all on fire; I immediately ran up stairs, and the gentleman followed me, and I opened the room door, and was just going to rush in, when the gentleman pulled me back, and some more people came up, and soon after a fireman came, and we got water, and I assisted in getting water as quick as possible, and after the fire was extinguished, I came down stairs again, and when I came down the fireman said, what have you been doing with the mattrasses, and I said, I had aired them; and he said that it was from that mattrass which was near the fire that the fire began, and the furniture. The hair mattrass and the straw mattrass were burnt completely, and there was not so much of them left as could be worked up with new stuff again. I pledged these things, I own it, and it was my intention to redeem them again.</p>

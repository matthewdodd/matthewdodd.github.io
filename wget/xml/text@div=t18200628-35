I rent the house with my sister, Jemima Hill, we only rent two rooms in the lower part of Mr. Harris's, who does not live in the house. On the 6th of June, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I went out and left my child, Susannah, at home. I locked the door, and took the key out - I was absent ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and on my return I found a false key in the door, but the door was locked. I unlocked it with that key - I had my own in my pocket. I turned round and missed the cloth off the table, also two sheets, and three towels, which were sent us to wash - they were worth above 1 l. In about an hour or two I found them at Miller's. The prisoner told me to think myself well off that I had got my property.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Golden-lane. On the 6th of June, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoner brought two sheets, and three towels to pledge; I offered to lend her 10 s. upon them - she would not leave them for less than 11 s. - they are worth about 16 s. She left the shop. I stepped into the parlour, and having heard that something was ordered to be stopped, I went out and brought her back with them; she said they were her daughter's, who kept a straw-bonnet shop in Long-lane. I said some articles had been stopped, and I would go with her to her daughter's. She went part of the way, and then said a man was to give her sixpence to pledge them, and he was to be found at the top of Brick-lane.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 16th of March, 1791, did any person make any application to you in the jewellery business? - Yes, on the 16th of March, 1791, the prisoner came to my shop to ask to see some necklaces, and ear-rings, we shewed him some that were commonly sold, he said he wanted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150173"></xptr>diamond necklaces and ear-rings, and was recommended by Lord Salisbury, there were but few in the shop, I told him we would collect others of the work people, and shew them in a few hours; he agreed to my waiting upon him in two hours, which was at four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you to go to? - To St. James's Place, he left a card and address (the card produced) Lord Massey on one side, and No. 36, St. James's Place, on the other. I went accordingly to the apartment at four o'clock, when I came to the house, a man servant shewed me up stairs, and I went into the room and found the person who had given me the card, I opened my goods and shewed him my book, he was looking over the book, and he asked the price of several articles, I told him; he asked me if I asked the lowest price, as he was going to pay ready cash for them. A person came into the room and said Dr. Hunter was come in, the Dr. came into the room, and the prisoner at the bar begged I would go out of the room while he spoke to the Dr. I went out of the room for about five minutes, and then was called in. Dr. Hunter was sitting down at the table to write, the prisoner looked at the articles, he then made choice of a pair of diamond ear-rings, a necklace, a watch and chain; he desired me to put them in cases, I told him I would take them home and put them in cases, as I had no proper cases with me, he desired me to bring them again as soon as possible, as he was going out; I went back again as soon as ever possible I could get them packed up, and took the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was you back? - This was before five, he looked over the bill, and I shewed him some other articles at the same time, which the workmen had brought in since I was gone out, he looked over the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the amount? - Seven hundred and sixty pounds; he then went to the drawer, and brought me this note. (produced) I looked it over, found it was regularly drawn on a check, told him I had not cash about me, I would get it changed, I returned in about half an hour with a draft on my house for the difference of the bill, his servant told me he was gone out, I waited for about half an hour expecting he would return, but I found he did not; I told the servant I would call in the morning, I went to Mr. Coutts's first in the morning, found the note was refused payment there.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe from the time of his delivering the note, you never saw him till he was in custody at Birmingham? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that? - That was on the 13th of last November twelvemonth, the year 1791, he was at that time in custody at Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person you saw at Birmingham, the same person that gave you the said draft? - He is.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good to look at the prisoner, are you certain and clear he is the man? - I am; I have not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. I observe that before the magistrate at Birmingham, you said you believed he was the man? - I did; I wished to avoid prosecuting him, I thought there were such heavy charges against him there, that justice would be done without.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Council. There was eight months from the time you saw the prisoner and received the bill from him, to the time you saw the prisoner at the bar? I should like you to recollect what you said, when you got to Birmingham? You said just now, that you verily believed he was the man, did not you say on the contrary, that you could not positively speak to his person? - I said that I believed him to be the person.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you did not make use of this expression at any time in Birmingham, that you could not speak positively to his person? - No, sir, I said that I believed him to be the person.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150174"></xptr>Q. Did not you say, Mr. Green, that the person who had got the goods of you was a thinner man than the prisoner, who was then examined? - At that time, I said, he was thinner than when I saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish you would recollect yourself a little, did not you say that the person who had the goods of you, was a thinner man than the man that was examined before the magistrate? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had the least sight of the person who obtained the goods of you for these eight months? - No, not for these eight months.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, your Lordship has done me the honour to allow me to reply in answer to the charge exhibited against me by Mr. Garrow; it certainly is not my with to be distinguished as a public speaker, and several powerful reasons present themselves, why I should be silent on this occasion; but in the present case, I feel myself irresistibly impelled to arrest the attention of the court, while I submit a few remarks to the candour, good sense, and liberality of you, my Lord, and the Gentlemen of the Jury. Gentlemen, I feel peculiarly unfortunate in being obliged to add to the loads of misery I now sustain, the being placed at this bar, to answer this charge. The circumstances of my now standing under the strongest prejudices, the public opinion being against me, oppressed by calumny in every newspaper, and almost convicted by the popular cry, before I have even heard the charge imputed to me, or had it in my power to say a syllable in my defence, under such prejudices, and in such a situation, I can only rely on the judgment, the honour, and the integrity of the learned Judge, before whom I am tried; and to implore a fair, candid, and an impartial hearing of the cause to the Jury, who are to determine the matter.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I can only be anticipating the observations that will be made much more favourable for me by the learned Judge, when I earnestly request of you, Gentlemen of the Jury, to try this cause<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150178"></xptr>on the evidence adduced before you, and totally to lay out of your consideration every thing you have heard before it came into this court, your minds being only impressed by the effect of the evidence; from which I feel a most perfect confidence in receiving a verdict declaring my innocence.</p>
               <p>I will now take the liberty of imparting to my lord and gentlemen of the jury, such observations as have occurred to me on the evidence which has been given against me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Green, gentlemen, I am sorry to say it, hath exceedingly departed from the truth, in a most gross and flagrant manner; gentlemen, my assertion is this, and I well know that base assertions can have but little weight, but, gentlemen, I have it in my power to call a gentleman of the first respectability, a man who wants only to be known, to be universally admired; I shall not anticipate his evidence more than I have already done, he will tell you that Mr. Green, when he saw me at Birmingham, on the mention of this question, said that the person that imposed on him was a much thinner man than myself, he has now told you he did not say so; that he said, that I was exactly the man, and that he was very certain of it; gentlemen, what can we think of a man thus elastic in his mind, one that will swear one thing one day, and one thing another: Heaven forbid, gentlemen, that I should be desirous of depreciating the character of any man, even the greatest enemy I have in existence, I assure you I would not; but when such flagrant evidence thus contradictory in itself, is brought against me, with a view to deprive me of my life, I think it but fair I should make it known.</p>
               <p>The next witness that is called is the lady that keeps the house, where the impostor lodged; she has acted in such a manner that does her infinite honour; she does not say that I am the person, she says she thinks I am the same person, but she does not attempt to speak that I am the person who imposed upon her. Gentlemen, I need not tell you what a wonderful coincidence in manner, size, appearance and voice, there may be between two persons without the smallest connection, as to the same identical person; we know a man of the brightest genius is like to err, as to identity and more particularly, where the view has been transient, as appears in the present instance. The mistress of the house swears that I left the house at five o'clock, the maid servant swears it was at six; gentlemen, were women will take upon themselves to swear to the identity of a person, in a forcible manner, it is very extraordinary, they should not as well recollect, to as great a certainty the hour, it appears they do not, for the mistress of the house says, I went away about five, and the maid servant says, I went away about six; therefore her evidence, as to the identity of person, cannot be depended on.</p>
               <p>The next witness called is Lecree, who appears to have been a servant, with the assumed Lord Massey, he has told you, gentlemen of the jury, that I resemble him that there is a wonderful likeness; but surely, gentlemen, that is not evidence, that ought not to add any weight in the scale of this cause; surely nothing but the most clear and strong evidence should govern the determination of a Jury; nothing of this sort as adduced by this witness, should be suffered to make any impressions; more particularly when the life is at stake.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the jury, there is a circumstance occurs to my mind, which I think very proper for your consideration. Mr. Hunter's name has been mentioned,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150179"></xptr>his name has been used in this cause, his evidence no doubt would be a material weight in this cause, I should be glad to know why he has not been brought forward, a person of his integrity, respectability and veracity, would have had very great weight with the judge, and you, gentlemen of the jury.</p>
               <p>I will beg leave to read to you, gentlemen, two letters, they were received by me yesterday from a man that was my servant, they will prove beyond the possibility of a doubt, the intention of Mr. Green and will manifest he has left no stone unturned to deprive me of my life; I will beg leave to call a witness who will prove having received this letter from

               <p>An abstract of the second letter is as follows:</p>
               <p>Sir, the very moment I sent of your other letter, Mr. Willerton and Mr. Green, have come to me and asked me several questions, the same as before, I have given the same answers, that I would be ready at any time; they asked me at last, Mr. Green asked me if I meant to stay always in livery, I said no; he said if I wanted money or clothes he would lend me some. - The meaning of it, gentlemen, you may see very plain.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, under all these circumstances it would be an insult to your understanding to suppose you capable of giving a verdict contrary to your best wishes, I solemnly declare to his lordship, and you, gentlemen of the jury, that I am not guilty of the charge.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the jury, I have been in custody fourteen months, since which time eight sessions have elapsed; why this charge has not been brought forward before this period; I cannot say. Gentlemen, from the vicisitudes I have undergone, it is impossible for any person possessed of sympathy, not to feel something, and more especially on the present occasion; where the dictates of keen sensibility take place, without the smallest mitigation.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I need not tell you, I have long been the mark of vengeance. I have been reviled to the utmost; but I have the infinite satisfaction in my own breast, that they are ill grounded; for could I be truly charged with any dishonourable, mean, or unmanly undertaking; my feelings would indeed be very different from those I now experience; my mind in that case would sting me, more than the bitterest reproof of the sincerest friends. Thus supported by my conscience, I wait for your verdict without inquietude, as knowing that to men of your liberality of sentiment, I am not the object of those prejudices, which have operated to fatally against many men in my circumstances, and doubt not, but that you will form your result, from a feeling heart, directed by an enlightened understanding.</p>

               <p>I live at Birmingham, I am in the profession of the law.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present at any time, that Mr. Green saw the prisoner at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150180"></xptr>Q. Did you hear him give any account as to the knowledge of his person, and will you be so kind as to tell us the expression he made use of on that occasion? - I was with him when he was before Mr. Careless at Manchester; Mr. Green got up and walked about the room, and he was asked whether he was certain he was the person, he did not take on himself to say. Mr. Careless wished me to be present, as a professional man; in consequence of this, I asked Mr. Green if he was certain, that Mr. Griffin was the person that had committed the robbery, he said he could not speak with certainty to the person, but his young man could; Mr. Griffin after some conversation got up, and walked up to Mr. Green, and beseeched him to take every opportunity of satisfying himself, whether he was the person or not. - I then told Mr. Green, that he ought to be decided in his evidence against him, as the charge was of such a serious nature as to affect his life; he said he believed him to be the person; on which Mr. Careless said it was sufficient to commit the gentleman on that charge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am sorry you have had the trouble to come to day, to take on yourself to prove what Mr. Green has said before. - Perhaps this examination is your hand writing? - It is not, it is Mr. Careless's I believe, this examination was brought ready prepared.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Green sworn to it? - I did; I asked Mr. Green whether he was certain as to the day, Mr. Griffin said it was no consequence, if he said the month of March, for he was all that month on the continent.</p>
               <p>Court. Was your conversation with Mr. Green, before or after, his examination? - Previous or rather during his examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before he signed his examination? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. As you attended to assist Mr. Green, you of course saw that every thing was put down correct? - I did not exactly see, what was exactly put down, I was there in some respect by desire of Mr. Griffin.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did the last witness say of Mr. Green, that he could not swear positively to the woman, but his servant could.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Green. This gentleman has said that you said you had a person who could more recognize the prisoner than yourself. - That is so, that person is in court.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect the prisoner as the person who came to your masters shop? - I cannot swear positively to that person, but I think the prisoner resembles him.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you be so good as to point out any alteration between the person at the bar and the person who assumed the name of Lord Massey? - He appeared I think at that time to be rather fuller in the face.</p>
               <p>Q. On the whole are you able to form a belief that the prisoner is the same person or not? - I cannot take on me to say; I cannot say any thing more than I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe he is or is not? - I rather believe he is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Gentlemen of the Jury, I state to you gentlemen, that this person was not in my brief, or otherwise I would have called him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is rather extraordinary Mr. Garrow you should not have called him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Sir, I have done you the justice and liberality to state that he is not in my brief.</p>
               <p>Court. How long had you an opportunity of seeing the person March 1791? - I only saw him in the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with John Bussell, a cheesemonger, in Salisbury-street, Portland-market. On the Wednesday afternoon, before I went before the Magistrate, between one and two o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Little North-street, which leads into Salisbury-street—I saw him take a pair of steps which were leaning against Mr. Bussell's house, and carry them off—one of his companions called out <hi rend="italic">"Bobby,</hi> the police!"—he then threw them down, and ran away—I saw him running through Paul-street, and pointed him out to the police—I knew him before; I had seen him about the street.</p>

            . On the 27th of March, about half an hour after twelve at noon, I was coming by the Exchange, and the Prisoner came pretty close by my side, and I missed my handkerchief out of my pocket; Mr. Hunt passed the Prisoner just by Finch-Lane, and I saw him take that handkerchief out of Mr. Hunt's pocket; I took him by the collar, and Mr. Hunt came and took the handkerchief out of his hand; said I, you rascal, I believe you have got mine, and I pulled a bundle out of his pocket; there were some firemen came up, and they hurried him into Mr. Butler's, a linendraper, at the Golden Key, and there were five handkerchiefs in the bundle; Mr. Butler asked him how he came by them, he said he bought them in Rag-Fair; Mr. Butler unbuttoned his coat, and out dropped my handkerchief from the breast of his coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where was this done?</p>
               <p>Lawson. Just by Finch-Lane; I was behind you about a yard when you took Mr. Hunt's handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he took your handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Lawson. It was found upon him, and I had it close in my pocket, that I could hardly get it out myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am butler to Mark Milbank, Esq., of Upper Grosvenor-street. On the 28th of May I was in St. James's-street—there was a bustle—I turned, and saw my handkerchief on the ground, this is it—there is no name on it, but I have worn it three or four years—there is a hole in a part of it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable S</hi> 119.) I was on duty in St. James's-street, about four o'clock, and saw the prisoner very busy in the crowd—he came against the prosecutor, and put his hand into his pocket, and drew out his handkerchief—I seized him, and he dropped it—I took it up—the prosecutor turned, and thought I was the thief—I told him I was as officer, and had taken the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>; I was out of employment.

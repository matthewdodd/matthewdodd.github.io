                  </hi>. I live at St. Paul's Road, Islington—a little after midnight, on Monday the 15th August, I was called to attend William Colson, the prosecutor—he was brought to my house—he had lost a great deal of blood, and was then losing blood—he had four incised wounds at the back of his neck—two were bleeding very much—one in par<lb></lb>ticular—I had very great difficulty in stopping the blood—it was dangerous from that cause—it was about an inch in depth—the wounds were such as would be inflicted by such a knife as this—there was a slight graze to the man's side, and the clothes were cut through—I attended him for a fort-night—the wounds are quite well now.</p>

I am a coachman, and live at 1, North Cottages, Canonbury—on Sunday night, 14th August, I was in Upper Street, Islington, going home, about 11.50—my wife, my aunt, and uncle, and cousin, were with me—as we went along we passed the prisoner and another man, named Holliday—the other man said to my uncle "Halloa, you have got it on you; you are walking with a stick"—I turned round and looked At the prisoner, and he said "You can go home and take your b—w—of a wife home with you"—I knew the prisoner before by sight, but I had never spoken to him—I turned round and struck Halliday, the man who was with him and Wood ran away—I tried to catch him, but could not, and we went on towards home—the prisoner came up again before we had gone very far—I ran after him, and caught him by his coat—he threw himself down—I walked away, and left him there—when we got to the comer close to my house, he came up alone—he said "You have grossly insulted me"—before I could turn round he jumped on me, and commenced stabbing me—he put his arm over my left shoulder and stabbed me with his right hand—I felt it was a knife—I felt four blows at the back of the head, and one in the side—I felt the blood flowing—I called out "See what he has got in his hand, "and my cousin and uncle pulled him off me—I was taken to the doctor's—the prisoner was behind me while he was stabbing me—my uncle, in pulling him off, pulled me down, and him on the top of me—my wife tried to get the knife away.</p>

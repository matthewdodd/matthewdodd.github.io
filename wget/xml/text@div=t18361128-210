                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Basing-place, Waterloo-road, in the parish of Lambeth. On Monday night, the 16th of October, I was the last person up—I went to bed at eleven o'clock—I fastened the house up entirely—I was alarmed about half-past six o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing by an opposite neighbour knocking at my street door—I came down stairs, and missed the articles stated, from the parlours—I had seen them all there the evening before—I found the street door wide open, and also the staircase window—the persons must have entered by the staircase win<lb></lb>dow, by getting over the side wall from the street—it is a sash-window—I cannot say whether it was fastened over-night, but it was shut—there was no appearance of violence on it—if it had been left unfastended a person outside could have thrown it up—I have seen all the articles, and have no doubt they are my property.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is an egg-merchant, and lives in Agnes-street, Waterloo-road, On Monday morning, the 17th of October, at a quarter be<lb></lb>fore six o'clock, I hear footsteps under my window—I live opposite Mrs. Luton—the street is about twenty yards wide—I threw my window open, and saw the prisoner Barnes—it was quite daylight—I had never seen him before—he removed from the window to the end of the street looking into Waterloo-road, and a few minutes after I saw Brown open Mrs. Luton's street door, and whistle—Barnes then crossed the road, and Brown came out of the house with two bundles, one was in a red cloth,—they looked up at the window and saw me, and then Barnes ran up the street—Mrs. Luton's staircase window was open, but the blind was down—Brown returned into the house—I went down and awoke Mr. Hancock, My land<lb></lb>lord, suspecting it was a robbery—I then returned to my window again, and staid there till exactly half-past six o'clock, when I saw Brown and Williams come out of the house—I feel certain of Williams as well—Brown had a small bundle, and Williams a hearth-rug and fire-irons—they left the door wide, open, and I asked Mr. Hancock to knock at the door, which he did—Mrs. Luton came down, and in half an hour she fetched me over to her house, and complained of missing several things—I did not know her before—I said before the Magistrate I felt certain that these two were the prisoners, but could not swear to them—I think Williams to be the man I saw with the fire-irons.</p>

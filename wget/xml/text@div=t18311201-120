On the morning of the 9th of November she came with her work as usual to my front warehouse, where I keep my manufactured stock, and weigh the work given to my work-people - she brought her work, and had it weighed; I saw her basket emptied - she was then directed to go into the back warehouse, where I keep my unmanufactured stock, and there to wait: my young man had occasion to go into that warehouse, and from what he said to me, I went and looked into the prisoner's basket - I saw some worsted, and asked what she was going to do with it; she said to take it to Helmet-row, St. Luke's, where I have another manufactory.</p>

            . I am foreman to the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner on the 9th of November; I went into the back warehouse to get some cotton, while she was waiting there; I saw her sitting against a basket, in which I had placed some worsted the night before - I heard the lid of the prisoner's basket move, and heard the rustling of some paper, I saw her manner was very flurried; there were other work-people sitting there, but not near the basket - I went into the front warehouse, and when the prisoner came in to have her turn, I said, "I shall want to speak to you, before you go" - I then went into the back warehouse, and found this green worsted in her basket, which is my master's.</p>

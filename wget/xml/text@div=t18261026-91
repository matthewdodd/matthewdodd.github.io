On the 16th of October, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my house - he asked for some wedding-rings; as I had been robbed several times, I took them out one at a time; I took out nine separately, and laid them on the counter; he made several excuses - one was too large, and another too small - he then desired me to weigh one, and while I was doing it I thought I saw him take one; I counted them, and found there were but seven on the counter, instead of eight; I said the one I had weighed came to 9s., and he said he would give me 7s. for it; he was then going away, but my sister shut the door, and I sent for an officer, who searched him in the parlour; his coat and waistcoat were taken off, and nothing found; I heard the ring drop, and it was found on the floor.</p>

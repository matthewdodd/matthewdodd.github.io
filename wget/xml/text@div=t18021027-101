               <p>Q. On what day were you robbed? - A. On Monday the 4th of October, I set out from Cheshunt.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you going? - A. To Tooting, in Surrey, on business; I came from Cheshunt about half past three in the afternoon, to Waltham-Cross.</p>
               <p>Q. That is in the road is it? - A. Yes; I applied to the Peterborough stage-coachman for a place, but he said he was loaded.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go by it or not? - A. No; I walked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270065"></xptr>on, and overtook another person, and he and I walked on together; I meant to go to London by the Tottenham coach, but it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that other person? - A. No, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you walk together? - A. We walked together till we came to Tottenham, and when we came to Tottenham, we overtook the prisoners at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. On the road? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all three in company together? - A. They were; the young man who was with me spoke to them at a little distance from the White Hart public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he seem to be acquainted with them? - A. I cannot say; he seemed to hold some conversation with them; I said I wanted to make haste to town; he directly said, we will go into this public house; I said I was dry, and the young man and I went in together.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoners? - A. They came in afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come in together? - A. They did; they were all in the place together.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed when you were at the public house? - A. I called for a pint of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of day was it when you got into the White Hart? - A. I should suppose it might be about half past six in the evening: I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did the prisoners come in? - A. They were in as soon almost as the beer was drawn; I think they were in before; they were at the heels of us as it were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they join company with you? - A. The young man and I drank our beer; I said I had got a bit of cold leg of pork, and asked the landlord for a bid of bread, but he did not sell it, and I went out and purchased a two-penny loaf; when I came back the young man was in company with the prisoners at the bar; they were in conversation together, and had a pot of beer; they asked me to drink; I said, no, I would keep my own company.</p>
               <p>Q. Who asked you? - A.

               <p>Q. What did you mean by keeping your own company? Did you mean the young man that accompanied you? - A. Yes; the young man handed round part of the meat and bread to the prisoners at the bar, in the room; I got up and said, I must go.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you sat there? - A. Very likely it might be three quarters of an hour, or less.</p>
               <p>Q. On your saying you would go, what then? - A. I paid a pint of porter towards the reckoning; the young man and I had two pants.</p>
               <p>Q. That was all the liquor you had some? - A. No; the prisoners called for some go, I believe, I cannot exactly say; they handed it round among themselves, the young man, and me; they drank, and paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much spirits were there? - A. I think there was half a pint.</p>
               <p>Q. How many glasses did you drink of it? - A. About half a glass.</p>
               <p>Q. You had nothing sufficient to intoxicate you? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You had not drank before you went in? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you, during the time you were there, sufficient opportunities of noticing the prisoners? A. I had remarkably so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the young man go along with you, or did you go alone? - A. The prisoners wanted more liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were to have had more, I suppose? - A. I suppose so; the landlord would not let them have any more; here is a person who was in the house at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go away alone, or in company? - A. I walked out first, the young man, I believe, was the next that came out, and then the prisoners; which came first I cannot ascertain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you part with the young man any where? - A. No, not then; we walked on together as it were.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the young man, the prisoners, and you? - A. No, the prisoners were all rather before me.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you came out first? - A. Yes, but they passed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you and the young man walking together when the prisoners passed you? - A. I was outside, first.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the young man came out next? - A. Yes; he asked the prisoners how far they were going; they said they were going to London.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose some one said so? - A. One and all together; when we had walked on the road about twenty yards from the Bull inn, at <placeName id="t18021027-101-crimeloc559">Tottenham</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was that in the presence of the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put it into your pocket-book again? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the woman say? - A. She said she would take care of it for me; I told her I could take care of it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not pulled it out before? - A. Not that I recollect; I wanted to get change, thinking if I got a stage, I had not money enough to pay it, only having a shilling and four pennyworth of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us the contents of your pocket-book? - A. There were three 5l. notes, some letters, and bills of parcels.</p>

               <p>Q. Then they all run away together at the same time? - A. I did not see Brown there at the moment when I got up, but I saw him going away when I recovered myself; I saw him some little distance further than where the other prisoners were.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you guess how many yards he might be from them when Haley knocked you down? - A. I don't think he was two yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Further before them? - A. I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see any thing of Brown again; just at the time you were knocked down, you say you saw him; did he then go from you, or did you see him afterwards? - A. I saw him when I got up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after they took the pocket-book? - A. It was after.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was he then? - A. I think within about two yards, or more, I cannot exactly say.</p>

               <p>Q. How long? - A. He was away from me first; the other two were behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go till after you were robbed? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it a clear night? - A. Yes, it was light, so that I could see, and could distinguish the prisoners perfectly well; I never lost fight of them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the watch join you? - A. No, not at that moment.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost sight of Brown, but not of the other prisoners? - A. No, I did not; a young man hearing the cry of, stop thief, run out.</p>

               <p>Q. You will not say you were as sober as you are now? - A. No, because I have not drank any thing but tea this morning.</p>

            , Esq. at the Seven Sisters, Tottenham High Cross.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say? - A. I did not see the robbery done, but I heard an outcry or stop thief, about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do? - A. I run out of the gates, and saw a gentleman on horseback first.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that? - A. Mr. Biggs; upon that I stopped his horse, and having so done, I begged his pardon for it, as I knew him; he said it was not a horseman, but footpads who had committed the robbery, and he believed he had over-rode them, or rode by them; I then went in pursuit of them, and run up the side of the turnpike-road a good distance, but never saw any thing of them; as I was standing still, I heard a person come running very hard towards me; when I first saw the man, he crossed over to the other side of the road when he saw me; I crossed over to him, caught hold of him, and asked him where he was going to; he said he was going after his partner; I told him to stop, and asked him what made him in such a hurry; in the mean time Mr. Biggs came up, and said, that is one of the men I saw in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270070"></xptr>scrummage, don't let him go, young man, and we detained him.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is that man? - A. Morris Haley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of any other man? - A. When Mr. Biggs came up on horseback, the man that was knocked down came up.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the prosecutor; you did not see it done? - A. No, but I saw his head all over dirt; when he came up, he said, that man knocked me down three times; after that, I said, take care of him, and I will go and see after the others.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know there were others? - A. The gentleman told me to take care of myself, for there were three or four others, and they were Irishmen, and a woman among them; I went into the grove, where there is a cluster of trees, a ditch parts it from the road, and there I saw that woman and Brown running down the grove together; I caught hold of the woman's shoulders, and made a catch at the man, but he sprang away from me, the woman stopped directly, and I saw no more of the man then, but I took him again the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he run that night? - A. He ran towards town then.</p>
               <p>Q. What time next morning did you see him? - A. About seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you then? - A. At my master's gate, and from thence I walked towards him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he then? - A. About one hundred yards from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him to be the person? - A. Yes, I had seen him by the lamps, and the lamp-lighter's torch.</p>
               <p>Q. The lamps did not light much into the grove? - A. It was rather moonlight.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon seeing him? - A. When I saw him in the morning, he was going towards Essex.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you made no attempt to stop him? - A. No, because he was so far off.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know him; will you undertake to say it was the same man you saw at night? - A. Yes, I was close to him at night, I saw his face, for he turned round and looked at me, and according to the dress he had on the over night, and by the description I had of him, and what I saw of him the night before, I am sure it is the same, I will swear to his face.</p>
               <p>Q. What, at the distance of one hundred yards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He passed by you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you pursue him then? - A. Because I wanted to go down to the Justice, and as he did not seem to wish to leave the place; as I was going to the Justice afterwards, a woman called to me, and asked me if I should know the man again, if I saw him, that got away the over-night; I said I should, and she gave me some information: I then went on to the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go after him? - A. Not then; when we came back from the Justice we agreed to go into the Ship to have some refreshment; Bangs went in before me, and Brown was in there along with another Irishman; he ran out as soon as Bangs went in, and Bangs said there he goes; I ran after him over the brick-fields, and he had just got to the stile as I got up to him; I detained him and asked him where he was going to.</p>
               <p>Q. You had an opportunity of having a close view of him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be positive he was the person you saw with the woman in the Grove? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing was said to him, but he ran out directly? - A. Not that I heard; I was going towards the house, and was within about twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw Bangs go in? - A. Yes, and immediately the prisoner Brown ran out.</p>

             sworn. - Q. What are you? - A. A constable.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you applied to on this business? - A. On the 4th of October; I saw the three prisoners, another man, and the prosecutor together, at the White Hart, at Tottenham; I asked Mr. Cantrill if he knew what company he had in the taproom, he said, no; I told him, I thought they were smashers, and to be careful what money he took.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them go out? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the same room with them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you see them? - A. I had been at dinner there, and came into the tap-room up to the bar, I saw them as I crossed the tap-room up to the bar, and went back again into the room where I left my company; I saw no more of them till I was sent for to take them into custody and to take them before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the three prisoners are the persons who were in company with the prosecutor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any one of them before? - A. Yes, Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sent for at night or in the morning? - A. At night, when there were only two taken, Haley and the woman, and in the morning I was sent for to take Brown.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Brown. Q. Where did you see me before? - A. At Mr. Nixon's, the Roebuck.</p>
               <p>Q. What was I doing, or what day was it? - A. I cannot say the particular day, I have seen him drinking there along with the rest of the Irishmen.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you sure you have seen him? - A. I am very sure of it; I produce the pocket-book and bills which I received from the Magistrate. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Q. (To Bangs.) Look at the pocket-book? - A. My brother's name is in it, Joshua Bangs.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180210270071"></xptr>Q. Is that your pocket-book? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the book that was taken from you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where are the bills that were taken from you? - A. These are the bills.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they? - A. One is a bill of parcels of goods I bought, the other is a smith's bill that I settled with a person in Brook's-market, in town.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Saunders). You said you put your initials upon the bills you picked up? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Are those the bills you picked up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Bangs). Those bills were in your pocketbook at the time? - A. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Holmes. Here is a stick which the Magistrate delivered to me; (produces a stout crab stick).</p>
               <p>Mews. I picked that stick up just by where I took Haley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you produce that stick before the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was it picked up to where you stopped Haley? - A. Two or three yards.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him throw it down? - A. No, I did not.</p>

             sworn. Q. What do you know of this? - A. I was exactly upon the spot, I came up just at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the transaction yourself? - A. I saw three or four persons running away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prosecutor before? - A. No,</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard any outcry? - A. I heard the cry of watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons did you see running away? - A. I saw three or four, I think there must be four.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any woman among them? - A. I cannot say, there was not light enough to distinguish.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did they run? - A. They ran different ways; the prosecutor cried out, watch; at first I thought it was a squabble, and could hardly think it was a robbery; when it was cried out a second time I went up to him, he was on the footpath, and he told me he had been knocked down and robbed by two men and a woman, who had ran away; I desired him to see where the watchmen were, upon which he called as hard as he could; I said I would go forward and take care they should not get towards London; being on horseback I got on rather fast; I met Mews, the coachman, and told him the circumstances; as I returned back towards the spot where the robbery was committed, on the dark side of the road, there was Haley under the trees, and he crossed over towards the side on which the coachman was; I asked him where his companions were; he said he did not know; his giving me that answer, gave me suspicion he had been in company before with them; the coachman took hold of him, and said, he must be one; we were going to take him to the prosecutor, who, at that instant, came up, and said, that was the man who had knocked him down, and that he would swear to him: I think the prisoner said, he had never seen him before; I desired them to see where the others were, and I would go on; I went on, and overtook another man, whom I supposed was the other; he was very near a watch-box, and I said, do you know any thing of the robbery at Tottenham?</p>
               <p>Q. Was that Brown? - A. It was not Brown, but another man; I desired him to come back, he said he had been knocked down himself; I then took him and gave him in charge to the watchman, who let him go as soon as I left him, which I think it is very fit the trustees should know of; I then went back, and found they had got the woman; the prosecutor certainly was in liquor, and must have lost fight of them before they were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you think so? - A. Because, between the time he was robbed, and when they were taken, must take two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not yourself see the robbery? - A. There was a general run when I came up; my coming up, I suppose, was the cause of their running; I lost sight of them, and so must he; though it was moon light, it was a very dark moon-light.</p>
               <p>Court. I did not understand him to have said they were not out of his fight till they were taken, but from the time they left the public-house, till the robbery was committed.</p>

               <p>Quinland's defence. All I have to say is, that I am a poor lone girl, and have no one to take my part; being quite a stranger in London, as I have worked chiefly in Essex, I was told to go to Fdmonton, where I should find some work; I went, and met with these two men, standing at a publichouse door, and the prosecutor and his partner; the prosecutor was the first who asked me where I was going, I said, I should go no farther, if I could get lodgings there; he said, he would stop with me; I told him, I would not wish to trust myself with strange people I did not know; we went into a public-house to refresh ourselves, and the prosecutor went in with us, and told us, if we were bound for London, he would go along with us; he called for a pint of beer, and went out for some victuals, we called for a pot, and said, we would not be under a compliment to him while we could pay for a pint; we came out of that house and went into another, but I don't know which it is; we had some beer there, and four half pints of peppermint; the prosecutor began to offer me every thing he had got, his pocket-book, notes and all, if I would go with him; he told me he was a single man, and if I would go home with him, he would settle so much a year on me; I said, I did not want any such thing, that I was not of that cast, for that I always worked hard for my bread; he came out into the road, and laid hold of my hand, I pulled it away, and he said I would rather go with some other fellow than himself; then he stripped off his coat and hat, and said, he would fight the best man in the street; one of the men took him up, and struck him three times with a stick; we got him away from them, and got him to go along with us; we had walked but a few yards, when he got hold of me, and said, I should not go any farther; my fellow prisoners said, they might get into a bobble if they stopped any longer with us, for we were all drunk; I began to scream, and he let me loose, when he found that people came up; I was making towards this man to save me, and to take me to London, upon which he called out watch, and took up this man directly; I staid where I was, being so much amazed, that I did not know which way to go, and I stopped behind; I was then going to look for

               <p>Prisoner Brown's defence. (Read.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I humbly crave the indulgence of this Honourable Court to hear this paper read; for being unused to appear in this situation, I am not able to speak with that accuracy necessary to make my innocence appear, which I trust it will. I am a labourer, and went to get a job at Edmonton, and had engaged to work there the next day; going back to London, I met my fellow prisoners refreshing themselves; on their saying they were going to London, we agreed to walk together. Soon after we were overtaken by the prosecutor and another man; they asked us to to drink; we consented, and went into the Red Lion; the prosecutor called for liquor, and insisted on treating us; we would not consent to it, but would each pay a share of the reckoning. After this we went to another house, where we had more liquor, and the prosecutor pressed very much to pay; he seemed to be intoxicated, and to make very free with Quinland, which she refused to let him do, and seemed much terrified. We then went out of the house, and a scuffle ensued between Haley and the prosecutor; a number of people collected round, and the prosecutor began to strip. Being alarmed at my situation, and the company I was in, I thought it best to leave them, for I had no knowledge of my fellow-prisoners. I heard the screams of a woman, and somebody running towards me, which was Quinland; she appeared to be frightened, and crying; she said the prosecutor had used her ill, and wanted to force her against her will; I saw the others coming up, and not liking their company, I went way; next day I was going to my work, and went into the house to have a pint of beer with the prosecutor, who asked me if I was in his company last night, and I said, yes, and he had me taken into custody. My Lord, I have here related a plain and simple tale of facts, and humbly trust my case to your decision, fully confident a poor and friendless man will find that commiseration his innocence and unhappy condition requires.</p>

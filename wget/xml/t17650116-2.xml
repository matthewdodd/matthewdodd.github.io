She being used to the horse, I doubt not but she would have followed him, had she not been incumbered: we could track the horse down a lane: I took my horse, and, with Mr. Austin, came to London; I enquired at New-Cross turnpike; we found the horse had been brought through there: I came to Smithfield about twelve o'clock, and about three I saw the prisoner upon my horse. I went to him, and asked him if that horse was to be sold? he said, yes. I took hold of the bridle, and led him into the George-yard; I asked the price; he told me eight guineas, or eight pounds; Mr. Austin said to him, Get down, friend: I took him by the sleeve, brought him into the inn, and sent for a constable: I said it was my horse, and asked him, how he could do so? he said he had not stole him, but bought him in the Borough, that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Allwin I do not know that he is known in my country: I think he came to my house, and asked for thrashing, about two months ago, but I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the horse last?</p>
               <p>Allwin. I saw him on the Thursday afternoon, about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe him.</p>
               <p>Allwin. A black gelding, with a bald face, three white feet, a swelling on the withers, and a little saddle-spot on the off-side: I bred him from a foal.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Bexley-Common from London?</p>
               <p>Allwin. It is eleven miles from London.</p>

            . Mr. Allwin came to me the morning the gelding was missing, and desired I would go with him to London: we came to Smithfield together; we saw the prisoner on his gelding; he asked the price of him; the prisoner said eight guineas. When we asked him how he came by the gelding, he said he had swapped a little poney for him, in the Borough, that morning: we asked him at what house; he said it was in the street: we asked him where he lived; he said somewhere in Essex, and that he had lived at Queenhithe; and at this time, he said, he lived in London, sometimes in one place and sometimes in another: I knew the horse, from the foal.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I came out of the country a little time before, and put my horse up in the Borough: I seeing a man with this horse, and another man talking to him about the horse, I said I would swap with him; his horse and mine were both put up at the George there, near St. Margaret's-hill; I observed, by his tail being tied up, that he was to be sold; I changed mine for the gelding: I had lain at the Saracen's-head, on Snow-hill, the night before, and my horse was there also. The man that I changed with told me he lived at Epsom: I brought him to Smithfield, intending to sell him in the afternoon, and this gentleman told me it was his horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any witnesses to this?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have the ostler at the Saracen's-head sent for?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If the Court pleases; his name is John: I do not know his other name. (He is sent for.)</p>

               <p>Tison. I know him by sight; he had a horse three or four nights at our house.</p>
               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>Tison. About ten days ago: I cannot say justly the day.</p>

               <p>Tison. No; that is above the size of a poney.</p>

               <p>Tison. I cannot rightly recollect the day; but I am sure it was above a week ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think of last Thursday?</p>
               <p>Tison. I am sure it was before last Thursday: I did not know he was taken up, 'till this moment I was sent for.</p>

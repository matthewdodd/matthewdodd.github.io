               <p>You are a stranger in town? - I came from Spain but I have been in England going on these two years, I was born in Spain<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190094"></xptr> my father is English, my mother is Spanish, I was brought up among English people, I live at present in Great Saint Andrew's-street.</p>
               <p>Where had you been? - I went to see an acquaintance of mine that lived in Bird-street, I went home with the prisoner and I could not sleep all night, the prisoner spoke to me by my name, I saw her once before, she asked me to go home with her and lodge with her till morning, I was glad of it to go out of the rain, for I was all wet, and I went home with her and staid all night, in the morning I got up and I was not very well, and she said strip off all your clothes and lay down and get a sleep, you are in an honest house, I stripped some of my clothes off and kept some on, I was afraid to strip them all off, though I was not afraid of robbing me, but I thought it was not proper that I should strip.</p>
               <p>Was any body there but her and her child? - No, but I do not like a woman to strip; in the morning I did strip off my clothes, and when I fell in sleep, she left me naked all but my shift, I waked, I looked all about, I was locked in, I made myself easy, I could not keep my eyes open, I was quite heavy, and somehow I was not very well, and so at night she came home and she told me to go about my business, and turned me out in my shift, and I cried out murder, and they got blankets to cover me.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you was sober that night when you went to sleep? - I was sober enough; the constable found the clothes where they were pawned, they were found on the Tuesday, the prisoner was taken up the same night.</p>
               <p>- FREEMAN sworn.</p>
               <p>I took the prisoner to the watch-house, and found the things at different pawnbrokers; the prisoner said she pawned them to get a breakfast; no promise was made her.</p>
               <p>The different pawnbrokers produced the things which they took in, some of the prisoner, and some of her daughter.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On Sunday night, at one o'clock, I met the prosecutrix, and a man with her, they asked me to recommend them a lodging, I said I did not know I could; they asked me where I lived, and went home with me, and the man that was with her sent for two pots of beer and a quartern of gin, they desired to have my bed, and the man staid till about six, then he went away, and she sent me for a pot of hot, which cost eight-pence, and half a pint of gin, which cost four-pence; after that she sent her cap and her stays by my child; I did not know she sent them.</p>

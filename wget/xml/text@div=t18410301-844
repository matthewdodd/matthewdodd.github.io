                  </hi>. I conduct the business of my brother, Elias Chartier, in High-street, Islington—it is carried on in the house of Philip William Hingston, who lives there with his family, and the shop is part of his dwelling-house. On the 9th of February, between one and two o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked for some thread lace—I got down a box containing a quantity of thread lace—she looked at various articles, and she kept putting the cards of lace up and down—she fixed on a remnant, and asked me to measure it—while I was doing that a wo-man came in, and asked the price of a bonnet in the window—that drew my attention from the lace a moment or two, while I answered the woman the price of the bonnet—I was waiting on Mrs. Whittingbam before the prisoner came in—I left off serving her to attend to the prisoner—Mrs. Whittingham gave me a particular look which I did not understand at first—about that time I turned round, as I thought there must be something wrong—I asked the person, did she wish to see the bonnet—before I could get an answer she was gone—I then looked at the box of lace, and in<lb></lb>stantly</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Paradise-terrace, Islington. About two o'clock on Tuesday, the 9th of February, I went to Mr. Char<lb></lb>tier's shop in Islington—soon after, the prisoner came in—I had seen her before that day—I observed her when she came in—she asked for some lace, and Miss Chartier put it down before her—she seemed to pull it about a good deal—after this another woman came in, and asked the price of a bonnet—she stood behind me at first, and then she stood near the pri<lb></lb>soner—I saw the prisoner give her the lace, and then she put it under her cloak—I intimated it to Miss Chartier as well as I could by a nod and a look—I turned to look for the woman, and she was gone—I immediately went to the door, and could not see any thing of her—I went both ways, and could not see any thing of her—I then returned to the shop, and Miss Chartier told me she had missed some lace—I said, "So I should think—I saw the prisoner give it to the other young woman"—I said to the pri<lb></lb>soner, "You know the young woman"—she said she did not, she never saw her before—the reason I said so was, because I had seen her with her before they went into the shop, and the other appeared then to be in<lb></lb>toxicated—I am quite sure the woman I saw then with the prisoner was the same person I saw in the shop—after this the prisoner said she had lost her purse, and she would have the house searched from top to bottom before she left.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What is your husband? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He is not any thing at present—he has been a tailor—I never dealt at the prosecutors shop before—I had never seen the prisoner or the other woman before—the pro<lb></lb>secutor's shop is on the pavement by Islington-green—there is a large</p>

               <p>space on the pavement both ways when you come out of the shop—I went to the shop door, and went a little way in both directions, but I could not see the woman who went out—I was close to the prisoner when she handed the lace to the woman—she was standing next to me at the coun<lb></lb>ter—the other woman came close to her—I could not tell Miss Chartier at once what I saw, because I felt so flurried—I was always as sure as I am now that I saw the lace handed by the prisoner to the other woman—I was too much flurried to slop her—she had a straw bonnet on and a cloak—I cannot say what sort of complexion she had—there was consider<lb></lb>able difficulty in persuading the prisoner to leave the shop—I went home—I could not go to the station though the officer asked me to go, because my friends would have wondered where I was—I went before the Magis<lb></lb>trate the next day.</p>

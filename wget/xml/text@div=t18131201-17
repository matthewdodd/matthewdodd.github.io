               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes, he was under my custody in Newgate, in January, 1812.</p>
               <p>Q. After then do you know what became of him - A. He was transported beyond the seas, for the term of seven years; on the 14th of February following he was delivered on board the Restitution Hulk at Woolwich; I delivered him in pursuance of his sentence when he was convicted, that was in February, 1812. I delivered him there myself.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>M. Arthur. I know it from her own confession and the pawnbroker's account. On the eighth of May I missed three shirts, two shifts, a pair of shift-sleeves, two handkerchiefs, a pair of pattens, a pewter plate, a smoothing iron, and a napkin. I told her that morning if she had taken any thing out of my house, I would forgive her if she would confess where they were; she said, if she owned to one, I would alledge all these things against her: then, in about half an hour after, she eloped; I advertised her, and she was taken; then she owned to the taking every thing in the indictment: here is a paper of her own writing, wherein she mentions them.

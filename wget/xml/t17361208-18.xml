               <p>Mr. Phillipson. On the 8th or 9th of November, Mr. Emmerson shew'd me the two Sugar Loaves in our Compting House, which he said were sold for 6 d. per lb. They were brought by Mr. Smith of St. Paul's Church yard, and being apprehensive that they were ours, and that they had been stolen, he brought them down to us. We enquired the next Day after one Mrs. Fowles, who had sold these two Sugar-Loaves; I went with a Constable to her House in Carter-Lane. I searched, and found nothing; then I asked her about these Sugar-Loaves, which (I was informed ) she had sold to one Middleton, and by Middleton to Mr. Smith; and I asked her likewise, whether she had not sold Sugar-Loaves to one Humphries, at the Sugar Loaf in Fleet-Street, a Publick House; she said she had seen Sugar-Loaves come into Humphries's House. Upon this I got a Search-Warrant, and went there; I asked him if he would let me search his House; he said, with all his Heart. We went up and search'd and I found 59 Loaves, which I can say are the Property of Sir

I said, I would attend his coming: But as I was going home, I remembered I had left my Handkerchief behind me, and returning to enquire for it, while I was there Powel came into the Yard; I asked him how he came by the Loaves he had sold Humphries; he said, very honestly. Says Humphries, you told me they were the Perquisites of several Boilers. After many Words, he confess'd he had them of the Prisoner Windsor, our Boiler, but he said he bought them of him, and paid him for them. I ordered the Constable to carry him to the Baptist's-Head Tavern, and I sent for Mr. Emmerson; I cannot say what pass'd between Mr. Emmerson and him, but by what pass'd I saw that Windsor was concerned, and had confess'd it.

            . The Prisoner Powel has us'd my House every Day these two Years. About six Months ago he brought some Sugar-Loaves to my House (I keep the Sugar Loaf Alehouse in Fleet street) and he asked me to buy them. He told me they were the Perquisities of Boilers, that he sold them for them, and got some little Matter by them himself. I took him for an honest Man, and bought several of him, and gave him 6 d. a lb. We always weigh'd them at a Chandler's Shop in Bride-Lane. After this I got them for a Guinea every seven Loaves, and seven Loaves generally weigh'd 46 or 47 lb. sometimes 48 or 49 lb. sometimes he told me he brought them from Whitechapel, and (says he) 'tis a very great Way. He told me I might have a Quantity of them for ready Money, as many of them as I would, and I did intend to go about them as they came so cheap, but Business prevented we.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you where you was to have them?</p>
               <p>Humphries. I did intend to ask him, and did resolve to go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he name any Person he had them from?</p>
               <p>Humphries. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he never name Windsor?</p>
               <p>Humphries. No, he only said he had them from Boilers as their Perquisites. After he was apprehended, I said to him, You Villain, you have deceiv'd me, you have done a pretty Piece of Work; at last he confess'd he had them from Windsor. We all went to the Baptist's-Head about three or four o'Clock, and Windsor was brought thither too. Windsor cry'd out, Oh! that I should be so bewitch'd! surely the Devil and old Powel bewitch'd me, that I should wrong the best of Masters! I! that have had a Sufficiency to live upon with them - ! Powel heard this, and I call'd him old Villain! and old Rogue!, but he simper'd and smil'd. - Why says he, do you take me to be a Rogue! why did not you tell me a Lye, when you told me they were brought from White-chapel, says I. Yes, says he, I did. For what End, says I. For a Colour, says he. Oh! says I, 'tis a very fine Colour indeed. I ask'd him afterwards the same Question, and he made the same Answer.</p>
               <p>Q. What would have been the Price of Sugar, if you had bought it out of the Shops?</p>
               <p>Humphries. As I am on my Oath, I did not know, till the Day the Warrant came out against Fowkes and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How many Loaves had you of Powel?</p>
               <p>Humphries. I had at several Times fifty-nine and sixty-three, and I sold them again for 6 d. per Pound.</p>
               <p>Q. When you bought them for a Guinea every seven Loaves, and those Loaves weigh'd but 48 lb. that was not above 3 s. Profit; had you no more Gain upon them?</p>
               <p>Humphries. I never made any Thing private; I sold them in Publick, and Powel brought them in through the Tap-House, he would not come through the House, because he would not look like a Porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell People how you came by them?</p>
               <p>Humphries. Yes, every Body; I told them I had them of Powel, and that he had something for selling them for the Sugar-Boilers.</p>
               <p>Q. How many had you from Powel in all?</p>
               <p>Humphries. In six Months I believe I have had 471; I believe it is six Months since I began to buy of him. Some I bought at 6 d. per lb.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173612080017"></xptr> and some I gave 21 s. the seven Loaves. I sold sixty-three to Mr. Watson; I had told him what I gave for them, and he bidding me 6 d. per lb. I said he should have them</p>

            . When the Prisoners were taken up, Windsor begg'd for Mercy, and confessed he had sold our Loaves to Powel. I asked Powel what he gave for them, and he told me 2 s. 6 d. or 3 s. a-piece: I said, surely you may remember the Price, and at last he said it was but 2 s. 6 d. and that he had 2 d a-piece for carrying them In the Compter. Windsor said, he he had never sold Powel above fifty Loaves: says I, Powel charges you with a greater Number. He said if he did, it was not Fact. Then I went to the other Compter to examine Powel. Justice Harwood was with me, and examining him closely, he said, he had given Windsor 18 d. a Loaf, and had sold them for 3 s.</p>
               <p>Q. When he said he had bought them for Half a Crown a Loaf, did he speak to any particular Number?</p>
               <p>Sir William Chapman. No, he only spoke in general; and the second Time, when he said he had given 18 d. and sold them for 3 s. the Words were general. He said he gave Half a Guinea for seven Loaves, and 9 s. for six.</p>
               <p>Mr. Emmerson. I desired to know the Truth of the Matter; and when Powel begg'd for Mercy, I said, if he would be ingenuous and tell the Truth, Mr. Chapman would indulge him, and he might have Mercy. Upon that he confessed he had sold above an Hundred to Humphries, and that he had them all from Windsor, and gave him 18 d. a-piece for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Chapman present, when you made these Promises of Mercy to him?</p>
               <p>Mr. Emmerson. Yes, and he did not contradict them.</p>

               <p>Sir. William Chapman. When this Thing was discovered, we were all amaz'd, for we thought Windsor a very honest Fellow; nay, we had such an Opinion for him, that when we left working at some of our Sugar-Houses, and consequently reduc'd the Number of Hands which we employ'd, we turn'd away an old Servant, and put him into his Place at this Bake-House at Paul's-Wharf.</p>

            . I am Lord Palmeston's Steward, my Lord is at Bath,  he would have appear'd in Mr. Powel's Behalf himself, but he ordered me to appear for him He liv'd many Years in my Lord's Service as his Butler, and had the Custody of all the Plate, and we never had any the least Reason to mistrust him. He has left our Service between nine or ten Years; he is still made very welcome whenever he comes to our House, and needed not to have left my Lord's Service had it not been his own Fault. He is about 75 or 76 Years old, and imagin'd himself uncapable of doing Business as he formerly had done.</p>

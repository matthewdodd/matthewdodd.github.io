                  </hi>I am the wife of Robert Lloyd, and live in Rose-street, Long-acre. On the 1st of January I met the prisoner in Seven-dials, and we had two quarterns of rum together—I thought my husband would be angry with me for staying out, and find out that I had been drinking, and I took the prisoner home to pacify him—when we got there my hus<lb></lb>band was not at home—I said I would go to bed, and told the prisoner to make my boy's bed, which she did, and went away, bidding me good night—I had two shirts in my room, one was ironed, and hanging on my line—when my boy came in I missed that shirt and another—I got up, and went, in the middle of the night, to the prisoner's lodging, in Little Short's<lb></lb>gardens—I found her there, and she gave the shirts to the policeman—they are the property of my nephew, Edward Webb—I had not given her permission to make use of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. She has known me some years—she borrowed 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of me, and said, "Come home, and I will pay you"—when we got home she could not find a shilling, which she said she had, but she said, "Go, get 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on these shirts, and bring in a quartern of rum; and by that time <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>" (meaning her husband) "will be come"—I said to her, "If I don't come back, I will take them home with me till to-morrow morning, and you can then do as you think proper"—I went to the pawnbrokers, and it was shut up—at one o'clock she came and said, was I at borne—I said, "Yes"—she said, "Have you got the shirts safe? "—I said, "Yes, " and I opened the door and gave them to her—we had had four quarterns of rum. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I was not the worse for liquor, but I took her home to pacify my husband, as I knew he could tell, if I drank the least—we had two quarterns of rum, but there were three persons to drink it—I did not suggest that the prisoner might take the shirts to pawn—it is not likely I would give my nephew's shirts to pawn, when I had other things—I had not borrowed any thing of her—I had 4 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. when I met her—she put 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. one time, and I 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the next time we paid 2 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—my husband did not come home till after I had been to the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>(<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi>27.) On the 1st of January, about one o'clock in the morning, I went with the prosecutrix to the pri<lb></lb>soner's lodging—the prosecutrix rapped at her door, and called her by her name, and asked for those shirts which she had taken from her room—the prisoner said, "I have got them safe in the cupboard, on the top of the stairs"—she then came out of her room-door, and asked whether she would have them then—she said, "You shall have them"—I then came on the top of the stairs and said, "Where are the shirts? "—she went into the room, unlocked the cupboard, and gave me them—she said the prosecutrix gave her them to pawn, but as the shop was shut up she could not do so—Mrs. Lloyd denied that, and she said she had taken them off the line without her consent—Mrs. Lloyd seemed excited—I think she had been drinking, and the prisoner was the worse for liquor.</p>

On the 17th of March, I let a friend out of our house, and soon afterwards I heard the rustling of some brown paper on the shop floor - I went into the shop, and saw the door a little way open - I went out, and saw a man standing on the step of the door - he saw me, and began to run - I followed, and cried, "Stop thief" - I lost sight of him as he turned the corner - I got sight of him again, and followed him up East-street, into Paddington-street - he crossed, and went down Baker street, and the officer took him - it was the prisoner - he was brought back - as we came back, we met a boy with these trowsers and waistcoat, which are my husband's, and had been in the shop a quarter of an hour before - I had seen the prisoner before, he had called for work as a tailor.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the deceased, John Brown - A. Yes; he was a <rs id="t18090412-34-viclabel201" type="occupation">gardener's labourer</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18090412-34-victim356 t18090412-34-viclabel201"></join>.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the beginning of this month were you disturbed while you were in bed by any noise - A. Yes; on Sunday the 2nd of April, between ten and eleven o'clock; I was in bed, but not laying down; upon hearing the noise I got out of bed and looked out of my window, I saw as many as six men; my window is as near as possible to the road; two of the men seemed to be in the act of stripping to fight; one, I believe, was stripped. It was a very moon light night<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120027"></xptr>indeed.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there light enough to distinguish who the persons were - A. I did not know who they were. When I looked through the window the prisoner seemed to be in the act of taking part of one of the men who were going to fight; I knew the prisoner before, I have seen him about the town; when they were about to fight the prisoner made an observation that the man of the name of Baldwyn had got the upper part of the hill; in consequence of which Baldwyn came down the hill, opposite of his antagonist, a man of the name of Eversly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Eversly a man known to you by his person - A. Not till after they had been fighting. When Baldwyn came down they set to fight, Baldwyn knocked Eversly down, Brown, the deceased, was very near to Baldwyn at the time; the prisoner assisted Eversly to get up and set him to with Baldwyn; I will not be certain whether it was the second or third time they set them to; Scales made some observations, but what I could not hear. Eversley was down I believe every time he set to, he was very much in liquor; they were both down at times; Scales made some observation to Brown, in consequence of which Brown said I am no second, I wish to see fair play; Scales stood in the attitude of defending himself against Brown; the two men that were fighting set to again; while these men were fighting Scales struck Brown and knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Q. What had 
               <persName id="t18090412-34-person358">Brown</persName>
             the deceased done to the prisoner to induce the prisoner to strike him - A. I did not see Brown do any thing. The two men that were fighting continued fighting; Brown got up and followed Scales two or three yards and hit at him, whether he struck him I cannot say; I did not hear Brown say a word, only that he was not a second; that was before he was knocked down. Scales followed the men that were fighting; Brown stood opposite of my door, he did not go near them any more; the two men that were fighting had two or three more rounds after that; I considered them all in liquor; Scales was in liquor, he kept with the party that were fighting; they might be five or six yards down the road; Scales came from them and came up to Brown, leaving them fighting; he struck him somewhere about the upper part of the body, but where I cannot undertake to say.</p>
               <p>Q. What had Brown done - A. Nothing more than what I have said.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon Scales returning back to 
               <persName id="t18090412-34-person359">Brown</persName>
             the second time had Brown done or said any thing to induce him to strike him that time - A. I never heard him move or say any thing. In consequence of this blow by Scales Brown fell down in the channel opposite of my window; he laid there some minutes; Scales returned to the men that were fighting; he never offered to return to Brown again, nor to take any further notice of him. The men continued fighting, they were not aware of the mischief that was done; nor do I think Scales was. Brown lay in the channel some time.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get out - A. He was moved by one of the witnesses present; I did not see Brown get up again; I thought he was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Scales struck 
               <persName id="t18090412-34-person360">Brown</persName>
             the first time had Brown done any thing to him - A. Not any thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Brown pushed me before I touched him</p>
               <p>Witness. I cannot undertake to say that he did no do it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Can you take upon you to say that the second time he struck him whether he did any thing to him - A. No further than following him to strike him.</p>

               <p>Q. You said after two or three rounds he came back - what I want to know is this - whether Brown had struck at Scales when he came back so as to provoke him - A. No; he never lifted his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he was opposite of your door - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had lifted his hand should you not have seen it - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see the deceased Brown - A. About twenty five minutes; I helped to carry him into the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the place where he was standing near the channel - A. Yes, about twelve inches from the channel; there was a strong oak plank against the foot path, he was standing on the road; he fell from the road into the channel, and possibly might fall against this oak plank. At the time I helped to carry him into the public house he was quite dead; I suppose so; Dr. Andrews was sent for immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you whether or no the deceased was in liquor - A. I should suppose he was; he had a very deep scar in his chin; three of his front teeth were knocked in, and I saw some blood coming from his ear, which we concluded came from his mouth or his nose; he fell with his face in the channel.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not examine to see whether the blood came from the ear - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner there afterwards - A. Yes; he came from the Windmill on the common; upon his coming down the hill he came to them that were fighting; Brown was standing by at the time; he gave Scales a push by the elbow, because Scales was coming to take the part of Eversly; Scales asked Brown if he was Baldwyn's second; Brown said he was no second, but he liked to see fair play; with that Scales struck Brown and knocked him down into the channel; I did not hear Brown speak after.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was this to the Abercorn Arms - A. It was between the Abercorn Arms and Mr. Budge's house; I never saw him knocked down but once, and I was as sober as I am now.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you on Easter Sunday sent for to attend him at any time in the night - A. Between ten and eleven o'clock I found him on the road on his back, near the Abercorn tap; he was carried immediately into the tap by my desire. I attempted to bleed him and recover him, but without effect, he was perfectly dead. I found a deep wound on the chin to the bone, from whence a quantity of blood might have flowed; several of his foreteeth were knocked in and loosened; the head was opened. On examining the head, a blood vessel had given way about the pericranium, and a large quantity of blood was found in the cavity of the skull, which I have no doubt was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the ruptured blood vessel that you have described the consequence of his falling - A. Yes, I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have described that his chin was cut to the bone, and some of his teeth were knocked in, and consequently it must be done with great violence - A. Yes, he was a very heavy and powerful man also.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you that your opinion is, the rupture of this vessel was occasioned by the fall - A. Certainly, and that rupture was the cause of his death.</p>

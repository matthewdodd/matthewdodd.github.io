               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. Have you your deputation with you as an officer of excise? - Not here, I have at home, that is Cornwall.</p>
               <p>This was about ten at night when you first saw these persons? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was totally without any goods whatever? - No.</p>
               <p>How far distant might the other be behind? - As far as to the window; Barkett and Julian were side by side; he said halloo, when he passed by, but when he came up he said nothing.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not one of you strike this man as he passed you? - No, I did not, till he made a blow at Julian, and then I struck him.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that when he passed by you did not strike him? - I would swear a thousand times, that I suppose he called out halloo, to know who we were; I was provided with a cutlass and pistol.</p>
               <p>Your arms were not at all held by them before you pulled out your cutlass, and began to strike about you? - No.</p>
               <p>That cutlass would have done a little excution, if your arms had not been held - If I could have done it I should, for their behaviour; I thought it was better to kill than be killed, when it came to that.</p>
               <p>You had a good intention then? - I had an intention to save myself.</p>
               <p>Did you at all speak to Williams before you

             the cutlass through his hands so let it go? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>I believe his hand was not much the better for the cutlass being drawn through it? - I do not know what his hand was, but I believe his fingers were pretty well cut one of them; had the gentlemen here been in my place, they would not have found it a laughing matter.</p>
               <p>Were not his fingers almost cut off? - I saw one of them.</p>
               <p>How was that hanging by the skin? - No, no.</p>
               <p>No! was not it very severely cut? - I do know, I know very well, he was cut in the fingers; what finger I do not know, I cannot say that, I know his hand was cut with drawing it thro', but I know he took my hanger, and I drew it thro' his hand, I know the finger was cut.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I believe you thought more about yourself than his hand, when you went to the public house? - I tried to take care of myself, I had some brandy to wash my hand.</p>
               <p>What is Williams? - A noted smuggler, he and his three brothers be in the Exchequer now.</p>

               <p>Was you with Mr. Ascott and Mr. Barker, on the 23d of December? - I was; we expected some muggler the way; I was at Chandem, near Penzance Mr. Barket, and Mr. Ascott, and me went out in the evening, between 9 and 10, we saw three men on horse-back, going towards Penzance on the beach, Mr. Ascott and me followed these three men, and Mr. Barket went on to Penzance town, in order to meet, when I came up with them I knew Williams, we got on towards Penzance Kev, and then the three men turned round and met us; Williams was riding a single horse, I called him by his name, says I, Mr. Williams, is it you? or something of that sort, so I passed on, and made up towards the other two men, who had ankers, Williams had no anker; I made up towards him, and after I spoke to him, I passed by towards the horses; says I, gentlemen, you had better give up the goods quietly; they made no answer, Williams turned round his horse, and rode up to me, and struck me.</p>
               <p>Had you struck him before that? - No, certainly not.</p>
               <p>Did you strike him at all? - No Sir, I had not struck at any man, Mr. Ascott was alongside of me, he struck Williams, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030141"></xptr>knocked him off his horse; with that the other two men on the ankers, jumped off, one ran to me, and struck me, and the other to Mr. Ascott, and he struck me several times over my head, and broke a stick over my head, Williams I believe was on the ground at that time, but I cannot say, we fought some time, at last the man I fought with ran away, Mr. Ascott and the man that attacked him, were fighting at the same time, then I secured a horse, and two ankers, and tasted it, and it appeared to be foreign brandy, when I had secured that, I tied the horse to the anker, and went back to assist Ascott, who was crying out, when I came back to Mr. Ascott, there was this Williams and the other person, and Mr. Barkett, and Mr. Ascott; Mr. Barkett came before me, I saw Ascott just before me, when I came back, and I saw Barkett haul off Williams from fighting Mr. Ascott, and he took Williams then, and secured him, and took him to the public house, the other man ran away, the man I fought with ran away, and took one of the horses with him, the anchor and horse that we did seize, we lodged in the public-house, in Penzance town, the horse they tell me was stolen, I know nothing about that, but the brandy is there still.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You was the first person that was struck in this business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now perhaps you may say, as the other witnesses did; that you had given no kind of provocation whatever to Williams, now I will ask you, whether you did not, in passing Williams, give him some insult, or jostle him, or strike him? - No I did not.</p>

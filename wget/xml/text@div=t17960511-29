               <p>Q. How is the orchard secured in an evening? - A. There is a very good fence, the gate was hatched up with an iron staple; I could track the horse out at the gate very plain, and the gate was hatched up again, just as it was when I put him in; there had been a shower of rain, and I could track him out at the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this poney of a common size? - A. Yes, and there are six spots upon the hide where the saddle has cut the hair off, and he was blind of one eye.</p>

               <p>Q. Who had you in the shop besides? - A. Only my daughter and me all the whole time those women were there, there was not any other person in the shop besides; the moment they were gone out of the shop we missed the muslin; when she was brought back I took it from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your shop a wide shop? - A. It is not particularly wide, I think it is not quite two yards in width, it is rather a narrow than a wide shop; when I took it from her I sent for the ward beadle; I never saw her before.</p>

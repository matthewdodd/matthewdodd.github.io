               <p>'I have been waiting for you, and now I will do for you.' I then felt something had struck my, eye, and then I growned dismally; and could not be heard. I then roused myself from the ground, and lifted up my hand to protect myself from further violence; I put my hand across my head. I received an inscission in my hand while I was protecting my head. I then articulated the word murder as well as I could; I was heard by some neighbours in the place, and a watchman came to my rescue, who is my evidence; the watchman picked me up, and gave me to a gentleman, who is here; he brought me alight. I was delivered to this gentleman, and taken to a public-house cut and maimed. I described the person of the prisoner; he being in a blue jacket, and white buttons on his sleeves; his feature I could not observe. I was knocked down like a bullock, twice; he laughed, and sprang at me. I was taken to a public-house across Haberdashers'-street, directly opposite to the lamp, and I was sent in a coach to Bartholomew's Hospital; I remained in the Hospital near three weeks.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Shoreditch parish. On the 20th of September, I heard the cry of murder; I went up to the prosecutor immediately; I saw Mr. Harris laying down bleeding. I saw the prisoner at a small distance, and as soon as I had lifted up Mr. Harris, the prisoner was pointed out to me by the people that were about. The prisoner was daring any body to come near him. I was confused at the time; I cannot tell the expressions he used at that time exactly. Some of the people said, watchman, that is the man, take him. I got hold of the prisoner in the most cautious manner I could, and one or two young fellows assisted me in going to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any weapon - A. None that I discovered I could not see any weapon; I got him to the watch-house, and I told the night constable of it he said he was not in charge. I told him I left the man bledding; he was not able to come. The prisoner said, if any man came that he had been scuffling with, he would do for them with the poker, or something. The constable told him if he was not quiet, he would lock him up in the cage; he still persisted, and the constable, or house man, sent for another constable; during this time the prisoner stood by the fire place; the constable said here is a knife, whose knife is this; the prisoner said, that is my knife. This is the knife, it was given me by the Magistrate; he desired me to produce it; I cannot exactly say this is the exact knife, it was a knife of this size. The constable said. if it was his knife he might take it; he was silly enough to give him the knife. When he had got the knife he became more outrageous, and the other constable that arrived put him into the cage; he resisted being put into the cage. After being in the cage he pulled a knife out, and rubbed it, and said if the prosecutor came he would do for him with that or something else. This knife was delivered to me by the magistrate. The prisoner said, if he had injured the man, he was very sorry for it, he would go down on his knees, and ask his pardon, or make him any recompence. I went from there to the public-house to see the prosecutor and the constable went with me for the charge. Mr. Duncombe desired to see the prisoner; he came, asked the prisoner, now he came to injure the man, he was almost dead; the prisoner said he was very sorry, and he was willing to go down on his knees, and ask him pardon. I think the prisoner was in a state of intoxication.</p>

            . I live in Haberdasher-Place, Hoxton; I am an insurance broker; I live almost opposite where this transaction happened. On the 20th of September, I heard the cry of murder repeated twice; I went out in consequence of hearing it; when I first opened the door it was extremely dark; I returned and took a candle in my hand; I saw Mr. Harris laying on the ground, he was calling for help. The prisoner I think was within two or three yards of him; I think it was the prisoner; there was no other person near him when I first went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that person say any thing - A. I took a stick in one hand, and a candle in the other; I heard a voice say take care of that fellow with the stick; I was then chiefly occupied in rendering what assistance I could to Mr, Harris; a young man came up and immediately gave charge of the prisoner. The first time that I opened the door, I heard a voice say, we have found the devil, let us kill him. I then accompained Mr. Harris to the nearest public house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260035"></xptr>and went for a doctor, an assistant of Mr. Weston's in Shoreditch came; he was afterwards taken to the hospital, and attended by the Hospital surgeon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner again while he was at the watchhouse - A. I did; I went to the place where he was confined; I asked him how he could think of injuring Mr. Harris in such a manner; he said, if he had hurt him, he was sorry for it, and asked to be let out of his confinement; he said he would go down upon his knees and, ask the gentleman's pardon, if they would let him out. I then retired from the watchhouse, and went to the public house where Mr. Harris was; in a little time a surgeon come; he wanted to bleed him; Mr. Harris was disinclined to be let blood.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to think the prisoner was the person that injured Mr. Harris - A. Because he was the only person on the spot; I had a light in my hand. I did not observe his features I cannot indentify the person. He was given in charge by a young man, and taken to the watchhouse. I noticed his sailors dress generally; that is all I can speak of my own knowledge. The prisoner I think was very far from being sober that night.</p>

            ; he was brought to the hospital on the night of that day, I think about twelve o'clock; I examined the state he was in; he had three wounds, two on the left eye, and one on the back of the right wrist; two wounds on the lower eye-lid on the same eye-lid, and one on the back part of the right wrist. I concluded it was done by a sharp instrument; there being no laceration or cotusions it appeared to be an unscissed wound on the back of the wrist; it extended through one of the integuments, and divided that one at the right hand.</p>

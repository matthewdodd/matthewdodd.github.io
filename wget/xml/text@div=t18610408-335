                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 129). On Friday, 22d March, I went with two constables to the prisoner's shop—he was standing at the front door—we requested him to come into the back parlour with us, and I said, "Mr. Cohen, I have come to speak to you respecting a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that you gave to Mr. George, or one of his men, the landlord of the Blue Peter; but, before we go any further, you need not say anything to the questions I ask unless you like, for it is most likely I shall use it against you as evidence, for it is most likely you will be charged for this thing; did you pass a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to Mr. George, or one of his men, on last Saturday week, the 9th of the month?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "And that note has been returned to you?"—he said, "Yes j it has"—I asked him where it was—he said that he had destroyed it—I said, "What did you do that for?"—he said because he did not like to have a note, with "Forgery" marked on it in his possession—I said, "Did you change a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note on the same day at Mr. Skipper's?"—he paid, "Yes"—I said, "Did you also change a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note at Mr. Jones's on the same day?"—he said, "Yes, I did; oh, Mr. Dunnaway, I have been drawn into this: I am as innocent' as a new-born babe: the notes were brought round to me by Mr. Moss, who keeps a coffee-shop in Church-lane, with some men, for some money and clothes, and the men ran away"—(I was examined before the magistrate as to this conversation before Moss was put into the box)—I said, "Mr. Cohen, have you got any more of those forged notes about you in the house?"—he said, "No; I have not"—I said, "If you have, give them up, because I shall search you, and also search your house before I take you"—I then saw him fumbling about in his right-hand waistcoat pocket, from which he took out a piece of waste paper—I said, "What have you got there?"—he opened the paper and gave me this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), saying that that was another of the notes—I said, "Have you any more?"—he called out to his wife, "Bring them other notes down there"—she brought a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and gave them to me in the prisoner's presence—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said, "Well, Cohen, what, about these?"—he said, "They were brought to me by my next door neigh<lb></lb>bour, a man who keeps a fish-shop two doors off, of the name of Warwick, last Saturday night; I saw they were bad, and I called my man to hold the men, and he let them run away; I have kept the notes, thinking to catch the thieves"—I said, "Have you given any information to the police of this affair, or given any description of the men?"—he said, "No"—I said, "That would have been your most proper course to have taken; you must con<lb></lb>sider yourself in custody, and go with me to the station."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he make the observation about the men running away, in relation to the second lot of notes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> And the first lot too—he did not say that he remarked that they were like the other lot—he said that he saw they were bad, and called to his man, who let the men run away—I went to Moss's house and left word with his wife for him to be at the police-court—that was in consequence of Cohen having vouched Moss—I did not know him till I saw him at the police-court—he did not introduce himself to me—he was pointed out to me, and I went and spoke to him—I said, "That is right; you are here"—I do not know that he made any reply—I called him, but I did not know what he was going to say at all.</p>

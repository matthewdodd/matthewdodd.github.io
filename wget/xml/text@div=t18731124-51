                  </hi>. In October, I was house surgeon at Guy's Hospital—the prosecutrix was brought there nearly insensible—she had a severebruise on her right temple, in front of her right ear, and the cheek-bonewas broken—her face was severely bruised, especially about her right eye<lb></lb>brow, where there were several little cuts; two ribs were broken on herright side; her lungs were wounded, and one rib was broken on her leftside; there were three grazes on the left side of her chest, and a smallinjury to her right hip—the broken ribs were dangerous, as they injured thelungs—a heavy boot or a man's foot would produce the injuries about herface and head—she was nearly insensible, but it was difficult to saywhether that was due to drink or to the injuries—there was a slightsmell.</p>

               <p>sitting with another female, and we all three went and got the worse forliquor; she was jealous of the other woman, and left me. She afterwards cameback, and we had some more drink, and I went to her house and went to bed; when I awoke I asked her daughter, who is sixteen years old, where hermother was. She said that her mother was drunk in Kent Street. I after<lb></lb>wards heard her fall down stairs, and picked her up and put her outside thebed. She must have rolled off the bed when the policeman came to takeme. I have always behaved well to her, and given her half my earnings. I was obliged to leave her through her drink, and I have been away fromher ever since. I had a witness who came to the Court and swore that hesaw her lying at the bottom of the stairs drunk, but he is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the Hampstead Water Company. On the 14th of April I was at Sadler's Wells theatre, between twelve and one o'clock at night, after the performance was over—I was coming from the boxes—I was on the step of the box-door, going into the street—the prisoner was standing at the door—as I came by him he turned round and put his hand to my breast, at the same time another shorter man ran against me—I saw the prisoner's hand pass, I put my hand up, and missed my shirt-pin—I turned round and asked him for it—he denied having it—there were three in company—one ran away—I held the prisoner—they denied knowing each other—the prisoner is the man who took it from my stock, for he put his hand across to my stock at the same moment as an<lb></lb>other man ran against my stomach—I have never found the pin.</p>

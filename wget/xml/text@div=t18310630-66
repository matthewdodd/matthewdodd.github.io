            . I am a constable of Croydon. On the 9th of February, 1830, I found a black mare at Russell's stables, Westminster, which Hale claimed - I went with Russell to the Obelisk stables, to apprehend the prisoner, or to learn from him where he got the mare - I did not find him there; I searched for him at a great many places for a long time, and found him in custody at Unionhall about three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever hear of a man named Hyder? A. Yes - he was transported either in January or March, 1830.</p>

            . On the 22nd of February, 1829, the prisoner brought me a mare to sell - I then lived in Bellstreet, Westminster; I was in the habit of buying horses of him - he said he considered it would suit me, and left it with me to try; he did not say whose it was - he dealt with it as his own; I bought it of him on the 23rd. and gave him 11l. odd - he lived somewhere over by the Obe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300053"></xptr>lisk at that time, I think; Coleman, the officer, afterwards came to my stables with Hale, but we could not find him - I did not see him till he was at Union-hall: I showed

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Had he been well known to you as a horse-dealer? A. Very well for some years - he was known all round the neighbourhood; I found him honest and punctual - there was no concealment in this transaction; it was about three o'clock in the afternoon - I did not go to look for him at the Obelisk for nearly twelve months after; I dealt with him for about six months after I bought this mare, and could have taken him if I had known it was stolen.</p>

            . I am an officer of Union-hall. I was informed of the prosecutor's loss about twelve months ago - I went to several places in pursuit of the prisoner for about twelve months, and on the 1st of June he was apprehended at the Rising Sun, at Brighton, where I understood he went by the name of Turner; Goff, who was with me, said, "Is your name Kingsmore?" he said, "It is, but some call me Turner," and asked what he was wanted for; we said for the horse he had sold to Mr. Russell - he said he bought it of Hyder.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Hyder has been transported? A. Yes, before I took the prisoner; but whether it is since the horse was stolen I cannot say.</p>

            . I am a butcher. I was present about the middle of last February two years, when a man(who went by the name of Wood, but) who I have no doubt was Hyder, sold the prisoner a black mare for 9l.; the prisoner had a receipt from him - I did not see the prisoner again till he was at Union-hall; I was sent for, and gave evidence there.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you keep a beer-shop? A. Yes, and keep a butcher's-shop in Alfred-terrace, Cambridge-heath-road; I came this morning from a booth at Fairlop-fair - he bought this mare at the Anchor and Hope, Devonshire-street, Lambeth; I had never seen Wood but once before - I then lived in Regent-street, Lambeth-walk - I kept a private still there - I got into trouble about that, which strengthens my recollection as to the time; I never saw Wood afterwards - I described his features and dress to those who knew Hyder, and have every reason to believe it was him; I wrote the receipt - I had known the prisoner five or six years, but not particularly: I advised him to have a receipt for the money, as the man's appearance caused my suspicion; I asked the prisoner if he knew the man - he said he had seen him before - I am not able to speak to the day, or the week, but it was shortly before I lost my still; it was on a week day - there was a good deal of cross-chopping at the office as to whether it was on a Sunday, and, to the best of my knowledge, I swore it was not; the transaction occurred in the parlour, four or five others were there - I have not seen them here to-day; they were strangers - I do not know a man named Cutts, nor his daughter; I have not been in any difficulty, except about the still - I was once in custody about four years ago, for having a 21l. bill, and charged with a conspiracy to defraud; I was only in custody one day and a night - I saw the prisoner pay for the horse a 5l. note, and the rest in sovereigns; I cannot say it was the horse in question - it was a black mare, about fourteen hands and a half high, with a cut tail; it had one white foot I know - I did not take particular notice of it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did any thing ever come of the bill? A. I went into Court, and the prosecutor refused to appear.</p>
               <p>MR. HALE. Mine was a black mare, with two white hind feet - the near fore foot was grizzle hair; it had a nag tail, and a streak of white down the face.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as a timber merchant at Old Montague Street, Whitechapel—previously to the 11th February I had some small transactions with a person of the name of Chapman—on the 11th February Chapman, in company with prisoner, came to my premises and said he had got a gentleman who would buy some wood and pay me ready money for it—we viewed the goods and decided about the price, and prisoner wished me then to take the number of the goods and send them on that evening—I said that would be impossible—I said I should like to count every veneer and see the number there was on it, and then I could give a guarantee for what I sent away—I went away through the Mill and said "Where shall I send the goods to-morrow?"—he said "Hasn't Chapman given you a card) Pass me a card"—Chapman gave me a card in the prisoner's presence, and away they went to a public-house, and I had a glass of ale with them—this is the card they gave me—this on the back is my own writing—the other is what I wrote on it after—the card is "Hastings, Dale &amp; Co., Shackelwell Lane, Kingsland, dealers in all kinds of timber"—I said before I left him on the 11th "If you will be kind enough to call on me about 11 o'clock tomorrow I will get everything ready so that I can guarantee that everything is what I represent"—on the 12th, at 12 o'clock, the prisoner arrived—Chapman was not there—the prisoner checked the goods with me and I went indoors and made out this invoice to the amount of 69<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—as I commenced to make out the invoice I said to the prisoner "I forget your name—I have got your card somewhere"—my wife was looking for the card and could not find it—the prisoner said "I will give you another," and he put his band in his pocket and took out another one and said "That is my address" I said "Are you proprietor of this place?"—"Oh, yes," he said—it was just the same kind of card as the other—no writing on the back—I then headed the bill the same as the card—I made out the account and said "Then shall I settle the account, sir?"—he said "No, I am not prepared to pay you the whole amount—didn't Chapman tell you my terms?"—I said "Yes, cash. and I understood cash"—he said "Well I am not prepared to pay cash; I will give you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a two and a three months' bill for the remainder; of course I will make my bills payable at my bankers;"—I said "Who are your bankers?"—he said Drummond, the banker, Charing Cross"—I then said "I know nothing of you, sir, and I really cannot see my way clear to let you have the goods without cash, as I have looked them out for, it is the price for cash, I will consult my partner about it"—he then said "Well I will go and take a glass of ale while you consult your partner about it, and you can let me know"—with that he went to the door, and as he had got the door in his hand to go out he said "Of course you know I shall make my bills payable at my bunkers," a second time—I consulted my <hi rend="italic">Missus</hi> about it—he didn't come back and I didn't go to see him—previous to the time I met him again, I met Chapman—he afterwards sent Chapman to know whether I would accept his offer or not—I went to the public-house to see him and said "I really cannot accept such an offer as that"—I asked him for a cheque on his bankers when I first saw him, and I would allow him 5 per cent, if he would give me a cheque on the bank for the whole amount—that is 2 1/2 per cent, over the usual amount allowed—he would not consent at all and when I saw him at the public-house I said "If you will pay me half</p>

               <p>cash I will accept a bill on your bankers for the remainder"—he said "No, I am offering you the same terms I can get anywhere else"—I stopped there some little time with him—he said "I have sold a business for 7,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the money is lying at Drummond's Bank to my credit"—I did not see Chapman there then—I was sent for to go home to business and I went outside the door and he (prisoner) followed me and said "I will make it 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash and give you a one and a two months' bill"—I hesitated for a moment and then said "Well, I will accept that on the representation of your having a banking account at Drummonds, and being the owner of a house "as he represented, the Robin Hood Tavern—he then said "Can you send the veneer in at once?"—I said "I will send for my carman and it is possible you may get it within half an hour of this"—the carman did not come for nearly an hour and a half, but he did come, and the goods were loaded as checked in the prisoner's pocket-book and in my book at home to correspond with the bill, and were loaded and delivered to his order, and the bill was receipted for the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received and the two bills on Drummond's bank for the remainder, and a receipt stamp put upon it.</p>

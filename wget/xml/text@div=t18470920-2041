On the 7th of Sept., about half-past eight in the morning, I missed a piece of sarsenet, worth about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sent up to Mr. Retier—I told the prisoner I had missed a piece of sarsenet—he said nothing—he took his coat off his arm, and the sarsenet fell from his arm on the counter—I did not say anything to him then—I sent for a policeman; he was given into custody—this is the sarsenet which I missed, and which I saw fall—I do not know it by any mark—I am sure I saw it drop from the prisoner—he was going home, I suppose—he had got out of the warehouse—it was not his duty to take it.</p>

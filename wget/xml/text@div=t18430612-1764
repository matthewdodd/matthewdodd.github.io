                  </hi>. I am servant to Isaac Brown, of Portman-house, Globe-road, Mile-end; he has a counting-house in his garden, there is a wall round the garden, nobody sleeps in the counting-house. On the 18th of January I left it safe, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening—I double-locked the door, bolted the shutters, and brought the key away—I went to the counting-house next morning, and found the shutters broken open—the desk was open, which was not locked the night before, but was shut—the front of the desk was broken out—I had left in it four razors, inlaid with silver, two reading-glasses, two clasp-knives, a shaving-box, and the other articles named—they were all gone—also two half-sovereigns—I went to the bottom of the garden, and found footmarks on the top of the wall, inside, as if they got in that way—I have known the prisoner three years—he lives in one of master's houses about 150 yards from master's—I saw him about four o'clock that afternoon, close to master's premises—I looked for him after this happened, but did not find him till the 28th of April, when he was appre<lb></lb>hended—there was a brace of pistols in the coach-house in the garden, about fifty yards from the counting-house—there was a bag under a sofa, in the coach-house, with two half-sovereigns in it, and that was gone—the prisoner's father had been employed by master in the house and about the garden.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fourteen years old—my father is a tailor, and lives in Globe-terrace, Mile-end, not far from Bird's—I have known the prisoner and Rossiter about six months—I was in the habit of playing with Rossiter—on Wednesday evening, the 18th of January, my mother gave me a coat to take to Mr. Butler's, in Seething-lane—my father-in-law had al<lb></lb>tered it for him—I did not take it—I fell in with Rossiter, and had some con<lb></lb>versation with him—the prisoner afterwards came to us—we were all three</p>

               <p>in the fields adjoining Globe-road—there were some other boys with us when Rossiter came to us—one boy said to me, "Aynt you going to take the coat home?"—Rossiter said, "What coat?"—I said "The coat I had," it was left at Bell's house while I was playing in the fields—I told Rossiter it was at Bell's—a little while after the prisoner came and asked me to pawn the coat—he said he would break open Mr. Bird's counting-home, and get me the money again—we walked up the street, and got the coat—my father was in the country at the time—the prisoner and others waited outside while I went in and got the coat—we then walked up Golden-lane, and the prisoner asked if I would let him carry it—I said yes, and at the top of Globe-lane he went into a pawnbroker's and pawned it—he brought out 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me the money—I gave the prisoner and Rossiter 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, and kept 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the duplicate—we all went to see a show—I stopped out till eleven o'clock, went to a coffee-shop, in Church-lane, I and the prisoner and Rossiter stopped there till two in the morning—the prisoner said, "We will now go down to Mr. Bird's"—I said I would not, I should go home—he said, "No, let us go down to Mr. Bird's, there is bags of gold and silver there"—I said I would go home—he said, "You fool, if we don't get anything there, I will go to a shop at the corner of Northampton-street, my father worked there, I used to go to him and I planned the way to get in," and if he got nothing there, he would go and get some pigeons and rabbits—we walked towards Mr. Bird's—before that he told me he would go and buy a diamond, and cut glass out of jewellers' shops—I left Rossiter and the prisoner at Mr. Bird's—I heard somebody coming, saw a policeman, and spoke to him, and told him I had been to the theatre, as I was afraid—he asked where I lived, I said, "At Old Ford"—he let me go—I did not go home, but slept in an outhouse—I met my mother next morning, went home with her, and told her what I had done with the coat—next day, (Friday) I heard of the robbery at Mr. Bird's, and told one of the constables of it on Sunday—I was ill in bed on Friday, and I think on Saturday. <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN ROSSITER</hi>. I am fourteen years old, and live with my father, in Globe-lane. I have known the prisoner some time—I met Portman play<lb></lb>ing in a field there, and had some conversation with him about a coat, and soon after the prisoner came, Portman said he had a coat, and was going to take it home—it was mentioned in the prisoner's hearing, that it was at Bell's—we all three went to Bell's—the prisoner took the coat into the pawnbroker's—we waited a little way off—he came out with the ticket and money—Portman shared the money among us—I and the prisoner got 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—Portman had the rest, and the ticket—the prisoner then said he would go and break into Mr. Bird's counting-house, and get the money to get the coat back again—he said he knew there were bags of gold and silver there—we all went to a show which was over at half-past ten—we walked about White<lb></lb>chapel and different places, and stopped in a coffee-shop till one, and went to Bird's counting-house between one and two—Portman was coming with us, but when we got there, a policeman saw him, and he walked off—the pri<lb></lb>soner and I got over the fence—it is partly wall and partly fence—we tried the counting-house shutters, but could not get in there, and then got into the brew-house—we did not get into the coach-house—he said, "Let us come to the counting-house first," and we did—he afterwards said, "Let us go to the house," and said there were two pistols there, but we did not go there—the prisoner brought two nails out of the brewhouse, and forced the counting-house window open—we did not get the pistols—he got into the counting-house first, and found the lucifers, and struck a light—he said his father worked there, and he knew all about the place—we found two half-sovereigns</p>

               <p>under the sofa in some bags—there was 1/2 lb. of Spanish-liquorice, two pocket-knives, four razors, four shaving brushes, two glasses, and other property—the prisoner put them all into his pocket—the prisoner drank some beer in the brewhouse, and wanted me to take the pegs out, and leave the tubs running but I would not—we went out over Mr. Baker's wall—the prisoner put the two half-sovereigns into his mouth, and wanted to persuade me they were sixpences, but I said they were half-sovereigns—he lost one in the garden, and we shared the other, we got it changed at a Jew's in Whitechapel—I got 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw a gun and some blankets in the counting-house—he wanted to take them, but I wouldnot—we immediately went to Petticoat-lane, got there about six, waited till the Jews came, and sold the things about eleven in the morn<lb></lb>ing—the prisoner took a razor home to his father—he said that would save him a good hiding—he got 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for two glasses—I do not know how much he got for the whole—I got half—I do not know how much—it was only pence—I continued with him two or three days, till all his money was gone, and did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>

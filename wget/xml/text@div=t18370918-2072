                  </hi> I am a tailor and draper, and live in Smithfield. About half-past six o'clock in the evening of the 19th of August the prisoner came into my shop, begging me to give him some list to tie up his stockings—I had a gentleman there—I said I had no one in, if he would wait a few minutes I should have—I returned to the counting-house, about two yards from where he was, and then he said, "I will look in again"—my foreman and son came in, and had occasion to go out again, after which the prisoner came in again—I said, "You are very unfortunate, my son and foreman have just gone out"—he said, "Yes, I know it"—he walked on two or three paces—I looked at him very hard, and said, "You shall not look in again"—I went behind the counter, and he said, "I will look in again, "and he ran off with the coat—I had had my hand on it not half a minute before—I saw him run away with it.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you tell the Magistrate you saw him run away with the coat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and it was read over to me, and I put my hand to it—I stated the case precisely as I have now stated it—I recollect the depositions being read over to me—I missed the coat not a minute after he left the door—I stood in front of the prisoner, close by him, with my hand on the coat—I went round the counter, not two yards from the prisoner—I stooped down to pick him a piece of list off the ground, and he ran off with the coat, and instantly my little boy came in, and said, "That boy is gone off with a coat"—I concluded he had had the coat because nobody else was there—ours is a shop of general custom—it was quite light—I do not believe we had one customer from five to half past six o'clock—this was a very excellent coat, the best I had in the place</p>

                  </hi>. I came from Mr. Matthews, in Ivy-lane. I was passing by the prosecutor's shop, and saw a boy outside talking to some body inside the shop—the prisoner was the person inside—I saw him come out—he said, "I will call in half an hour"—nothing came out with him the first time—he went in again, and came out with a coat wrapped up under his arm.</p>

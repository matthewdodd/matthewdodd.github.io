                  </hi>. I am a gun maker, and reside in William Street, Whitechapel. On Sunday evening, 4th April, about 5 o'clock, I was in Commercial Street, near Whitechapel—I was going from Spitalfields Church to Whitechapel Road—I saw the two prisoners and another woman—theybeckoned me to Wentworth Street—I did not take any notice of them—when I got to the corner of the street, to cross the road, Smith rushed and snatched the guard of my watch, which was in my waistcoat pocket—it was a silver guard and a very strong one, and my watch was silver—she pulled the watch out, and pulled me along with it down Wentworth Street, and Williams gave me a push and I fell down, and the guard snapped, and Smith left a part of the chain, and Williams, while I was on the ground, took my handkerchief off my neck—they ran away, and took the watch with them—therewas part of the guard in my hand—I valued the watch at 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they all ran away, and were taken in custody some time after.</p>

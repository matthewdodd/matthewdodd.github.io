               <p>I am servant to the last witness. The prisoner opened the door with his left hand, and I took him with my right; it was the 27th of August, on Thursday, between seven and eight in the evening; I took hold of him, and I found the pot in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to examine his pocket? - My fellow servant told me of it; James Ponton brought him back as he was going out at the door; he took out one pot himself, a pint pot on his right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any quart pot taken from him? - Not till my mistress asked him if he had got no more; and he said yes; then he produced the pot and the pint; he had one in his right hand pocket, and one in his left.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did they belong? - To my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. Was her name on them? - Yes; and the name of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he had any liquor there that day? - He had a glass of ale, and paid for it, and did not drink the ale; he was not there ten minutes before he did the robbery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me produce the quart pot? - I did not; my mistress did; I found a pint pot in your right hand pocket.</p>

               <p>I am servant to my mistress; I am the pot boy; I stopped the man; I detected him putting the pot in his pocket; I see him produce two pint pots and a quart pot.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did these pots belong? - To Mrs. Brown, my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the first pint pot come from? - From his right hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the other pots come from? - One came from under his apron; we thought it was in his breeches; the pot was very warm; and the other was in his coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was there not a crowd of hackney coachmen in the house? - There were but three in the house.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I have kept the pots; there is one pot that was produced after I came to him, and there was one laid on the table before I came to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these three pots kept separate? - Yes; they were kept tied up with my own hand, and ever since in my own possession; I have them now; they are mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there the name of the house on them? - Yes; the Queen's Head, in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you kept that house? - Four years.</p>
               <p>Q. There were no pots in that house but what were your's? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor ever sold any? - No.</p>

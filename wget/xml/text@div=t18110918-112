               <p>Mr. Alley. This was at half after eight in the evening - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It must be dark, and at the time that a great many girls were running about the street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear to his giving it away to another, you did not see it - A. I was convinced that he had taken my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never feel a man's hand but against your pocket - A. Many times.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not like to be prosecuted for that - A. No, I should not,</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sixty-eight years old, and live in Green Man-lane, Poplar. On the 29th of Aug. between ten and eleven o'clock I met the pri<lb></lb>soner—she asked me to go with her to her house to have a cup of tea—we had a pint of beer before we went—I gave her and another girl a quartern of gin—I went into the house, she took me up into her bed-room—I did not like the look of the house, and said, "Why did you bring me to such, a place as this?"—she said she lived there, and I should be treated as I liked—she said, "Give me a shilling, and you can do as you like with me"—I said, "I have not a shilling to give you"—she knocked me down on the bed, fell on the top of me, held my left-hand down, forced her hand into my pocket, and took three half-crowns, and one shilling out—I said, "You have done the job"—she walked down stairs, I walked after her, and followed her to give her in charge—she said, "Where are you going you rascal?" she staggered me, knocked me down, and gave me a black eye—we were outside the house then.</p>

On the 14th of May, about nine o'clock in the morning, I asked the prisoner if on the 4th of May he did not go away from my house with some soap in his pocket, which he positively denied; I promised him pardon if he would tell me all he had done, and I would continue him in my service if he would conduct himself properly for the future. On the 14th of May I could not get him to confess; I told him if he would not hear mercy, I threatened him I would have an officer; I went with the prisoner and the officer to his lodgings, No. 4, Pell-street, Ratcliffe-highway; on the ground floor, in a box where the wife's clothes were, we found the several articles mentioned in the indictment.</p>

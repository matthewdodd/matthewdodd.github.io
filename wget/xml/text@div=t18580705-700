                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, of No. 35, Long Acre. About 20th June the prisoner came for half an ounce of tobacco—my daughter served him, and he gave her what pretended to be a shilling—she took it up and gave it to me—on my looking at it, the prisoner said, "It has been a little worn, but it is all right"—it had at that time some appearance of silver on it; it has not now—I gave him 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and my wife gave him the tobacco, and he went from the shop—soon afterwards I put that shilling aside, and kept it separate from any other money; the next morning I discovered it was bad; it is a farthing—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, at No. 136, Long Acre. On Saturday, 26th June, the prisoner came about 8 o'clock—he asked for half an ounce of tobacco; I served him, and he produced a copper farthing, covered with liquid, to represent a shilling—he laid it down on the counter, and held his hand over the counter, to throw a shade on it, that I should not see it was bad—I took it up, and found, by rubbing it on my boot, that it came like copper—I said, "This is rather neatly got up, have you got any more?" he said, "No," and he was not aware that it was bad—I said, I should not let him go, till I got a policeman; he said, he had got it from a beer shop or public house, where he had been taking dinner—I gave him in custody with the coin; it has been filed at the edges.</p>

On that Saturday evening, I was called to the shop of the last witness, and the prisoner was given into custody for uttering a counterfeit shilling—I produce these two farthings; one was given me by Mr. Leon, and the other by Mr. Sperling—the prisoner had no money on him—he gave an address, and I went there, but he was not known.</p>

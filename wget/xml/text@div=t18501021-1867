I am a cheesemonger, in Earl-street, Seven-dials, On 5th Sept. the prisoner Westbrook came to me—he said he had a warrant, signed by Mr. Savage, and he had ascertained from Mr. Savage that Mr. Shepherd was no longer Mrs. Hume's collector, and he was appointed collector—he produced a warrant—this was about eight o'clock on Friday evening; and he said, unless the rent was paid before nine o'clock next morning he should put the warrant in force—he said he had been to Mr. Watts, the tenant, and he had referred him to me—I made an appointment to meet him at his house next morning, at nine o'clock; which I did, and I handed him 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I stated that I thought there was some error in it, and that that was not the amount of money that was due—I paid him that 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my brother's account—I had his authority to pay it—I stated that we had always been in the habit of paying Mr. Shepherd—he said he had ascertained that Mr. Shepherd was the, collector at one time, but Mr. Savage had been appointed agent—he gave me this receipt—when I said I did not think so much was due, he said, "You had better pay the money under a protest"—I said I was authorized to pay the money if I got a receipt; that was all that I required—I did not know the meaning of a protest—after I had paid the money, Mr. Savage called out me, and wished me to go with him over to Westbrook's—</p>

            , a Person with her, had some Gin together; as we were sitting by the Fire-side, she said she lived but three or four Doors from that House, and said her Husband was out, and I should be welcome to lay down upon the Bed a little, and she would be a Customer to me; when I went up Stairs, there was a Bed in the Room, and immediately half a Pint of Gin was brought up without my Order; I says I don't want any, but as 'tis come, I shall drink; I went from thence back to the Gentlewoman's that bought the Sheets of me, and she bought a Remnant of Check.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. I was there about a Quarter of an Hour, from first to last; I packed up my things in that House, then went and told the Gentlewoman at the other Place where I sold the Sheets, I would bring her some more sheeting, and two Pounds of Snuff.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing when you went away?</p>

               <p>Court. And there you opened the things again?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. I opened them to pack them so as the Rain should not hurt them in carrying them Home.</p>
               <p>Q. When you opened your things there, did you miss any thing?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. Yes, my Lord, I missed a very large Parcel of Handkerchiefs, which might be to the best of my knowledge, 63 or 64.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what Kind were they?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. There were a Dozen or Fourteen printed, and all the rest were checked.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Worth of all of them?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. The whole, take them all together, might be worth 3 l. or 3 l. 10 s. I told the Gentlewoman of the Gin-Shop, in case these Goods should be found upon these two Women, they should stop them and give me Notice; I went back directly to the Place, but the Women were both gone.</p>
               <p>Court. Then those two Women that were with you at the Gin-shop, and at this House, were both the same that yo u suspected took your Goods?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. Yes, though I did not see them take them away, but as the Evidence will prove it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time of the Afternoon was it you went away from the Gin shop? and what Time was you there in the Morning?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. About Nine in the Morning.</p>

I went immediately back again, and fetched the other Woman; and she told every thing, where the Handkerchiefs were pawned; some were pawned at one Place, and one at another; some she had pawned, and some she had sold; we found it all to be true as she had said; there was one hid under the Hog-tub in the Yard.</p>

The Woman and she went up Stairs together; I stayed the Space of half an Hour, then she came down. I saw she had something in her Apron. I said, I will go.

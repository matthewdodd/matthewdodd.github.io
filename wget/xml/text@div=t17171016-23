Mills, the High-Constable of the Matter, who sent Mr. Wootton to search. Mr. Wootton deposed, that being sent by Capt. Mills, he took one to his Assistance, and went to the Place aforesaid, and forcing open the Door on a sudden, before the Prisoners had any Intimation of their coming, he saw Hunt sitting by the Fire, who starting back at the opening the Door, some Pieces of the counterfeit Money sell from her (he supposed out of her Lap) and that there was on the Fire a Crucible, half full of Mettal melted, which he ordered a Watchman to take off, but being hot; he spilt it among the Coals; that there was a Flask lay by her, which she kicked to break, and in breaking the Mold, the counterfeit Money flew out of it. That Wood was indeed sitting by her, but he did not see her doing any thing. The Utensils and counterfeit Money was produced in Court, the former were broken to Pieces by Order of Court, and the Money broke by the Warden of the Mint, according to Act of Parliament. Joanna Wood deny'd the Fact, saying, she was innocent of the Matter; that indeed she had let Hunt be in her Room, but did not know what she was doing, till going into the Room to fetch out some Napkins to make Clouts of, Hunt turn'd the Key upon her, and lock'd her in. Hunt acknowledged the Fact, saying, That she indeed herself was guilty, but what Joanna Wood said was true, and that she was wholly innocent of the Matter.

               <p>I knew both the prisoners. On Wednesday the 7th, I was at a Mr. Bishop's, a publick-house, about a quarter after six in the evening. Mr Lay was drinking crank, and I was drinking beer. It is in Sun Tavern Fields, about two hundred yards from Cole-stairs. Rutledge came in, and asked me if I would buy two iron bars of him; I had nothing to do with them, and I said I would not buy them off him. Rutledge is a <rs id="t17890114-51-deflabel262" type="occupation">waterman</rs>

Rutledge went away, and Lay came in and drank his crank out; after I had drank my beer, Lay asked me if I was going home, I said yes, to get some tobacco; he said he was going to his shop to get a man, and that he had agreed with Rutledge for the iron; afterwards he came to our stables, about five minutes afterwards, and asked me if I had seen any thing of Rutledge, I said no; if he wanted him he would find him about Cole-stairs; in about five minutes I saw Lay come out of Mr. Shepherd's yard, just by Cole-stairs, with a bar of iron; it was then about half past six; then he pitched it against the corner of a house, and said, I think I can carry another, bring me another out; he said it to either Rutledge or Freeman, I do not know which; Freeman and Rutledge were there when I saw Lay coming out; then Lay carried them about forty yards, and pitched them by the side of a house, and said he could carry them no farther. He gave one to Freeman to carry, and the other he carried himself. I did not see Rutledge till we came to Mr. Bishop's, the publick-house; Freeman and Lay carried it to Lay's house. About half an hour afterwards, Rutledge, Lay, and Freeman came to Bishop's; and Lay put his hand in his pocket, and gave them two half-crowns and a shilling; Freeman then said, is this all, and Rutledge replied, no; I got one shilling coming along.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, prisoner Lay's counsel. Was you with them during the time? - No. I walked with them going up to Mr. Bishop's again; about forty yards.</p>
               <p>Was Freeman in the stables with you? - No. I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Did not you refer Rutledge to Lay to purchase the iron? - No; that I swear.</p>
               <p>Did not you go out with Rutledge to the door? - I can neither say one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Do you owe Lay any thing? - Four or five shillings; he asked me for the money, and threatened to set lawyer Dyke to work at me, if I did not pay it.</p>
               <p>Was not the money for this bar-iron first offered to you? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You was to have no part of the profits of this? - No, not a farthing.</p>
               <p>Court. When Rutledge came in, he first, you say, applied to you? - Yes; Lay heard him talking about bars, and he said he would buy them. I told him I would not buy any thing of him.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you tell him who you would recommend him to? - I did not recommend him to any body.</p>
               <p>Remember you have been examined before, and I have your examination in my hand. Did not you tell Rutledge that Mr. Lay would buy them of him? - I told him they would not do for me, they might do for a blacksmith.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him that there was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140068"></xptr>blacksmith by, that might want them to shoe his horses? - I think I might.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you tell him Mr. Lay was there, and would buy them? - Yes, I think I did.</p>
               <p>Why did you tell that gentleman (Mr. Knowlys) a little while ago, that you did not recommend Lay to Rutledge. Did not Rutledge ask you for the key of your stables to put the iron in? - Yes, he did; and I told him he should not have it. I went to do the horses up.</p>
               <p>How came you to go just at that minute? - It was a quarter past six, and I generally go at that time. It is the way to Cole-stairs.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him you was going to the stables? - I did not tell him so.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself? - Yes, I think I did tell him I was going to the stables.</p>
               <p>Why did you tell him you was going to the stables? - I might have told him so.</p>
               <p>Did you or not? - I think I might.</p>
               <p>Why did you tell him so? - He said he was going towards the stables; and when he came to the stables, he asked me to let him put the iron in, and I said no.</p>
               <p>What business had you to leave the stables, and go to Cole-stairs? - That is where my dwelling is.</p>
               <p>How much did the iron weigh, upon your oath? - I do not know; no more than what Mr. Lay said at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Was not you by when it was weighed? - No.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - Yes.</p>

Lay was not at home, and I took Freeman with me, and he picked out some bars, of which I took three away to the office; they were not right; and I left them at the office, and went and took Lay, and brought him to the office; and he said they were not the right bars, and that he would go back and fetch the bars. I found Lay in his shop; he said his name was Lay; he came with me freely. The magistrate sent us for the bars; and Lay shewed me the bars, and brought one of the bars in his own hand; he said he had them from Freeman and Rutledge;</p>

               <p>I am a sailor, an apprentice to Captain Nixon, of the Themis. I asked Rutledge to drink with me at a booth on the ice last Wednesday was se'nnight; I asked him to drink three or four times. I told Rutledge I was going on board again, for I had got no more money; and he d - d me for a fool, and asked me if I could not get none; I said no; and he asked me if there was no iron or any thing like it about the ship; I said yes, there was a lighter of iron along-side; and he said when it was dark he would put me in the way of getting a shilling or two; and if I would be ruled by him, I never should want for money to spend. About six in the evening he went out of the booth, and told me to stop there till he came back; he returned in half an hour, and said he had got a man to buy the iron; we took two bars from the lighter that lay along-side, and carried them over the ice, and laid them against Mr. Shepherd's wharf, Cole-stairs; then he went away and brought Mr. Lay and

            ; then Mr. Lay and I took the iron, and set it up against the house; Lay said he would carry them both; he carried them a little way down the street, and then said they were too heavy for him; he gave me one of them, and we took them to his house; he bid me stand at the door, and he got steelyards, and weighed the iron; then we went to Mr. Bishop's, the publick-house, and he gave Rutledge two half-crowns and a shilling; I had half the money. I paid for part of the beer, and then we came away. I should think that Lay must know that we did not come by them honestly; he did not know what ship they came from; he knew I was a sailor.</p>

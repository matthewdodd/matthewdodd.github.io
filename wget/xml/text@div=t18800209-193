My husband is a baker, of 6, Chandos Street—on 15th October the Prisoner came in for a penny bun, and put down a shilling—I put it in the tester, and told him it was bad—he than opened his left hand, threw down a good one, and said, "Take it out of that"—I said "From your opening your other hand and giving me the good shilling, I feel confident you knew that the first coin was bad, and I shall detain you till my husband comes"—my husband came in at once, and went for a constable to whom I gave the coins—this is the shilling; I know it by the way I bent it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes; I have known him not more than six or seven weeks. On the 18th of October met him in the Strand; he asked me to have something to drink; we went into a public-house, and had something to drink; we were not have a minute in the house; he said he had to call on a friend of Smithfield. At Smithfield we went into a public-house and had a dram, and then he took me up to Compton-street, that is where the accident happened; we arrived in Compton-street about four o'clock; it was about one o'clock when I met him, and in <placeName id="t18131027-64-crimeloc366">Compton-street</placeName>

We had not been there a moment before the prisoner struck me, and drawed my watch out of my pocket; he made a bolt out of the room; I pursued him, and called stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to stop him in the room - A. I should have taken him at the time, but it was not what I expected; it was quite unawares.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any body else in the room - A. There was a woman with a child; she is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. When you ran out, and pursued him, and called stop thief, how far did you pursue him - A. Not more than ten or a dozen yards up Compton-street; I returned back to the public-house before he was taken. The prisoner was brought back in two or three or minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the watch - A. It is in the possession of a person who now has it. I thought at first it was a joke, and said if he would pay the expence he might go, but when he run out of the house I followed him, and cried stop thief.</p>

            . I am a painter. On the 13th of October, between for and five in the afternoon, I was painting a house at the top of Northampton-street, in Compton-street; I heard the cry of stop thief; I turned round, and saw the prisoner coming up the street; I crossed over and laid hold of the flap of his coat; he said, let me go, it is only a lark; We returned, and I took him back to the George public-house, the corner of Compton-street; the prosecutor was there, and a number of people. The prosecutor said, he thought it was only a lark, he did not wish to hurt him, if he could get his watch, and expences if the watch was damaged; the prisoner said, he and the prosecutor had been drinking all day together; the prosecutor and the prisoner were both fresh.</p>

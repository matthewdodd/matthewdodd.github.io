                  </hi>. I am the wife of Timothy Kahlar, of 8, Horace-street, Marylebone—on the night of 31st May, about five minutes to 12, I went out with a jug to get some beer for supper—I got the beer, and was coming home when the prisoner caught hold of me by the back of my dress and asked me to come round the corner with her, that she wished to tell me something very particular—I said it was rather too late to stay—then she said she would not keep me a minute, and before we got half way down Shelborne-street she stabbed me in the chin—she then stabbed me several times, once in the bead, and fourteen or fifteen times in my body, with a large carving knife, once in the neck and in the eye, and she nearly cut my hand in two—I fell down—we both fell in the passage of a house—the door gave way—she fell over me—she put her knees on my chest, it is very much bruised, pulled up my clothes, and tried to stop my mouth to prevent my screaming—I got them out again, and called murder—two men came to my assistance, and pulled her off me by the legs—she kicked me several times in the leg, and the print of the nails of her boots is in my leg now—when they were pulling her off me she flung the knife at me, and it stuck in my neck—I begged mercy of her several times—I went to Mr. Danford's, a doctor's close by—the prisoner lived for three weeks in the same house that I did—we never had the slightest quarrel—she was sober—I never saw her drunk—I did not call her names.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 268.) I am employed in Woolwich Dockyard. In consequence of something I heard I went to the defendant's house on Wednesday, the 19th of Nov., between six and seven o'clock—he keeps a marine-store shop in Sun alley, close to the dock-yard—I found the prisoner and his wife sitting by the fireside in the shop, sorting some copper nails which were on the table—it is a sort of mess-room and shop and all—When I went in they seemed rather excited, and they put a cloth over the nails, and strove to conceal them—I examined the nails—they were copper and brass nails—I found these nails which I produce, with the broad arrow on them distinctly—when I had ascertained what they were, I told him that, finding them, I should search the house—I searched all round the house, and then went to a cupboard, where I found two bags—I took them into my hand, and was going to open them, and the prisoner made use of these words, "There is enough there to transport me"—he said he hoped I would look to his family—he hoped I would be merciful to his family—I opened the bags—in the first bag I found six new copper bolts, with the broad arrow distinctly to be seen upon them, in seve<lb></lb>ral places—I also found in the bags some new brass and old brass, some new and some old copper nails, with the broad arrow on them—in one of the bags was some lead and some old copper sheathing, and several pieces of brass and cop<lb></lb>per, some of them marked with the broad arrow, and some not—these are the articles—I weighed what has the arrow—the new copper bolts weighed twelve pounds, and the new nails and pieces of copper three pounds—these</p>

               <p>are the articles which have the arrow—there were seventeen pounds in all, but part were not marked—after I found these I went into the yard, but I only searched by the door—I found nothing there—these things are in the same state as I found them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant R</hi> 30.) I am attached to the Dock-yard at Woolwich. On the 19th of Nov. I went to the prisoner's house, about a quarter before seven o'clock in the morning—I searched in the cellar, and, under some old rags, I found a quantity of iron nails, and two small plates, all marked with the broad arrow, which is the mark with which her Majesty's stores are marked—(I have been in the police attached to the dock-yard for five years)—I looked in the room, it is occupied as a shop and living-room—there is only one room down stairs, and a cellar under-ground—I believe there is one bed in the room, which is occupied as a shop and kitchen—the house consists of one room and a cellar—I saw the prisoner's wife there, and two or three children—there was only one bed there—I have known the prisoner the last four years, and residing in that house the last two or three years—it is about five minutes' walk from the Dock-yard gates, and about 100 yards from the Dock-yard wall—I know Byers—I do not know what he is—I know nothing of him but seeing him backwards and forwards through the town—I saw him in company with the prisoner two days before he was taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the steam-engine department in Woolwich Dock-yard—this copper bolt has the mark which is put upon her Majesty's stores, in several places, about two inches apart all round—these are the marks of the Queen's stores—this bolt is new, and so is this nail—here is a nail that I should consider to be one-third worn—these others are new, and they are marked, and belong to the store-keeper's department—such articles are never sold, whether old or new—after they have been used they are sent to Ports<lb></lb>mouth to be re-cast—no copper is ever sold.</p>

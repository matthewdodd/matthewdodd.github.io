            , of Russell-court, Drury-lane; I knew nothing of Robbins at that time: I gave him sixteen guineas for the note, I kept the note some time in my possession, and on the 7th of November, I sent it down with some other money and notes to my bankers, Mr. Drummond's; subsequent to that, and previous to the note becoming due, the prisoner had applied to me for other money, which I lent him on other securities, and in the course of that business he asked me where the note lay, I did not tell him at first, for he said, that Mr. Robbins was a very good man, and generally sent to take up his notes as soon as they became due, if not before, in order to prevent trouble: this conversation was subsequent to my having sent the note to Drummond's, and previous to its becoming due; I told him it was a matter of no consequence where the note lay; but the second time I told him it lay at Drummond's; as the note was out of my hands, I did not take any particular notice when the note was due; but on the evening of the 26th of November the prisoner came to me, and requested me to let him have some more money on another note, he then had been in the publick house, which he had taken some few days, he had then had a good deal of money of me upon some notes, and upon a judgment; I told him, I could not let him have any more, he seemed very desirous and pressed me very much; he had had some beer of me to the amount of five or six pound, he would have paid that out of the note, if I would have given him the difference which I thought rather odd: I saw no more of him till he was taken up: the note is satisfied under the bond and judgment, so that I have no claim on the prisoner, nor on Mr. Robbins.</p>
               <p>Court. Explain more particulary how the note is satisfied? - Nothing has been done but what is in the strict line of business; it was a bond for eighty pound, and the judgment was given for double the the penalty of the bond.</p>
               <p>In what way did you conceive the note was satisfied? - The bond was given for one hundred and twenty pounds, it was the sum that he first had of me, but it was returned again; the lease was understood to be for fourteen years, when that agreement was made, and it was afterwards understood to be only for seven; there was a differance meant to be made (but only these things came so fast one upon another) declaring, that though the bond was for one hundred and twenty pound, yet there was only eighty pound lent.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was that bond given prior to the note? - No, Sir, subsequent, I have not the least resentment or severity against the prisoner, very far from it; I stand here in a very disagreeable situation that my evidence should affect his life.</p>
               <p>Court. When was the bond given? - Between the time of discounting the note and its becoming due.</p>
               <p>Court. How much money was actually lent on the bond? - Eighty pound, exclusive<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150047"></xptr> of this note; there was some other money that was due on other notes, which I shall say nothing of at present; the money that was levied was not sufficient to pay my demands wholly; I let him have twenty pound on another note and twenty-five on another note.</p>
               <p>But what sum exclusive of these two notes was advanced on the credit of the bond? - Eighty pound, he had engaged to give one hundred and twenty pound for the lease, and that sum was at first meant to be advanced on the bond; it was actually lent, but it was returned again in a day or two; besides the eighty pounds lent on the bond, there were two notes one for twenty pound, and one for twenty-five pounds and some odd shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon failure in payment you took out an execution under this judgement? Yes.</p>
               <p>What was levied under that execution? I do not exactly recollect the sum, my Lord, I was not prepared for that information, it will not be sufficent to pay every thing.</p>
               <p>Will it cover the whole sum of one hundred and twenty pound? - Not with the expence and every thing.</p>
               <p>Was it above one hundred pound? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>The other two notes were not paid then? No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>What became of the sixteen guinea note afterwards? - It was returned to me upon the day after it was due, the 27th of November by some of Mr. Drummond's people, then I went with the note to Mr. Robbins and it was not paid.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. I think you say that you received a bond and a power of attorney to confess a judgment from the prisoner a week or ten days before this note became due? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That bond was for one hundred and twenty pound, and the warrant of attorney for double that sum? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I think you said that all the money that the prisoner received from you before that time was eighty pound and sixteen guineas? He had received one hundred and twenty pound when the bond and judgment were given which was returned, and eighty pound afterwards advanced, so that at the time he had given me the judgment he had received one hundred and twenty pound and sixteen guineas; so that the sixteen guineas never were meant to be included in the one hundred and twenty pound.</p>
               <p>Had not you a transaction with the prisoner about the purchase of this lease? - He deposited the lease in my hands as a security.</p>
               <p>Did not you actually agree for the purchase of it? - No.</p>
               <p>The lease was deposited in your hands as a security? - There was no regular assignment of the lease, there was an agreement.</p>
               <p>But you thought of the value of it, and the value of it was considered between you and the prisoner? - Yes, or else I should not have lent my money to a stranger.</p>
               <p>What was the value? - He was to give eighty pound for it.</p>
               <p>Do you mean, Sir, considering it as a lease for seven or fourteen years, to be of the value of eighty pound? - For seven years.</p>
               <p>Is it not a lease for fourteen years, at the determination of the tenant, not of the landlord, but of the tenant? - Both I believe; it is certainly determinable at the option of the lessor, I am sure of it, because application was made to the landlord to continue it for the whole term, and if he would give his word, that the lease should stand the whole term, Godfrey would give the one hundred and twenty pound.</p>
               <p>What does your whole demand on the prisoner amount to? - The amount is not entirely finished.</p>
               <p>Of what you have actually advanced? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150048"></xptr> I do not exactly know; I have no with to keep this business any secret; so far from it, that I gave the prisoner's wife an account some time back.</p>
               <p>Court. As you put it in such a way that you were satisfied for this note; I thought it my duty to enquire how you were satisfied, - I was satisfied in that way, under that judgment.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you recollect the whole of the sums advanced on all the securities together, to this man? - There was the 16 guineas, the 80 l. and the 20 l. the 25 l.</p>
               <p>Was there any part received from the prisoner, except what was levied under the execution? - No, I never received a halfpenny from him in my life.</p>
               <p>Is the lease in your possession now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who is in possession of the house? - One Blazon.</p>
               <p>Then you now hold the lease of the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Besides what was levied under the execution? - Yes, the lease was sold under a bill of sale by the sheriff.</p>
               <p>What, under your execution? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. What was the lease sold for under the execution? - Sixty pounds.</p>
               <p>And purchased by you? - No.</p>
               <p>Purchased for you? - I have it now.</p>
               <p>What did the goods appraised come to?</p>
               <p>Perhaps Mr. Godfrey has the account, I gave it him</p>
               <p>He has an account; it is very odd you cannot recollect these sums? - It is not odd at all, I was not prepared.</p>
               <p>Was the goods appraised at 57 l. 10 s.? - No, I believe not.</p>
               <p>What other sum was it? - Forty-nine pounds, as I heard; the goods were appraised to Godfrey at 57 l. 10 s.</p>
               <p>Court. Were the goods bought in for you? - They were bought in by a friend of mine.</p>
               <p>For your use? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. The licence, what did that cost? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You have it now, or your representative? - When I sent to Godfrey for the licence, I sent two guineas to him, codering his situation.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner's Council. We had better proceed to see whether there is any evidence respecting this note; you shall have the liberty of calling this witness again.</p>

               <p>- MACMANUS sworn.</p>
               <p>I apprehended the prisoner: there was no particular conversation.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Johnson junior. I wish now to enquire more particularly, with suspect to the securities you have in your hands, at the time this note became due: you had a bond for 120 l. the penalty of which, was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150050"></xptr> double the fund; and the lease deposited as a collateral security; and you had, besides the other notes for which you had advanced cash, one for 20 l, and the other for 25 l. are those notes still unsatisfied? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then, under the execution, you say the goods sold for 49 l. and the lease was bought in at 60 l. that makes 109 l. the lease was valued at 80 l. that makes 129 l. and the goods at 49 l. were brought in for your use. - There was another judgement entered up at the same time that mine was, and part of the money levied, went to Mr. Gillies; he had taken a judgment prior to mine.</p>
               <p>What was the amount of that? - Eleven or twelve pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You have stated the goods to be 49 l. and the lease 60 l. what did the gage bill amount to? - The money that I actually received, at the time the present tenant went into the house, was, 99 l.</p>
               <p>I want to know what you received under the execution? - I received nothing, but what I received under the execution.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. It turns out, that these several sums nearly cover Mr. Johnson's demand, that may be taken to be the fact; the operation of it is a subsequent one; it happens, that eventually the securities have turned out sufficient to satisfy Mr. Johnson's demand, whether they would have done so or not, is another question.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Do you wish to say any thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say at present my Lord.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

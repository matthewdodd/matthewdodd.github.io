            (to Sharp) Did you at any Time lose a Copper Saucepan and five Pewter Plates ?</p>
               <p>Sharp. Yes. The 18th of last Month.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your House?</p>
               <p>Sharp. In Catherine-Wheel-Alley, Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Court. Now give an Account of the Particulars.</p>
               <p>Sharp. Please you my Lord, the Prisoner was at my house on Monday Night, a drinking, and he acknowledg'd he took these Things from my Dresser, before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself? Where were the Goods found?</p>
               <p>Sharp. At a Publick House over against me, please you my Lord; the Person that gave me Intelligence of the Goods, was the Maid of the House,

When I took him before the Justice he said he was in Liquor, and he intended to have brought them home again, but he did not; he told before the Justice that he had not been well, and he took these Things to get a little Money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any Thing of the Man; What is he?</p>
               <p>Sharp. A Wheelwright.</p>

               <p>The Prisoner declar'd there would have been several to have appear'd to his Character, but they were gone home with a Design to come To-morrow Morning. <rs id="t17460409-17-verdict75" type="verdictDescription">

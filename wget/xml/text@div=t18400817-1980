In consequence of instructions, I watched near the prosecutor's premises, in Long-acre, on the 4th of August, about nine o'clock in the morning—I saw Townsend come out of the back premises—I was in Cross-lane, leading to Long-acre, in plain clothes—Townsend went down the street, and into Great Wild-street, Lit<lb></lb>tle Wild-street, and, at the corner of Duke-street, he put one of his feet into the John of Gaunt public-house—he looked round, then came out, and went on to Lincoln's Inn-fields, and stood against a lamp-post—I passed him, and put myself into a house, where I had permission to watch him through the window—he remained there about a quarter of an hour, anxiously looking for some person coming in the direction of Holborn—after that time I saw Gardener, walking in a great hurry towards Towns-end, from the direction of Holborn—Townsend then left the lamp-post and met him—after walking a few yards towards where I was standing, I saw Townsend put his hand into his pocket, and take out one of these pieces of leather, and give it to Gardener, who put it into his pocket—Townsend then took out this other piece, and gave this to Gardener—I went out, and took them both—I said I was an officer, and should take them both to Mr. Pearce's—they refused to go, and Townsend said he was sent to Mr. Bur<lb></lb>rows, his master's solicitor—I said he must go back to Mr. Pearce's first—he then said he was in business for himself, and that this was his property—I said I should take them both back—Townsend then struck me three violent blows on my head, and knocked me down—I then lost my hold, but I jumped up, and took Gardener by the collar again—Townsend had run away, but I seized Gardener so suddenly that he could not get away—I took hold of the piece of leather which Gardener had in his hand, but he refused to let me have it—I took him to Mr. Pearce, and on our way he said I must be either mad or drunk, and he was doing it by way of trade—on our arrival at Mr. Pearce's, I took the leather from his hand, and put my hand in his pocket, and took out this other piece—he was then taken to Bow-street—I then went back to the prosecutor's, and took Townsend—Gar<lb></lb>dener</p>

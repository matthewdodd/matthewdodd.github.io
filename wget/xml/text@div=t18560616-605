                  </hi>, I am a butcher, and live in Pitfield-street, Hoxton. On the morning of 7th June I bought four sides of veal, and three fore-quarters, in Newgate-market—my cart was in Warwick-square—I gave directions to my man to take the veal there, and I went to a coffee shop—I was looking out at the window, and I saw the prisoner carrying a quarter of veal on his shoulder—I came out of the coffee shop, and followed him into the market, where he put the veal off his shoulder, on to another man's shoulder—I followed that man, and saw where he put it—I waited till a porter came, and I put it into Mrs. Payne's—I saw the prisoner again in half an hour in Newgate-street—I am certain he is the same man—I examined the quarter of veal, and am certain it was mine—it weighed 51lbs.—it was a remarkably large one.</p>

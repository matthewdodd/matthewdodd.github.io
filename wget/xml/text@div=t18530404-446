                  </hi>. I live at Addenham; I know the prisoner. On 26th March he went with me from there to Uxbridge—I bad a pair of shoes in a bag with my clothes; I bad them when I was at Uxbridge—the prisoner carried my bag part of the way for me—I know him well; we both came from one village—we went to the Sun public-house; I left my bag in his care while I went to the butcher's to get a bit to cook for supper—I came back, and told him I could not get any liver, but I went to the market and bought four black puddings; we bad them for supper—I then took the bag, and found it had been undone—I missed my shoes—I said to the prisoner, "My shoes are gone"—he said, "I know nothing about them, don't accuse me"—I said no one else could have them, the bag was left in his care—I bare seen my shoes since; these are them—they are tied with a bit of tape and string, as I had them—they never were on my feet, only just to fit them—I left them in the bag.</p>

On Tuesday I saw the heads of five sheep at Mary-le-bone Office; the prisoner was in custody; I knew them by an ochre mark round the right eye - that was only on three of them; I could not discern it on the other two, as the skin was off; two of the skins were found last Friday, in the cut of the Paddington canal- I knew them by two strokes of ochre down the off side. The beads were fresh, and had been recently killed; the wool was cut more off the three than the other two. The prisoner lived at Kensal-green, I believe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. You missed them on Saturday, the 10th, and saw the heads on Tuesday? A. Yes. Graziers generally mark their sheep with ochre- I believe we are the only persons who mark them round the eye - I will not swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had seen other heads with this mark round the right eye should you have claimed them? A. Yes. They were found about a mile and a quarter from where I live. I do not know the prisoner - he lived in a cottage by the side of this cut, and about one hundred yards from where the skins were found.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What mark is on the skins? A. The two strokes down the off side; I made them myself - on the Wednesday before they were stolen; the mark round the eye is done with wet ochre; I did it myself, and believe it to be my own mark, and on the skin also; the water has washed it out a little, but it is visible.</p>

            . I am an officer of High-street, Mary-le-bone. On Monday, the 12th, I went with the prisoner's landlord, Mr. Saunders, of Kensal-green, on the Harrow-road, and in consequence of what he said I went to a cottage there, close by the Paddington canal side - the cottage was fastened up, and on the back door I observed the print of a hand with bloody finger marks, and on the privy floor I saw a bloody foot mark. I went to the back door, and perceiving a very bad smell come from the house I endeavoured to get in that way; I forced a window up and got in, and in that back room, hanging on the mantel-piece, were the plucks of three lambs and two sheep, and on the hearth were the heads of three lambs and two sheep - part of paunch and a quantity of fat in the cupboard; there was no furniture in the cottage - it did not appear to have been occupied; there was a quantity of blood on the floor, as if sheep had been slaughtered there. I let every thing remain in the state I found it, fastened the door, and went to the office. I got a warrant against the prisoner, and was out with Webster till three o'clock on Tuesday morning, by the house, but he never came near - he was apprehended next morning about eleven; Webster brought the prisoner and the heads to the office.</p>

            . I have three cottages by this cut. - The prisoner came to me on the 31st of May, to take one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220006"></xptr>of them; he called on the 2d of June, and took it, and paid me 4s. down, as a week's rent; I gave him the key that day. I went there with Buckeridge on the 19th, and saw the sheeps' heads and marks of blood as he has stated. I had only seen the prisoner at the cottage once, that was on the Monday after the 2d of June - he had no furniture there - I only saw some parcels - he never lived there; he said he took it for his wife and two children. - I asked him on the 2d of June for a reference; the person he sent me to did not know him. When I saw him at the cottage there were some parcels there, but I did not go in- I thought he had received them by the canal boat; he sent them away by the errand cart. On the day he was apprehended I saw him at the door of the Coach and Horses, public-house Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he pay your rent? A. He gave me 4s. on the 2d of June. I saw the cottage almost every day, but was never in it; he told me he was a yeast merchant, and had his yeast from Northampton; several Northampton boats pass the cottage.</p>

            . I am an officer. I had been to the prisoner's cottage, but could not find him. I went at nine o'clock on the morning of the 13th, and left about eleven, leaving a person to watch; he fetched me, and when I got within a hundred yards of the cottage I saw the prisonner peeping round the corner of the house, as if to see if he was being noticed; I kept on the opposite side of the road, crossed over, and collared him; I told him to consider himself my prisoner, for I had a warrant against him for felony - he made no answer; I asked him what he had got in the cottage; he answered nothing at all; I said,"Are you sure you have got nothing at all?" he said nothing but some knives and hooks; I said, "Then what have you done with the heads and plucks that were there- have you flung them in the water?" he said No, he had tied them up in a basket, and they were outside the house- I asked for the key of the cottage - he asked me to take it out of his right hand pocket, which I did; we unlocked the door, went in, and found two knives, some books, and a piece of wood, which I believe they use to hang sheep on - there is a hole in it for the hook - it is a little bloody. I went outside the house, and found the heads and plucks in a basket, tied up in a small bag, with a quantity of fat; I asked what he was going to do with them - he said he was going to take them away; I asked if he was married, and where he lived - he declined answering till he got to some other place. Saunders and I had before that found part of the sheep's guts in the canal, which is about six yards from his cottage; we brought him to town with the basket - Saunders took the skins off the lambs' heads, with the mark round the eye - I produce them.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Coppicerow, Clerkenwell. I have dealt once or twice with the prisoner. Last Friday or Saturday week I sold him ten sheeps heads and plucks - he had bought such things three or four times; I only knew him by his passing. I bake heads and plucks of an evening. He was passing by, and I asked if I had anything to suit him, and sold him these.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you sent for to Marlborough-street? A. No; I do not know where the prisoner lived, and did not know him by name; I thought he kept a sheep's head shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you ever seen sheep marked with a red spot round the eye? A. Very often - it is not uncommon; I think I could produce one or two heads from my shop now with the same mark. I buy about sixty sheeps' heads every week. I have lived at No. 6, Coppice-row, four years.</p>

On the 19th of this month, about half past eight in the evening, the prisoner came in for half a quarter of a pound of butter, after she had gone out of the shop a minute or two, I looked over the counter, there were ten piles of cheese of this description, I missed this one cheese, I ran out of the door, and called to her, and when I called, she walked faster on, I ran after her and pulled her by the shoulder, I asked her what she had got, she replied nothing, I said, it is a very large nothing, feeling it, I brought her back, Mr. Veesey took the cheese from under her cloak, the prisoner wished to be discharged, she said I had got the property, and that was quite sufficient, I refused to let her go.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that cheese again. - Yes, here is a mark that was put on immediately, and here is a V that was on it before.</p>

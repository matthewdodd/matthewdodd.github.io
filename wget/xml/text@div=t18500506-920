                  </hi>. I am a compositor, and live at Stepney. About twelve o'clock at night, on a Saturday, the latter end of April, I met the prisoner in Bow-road—she asked for something to drink—I took her to the Plough, and we had some drink—I went into the yard with her, and was talking to her, and she took a half-crown, seven shillings, and a sixpence from me, and ran away—I ran after her—she joined a man and woman—I pursued her, and did not lose sight of her—I gave her to the officer.</p>

On that Saturday evening the prisoner and this young man came to my place, about ten o'clock, and remained till twelve—they sent out for a pot of beer—they drank that, and sent for another—he sang three songs—I and my wife were there, having our supper—they were sitting round the table—we all four sat together—there are two rooms in the house, one up-stairs and one down—I had never seen this man before, that I know of—I had seen the prisoner a few times—she came to my place about four times, to see my wife—she never brought anybody there before, to my knowledge—when she came in she said, "Here is the young party I have been talking about"—we had a mackarel and a pint of beer for supper.</p>

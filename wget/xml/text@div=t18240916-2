On the 26th of June, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoners came into the shop to look at some seals which laid in the window - I took out about six: they wished to see some more, but bought none; they looked at other things, and at last chose a pair of ear-rings, upon which they paid 2 s. 6 d. as a deposit, and said they would call again in the evening, and pay for them; they came to 6 s. 6 d.: they said they were for their little sister, and they had not sufficient money about them, and had to go to Westminster. They were nearly half an hour in the shop; and just before they came in I had been winding up all the watches, and am positive that the watch in question hung upon a nail, within their reach, when they came in - it had come from a lady to be repaired a fortnight before, and she was to call for it that afternoon. I had would it up ten minutes before they came in, and missed it about an hour after they were gone; nobody but them had been in the shop; other watches were also within their reach. The shop is very small indeed. I am positive that they are the men - they had called at the shop three days before, and looked out 16 l. worth of goods, and what then occured induced me to notice them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You had seen them before, had you any conversation with them relative to that matter - A. No. Mr. M'Phale had cautioned me about them, and I was afraid to say anything to them. The watch belonged to Mrs. Baring, of New Ormond-street: it has not been found. I saw them in custody five or six weeks after. I did not leave the shop till I missed the watch. They must have got behind me to take it. The shop is very small.</p>

            . On the 20th of July I went to No. 8, Lambeth-marsh, and asked for two young men named Morgan and Sessions - the woman said two men named Brown and Williams lived there, but they were out; we went on the second floor, and saw a girl. I went on the roof of the house, and saw Sessions concealing himself, and took him; he had only his trowsers on: he dressed, and in going down stairs he rushed from me, and ran away,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160004"></xptr>and was stopped near Astley's Theatre. He had asked if I wanted him for broad, meaning cloth; I said Yes - he was secured. I took him into a public-house, and handcuffed him with difficulty, as he resisted. I took him to the coach stand, and found Foster there with Morgan.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was on the roof attending to his pigeons - A. There were pigeons there.</p>
               <p>- FOSTER. I am an officer. I went with Lee. I took Morgan at a plumber's-shop in Stangate-street - his wife denied him to me: I said I wanted him for the old game; he said,</p>

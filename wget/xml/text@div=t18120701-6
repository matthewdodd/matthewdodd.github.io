On the 2nd of June, in the afternoon, about seven o'clock, I was in the shop: I saw the prisoner come into the shop with another woman. The other woman asked for calico for a gown lining. I shewed her several. The prisoner stood between her and the door. The other woman purchased calico to the value of ten pence, and the other woman paid me. The prisoner was going out. The other woman kept speaking to me as she went out. After the prisoner was out in the street she ran towards Berner-street. Upon my seeing her running I ran out and laid hold of her by the shoulder. I saw the shawls fall from her, from under her shawl. I saw two shawls fall from her.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure they fell from under her shawl - A. I am certain. I picked one up, and a person who is here picked the other up. The prisoner then made off into Berner-street, and then I laid hold of her completely, and gave her up to some one else to bring her back to the shop, and she was brought home; and when the prisoner was brought back she said she had not taken them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen these shawls in your shop before - A. They were in the window. I had seen them in the window when I looked, within three quarters of an hour before they came in. They were articles that we deal in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she near that window when she was standing in the shop - A. Very near that window.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else was in the shop at the time that you was serving this woman with the calico - A. No one but myself. There was nobody near her but the other woman that was near her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any of your family, or any of your journeymen in the shop - A. There was nobody in the shop but her and the other woman and myself. I have no partner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. You said, she said she had not taken them - A. Yes; she said so.</p>
               <p>COURT. At the time that the woman came into the shop, you were alone - A. I was alone.</p>

                  </hi> I am a furniture-dealer, at Holloway—the prisoner was introduced to me by Mr. Smith, a lodger of mine—he spoke English pretty well—he said he was librarian in the Foreign Department in the British Museum, that he had the appointment, and was about to enter on it on 1st Jan, next, at a salary of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and he wanted goods to furnish seven rooms—I saw him on many occasions, and on 24th Sept. he gave me an order—I let him have a carpet, value 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a rug, value 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a dress<lb></lb>ing-glass, value 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., believing him to be the librarian of the British Museum—he had some curtains, he said I was to put them up in the room, 47, Great Russell-street, where he was lodging—I said there were three windows in that room, and my curtains were but for two windows—he said, "Never mind that, you will have to take them to the British Museum, there are but two windows there"—I should not have parted with any of these things if I had not believed he was librarian to the Foreign Department of the British Museum.</p>

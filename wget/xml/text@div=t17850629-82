               <p>My partner's name is Adlard Thorp, I lost some printed linen the 16th of June, between six and seven in the evening, the prisoner and another woman came in with inten to buy a remnant of cotton for a child's frock, I served the other woman to the amount of five shillings, they went out together, and as they were going out of the door, I suspected there was something under the prisoner's cloak; I told my young man I was not satisfied, and we both went from behind the counter to the door, and the moment we got to her, my young man saw her drop the linen, I did not; I saw the linen on the floor in the shop, they were only just at the door, she made some frivolous excuse, and said, she knew nothing at all of it.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive her take anything at all in the shop? - No, it was laying just by the door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles, Prisoner's Council. Your counter is near the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have linen placed in other parts of your shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had a horse of linen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That extends near the door? - Yes, it is at the door.</p>
               <p>Might not any person in passing briskly towards the door have dislodged this linen from the horse? - No, Sir, we never put any of that kind on the horse; it never was on the horse.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290108"></xptr>Are you sure there was no cotton of that pattern on the horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was it since you inspected the horse? - I cannot tell .</p>
               <p>Who prepared the horse for shew? - My man.</p>
               <p>Do you take upon yourself to swear, and do you expect to be believed, that when an other man furnished that horse with goods, that this cotton was not on the horse? - I will take upon myself to swear that that printed cotton was not there.</p>
               <p>How many pieces might this horse contain? - Twenty.</p>
               <p>Will you take upon yourself to swear that you took a particular note of every one of these twenty pieces that were on the horse? - I cannot swear that, but I can swear that that linen was not on the horse .</p>
               <p>Do you know where that linen lay? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Then will you say it was not on the horse? - I am sensible it was not on the horse, but I do not know where it was.</p>
               <p>How many customers had you in your shop that day? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>It is a shop pretty much frequented? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many were in it at that time? - Six or eight.</p>
               <p>Then of course these people had been up and down the shop? - I admit that.</p>
               <p>Did you search this woman? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>What, my friend, suspect a woman of robbing you and not search her, then of course I think you took her for an honest woman; what became of the other woman? - She went, I let her go.</p>
               <p>How did the other woman behave when you stopped the prisoner? - She stopped about five months, but she went off when I sent for a constable.</p>

               <p>On the 16th of June last, between six and seven, I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner, and he charged her in my presence with stealing a piece of printed linen, she made no answer at all.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I saw the piece of linen fall from the prisoner at the bar, she was by the door, I was behind the counter when it fell from her, but I was close to her, I was going to take hold of her, as I suspected she had something, the horses were fastened to the door, there are one on each side, she was between the two horses, a person may go without touching either of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. That is as much as they can do I fancy? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What part of her did it fall from? - From her clothes, I saw it slide down, I saw it before it came entirely to the ground, I saw it falling, it fell between her and one of the horses; I was so close to her I could not be deceived, I am quite sure of it, it was under her cloak I imagine; she had a long cloak on.</p>
               <p>Did you furnish the horses? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any goods of that kind on the horses? - We never put any such common goods on the horses, this was a linen, we never put any on the horses but callicoes.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive her taking it? - I did not; it was delivered to the constable in my presence, it was the same I picked up.</p>
               <p>Constable. I had it from the counter, Mr. Graves delivered it to me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That was the same that was picked up off the floor.</p>
               <p>(The piece deposed to by the shop-mark, by Young and Graves.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. A man might go without touching any of them, might not he? - Yes, just steer clear.</p>
               <p>Was the other person before her or behind her, that went out of the shop with her? - I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you find it between the horse and the door sill, or between the horse and the counter? - Between the door sill and her, it was in the middle of the door-way, withoutside the horse.</p>
               <p>When you hand these pieces on the horse you hang the ends to shew, you put the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290109"></xptr> heaviest inside the horse? - I am sure I found this withoutside the horse.</p>
               <p>Were you so near her as to swear that you could see distinctly whether this piece fell from her or not? - That was the woman that I saw the piece of linen fall from, I was so close that I could not be deceived, the other woman was not between me and her, I was close to this woman, but the other must be be before of course.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowles. That is reasoning, but you did not see that; the prisoner permitted herself to be searched very quietly? - I do not know that she was searched at all .</p>
               <p>Do you know every piece that you put on that horse? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Do you know every piece that you put on these two horses? - I do not know exactly, but I know partly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my councel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who all gave her a very good character, and said she worked hard for her living at her neadle .</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you shew the prisoner this linen? - No.</p>

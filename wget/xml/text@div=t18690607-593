                  </hi>. I am a guard in the employ of the South Eastern Railway Company—on 17th May last I was guard of the train between Ashford and London, arriving at London at 2.25—that train takes up trucks which have come from Folkestone, at Ashford—the prisoner is the under-guard of the train—his duty was to see the trucks shunted down, and to see if the loading van was shifted, and to let me know if it was—there are some stoppages on the way, five minutes at Maidatone, and thirty minutes at Tonbridge—he started from Ramsgate with break No. 1866—No. 1674 was the break he shifted into at Bricklayers' Arms, on the morning of the 18th.</p>

Q.</hi> Was break 1674 on the Ramsgate line that night, do you know? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know it was hot—he shifted into it between 4 and 5 o'clock—I don't think the key of one break will fit another; I never tried—I have had one break fifteen years—some guards find their own locks, and some have the Company's locks—I am not aware that anyone has keys except the guards.</p>

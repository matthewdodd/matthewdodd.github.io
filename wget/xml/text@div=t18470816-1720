                  </hi> I live at Harefield—on Friday, the 19th of July, I went away from home for about two hours, and when I came back I found the prisoner at my place—my brother George handed me over eleven cigars, and said the prisoner had taken them from the box—I asked the prisoner why she did it—she said she did not know why—I took her to the station, and handed the cigars to the officer.</p>

                  </hi> I am the brother of James Scarlett. On Friday morning, the prisoner came to the shop and took some cigars, which were in the window—I saw her do it—she went out of the shop, came in again, and took some more—she went out, came in a third time and took some more—I did not speak to her the two first times—the third time I went out and called her, she came back and gave me the cigars when I asked her for them—she asked for half-penny worth of cotton, and said that was what she came for—I did not serve her—I kept her in the shop till my brother came, told him, and she was given into custody.</p>

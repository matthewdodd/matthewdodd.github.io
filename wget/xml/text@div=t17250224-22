Percival, Lieutenant Shipton, the Prisoner and the Deceased, were all in Company together at his Master's House. About 11 o'Clock, they all went away but the 2 last, who then gave Orders for a Bowl of Punch, and appeared very pleasant and friendly. Between 12 and 1, they called for a Box and Dice, which he carried to them; and in about 5 Minutes after, he heard'a Noise, ran up Stairs, and saw both the Prisoner and the Deceased with their Swords drawn; the tormer standing in a Corner within half of a Yard of the Wall, so that he could not retreat from the other, who stood before him. In this Posture this Evidence left them, and ran down to call up his Fellow-Servants; and returning with them, they found both the Gentlemen fallen down, the Deceased being undermost. They took them both up. The Prisoner kill'd the Deceased, and called him his Dear Merrick. And turning to this Evidence, For God's Sake, says he, run for a Surgeon, which he did immediately; but returning without the Surgeon, who staid to prepare some Necessaries, the Prisoner, with great Impatience, sent him back again, and then he brought him. The Prisoner was wounded, and bled pretty much, but would not suffer himself to be dress'd, till the Surgeon had taken Care of the Deceased.

            , the other Drawer depos'd, that when his Fellow-Servant was gone for a Surgeon, the Deceased said, Dear Cook, was it you that did it? And the Prisoner answered, Dear Merrick, it was. Then reply'd the Deceas'd, I freely forgive you. But was it not your seeking? return'd the Prisoner; to which the Deceased made no Answer. The Deceased was afterwards laid upon a Bed, where this Evidence asked him how he did? And he answered, Very well! How does Cook do? Cook had 2 Wounds in his Side, and both their Swords were drawn.

             Surgeon, depos'd, that about 2 in the Morning, being called by one of the Drawers, he came to the Red Lyon, where he found the Prisoner and the Deceased standing together in a friendly Manner, the other Drawer standing by them. The Prisoner desired him to take Care of his friend, which he did; and tho'in the mean time the Prisoner fainted, yet he would suffer nothing to be apply'd to his own Wounds, till those of the Deceased were dress'd. The Deceased had lost about a Pint of Blood by his Wounds; and his Condition appearing dangerous, it was thought necessary to have  the Advice of another Surgeon. And Mr. - Hollaway was send for; and they together, by putting the Deceased in another Posture, perceived that the Sword had pass'd quite thro' the Body. He heard the Prisoner says Merrick, you Know 'twas your own Fault? But the Deceased made no Answer. About an Hour or two before his Death, this Evidence ask'd him if there had been any former Quarrel betwixt him and the Prisoner? And he answered, No: I forgive him and all the World. The opened the Body, and found that the Sword had perforated the Cavity of the Belly, and wounded the Guts in two Places. He died about 11'o Clock in the Night of the same Day, and they believed that that Wound was the Cause of his Death.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner in his Defence said, that he sate next the Door, and the Deceased came round, drew his Sword, and stepping betwixt the Door and him, he (the Deceased) forced him up to the Wall, and put him under a Necessity of using his Sword for the Preservation of his own Life The Gentlemen that were in Company with the Prisoner and the Deceased that Night the Misfortune happened, depos'd, that they saw no Signs of ill Will in either of them, but that they appeared to be very good Friends; and that when they were taking their Leave of them, the Prisoner desired Mr. Shipman to stay longer, which they thought was a Sign that the Prisoner had no Intention to quarrel. The Duke of Richmond, the Duke of Montague, the Earl of Essex: the Lord Mansfield, the Lord Albemarle, and the Lord Walgrave, depos'd, that they had known Mr. Cook for several Years, and always found him to be of a peaceable Disposition, and not subject to quarrel. A great Number of other Persons of Quality were present and ready to speak in the Favour of the Prisoner; but the Court thought it unnecessary.

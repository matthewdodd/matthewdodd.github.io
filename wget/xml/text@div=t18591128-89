                  </hi>. I live at 3, Albert Villas, Bridge-road, Battersea. On 6th October, I left home and remained away until the 12th—I left my house empty, but locked it up securely—I locked the back garden gate, and left the key at Mrs. Simmon's, two doors off, because it was heavy—the front door was bolted and chained—I returned on the afternoon of the 12th and found the house in confusion, and broken open, the wardrobes and drawer were broken open in the front bedroom, the cupboard in the front bedroom was also broken open—I missed a pencil-case, three brooches, a watch, two rings, and a large quantity of wearing apparel, value 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was safe when I left—I afterwards saw the policeman, Levy, fit a screw-driver to the marks—I compared them also, and they corresponded with it—the lock of the back door had been picked—the garden gate was locked when I came home, but the policeman bad been in before I returned—I was before the Magistrate, and sat close to the prisoners, and when Mrs. Jennings was making her statement, I heard Watson say to Dobinson, "By God Harry, we are done."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, Count Stock Place, Bridge-road, Battersea—on the evening of 11th October, about 7 o'clock, I was near Mrs. Rippon's house, and saw Watson come out at the gate with something in his right hand like a piece of iron or a screw-driver, but it was rather dark—he came a few steps towards me, and then turned to a man who was under a lamp-post, and said, "Harry, there stands that b—y cat; we are done"—they then went towards the Flamborough Arms—I am certain it was Watson, I knew him before—I cannot swear, but I believe it was Dobinson who was under the lamp—afterwards, about 8 or 9 o'clock, I saw Watson come from the public-house—he crossed the road, and went up the Boling-broke-road—I saw him again next evening as I came from my work—I was standing outside Mrs. Dixie's door, and he said to me, "If I catch you in a dark place or on a bridge, I will throw you over and break your neck"—he had previously lodged in my house—I then lived at 3, Mary's-place, and I once went into his room and saw what he told me was a life-preserver—that is fourteen months ago—I took it from his hand—I saw it again at the police-court; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is either an N or a K upon it, and here are dots at the end of it—I next saw it before the Magistrate at Wandsworth.</p>

               <p>give any information to the police in this case, but next morning I found the door open, and knocked at Mrs. Staple's, next door—it was on the 17th October that I heard there had been a robbery—I think it was a fortnight ago yesterday that I went before the Magistrate—a policeman came to me; that was the first time I had given information to the police about it—the man had not a bundle when I saw him coming out at the gat—he had nothing but this in his hand—it did not look like this; it looked longer—I do not know whether it was a crowbar or a stick—he had no bundle—it appeared like a long piece of iron or a screw-driver—this was not in the dark—I thought it was a screw-driver, because he gene<lb></lb>rally carries one, being a smith, and I thought he had gone in for the purposes of his trade, and not to break into the house—when he said, "Harry, there stands that b—cat," I did not think anything about a burglary, but I thought it was something that was not quite right—I thought some<lb></lb>thing was wrong, and I should have told a policeman but I could not see one; this was about 7 in the evening—I could walk from there to my house in five minutes—I did not see a policeman as I walked home; I looked for one, and likewise coming back—I went into a person's house, opposite the Flam borough Arms to leave my things, as I had just come from work—I gene<lb></lb>rally go into that person's house when I have done my work—she is a car<lb></lb>penter's wife—I saw no policeman on my way back to her place; it is only one street; there is a public-house there—the clock had just gone 10 when I got home—I looked for a policeman as I went home. A policeman came to me on 17th October, and asked me what I saw, and I told him—Jennings is my name, people have called me other names, but I never said my name was anything else—they have called me Marshall, and Pearce, and White—I did not live with a man named White—Longhurst was my maiden name—my husband died in 1851—it is since his death that I have been called Mrs. White—I cannot say where I was living at that time—I might be coming along the road this morning and be called Mrs. White—I was living in Chelsea and in Battersea—I was not living with a man named White—he lived in the house at each place with other lodgers—he was my lodger at first, and I became his lodger; we shifted our quarters—I have not lived with the prisoner Watson as his wife; he was my lodger at 3, Mary's-place—White was not in the house then, that was after I had been to Chelsea—I do not know what has become of White—I cannot tell when he left—I do not trouble my head about my lodgers leaving me—it was not after he left that Watson came to live with me—on my oath I was not living with Watson as his wife—I know Mrs. Bedford—I cannot say how many different houses I have been living in with Watson—I cannot recollect—it is more than one; it is two—I will not swear it is not three—I did not sleep with him—I was not seen in bed with him by Mrs. Bedford—I know his brother Henry Watson—I do not know what he is—I believe he lived with me when I was called Mrs. White—White was not then living with me as my husband—I cannot say whether he was in the house—White was not with me when Watson was there—Henry Watson did not see his brother in bed with me, after White had left, and if he says so he tells a great falsehood—no one can swear they saw me in bed with him—I swear that the prisoner Watson has never been in bed with me—he slept in the back room when he first lodged with me, and in China Cottage he had the front parlour—I have only once had a conversation with Henry Watson about William Watson, and that was through a letter from my son—I never told Henry Watson that as William had treated me so badly I would get him transported if I possibly</p>

               <p>could—I saw Mrs. Bedford yesterday morning—I did not call on her last Wednesday week—I never asked her not to say that she had seen me in bed with Watson—I did not say to Mrs. Bedford, "Do you think I shall get more than three months if I do not appear against him;" not that I wished, that they had sent for me from Birmingham—I do not know any one at Birmingham—I have moved seven times, that was to get rid of the prisoner Watson.</p>

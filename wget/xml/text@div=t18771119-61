                  </hi>. On the 28th October I was in Freeschool Street at about 11.10 p.m. with another chap—a woman was walking behind us, and the prisoner and another—were walking on the other side—they—called out "Whoa Emma," and they came over and the prisoner struck me on the forehead and nose—he had nothing in his hand that I saw—I felt a cut on my forehead, and was knocked up against the gate, and then I went up to the prisoner to hit him, and the other man came up with a knife and drew it down my arm—two gentlemen caught hold of me as I was falling, and I found myself at the hospital.</p>

I am a single woman, and on the night of the 28th I was with my sister in Freeschool Street—the prosecutor was walking on in front, I believe—I saw the prisoner and another man on the other side, and they shouted out "Whoa Emma" two or three times—the prose<lb></lb>cutor said "Shut up," and the prisoner rushed over and knocked him down, and as he hit him blood flowed from his head, and I took my apron off and wrapped it round his head—the prisoner pushed me and knocked me down—the other man stabbed the prosecutor after the prisoner knocked me down—he had a knife in his hand at the same time.</p>

                  </hi>. On 1st April, about half past 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into my public house at Barking—he asked for a pot of beer; I asked bun if he had money to pay for it—he said he had half a crown to pay for it—it came to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me what I thought was a half crown, and I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I laid it on the till, and then saw that it was a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—there was no other money there—I took it back to him the moment I found it out, and asked him for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more—as I held it out to him, he snatched it out of my band, and put it in his pocket—I put my foot against the door to prevent his getting out, but another man <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me on one side—the prisoner got the door open, went out, and a man caught him—I went for the police directly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am potboy to Mr. Ellmore. About 4 o'clock on this day the prisoner was in the tap-room—I saw him give a piece of silver coin, which he said was half a crown—I afterwards saw my master show him a 25. piece—he said, "Let me look," snatched it out of his hand, and put it in his pocket—Mr. Ellmore asked him if he was going to give it to him; he said "No"—Mr. Ellmore stood against the door to prevent his going away, but somebody else pushed my master away, and the prisoner got away.</p>

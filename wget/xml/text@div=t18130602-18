               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners - A. Yes. These are the women that I met on the 15th of April about five o'clock in the morning, as I was going to work at Paddington. I met the two prisoners in Drury-lane; they asked me to give them something to drink. I told them I would, and they took me to the Black Dog in Drury-lane. I gave them some warm porter as they requested.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. I had been tipsey the over night; I was sober in the morning.</p>

They asked me to give them something to drink. I told them I would not. I had my hand in my left hand breeches pocket; one of the two prisoners, which of them I cannot say, shoved me down across the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. You were in the house then - A. Yes, below stairs. The two prisoners and my falling, I had my purse in my hand, containing a three-shilling piece, two shillings, and a ten pound bill of exchange.

I took her to a house where the prosecutor was sitting; there he asked us to have some beer and gin. We took some. He asked Writtle if she knew any house to take him to. She said, no, he might go home to her apartment. We all three went together to her home. He took something out of his breeches pocket, and gave it to Writtle; she throwed it on the bed. He went away. On her return to the bed she picked up a three-shilling piece. I am as innocent as a child unborn.</p>

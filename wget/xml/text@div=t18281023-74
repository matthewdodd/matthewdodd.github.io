            . I live with the prosecutor. The prisoner came about 11 o'clock at night, on the 1st of August - I served him with Dutch cheese, which came to 3s. 4d.; he threw down a gilt sixpence - I did not know but it was a half-sovereign, and gave him 6s. 8d. in change; he went away; while I was giving him change he said he kept a public-house close by, and was going to have a club, and should want some hams - this took my attention from the money; he came again next day, and tendered another gilt sixpence, and said, "Give me change" - I told master he was the man who had been there the night before; they are both gilt sixpences (looking at them).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took them in exchange for a double sovereign; and postponed my trial last Session in order to prove it, but I cannot find the witnesses; I had got intoxicated the first night, and lost the cheese.</p>

               <p>What passed at Litchfield-street? - He was asked how he came by that silver, he said, he took it in trade the over night, and the reason why he came to buy candles of me was, because he could buy candles for seven shillings a dozen, and he was obliged to give seven shillings and eight-pence elsewhere.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any thing particular how he was to pay for the candles? - I did not chuse to let him have the candles without the money, he had only twenty-six shillings, and a few halfpence, a man came with the prisoner, and he sent him for the remainder of the money, but before he returned, we were gone to the Justices.</p>
               <p>After the prisoner had given this account of himself was he searched or not? - I do not know.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>When was it you went to Butler's house? - On Friday the 17th of January; Clark, Jealous and Macmanus were with me.</p>
               <p>Was he at home? - He was in the shop when we went in.</p>
               <p>What shop does he keep? - A clothes shop, sells ready made clothes; Clark told him we were come to search his house, and he stopped with the prisoner, while we proceeded up stairs; that is Jealous and me, I do not know whether Macmanus went up or not; in a bed room up two pair of stairs, a back room, I found a kind of step ladder, I then looked about, and I observed a trap door.</p>
               <p>Court. You had heard of this trap door before, had not you? - We were informed, my Lord, that there was a trap door, I went up through the ladder, into the cock lost, there I found this press fixed, it is a boarded lost.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Jealous go with you? - He followed me, this press was fixed upon a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260112"></xptr> bench, near to another trap door, which was almost at the further end of the cock lost, within about two yards of the further end; I believe it was that trap door that went upon the leads.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the press fixed in the cock lost? - Yes, within about two yards of the further end, there was the cutters in it, which are still, and every thing complete for cutting.</p>
               <p>Court. Pray, Sir, how was this press fixed? - It was fixed upon a bench, which was fixed by feet and stays into the ground, through the bench are these screws.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it was screwed into the bench? - The press was fixed on the bench by screws, and the legs of that bench fixed to the floor, the legs were nailed to the floor.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose they are obliged to have it quite tight? - Yes, my Lord, there were other stays besides the feet to keep it steady, it was the other trap door that gave us light.</p>
               <p>Court. So that when that trap door was fast, the cock loft was quite dark? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. But some light I suppose would come in from the other trap door? - No, my Lord, it shut very close, the first trap door; at the top of the first trap door that opened from the bed room, there were four iron bolts within side, one at each end, and one at each side.</p>
               <p>Had you a candle with you, when you went in? - The further trap door was a little open.</p>
               <p>Court. You have given a description of the manner, in which this bench was fixed, did it appear to have been fixed in that manner like a bench standing for some time? - No, my Lord, the legs of the bench, and the bench appeared to be new, or nearly new.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not mean to be understood, as if it was set up that day? - No, my Lord, but it appeared to be new work, but I do not apprehend it was set up that day.</p>
               <p>Court. As for that engine I suppose it is taken away presently? - In one minute, only unscrewing these two screws.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any other bed rooms in the house? - I only went into that.</p>
               <p>Do you know who slept in that room? - The prisoner and his wife.</p>
               <p>How do you know? - Their things were in it, and he said that he had lost his knee buckle, and sent his boy to look for it while we were there.</p>
               <p>What did you find there? - In the sieve that lay just by the cutter were these blanks, and this

             picked up was laying near the place, and upon the bench where this cutter was fixed, were these two other cutters, there were some dies, which I gave Mr. Clarke, which he said were of use for buttons, and I found some buttons, these four buttons.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. This was all you found in that appartment? - There were tools for putting them up, a hammer and nails.</p>
               <p>There were dies then in this room, that were calculated to be made use of for the making of buttons? - So Clarke told me.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing more? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. Where did you find these? - On the cock loft floor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. That instrument would equally serve with dies fixed for cutting buttons, as for cutting any thing else? - I think so.</p>
               <p>Court. How many buttons did you pick up there? - I found four.</p>
               <p>(Four buttons produced.)</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>You went to this house of Butler? - Yes, I did, I took the prisoner into custody, at his house, I think it was the 17th of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260113"></xptr> January, he was walking at the door, my information running, that there was a press up two pair of stairs, in a place that went out of his bed room, I took him up two pair of stairs into his bed room, and I searched him.</p>
               <p>What did you find on him? - Two shillings.</p>
               <p>Are they good or bad? - They are bad. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Did you make any observations on these shillings? - No, I did not, they are not cut out from such tools as these, they are cast.</p>
               <p>Have you seen all the other shillings? - I have not, (the shillings shewn to Clarke) these are all cast.</p>
               <p>Explain to us the use and nature of this machine. - This machine is generally used for cutting out round blanks of any sort by the force of this fly, and this screw working up and down, every time it moves up and down it forces out a round blank.</p>
               <p>Look at these. - These are called cutters, they put the metal between, and whenever that screw turns round, it forces out a piece of copper, or metal, or any thing else.</p>
               <p>Has that been used? - Yes, it has.</p>
               <p>Court. Which cutter do you speak of? They have both been used.</p>
               <p>What is the operation of cutting? - They are cut out into round blanks without impressions, and wherever they are cast, the impression is squeezed into the sand, and it leaves either the impression of the man's or the woman's head.</p>
               <p>Then in casting money that is not of any use? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>You say this machine may be used for an innocent purpose? - It is possible it may.</p>
               <p>Look at these four buttons. - Here are two that have been made by a button maker, and two that have not, these two have been made for a deception, they are not made by a button maker.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. But yet they appear to be buttons. - Yes, they do.</p>
               <p>You mean today, that the prisoner is not a good button maker.  - He may be learning.</p>
               <p>Court. That is, these two were made by a man that did not understand button making. - Not a doubt of it, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Prosecution. When they are made with a fly, how is it done then? - Then they are what they call blanks, without any impressions.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. That instrument would answer the purpose of a button maker, would not it? - It would.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. We have had many trials here, what has been the usual method that has appeared to the Court of making of silver? - The usual method of making silver has been by casting.</p>
               <p>Is there any other new way now?</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot ask him that, altho' whenever I have seen Mr. Clarke, I never heard him too forward.</p>

               <p>Look at that parcel. - The se are bad, the major part of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Of what metal are they made? - I cannot tell, that is a good one.</p>
               <p>Will that engine cut out blanks of metal, gold, silver or copper? - It will.</p>
               <p>Court to Clarke. What is the value of such a machine? - I should suppose about four guineas, or four guineas and an half.</p>
               <p>Court. It ought to be proved that this instrument was in the prisoner's possession criminally and knowingly; I do not conceive that the bare having that instrument in the house is criminal he must have it for a criminal purpose; therefore you must give evidence of the criminal intention; do not presume a man into high treason.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am entirely innocent of what is alledged to my charge; I took the silver one evening, a man bought a waistcoat and breeches; I took one guinea and an half in silver, and a guinea in gold; that was the silver I gave to the man. I thought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260114"></xptr> I could manufacture my own buttons cheaper by having this machine, than getting them ready done.</p>

               <p>Q. Like goods, of like quality and like mark, might be found in other shops? - A. There might, from our warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. A considerable number of loaves, marked in the same way, have got into circulation in the trade? - A. Certainly, previous to my taking stock, but not since.</p>

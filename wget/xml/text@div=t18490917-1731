                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Pither, who keeps the Duke's Head, at Bedfont. On Wednesday, 22d Aug., between one and two in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner there—he asked for twopenny worth of gin and a drop of cold water—I served him—he gave me a half-crown in payment—I gave him a shilling, two sixpences, and a fourpenny-piece in change—he stopped but a very few minutes after he got the change—I put the half-crown into a cup in the till in the bar—there was no other half-crown there—the prisoner was brought back again in about half-an-hour by Mr. Pither, the policeman, and another man—I gave the half-crown to the policeman before he went after the prisoner—it had been locked in the till and I had the key in my possession all the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the In-tellers Office, in the Bank of England. I have examined the half-crowns produced—there are four among those produced by Bray dated 1845, and ten of 1817—the one produced by Turner is dated 1845—they are all bad—I cannot positively say whether any of them were cast in the same mould with the one in question—they appear all to be made with the same metal, Britannia metal—I am not in the Mint—I am sent from the Bank—I cannot tell whether any of them have been cast in the same mould; I should think it would be impossible for any one to say—all I can say is that they are bad.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I positively deny the charge; on 22d Aug. I was going to Egham races; I had nearly 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—worth of silver in my pocket; I went into Pither's house for a drop of gin; I gave no half-crown at all, it was a shilling, and I received sixpence and a fourpenny-piece in change; whilst standing at the bar, a man came out of the tap-room for a pint of beer and was served by the mistress; he gave her some money and received some silver in change; I cannot positively swear what it was; I saw a shilling and sixpence perfectly; I then came out and proceeded along the road towards Egham; when I got about a mile and a half on the road, Mr. Pither came behind me, collared me, and charged me with having passed some bad money at his house, and about two minutes after the policeman came up and took me; I walked a few paces, when he returned back a short distance and picked up something; what it was I do not know; he returned and said he had picked up a bag, and accused me of having thrown it away; the man who was taken into custody at the same time I was, was not above five yards from me at the time in the custody of a butcher who had collared him by the policeman's order, on suspicion of passing bad money, and he was iden<lb></lb>tified as having passed a bad half-crown at another public-house; he was just as likely to throw away the bag as me; the policeman took my money from me, so that I have not been able to get counsel.</p>

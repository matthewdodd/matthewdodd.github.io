I am a gunner in the Royal Artillery, and servant to Captain Joseph Hanwell, who lives at Charlton—on 23d May I was at my master's house—I locked up between 10 and half-past—the house was made secure; the doors were locked, and the windows closed—I got up at half-past 5 next morning—I discovered that some persons had broken through the window of a small scullery at the back of the kitchen, and entered by forcing through the bars; the wire was all torn out—I found the wine<lb></lb>cellar door forced open, and some wine and spirits gone, and the drawers all ran sacked—I missed two coats and a vest, three pairs of Boots, a ham, and two handkerchiefs, the property of my master—the coats I was in the habit of wearing; these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them, and here is a Bottle which has the same mark on the cork as those in my master's cellar—a screwdriver was missing; this is it.</p>

About 7 o'clock on the morning of 24th May I received information of the Burglary, and about half-past 8 I saw the prisoner Johnson lying down in Union-street, Woolwich, drunk—that is about a mile or a mile and a half from the prosecutor's house—I raised him up, and then observed this pair of Boots in his coat pocket, and he had on this coat and hat, which have been produced—he was too drunk to be spoken to; when he came to himself, I asked how he came in possession of these things—he said he picked them up in the Charlton-road—in his trousers pocket I found a screwdriver and a Bottle of wine—in the course of the morning, Burgoyne was brought to the station—he was also drunk—he had on this coat and waistcoat—in his trousers pocket were two Bottles of gin, and in the coat pocket some Broken eggs—he said he picked them up coming from Chiselhurst—I took off the Boots which the prisoners were wearing, and compared them with some footmarks in the prosecutor's garden; they seemed to correspond—I put the Boots into the footmarks, and here is a nail on this one rather loose at the tip, and that could Be seen in the footmark; I am sure that impression was there before I put the Boot into it—I merely but the Boot in just to compare it; you could see the print of the other Boot in the garden Beds.</p>

Nothing was said about the footmarks on the first examination. The man-servant states that the entry was made by the scullery window. It is very strange that people should put up bars that people can get through. He does not speak to any peculiarity about the footmarks, but the policeman can. I think it is a got up concern by the policeman.</p>

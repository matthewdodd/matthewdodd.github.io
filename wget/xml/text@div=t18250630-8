I was in London in June, and lodged at the Mitre Inn, Mitre-street, near Duke-street, Aldgate. On Monday, the 6th of June, at rather more than half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I went through <placeName id="t18250630-8-crimeloc44">Whitechapel</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18250630-8-crimeloc44" type="placeName" value="Whitechapel"></interp>

I sat on the bed - she sat near me, and proposed that I should give her money; I said,</p>
               <p>"My dear young woman, you have brought me into such a place as I was never in before - I don't wish to stop, let me go;" she said she must have half-a-crown; I said, No, I would give her a shilling to let me go. She said she was not well herself, and not in a proper way, and would call up another woman; I said No: she opened the door, and called to the other prisoner by the name of Selly; she came: I was sitting on the bed - I had pulled off my top coat, and put it on the table. Groves came in in a very impudent way, and sat on my knee, and would not let me go; I said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake let me go - I will give you something:" my small clothes were unbuttoned when she came in; I said I did not wish to have her at all, and she must let me go; she said I had no money; I knocked against my pocket, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have a little copper;" she said,</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you have only a few halfpence." I was obliged to take out my purse, containing this money, to give her a shilling to get rid of her; I pulled out 2 s., but she would not take it; I put it back into my purse, and returned it to my pocket; and in less than two minutes she (Groves) put her hand into my pocket, and drew my purse out - I felt her do it: she gave me a blow across my stomach, and ran out across the other side of the way; Williams had run out just before, and said to her,</p>
               <p>"I leave the concern to you." Groves gave me a blow, and ran across the way; I caught up my top coat, and ran after her, but she was gone. When I came into the street a parcel of women pulled me about, one saying she was gone one way, and another the other; they both got off. A man shewed me the way to Whitechapel-office, where I saw Lea and Foster, and two days after I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300008"></xptr>them in custody - I am quite sure they are the women who were in the room with me, and who I have spoken of. I have found neither purse nor money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Where did you get all this money? A. From customers who I have sold goods to. I had twenty-six sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, a half-crown, four shillings, and a purse. I had been at the Mitre in the early part of the day, and was sober - I never drink. I was afraid to stop from the appearance of the place. I did not know when I met her that she would take me to such a low room; I looked into my purse while I was in the room; I took it out to give her a shilling; I had counted the money and put it into my purse a moment before I left home - I was going to a shopkeeper to buy goods.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner used no violence to you when she sat on your knee? A. She did not use me roughly; she pulled the money gently from my pocket; I felt it, and caught hold of her hand, but she got off with it; the money was not taken quietly from me, for I caught hold of her hand, and she forced it out.</p>
               <p>Q. From the short time you saw Groves may you not be mistaken in her person? A. I am sure I am not; it was near four o'clock when I got home after the robbery; I saw the clock in Whitechapel: I cannot say how long Groves was in the room - it lasted ten or twelve minutes before she came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate that she went into the room, and out of it in a moment? A. Williams called her up, and spoke to her in some strange language, and then said,</p>
               <p>"I leave the concern to you," and left the room, and shoved the door together; it was flash language. I heard her say as she shut the door,</p>
               <p>"I shall keep the coat for payment of the room."</p>

            . I am a watchman. I took Groves into custody on the 13th of June, in consequence of information from the officers - she denied the charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In what parish is the house in? A. Christ-church, Middlesex.</p>
               <p>WILLIAMS'S Defence. Foster and Lea can prove that I was acquitted before the Magistrate.* I was going on an errand in Whitechapel - he followed me home, and asked if he should come after me; I said very well, and he followed me up stairs, and asked what he was to give me; I said 2 s. 6 d. - he said he was poor, and offered me 1 s.; I differed with him, and at last said,</p>
               <p>"Well, give me the shilling;" he said he would not give it to me first: I said I would not stop with him unless he gave me the money first; he began to pull me about, and would not let me go; I said I would not stop with him, and finding I could not get away I said I was unwell, but he could have another young woman. I left, and never saw his money or purse. He told quite a different tale at the office.</p>
               <p>* The prisoner William had surrendered in Court to take her trial.</p>
               <p>JURY to SAMUEL COHEN. Q. Was Williams the first person who sat on your knee? A. No; she sat on my side, and the other on my knee. Williams unbuttoned my small-clothes.</p>

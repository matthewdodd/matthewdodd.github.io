I went into the dress boxes. I did not miss my property till ten minutes past twelve o'clock, when I got home. I have since seen the cheque in possession of the constable.</p>

            . I am cashier to Messrs Herries, Farqubar and Co. I have a cheque dated the 14th of April, made payable to the prosecutor. The prisoner presented<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182305140030"></xptr>it for payment, on the 15th of April, a little before ten o'clock. I asked him how he came by it; he said he had met a gentleman at the top of St. James-street, who told him he would give him 2 s. if he would go to the banker's and receive the money for it. I said we had received a letter from Mr. Blagrave, desiring the person who brought it should be detained, and I gave him in charge, I did not send to see if any body was waiting. He presented one of Mr. Blagrave's cards, and said the person told him to say the money was for that gentleman.</p>

            . I took charge of the prisoner; he said a gentleman employed him to get the cash for it. I asked where he was to meet the gentleman, he said at the corner of the street, and pointed to Ryder-street. I gave him an opportunity of finding the man, he would point nobody out. I asked how he had spent the evening before, he said he was at home, and in bed after ten o'clock, at No. 13, Calmell-buildings, and that he was at his former lodgings, in the early part of the evening, No. 13, Bennett's-court, Drury-lane, and went from there to Calmell-buildings. I went into Bennet's-court; they said they knew him, but had not seen him for six weeks. I found he did lodge at Calmell-buildings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the very day the gentleman lost his pocket-book, I was at work at the shop all day, and stopped at Mr. Horrigan's, Bennett's-court, at a christening. I went home about ten o'clock and went to bed before a quarter-past ten o'clock, and in the morning met a gentleman, who gave me 2 s. to receive the cheque, and said if they asked who sent me, I was to give the card.</p>

            . I live in Fleet-lane, and am a boot-maker. In April I lived in Calmell-buildings, on the first-floor. The prisoner lived in the same house, and slept in the same bed; he is a boot-maker, and worked for Mr. Hale, of New-street, Covent-garden; he came home at half-past ten o'clock, on the night he was accused of this, and went to bed, and staid there all night. I had been at home all the evening from four o'clock. I had been with him till three o'clock that afternoon, and left him at Horrigans.</p>

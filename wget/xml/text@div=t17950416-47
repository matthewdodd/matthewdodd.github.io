               <p>Q. Was it a broken pane before? - I am not certain, I see him take out a roll of goods, and put it under his arm; I then laid hold of him by the collar of his coat, and asked him what he was going to do with it? he struck me on my face a violent blow, he tried to extricate himself, he did extricate himself and ran away. I cried out stop thief, and he ran up the street; and I apprehended that he made his escape; I turned into Mr. Croft's shop, and told Mr. Croft's son what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man? - I saw the man, it is the prisoner at the bar; I am positive to his person.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it that time of night that you could see a person by the light of the lamps? - It was opposite the door where I took him.</p>

               <p>I was going up Fleet-street, on Saturday the 7th of March (I am servant to Mr. Liddiard, goldsmith and jeweller, in Paul's Church-yard) I heard a cry of stop thief! the prisoner Pope was about six yards before me; I never see him come past me; I immediately ran after him, and he dropped something by his left hand, down on the pavement; I had a parcel in my hand, I could not go very fast; I kept pursuing him, crying out stop thief! I pursued him across the street, till I came to Fetter-lane; he crossed just at St. Dunstan's Church; he was running towards Temple Bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when you first saw him? - About the middle of Fleet-street, near Anderton's Coffee House.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him? - No, I did not. I am positive the prisoner is the same man; he had his stocking down on his left leg; I was close to him when he was taken. When he was first taken he was in Brick-court; the patrol took him; two or three more set on the patrol with sticks and beat him unmercifully indeed. I heard one cry out, d-mn my eyes, where is my knife? I believe it was the prisoner, I am not very certain; they beat the patrol very much indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. How many patrols were there? - Only one. after that he got away again; he ran into Arundell-street, in the Strand, and there he was laid hold of again; I went up to him again; he was taken into the public house; I said that was the man that ran up Fleet-street; he said, how could I be so hard as to say he was the man?</p>
               <p>Q. You say he dropped something out of his left hand; can you say what it was like? - Like something rolled up very close together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what it was? - No, I did not; one part seemed to be rather longer than the other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. It was as high as Anderton's Coffee house where you first see him? - Yes, at the brush makers.</p>

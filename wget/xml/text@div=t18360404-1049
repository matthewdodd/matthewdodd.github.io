                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. I applied for a warrant for Phillip Cork and John Stuckey—I went to Cork's house, on Twickenham-common—I told him I wanted him on a charge of felony—I read my warrant to him—he said, "Why did you come at this late hour of the day—why did you not come in the morning?"—I was about to put the handcuffs on him—he said, "I will go without them"—I said, "You must have them on"—he then wanted to go into the next room for his jacket—I said his wife could get it—a constable who was with me gave it him—he seized this knife, and said the would not go, and he would stab the first man that come near him—I seized him by the collar and got him in the corner of the room—he kicked the other constable, and struck me—we got the handcuffs on one hand and took him—I went to get Stuckey—I could not find him—I returned to the lock-up place, and searched Cork—he said "You want another person, don't you?"—he said it was Channell—I looked him very bard in the face—he said, I am guilty—I mean to plead guilty before the magistrate'—I looked him up, and and left him.</p>

                  </hi>. I do not remember Channell coming to my house—I was absent from home during Easter week—on return the sergeant of the police called to say some information had come up which would lead to a discovery of the robbery on my premises—I felt great anxiety that it should be discovered, because of the number of depreda<lb></lb>tions from the same quarter—the police-constable came before me the day after, and told me this information had come to Mr. May that would lead to discovery—I mentioned the name of Channell as the person from whom it could be obtained—I heard nothing more till I heard that Channell had gone with him to the magistrate, and made depositions upon which the warrant was grated for Cork, and he was taken into custody—I attended the next morning before the magistrate—I believe Channell was set at large.</p>

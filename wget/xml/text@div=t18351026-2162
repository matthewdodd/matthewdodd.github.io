                  </hi>. I am inspector of the letter carriers—the prisoner was employed under the Post-office on the 18th of September, and had been so rather more than twelve months—he was employed in the inland-office, where the letters are received from the mails, to stamp a certain portion of them—I can only speak from report as to the table he was em<lb></lb>ployed at—but he was employed as a stamper of letters in the inland-office, and he was employed as assistant to deliver letters in Golden<lb></lb>square—as assistant to Walton, the letter carrier of that walk—on the morning of the 18th of September, at about out eight o'clock, I called the prisoner into my room after he had finished his stampling in the inland-office—the stamping was all over—I called him from the letter carrier's office, which is in a different room from the inland-office—when he came into my room, walton was there—I asked the prisoner if he had delivered any letter in Lisle-street the preceding day, and a letter in Golden-square to Desvignes—he said he had; that the letters I was ques<lb></lb>tioning him about had been mis-sorted to him—I then said to Walton in the prisoner's hearing, "You hear, Walton, he says you mis-sorted these letters to him"—Walton said he had not mis-sorted the letters to him—I then asked him if he had any letters about his person—he took out of his coat pocket a small book, and some papers, and, after looking over the book and papers hastily, he replaced them in his pocket—I then desired him to let me look over the papers and the book—he took them out of his pocket, and handed them over to me, and among them I found two letters—these are them—I found no other letters about him—one is directed to Miss King, No. 5, New-street, Covent-garden, London—the other to a Mrs. Rotherham, No. 28, Princes-street, Leices<lb></lb>ter-square</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183510260045"></xptr>
               <p>London—I asked him how he came by these letters—he made no reply—I then sent for the Post-office constable, and gave him in charge—when he was in charge of the constable, I repeated the question to him, "How did you come by these letters?"—he said, "I took them from the table in the inland-office, where I have been stamping"—neither of the letters are in the prisoner's delivery—it was no part of his duty to have them in his possession after he left the inland-office—I was present after<lb></lb>wards, when Miss King and Mrs. Rotherham opened the letters—the letters were taken to the solicitor of the Post-office—I saw them delivered to Miss King and Mrs. Rotherham, at Bow-street—I think it was by Mr. Peacock—I saw Miss King break the seal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is it in your department to superintend the mode of sorting or stamping the letters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was in consequence of a complaint made to me by Walton, that I sent for the prisoner—his com<lb></lb>plaint was, that he suspected he kept letters irregularly, for the purpose of getting the postage, not to steal the contents, and it was in consequence of that complaint that I put the questions to him about the letters in Lisle-street and Golden-square—one was directed to Mr. Gibson, of Lisle-street—I did not see that letter—I am not certain whether Walton stated what the postage on Gibson's letter was—there was no complaint at the Post-office that those two letters were not delivered—this letter is marked 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that means the postage; a double letter would not be marked so—the other is marked 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there are many places in Ireland for which single postage would be 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but there is no place in England where it would be 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there are some parts in Scotland—he did not pull the letters out of his pocket hastily, but looked them over hastily.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the inland-office at the Post-office. These two letters came to the Post-office on the 18th of Septem<lb></lb>ber last—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>) I know that by their both bearing the stamp of that morning—it was the prisoner's duty to stamp these two letters, he being second stamper at the E table—I have no doubt that these letters were stamped by the second stamper—the prisoner was at the E table in the inland-office that morning—there is the Bawtry penny post-stamp on this letter, directed to Mrs. Rotherham—that would be one penny in addition to the single postage—the word "Bewtry" is not very legible, but I know the letter came from Tickell—I know it must be the Bawtry stamp, as it came from Bawtry, but on looking at the stamp at the back, I know it came from one of forty post towns, of which Bawtry is one—that is the London stamp, which was put on by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But from any stamp on it, when it first came to the prisoner's hands, could he tell where it came from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He could not—it has been stamped in a solvently, careless manner—after the prisoner had stamped the letters he should have taken them to the sorting table, which was within a few yards of his table—there was no necessity for him to put them into his pocket—he had no business to take them into the letter-carrier's office—his duty was to take them from the E table to the sorting table, in the same room, and within a few yards of him.</p>

               <p>morning in the office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Every morning; it is performed with great despatch—he stamps the letters as fast as he can—his attention is not draws to the marks, whether they are plain or not—not the post-marks—his duty is simply to stamp them—one person sits directly opposite to him—there are two stampers on one side of the table and three on the other—there were three persons opposite to him nearly the whole time—it is impossi<lb></lb>ble to say for a minute—I see nothing in this eleven-penny letter to in<lb></lb>dicate that it was more than single—the stampers would not have an oppor<lb></lb>tunity of examining a letter to find the country mark as I have done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the prisoner's stamp? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The day of the month, and a private mark, "E 18 Sept. 1835," that was all the stamp he made—here is "Bawtry Penny-post" on it—that is charged for conveying the letter from Tickell to Bawtry, the postage from which is only 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—that was marked at Tickell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If his attention was called to the Bawtry mark, he would at once know it was a single letter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—a practical inland-officer could not be deceived into a belief that this was a double letter, but other persons in the post-office might, as there are many double letters which bear the tax of eleven-pence—the letters are separated on the table, paid and unpaid, and franks also, but not at the stampers' table; one pile is put on the stampers' table at a time—the stamper takes them himself from the other table—a clerk examines them, and stands them by the side of a small ridge—by accident paid letter might get mixed with the unpaid—it was the prisoner's duty only to carry the unpaid letters to the sor<lb></lb>ters' table—if paid letters were accidentally carried with the unpaid, they would be sent back; but I can scarcely see how it was possible for him to do that—it would be discovered by the examining clerk before it got to the prisoner's hands; and if he did carry them to the sorter's table, that sorter would carry it to the paid sorter—it has occasionally occurred in error, that a stamper, who should stamp unpaid letters, has stamped paid ones—they go from the sorters' table to other sorters to be re-sorted, and he told up—that is done in the inland-office.</p>

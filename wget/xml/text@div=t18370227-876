                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. George Boreham of Bomford, a straw-carter. I was returning home on Saturday evening the 11th of February, about half-past six o'clock—when I got into the lane I felt a blow as if somebody hit me on the shoulder—I looked up, and saw somebody running away with the reins—they had been on the fore-ladder of the cart—it was in taking the reins that he hit me on the shoulder—I took it to be this prisoner—I knew him before, and his name—I went to his house on the Sunday morning after, and asked him for them—he said he had not got them—I went to the constable, who went, and he gave them to him—these are them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the constable. Hale gave me information—I went to the prisoner's house, and asked for the reins—he said, "I have not got them," I said, "I am given to understand you have, if you do not give them me I shall look for them"—he went into his room—I followed him, and he gave me the reins.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition stated</hi>, "I went to the prisoner, and asked him if he had any reins belonging to George Boreham, he replied he had, but he was going to take them to Mr. Hale, the father of the witness George Hale, that evening.")</p>

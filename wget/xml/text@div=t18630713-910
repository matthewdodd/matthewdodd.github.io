                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mark Stubberfield, a stone sawyer, at Hastings—I am staying at 102, High-street, Shadwell—on 6th July, about 11 at night, I met the prisoner in the highway, St. George's-in-the-East—he asked me to give him a glass of ale—I took him to a neighbouring public-house, and gave him a pot of ale—we then went into another public-house, when we came out he wanted me to give him another glass—I said, no; I had no more money to spare—he said, he belonged to the north, and I said so did I—he ordered two glasses of ale—I would not pay for them—I said I would have no words, and I walked out and left it—at that time I had a half-crown, a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in a side pocket of my dress, and I had some coppers in my hand—the prisoner followed me out, and struck me a violent blow, the marks have not gone yet—he then struck me in the chest, and then caught me round the throat with his hands—he took the skin completely away; there is the mark now—I could not cry out—I thought I should choke every minute—he then took my money and knocked me down—he pulled the pocket of my dress right out, and tore out all the gathers—he then ran away, and I got up and ran after him shouting, "Police!" and "Stop, thief"—a constable came up; I gave him information, and told him the direction the prisoner had gone.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 278). On 11th June, I heard cries of police, and saw the prosecutrix—in consequence of what she told me, I went after the prisoner—I found him down Bell Wharf-stairs; the prosecutrix was with me—he was sitting under a barge on the beach—I searched him at the station, and found in his boot 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a half-crown, a penny, a halfpenny and farthing, a knife and a pocket-book.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). He broke my watch<lb></lb>guard right through, and when he struck me in the bosom he broke the glass—it is my husband's watch—I saw the guard in the prisoner's mouth; it was all over saliva when I pulled it from him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I have not a tooth in my head, and cannot bite a piece of bread; I never knew she had a watch. When I fell in with the young woman I had been having a pot of ale with a friend; she asked me to have a glass of ale, and I took her to a public, and called for a quart. Two men followed us into several houses. I gave her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and she wanted to run away, and leave me in the lurch. She said she could not take me to her sister's; she would take me to another house. I would not go, as I was afraid of the two men who were following us. I put the half-crown in my boot for safety; she had not a halfpenny.</p>

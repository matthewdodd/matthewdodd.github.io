               <p>What did you drink? - I think according to the account the landlord said the next day, we had four pots of beer: This past on till ten o'clock, I put my hand in my pocket, I had six guineas in a yellow purse and some silver, and I took out a shilling out of my purse to pay my reckoning; the man of the house said, he had some knowledge of my face, says he, Bennet, I recommend this man to see you safe home, you are a cripple, you have a dangerous way to go, says I, I know nothing of him, do you know him? he said yes: I live at the edge of St. George's-fields:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100070"></xptr> So the prisoner went with me to Smithfield, and there he all of a suddenst opped me, and took me by the throat and throttled me, and took my money, which was six guineas, and three shillings and sixpence in a canvas bag, by force of arms; he said,. if I made the least resistance in the world, I was a dead man: It was all the money I had in the world: I could pick the prisoner out in a field of ten thousand men: I did not know when I came into Court, and looked for him where he stood, as God is my judge.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was you drunk or sober?-I was as much in my senses as I am now in your presence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, then the prosecutor said to me, see me home, and at the corner of Smithfield I said, shall I put you in a coach, he said no, I will walk quietly by myself, I sent to Mr. Birkett, but he is not here.</p>

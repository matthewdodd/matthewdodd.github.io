               <p>Q. When you came to London there was Mr. Watt, you, and the prisoner. - A. No more than us three; captain Chulmney left us at Grantham; we all got out at the post office, Lombard-street. Mr. Watt and I, each got a porter to carry our luggage, he did not appear to have much luggage; he had a pair of small saddle bags, he took them under his arm and walked away, and I believe Mr. Watt accompained him; he said he was going to the west end of the town. Mr. Watt was going to the London coffee house.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you hear of the loss of this parcel. - A. About three weeks afterwards. I think within a week after that I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe at that time you did not know the name of the prisoner. - A. Oh no. When I met the prisoner, he was walking between the turnpike-gate at Battle bridge and Charles-street; I rode up to him, I asked him if he recollected me making the observation respecting the parcel I have stated; he said he did; I told him the parcel was lost, and that it contained money and bills to a large amount; that I had been called upon by Mr. Kensington, and I had given him what information I could upon it; I said if he would take the trouble the first time he went into the city to call upon them they would be obliged to him, and I should the same; he told me he should make it his business to call; I told him I had met Mr. Watt a few days before, Mr. Watt perfectly recollected the parcel; when I met him he promised also to call at Messrs. Kensington.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, sir, you did not see the prisoner again till you saw him in custody. - A No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You then recollected that he had been a travellar in the coach. - A. Perfectly I did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. If I understand you distinctly, there were five passengers altogether in the coach. - A. No, not more than four at one time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then altogether there were five. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Chulmney left you, you never saw the parcel at all. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is is not usual to change the coach. - A. Not between York and London.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you came to London, can you undertake to say the prisoner was left alone for a single moment. - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot undertake to say that at any given time the prisoner was alone. - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You cannot say whether the prisoner was left alone, in the course of the night you went to sleep - A. Of course if we can.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You never heard of a man stealing any thing if he was asleep. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Court. Now the objection arises. - You do not prove in the city of London the possession of a parcel that this man stole, because he is found in possession of part of the produce in the county of Kent; there is no evidence of the possession of the property in the city of London, though the prisoner will not go from the bar without strong suspicion. We are not to convict men of offences with our suspicions only; it is much better a guilty man to escape punishment than an innocent man to be found guilty. Gentlemen, this is a very suspicious case certainly, and whatever you and I in our private opinions may think of the prisoner, we cannot upon this evidence convict him. Where the life or the liberty of the subject is concerned, it is necessary the offence should be committed in the county. Property stolen in any any distant county being brought into another county, the felony continues with him; but here is no evidence at all of the property being seen in London; it is not seen by Mr. Rangham but in the country; the produce is not found in the possession of the prisoner in London. The property is stolen on the 13th of March, and negotiated on the 20th of March in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280012"></xptr>Derbyshire. There is strong suspicion against the prisoner, but this suspicion may be against an innocent person. There is no evidence that he had possession of it in this county.</p>

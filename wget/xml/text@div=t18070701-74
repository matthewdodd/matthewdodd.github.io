             Q. Are you servant to the Rose and Crown public house, Rosemary-lane. - A. Yes; on the 4th of June the prisoner at the bar and the prosecutor and his wife were sitting at one table; I saw the basket under the table where they were drinking their beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Who left the tap room first. - A. The man and his wife; the prisoner staid about a quarter of an hour after them; when she went away I asked her if the basket belonged to her, she told me it did; then she went away; I did not see what was in the basket. A few minutes afterwards Cooper came in, he looked under the table; I asked him what he wanted, he said a basket; I told him the prisoner had taken it away.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again. - A. On the Monday fortnight I went to the magistrate, I said that was the woman as soon as I saw her; I am sure she is the woman that was sitting with Cooper and his wife, and that took the basket away.</p>

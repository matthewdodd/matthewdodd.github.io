                  </hi>. I am waiter at the Cafe de L'Opera—on a Monday at the end of October, a person came in there for two bath buns—I cannot say whether it was the 31st—I saw him served by Elizabeth Ann Jones—he gave her a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—she gave him the change, and after he had gone she called my attention to it—it was bad—the prisoner is the person, I am quite sure—I saw him in the shop again on Friday, 23d December, and recognised him before he asked for anything—I kept a sharp watch on him—he asked for two bath buns and was served, and handed a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece in payment—directly he put it down I collared him, and said, "You nave been here before and I expected to see you again"—I asked for the crown piece, and he snatched it away from me and concealed it in his collar next his skin, I believe; but I had it long enough to see that it was bad—he said he had never been into the house before, and that he was a servant in the neighbourhood; he was without a hat on both occasions—a constable was sent for—the prisoner refused to be searched, and we fetched another policeman—he was put in a cab, and before he got seated, the policeman</p>

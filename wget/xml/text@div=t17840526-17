             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Saturday evening between six and seven, that man, the prisoner, returned from Moorfields, I said, give me the things and go no further, I then came in, I had some friends at tea, and while I was sitting I saw the shade of somebody, and heard the foot, and I asked Mr. Harris who is that, he answered me it is John; what should he go up for, says I; I have given him leave to clean a coat; says I, I was frightened last week with him; in ten minutes I saw the shade pass.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see the prisoner go up stairs? - I saw the prisoner on the Friday, I only saw the shade of him go out of the passage, I did not see him afterwards till the Monday morning; then when I came down I found my ear-ring, which led to the discovery, I found a garnet ear-ring upon the chair by the side of the drawers, which had been before in the purse, all the articles mentioned were in the purse, eighteen guineas, four half guineas, and a dollar, there were two ear-rings in the purse, one of which I found in the chair, that made me open the drawer where the purse was, it was my own purse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Did you go to church that morning? - I had not been out of the house, the next morning he was taken into custody, while I was waiting in the passage, he was at the back-door, he asked me the reason of all this, I said you shall soon know; I said John, you went up my stairs on Saturday night between the hours of seven and eight, he denied it; I said John do not say so, for the girl saw you, upon which he immediately made oath and said, it is a damned lie.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at that handkerchief which was found at the prisoner's lodgings? - This handkerchief I missed on the Thursday before, I made that handkerchief, here is the fellow of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Is it not what they call a French cambrick? - No, Sir, it is not.</p>
               <p>Are you a remakable good work-woman? - I have been reckoned so.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you can swear to the needle that made it; do you mean to swear to the shade? - No.</p>
               <p>I thought you might, they are usually hemmed round? - Not all.</p>
               <p>Where there is a selvage you do not hem them? - I always do.</p>
               <p>This was lost the Thursday before? - I am sure it was the Thursday, because it was the day of the wash.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the washerwoman's pocket when she went home? - No, Sir, I had no occasion, she had lived servant with me upwards of seven years.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted, that every body that has lived with you, or has any thing to do with you must be honest; whether she took it home with a bit of soap wrapped in it you cannot tell? - No.</p>
               <p>You are not angry with me I hope? - Not at all, Sir.</p>

               <p>I understand your master, that he had given him leave to fetch down that coat.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I took the prisoner to the watch-house, I attended for Mr. Newport to take the prisoners to prison, he remained there till six in the evening to be examined again, and he told me he had some money at home, says I, you cannot have any, says I, your lodgings have been searched; says he, I do not trust any body with my money; I went with him myself, and took another man with me, and he said he wanted to go down stairs, I went with him, and he sat there for some time; I said I cannot wait all day for you, and he came up and went out of the door again, without getting any money; says I, where is the money; he said, you will not give me time; I said I do not hinder you, so he hesitated some time, and then he said it is not worth contending; he said I have made away with some of it, and he went down again to the vault, and took it out of a hole in the wall, fifteen guineas in the purse, and gave it to me, (produces the purse and money) there were fifteen guineas in the purse, and four half guineas and a dollar; when I took him back again to his lodgings, he took it out of some mould that was in a bit of paper, he kicked it up with his foot, and the paper was all wet; I put the gold and the other money together, the dollar I kept; this is the same, this is the purse.</p>
               <p>Court to Harris. Is that purse yours? - It is not; I can identify the dollar, I have had it in my possession ever since the year 1780.</p>
               <p>Any particular mark? - Only rather thin and large.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no particular mark upon it? - Not that I know of, only being very much worn.</p>
               <p>Have you a dollar of the year 1773? - The date I do not know, but that dollar has been in my possession ever since the year 1780, which came with some other money to me from the country.</p>
               <p>There was no mark on the gold? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. It was in King Philip's reign I see, did you observe that before? - I do not know what reign it was in.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see a dollar before? - I have.</p>
               <p>Court to Harris. Will you swear that in that purse that was taken away, there was a dollar? - I positively will.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Harris. Will you swear the same? - I will.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>When I went to work on Monday morning, Mr. Harris stopped me, I was going up stairs as usual to get a cleaned coat to do off, and he stopped me; I did not get up stairs, he sent for a constable, and told me I was his prisoner; he would not tell me what he took me for; this man told me to produce the money, and I should get clear off, there should be nothing at all done to me, and this money that I have produced is my own, and I did it to get clear.</p>
               <p>Court to Blacketer. Did he describe what gold it was? - He said he had made away with part of it, and that he had thrown the trinkets over Black-friars Bridge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. What did you say to him, tell the whole. - I have told the whole.</p>
               <p>No, not quite, it is better for you to own it? - I did not tell him to do that.</p>
               <p>What did you tell him? - I never told him any thing, there was no promise upon my oath, I told him it was not in my power to shew him any favours, I said nothing more.</p>
               <p>What could induce a man, whom you knew nothing of, to give you his money? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you threaten him or frighten him? - No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Did you say the prosecutor would shew him any favour? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you find any of the trinkets? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Did you make any promises at all? - No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who all gave him a good character.</p>

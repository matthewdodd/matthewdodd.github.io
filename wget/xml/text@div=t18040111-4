             sworn. - About six o'clock on Saturday night, I saw the prisoners lurking about different shops, and looking in, till they came to the prosecutor's shop; they were watching the shop I suppose for half an hour; I saw the short man, Baker, try five or six times to go into the shop, by getting hold of part of the door, and peeping in, while the other prisoner was watching the door; I saw Devise running towards Aldgate church; I pursued him, took hold of his collar, and he threw the bellows down; he had a short struggle; we both fell; he got up first, and ran away; he ran about forty yards; I had my eye upon him the whole time, and then he was taken; I took him back, and he asked me to let him go; by that time a mob had collected; taking him along the prisoner, Baker, came up, and made enquiry what was the matter; I expected he came to make some resistance, and immediately seized him by the collar, and told the mob he was the confederate of the other; we then got him into an ironmonger's shop; the person who picked up the bellows is not here.</p>
               <p>Baker's defence. I saw a great number of people collected; I went to see what was the matter, and that gentleman laid hold of me</p>
               <p>Devise's defence. I heard the cry of, stop thief! I went to see what it was about, and this gentleman took me into custody.</p>
               <p>Adshead. When they were brought back, Devise offered to pay me for the bellows.</p>

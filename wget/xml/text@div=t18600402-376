                  </hi>. I am a waterman, and reside at Greenwich—the prisoner is my brother—On Saturday, 3d March, at noon, I went into the Union public-house at Greenwich; my brother came in a few minutes after me—on his entering the room I observed that he looked very pale, and from his former threats I began to think it was time for me to go out of the room; but before I had time to do so, or to finish my conversation with a gentleman who was there, my brother called for a glass of gin and water—I had previously called for a glass of stout; the two were brought in together; mine was put on the mantelpiece, my brother's was put into his hand—he drank part of it, and then aimed the glass at my head, and the rest fell out of the glass—he aimed it at my head with all his vengeance, as hard as he could, and inflicted two very heavy wounds on the upper part of my head—not a word had passed between us—I fell senseless, and when I recovered I was bleeding in the corner of the room—the landlady sent for a doctor.</p>

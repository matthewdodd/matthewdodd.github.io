On Monday, the 17th of March, about a quarter past ten o'clock at night, I went out of my room to the chandler's shop, to buy a candle - I returned in about five minutes; my room is the back garret. I pulled the street door to when I went out, but I do not know whether I shut it or not. When I came back I put the key in the key hole, and opened it. I went into the passage; I had no light. There was a man inside the door, who said,</p>
               <p>"Is that Mr. Leacy," I said it was - he asked if I was not going to force the law against him, for robbing me - I said, were it not that he had robbed me I would not. I know by the voice that it was the prisoner; he said he would give me more reason to do it, and rose his hand to strike me; I put up my two hands up to catch his, and I caught a knife in his hand - he drew it through my hand, and cut it. He struck at me with the knife, and cut me in the breast; I had hold of the knife all the time - he thrust it through my hand into my breast; it penetrated through my clothes, and the skin of my breast - he only struck me once; we caught each other, and struggled about. I ran to the stairs. I received a cut in the back part of my left hand in the struggle; I cannot say whether it was done by accident or not. Two women came down from the first floor, with a light in their hands; he then went out at the street door, taking the knife with him. The wound was not very deep in my breast - I had seen him two days before this affair; we had no quarrel. I suspected him of breaking open my box. I met him in Oxford-street, and told him so, and desired him to send me home what he had taken from me, or I would go before a Magistrate for a warrant - he told me not to bother him; this was all that passed. I did not see him again till I found him in the passage. I went to the watchman the night it happened. Both my hands were cut. I did not go to the doctor at all about it.</p>

We heard the door bang to, which made us go down, as it shook the house, it went with such violence. We both went down with a light, and saw him in a very bad state - there was a candle in his hat on the ground, he opened his bosom and shewed me a wound, which was bleeding at his breast and his hands also.</p>

On the night of the 17th of March, about half-past ten o'clock, we heard a scuffle in the passage and went down - the prosecutor's hat was laying on the ground and a new candle. The door was shut with such violence that it brought us down. I found the prosecutor in the passage; he opened his shirt and I saw a wound in his bosom and the blood running down.

            . I am a constable; I apprehended the prisoner on Tuesday the 18th of March. Leacy came to the office and produced the clothes he wore that day. Here is a mark on the shirt which the knife went through, and also on his jacket and apron.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating, that the prosecutor had run away from Ireland last summer; and in order to gain the affections of the prisoner's wife, had represented her as inconstant, in consequence of which the prisoner left her for six months, and found she was living with the prosecutor, and on going to demand her the prosecutor produced a spring bayonet, and threatened to run him through, and swore he would put an end to his life, and if his wife returned to him he would be her butcher. That upon her returning to live with the prisoner he detained her box, clothes, and some duplicates; it then went on to state as follows: -</p>
               <p>"he took his oath that if she would come and stop in the passage he would bring her box down. She went, he locked her in the privy, fetched his bayonet down, and swore he would take her life if she did not go up to his room, which she was obliged to do, and he kept there till six o'clock the next morning, with his spring bayonet drawn for fear she should scream. She told me this on the morning of the 15th, and I went to his room to correct him - found the door unlocked and brought the box away, it being mine - he went to swear a robbery against me, but could not make it out, and so he swore I way-laid him in the passage and stabbed him, and that he saw me by the light of the lamp, and there is no lamp near the door - this is a plot between him and my wife to take my life that they may live together."</p>

            . I live in Gee's-court, Oxford-street. The prisoner was in my room on the night this lad says he was stabbed; it was St. Patrick's-day - it was half-past ten or eleven o'clock when he left my room - he was drinking part of a gallon beer with his wife and child and my husband; he came in about eight o'clock - I know the time, as I am in the habit of carrying out milk and thought it time to go to bed - I usually go to bed between nine and ten o'clock, only we were merry making; his wife lodged with me when this happened, and he lodged with me twelve months ago. I live about two hundred yards from Gray-street; he lodged in Peter-street at the time.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

I was in George-street - I now know that is the name of the street - I asked the prisoner and some others, who were standing together in George-street, the way to Mr. Boyle's, a publican, who I was going to, and who lived in the neighbourhood; on my asking the prisoner the way, he said, if I turned down there, pointing to a turning, that Boyle's was close by; I was going away, and directly I moved the prisoner laid hold of my bag; he took hold of it by the end - I had the string of it twisted round my wrist; he tried to take it from me, and I collared him with my left hand - I then received a blow from one of the men who was with him; I was knocked down with sticks; the other men had sticks, but the prisoner had no stick; I received a blow on the head from a stick, which knocked me down; I still kept the prisoner - I did not let him go - I kept hold of the bag also; we got up together - I still held him, and at last I could not hold him any longer; he took the bag away: I called Watch, and Stop thief! and followed him till he was caught, and never lost sight of him; I do not know what became of the bag - I do not know what he did with it; there were from twelve to twenty men; I suppose I received about one hundred blows altogether, and had my hat cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was a good deal of struggling with you and the prisoner, and at last they got the better of you? A. Yes. I never lost sight of him, and swear positively he is the man - here is my hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Who has had the hat ever since? A. The officer - I gave it him two or three days afterwards, but I showed it the same night; the officer told me to take care of it - I was not drunk; I had been drinking certainly; I never saw the prisoner before to my knowledge - I knew Boyle before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not been to his house often before? A. No- about twice in my life; I will swear I have not been there more than three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not so drunk that you did not know the way? A. I did not know the neighbourhood - I might not go there above once in four years.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had one hundred blows - did you not have more? A. I might; I did not beat the prisoner - I was obliged to let him go; we caught him just by Boyle's, which is only round the corner, down the next street; I did not lose sight of him in turning the corner - I followed him, calling Stop thief!</p>
               <p>Q. Well, but you were surrounded by twelve or twenty men? A. Yes, but they let me go directly he got away: I swear I never lost sight of him from the time I was knocked down till he was secured; I never lost sight of him from the time the bag was taken; I did not see what he did with the bag: I looked at him, and when I caught him he had not got it; I do not know what he did with it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Although you had been drinking, had you all your faculties about you? A. I had - I was able to run after him.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was in this neighbourhood, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I sprung my rattle - I was in Buckeridge-street, at the end of Lawrence-lane; I came up after it was pretty well all over - I heard the cry of Stop thief! in Lawrence-lane; I made towards the spot, and found the prisoner struggling with Hussey, and a great crowd of people round him; he tore the prisoner's coat very much, and his own coat was torn also; I had seen the prisoner running, but the prosecutor took him before I got up to him - he was the first of those who were running, and was taken by the prosecutor just before I got up; there was a chase before that, and he had escaped from the watchman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not that before you got up? A. Yes; it was rather a hazey night. The prisoner was not in custody of a watchman when I came up; I did not see him ill-used; he said to me, "See how they have torn my coat;" he had nothing with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prosecutor appear much injured, and his hat cut? A. He had his hat cut, as it is now, and the prisoner's coat was torn.</p>

            . I keep a public-house in Church-street. I did not know that Hussey was coming to me; I was standing five doors from my own house in Church-street, and heard a watchman cry out Stop thief! I saw the prisoner running - he did not pass me; he came and hit me in the left breast, and turned me round; I put my arm out as I turned round, and caught him by the neck: the prosecutor and the watchman took hold of him almost at the same time; he asked me to let him go - he said, "For God's sake, let me go."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he had done nothing? A. No, he did not; I did not see Fagan.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not come up till after the prisoner was taken? A. No - but I understand the prisoner was rescued from the prosecutor; I have known the prosecutor since he was two years old - I do not suppose he had been to my house above three times.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Giles'. On Friday night, the 30th of November, I was in George-street, and heard a cry of Stop thief! several times; I ran up George-street, and met the prisoner coming up Ivy-street into George-street - I struck him with my stick, and told him to stop, for I knew him very well, and certainly would have him; but he ran up the street still - I followed - Boyle was coming up the street, and stopped him; he said, "I have got him;" Hussey came up - he took hold of him on one side, and I on the other; we took him towards the watch-house - he made a sudden pull back, and the mob rescued him from me; I sprung my rattle, and Fagan came up and took him; I knew him before very well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many people were running besides the prisoner? A. There was not one coming down Ivy-street - there were people coming down George-street, as if to meet him, but none were running in the same direction as the prisoner.</p>

            . I live at No. 68, New Compton-street, Soho, and am a journeyman bricklayer; I am always in employ - I work for Mr. Meux, the porter-brewer; I have been in his employ for six years, and am so now. I have seen the prisoner as I was going up and down the street, in my employ - I only know him by sight; I am not acquainted with him. I am allowed a pot of beer at the Two Brewers public-house, in George-street, every day; and on the 30th of November I saw the prosecutor, as I came out, on my way home, in Buckeridge-street - I first saw him at the bottom of Bainbridge-street; he appeared a little tipsy, from what he said to the beadle; I do not mean to say he was drunk; he went down towards Buckeridge-street, and I was going on my way home. I saw him stand in the middle of the street; he had a bag under his arm; I saw two or three young men by the gas-light, apparently about my own height, behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you tell how many young men were behind him? A. Two or three, according to what I could tell; I could not swear to their persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to tell whether the prisoner was one? A. Apparently not, by his height; the three men did not appear much taller than me; he is shorter than me.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened to the prosecutor? A. I suppose, by his singing out Stop thief! he lost his bag; I saw nothing done to him, for I stood at the corner, but he cried Stop thief! and they all ran up the street, and there was a flustration - I stood there, and saw them run down again.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether the prisoner was one of the persons running? A. I would not wish to take a false oath; he was not one of the three young men that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was not one of those who were behind the prosecutor when he had the bag? A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You swear distinctly to the prosecutor being there? A. Yes; I do not know his name; he was an entire stranger to me; I could not notice the three young men so as to swear to them; I had never seen them in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. There were only three congregated together? A. Two or three.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, when there was a cry of Stop thief! they all ran - did only the three men run? A. The street was all in confusion; I cannot tell who the others were: a great crowd joined in the run.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think there was a robbery committed? A. I was so struck I did not think of it. I go to have my pot of beer in George-street every night; I go this time of year a little after six o'clock. I never heard a cry of Stop thief! in George-street before; I was so struck I could not move - I do not know what a rescue is; I know nothing of their getting a man out of custody: I am not often in George-street in the day time. I have seen the prisoner when I came up and down the street, to our shed - I do not know how often I have seen him there, perhaps twice a day; I have frequently seen him in George-street: I neither saw nor heard the prosecutor ask the way to Boyle's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him ask any question? A. No; I saw him speaking to the street-keeper at the bottom of Bainbridge-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the three persons? A. This was in Buckeridge-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any persons running? A. When the prosecutor called Stop thief! people came out of their houses; I cannot tell who was running first: I will swear I did not see the prisoner in George-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he have been there without your seeing him? A. If he had been there he must have been in some house or other, for I am sure, if he had been there I must have known him.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw three people in the street, and people come out of their houses - must you not have seen all the persons in the street? A. Yes, two or three behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear there were not twenty? A. I only saw three behind.</p>
               <p>Q. In George-street? A. In Buckeridge-street, where the cry of Stop thief! was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard where the robbery was? A. It was in Buckeridge-street where I saw the three young men behind him, and he sung out Stop thief! one end of it comes into George-street; I saw no more than three behind him.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear there was not a mob of ten or twenty persons? A. My Lord, I cannot say, but I saw two or three behind him; I only say, by the gas-light, there were only two or three behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear, that at the corner of George-street, or where the robbery was done, that the prisoner was not one of them? A. He was not one of the two or three behind him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you distinctly see the two or three persons who were about the prosecutor when he had his bag? A. I saw two or three behind him, but to swear who took it I cannot.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the patrol, I was present at the fire at Mr. Nelson's, I saw the prisoner stand at the door at Mr. Nelson's, with three others, the adjoining house was then on fire, they went up stairs and I followed them to the fore room up two pair of stairs, I am sure the prisoner was one, it was between ten and eleven at night.</p>
               <p>Was there a candle? - There was a light from the flames, and I plainly perceived the prisoner, and I saw a sailor, that was in company with the prisoner take a poker and attempt to break open a lock, but they did not, the prisoner reached the poker to the sailor, the prisoner then went into the adjoining room, where there was a bed, and there stood a chest upon chest of drawers, and I saw them both, the prisoner and the sailor, break open the drawers, and I saw the prisoner take several things out, and put several things in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Where were the family at this time? - That I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you see any part of the family in that apartment? - I did not, I saw the prisoner put some of the things into his pocket, I could not see what sort of things they were, he took them out of the drawers, soon after I came down there was a great suffocation in the room, I told my partner, and soon after I saw the prisoner hanging out of the two pair of stairs window by his left hand, they are both front rooms, I suppose he might hang five minutes, and waving his right hand as if in distress, which excited the compassion of every one thereabouts, they supposed him to be one of the family.</p>
               <p>How did he come down? - He fell from there on the leads of the one pair of stairs over the private door of the house, and was assisted down from those leads which broke his fall, many people offered to assist him as one of the family, then he went in again at the same door that he first went in at, that was the private door, I did not hear him say any thing, he went up again to the same chamber, me and my partner followed him very close, he then came down stairs directly, we came after him close to his heels, we followed him, he went through the crowd into Surry-street, I followed him there and stopped him, I asked him where he was going to, he said he lived at Charing-cross, I said that was quite the contrary way, he was going from Charing-cross; I asked him what he had upon him, having seen him take the things before,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140045"></xptr> his pockets were pretty well loaded, he said what he had was his own property, I told him I doubted that, he said he was positive it was, I told him he should come down with me if he pleased, and I would take him to the officer of the night, he came very quietly, I delivered him to my partner and the constable of the night.</p>
               <p>Have you any sort of doubt that this is the man that you saw go into the apartment? - I have no doubt of it, because he was in my sight, I lost sight of him about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Councel. When this man came down you was not near him I believe? - Yes, I was at the door when the prisoner was taken off the leads.</p>
               <p>What was said at that time? - Nothing that I heard, there were a great many people about.</p>

               <p>Were there not a great many people assisting, and others telling them where to carry the things? - I did not hear any.</p>
               <p>Where did the people belonging to the goods carry them? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was not this man following somebody with goods? - There was not a creature going before him with goods.</p>
               <p>Why did not you take him into custody up stairs? - Because I thought it was better to take him as private as possible.</p>
               <p>How many people were at the door at that time? - I did not number them.</p>
               <p>Were not there a great many? - Yes, there were beyond a doubt, I never saw the prisoner with my eyes before, he went with me immediately, I heard nobody enquire where the goods were carried to; I did not hear whether he was hurt by his fall, some people compassionated him, as he appeared much hurt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did he pretend at all that he was carrying any thing away for the benefit of the sufferers? - He did say so at the watch-house, but in the street he said it was his own property, at the watch-house he could not tell the name of any one person in the house.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did you hear any conversation in the street? - No.</p>

               <p>Do you know where that was on the evening of the fire in the Strand? - It was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140046"></xptr> next to the drawer where these things were taken out, in the bed room, in the chest upon chest, I have not seen it very lately; these shoes appear to be the property of my mistress, her name is in the black shoes, I have no doubt of their being her property.</p>
               <p>Where were they kept on the night of the fire? - In the top drawer in the same chest, I do not know the stockings, they are not marked, she had some of that sort and some gloves of that sort, her name is not in the gloves, the silk skirt has my own mark on it.</p>
               <p>Court to Holmes. What do you take the value of that skirt to be? - Four shillings.</p>

               <p>I had no intention to take these things, I went up stairs into the two pair of stairs room certainly, I was coming home with my wife from over the water from my sister's to Charing-cross, and I called at a public-house in Devereux-court, which Mr. Davis, a neighbour, kept, that kept a public-house in St. Martin's-lane, just by where I live, I sent my wife home, and told her I would call in to see this Mr. Davis, I went and spoke to him, I had a pint of beer, he told me to go up stairs, and said there was a society above stairs, and if you go up stairs you may sit more comfortably, I went up stairs and had one pint of beer, and all of a sudden he came running into the room and said, there is a great fire just by, accordingly every body almost ran out of the room, and I unfortunately went among the rest.</p>
               <p>Court. How far is Davis's from the fire? - Davis's house is almost by St. Clement's church, accordingly I went to the fire, I had drank a little more than usual, I saw several people go into this house, and I went into the two pair of stairs, when I came in I saw that gentleman there, and several more people were in this bed room, the drawers were all laying about the floor, and them things, they went out, and there was a large round hat box laying on the ground, I took hold of it and I filled it full of things, when I had so done I went to lift it on my head, so then these things dropped, and one of my pockets was full of lemons, accordingly I stooped and picked them up, what they were I did not know till I saw them in the watch-house, I had rather a loose waistcoat on, and I put some things into my waistcoat bosom, and they dropped out again, and unfortunately I put them into my breeches, I came to the room door with the hat box on my head, I could see nobody and I called out are you all gone, nobody answered, I went to the room door and the door was shut, I pulled it open, as soon as I did so the smoke at that door dashed into my face, and I thought the whole place was in flames, I directly threw the hatbox off my head and ran to the window, and in my fright I did not take the things from about me, I hung with my hand by the window, at last I dropped on the leads, and from there into the street where the people caught hold of me; they asked me if I was hurt, I told them I thanked God, I did not feel myself much hurt, but I had some property about me, which had broke my fall, meaning the things in my breeches; I asked them where the goods were carried, that belonged to the house, and they said they did not know; I went into the house again, as far as the first pair of stairs, I never went up three stairs, there were a parcel of men standing there, I asked them where the goods were carried belonging to the house, some of them said into the next street; then I came out again, and the people gathered round me again, I told them I had some property about me, they told me the goods were gone into the next street; I went directly to the next street, and there were three girls standing at one door, whether the first second or third, I cannot say; and I went up to them, and said, does the goods come here, my girls, and one of them said no, no, they fell a laughing, and said lower down; then I came from that door, and there was a man to the best of my knowledge<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140047"></xptr> had something on his head; I was following him, and the patrol caught me, and asked me where I was going, says I, I am going to where the goods is carried, then he said I should go with him, for I had some property about me; I said, I have some property upon me, let me go and deliver that first; and he said, what property you took you shall deliver to me, I said, I would; I went along with him directly to the watch-house, I shewed him where the watch-house was, and when we got there, I told them I had some property about me, I went to give them the things and they took them away from me, then they searched me, the gentleman asked me my name, I told him and where I lived; if he had let me gone to the bottom of the street, he would have been convinced where I was going.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheriff Watson. I attended the fire, and the goods in general were carried into Surry-street; I put a party of the guards there, and after clearing away, I desired an officer to send a party more to keep those goods from being plundered.</p>

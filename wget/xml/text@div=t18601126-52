                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Henry Ernest, and another, wholesale druggists, of Old Swan-lane, Upper Thames-street—nobody sleeps on the premises—on 23d October, about 7 o'clock, I locked up the warehouse, and left everything safe—after locking it up, I as usual sent the key to Mr. Roach's house by the porter—about half-past 8 next morning I went to the premises, and found them in possession of the police—I found the safe had been opened by a key, and the contents wert scattered about the floor, as well as the contents of the cash-box—upon examining the stock a quantity of attar of roses was missing—I can't say the exact number of bottles, as it is not in my department, but to the value of about 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were in the safe when I left the evening before—the key of the safe was left in a desk in the counting house—that desk had been broken open, and the key was gone—the warehouse had been entered by a trap door in the roof—that was secured with a bolt—I should think it had been opened by a bar—it was forced open.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Ernest—the attar of roses was kept in the safe, and the key of it was kept in my desk—when I went there in the morning, I found the safe open, and I missed twenty bottles of attar of roses from the safe—they had been there the evening before—the value of them would be about 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw one of those bottles at the Mansion House—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I can swear to it—it would contain between two and three ounces, English weight—the value of it is between 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have one other of the bottles in my pocket—we sell them—I know this to be one of the twenty, because the twenty were bought in a</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you count exactly twenty on the 23d? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not count them on the 23d, but I know none had been taken out of the safe—I had counted them when I put them in the sale a few days before—none of them had been sold—other parties sell, but they do not take bottles from the safe, and the key of the safe was in my desk—I lock my desk up when I go out—I am the managing clerk, the head of the department—my master is very seldom there, and if he was there, he would not interfere—I never give up the key to him or any one else—the weight of the bottle is marked on the label—I know this to be one of the twenty bottles, by the label—I can describe the mark without looking at it—it is "P.O.A."—that is a mark put on at Smyrna, by those who export—that would only be put on in a particular lot—bottles are sent over to other persons besides my master, marked in the same way, but besides that mark, there is the number on the bottle, the gross weight, the tare, and the net weight, all of which agree with the invoice—I have looked at the invoice several times, to see whether the weight and number correspond with the bottle—the tare is the weight of the bottle, independent of the attar—that is marked on the label, and the number of drachms, in Turkish—that would be marked on all the bot<lb></lb>tles sent from Turkey, but I never saw a bottle marked exactly similar to this—the marks would agree, but not the weight and number—there is a separate number on each bottle—"58" is the number on this—that is put on for the purpose of identification—of course I could not swear that no other bottle would be marked "58," but it would be against all practice to do so—it would be very improbable—I have the invoice here, and there is only one No. 58 in it—it does not follow that there would be a number 58 in every case sent—they may begin with any number they like.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the town travellers to Messrs. Ernest—I see stock when it comes in—about twenty minutes past five, on 24th October, the night after the robbery, I called at the shop of Mr. Baldock, in Aylesbury-street—I called there in the usual course of business—I remained in the first instance, and then left the shop and went into the back parlour—I saw the prisoner come in and produce this bottle of attar of roses—it was then in its original case, this tin canister—I was then let out by the back premises, and made a communication to a friend to get a policeman while I walked up and down before the shop—I then went in after waiting for some minutes before the policeman arrived, and the bottle of attar of roses, now produced, was placed in my hands by Mr. Baldock, and I recognised the article, he asked me if was a judge of attar of roses—I said that I did not pretend to be a great judge, but I knew something about the article—he said "I am offered this at a certain price"—he did not name the price—I asked what price he was asked for it—he said he was asked 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce—that was in the presence of the prisoner—Mr. Baldock remarked that the quantity was too much for him to take, and that he knew I was in a</p>

               <p>position to get rid of any quantity of attar of roses at a price—I said, "Yes, I can do any quantity at a price"—I then said, "Who has offered it to you?"—he said, "This is the party"—I turned to the prisoner and said, "Well, have you got any more of this article, because I can't give you 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce for it, but I will buy it at a price; there shall be no mistake with regard to you or me—I do business on cash-payments—the fact is, I will take any quantity of it at a price"—I asked him if he had got any more—he said he had got five or six bottles more—I said, "As a matter of course you have got them with you, and they are equal to the sample you have produced to me"—he said he had not got them with him but could bring them in the course of a minute or two—I, not wishing to lose sight of the prisoner, said it did not matter, I would take a single bottle as sample of a lot—we then went farther into conversation, the question came to be about the weight; I asked him the weight, what he asked for the bottle of attar now produced—he said he should leave that to me; he did not know the weight—I remarked that I was not buyer and seller too, and that it was just probable he might turn up a week or two hence and say I had cheated him in the weight—I then said to Mr. Baldock, "If you will-be kind enough to find your Turkish weights, we will weigh this bottle"—Mr. Baldock searched for the weights for a few minutes and could not find them—we then said we would open the bottle and take the weight of the contents—in the first instance the gross weight of the bottle was taken, that is, the bottle and contents were put into the scales, then the bottle was emptied into a clean measure-glass and the weight of the empty bottle taken, which exactly corresponded with the net weight on the bottle—the gross weight of the bottle was three ounces and three quarters—I really forget the tare of the bottle, but it exactly corresponded with the mark on the label—at that time the bottle was full, it had not been opened—after this; my friend arrived with the policeman and the prisoner was given in charge—he then said a party round the corner had given it to him for sale—he remarked that Mr. Baldock had known him—he said he would go, and fetch the man who gave it him, if we would allow him to go by himself, but that it was not likely if the man saw him going with a policeman or with any disturbance about, that he would wait his coming.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

Ernest—before I went to Mr. Baldock's, I knew the marks upon the whole twenty bottles—it was upon seeing the P.C.A. on the bottle that I gave the prisoner in charge—I did not know the other marks until the invoice was compared with the bottle—the policeman came into the shop after the attar had been turned out of the original bottle—he was not there when the prisoner spoke about the weight of the attar—the prisoner agreed to let me have the lot for 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce.</p>

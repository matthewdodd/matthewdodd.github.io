               <p>Q. Did you go to see the prisoner. - A. Yes, I called there that evening, she sells things about the street, and lives in <placeName id="t18110220-39-crimeloc215">Grub Street</placeName>

               <p>Q. How could you lose your watch without knowing it. - A. Because she put her arm round my neck, I did not feel it go away, the watch was taken from my fob, the notes were in a little bag in this side pocket, the money was wrapped up in a dirty rag, and a silver shilling of George the Second.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take it. - A. No, but when I was coming away I searched, and found my property was gone, the officers searched her, they have got my watch, three dollars, and that new shilling which were found upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you drunk or sober. - A. I was rather the worse for liquor, but sensible, I knew what I did.</p>

As I was going by I saw this woman had the man round his neck, I was curious enough to see what she was doing off, I saw her draw the watch and put it in her bosom, I saw her take the bag out of his pocket, and shake it to the two women that were there, the windows were all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200030"></xptr>broken, I could see in, she was putting the man out, I insisted upon the man staying in until he had his property, I got a young man to stand at the door while I went and got the two officers.</p>

Mr. Gray came down stairs and said he had lost his property, when the officers came I told them to search me and my acquaintance, she pulled the watch from under her arm, and gave it to the officer, I saw three dollars in Mr. Gray's hand when he paid for the gin, they were taken out of the prisoner's pocket.</p>

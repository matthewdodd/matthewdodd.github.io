               <p>COURT. Q. Where had you been? A. To May-fair; I was coming across Curzon-street, and saw a man running across the road, and another ran to meet him - they met in the road, the tall one struck the other, and the hat-case was dropped, and it rolled towards the gutter - I really think the prisoner is not the tall one, and I do not think the other one was Wilson - they both ran off - the tall one had a long great-coat, but whether it was black, blue, or brown, I cannot tell, as the night was so foggy - I could not see two yards from me - I ran towards Park-lane, to near where the prisoner was caught - I lost sight of both the men - when I first saw the two men in the scuffle, my two sons were with me, and could see the men, but they could not run fast enough to keep up with me - to the best of my belief, neither the prisoner nor Wilson are the men- I saw the prisoner in the custody of Wise, within two or three minutes after I saw him run away - he ran down Audley-street, and then Stanhope-street - a man, who appeared like a groom, picked up the hat-case, he was not like Wilson - I was about twenty yards behind the short man, when he ran after the tall man - when the prisoner was taken the tall man was gone.</p>

Fourteen - I have heard the prisoner's name since then - I never saw him at my father's house - I saw a man run away, he was not so tall as the prisoner - he had a long coat on - Wilson is the man who ran after him - when I first saw him there was a bit of a bustle in the middle of the road - I saw the man drop the hat-case, it did not roll that I saw - Wilson took it up and ran down a mews - my father went on, and we went on after him - I lost sight of the tall man when he turned the corner.</p>

            . Q. Are you the person who had scuffle with some person in Curzon-street? A. Yes; he dropped the hat-case, then ran, and I pursued him - I did not lose sight of him for a moment - as he was going to turn round Stanhope-street, there was a family coming out of a house, and he turned across the road, and ran towards Stanhope-gate, and the policeman caught him - the prisoner is the man - there was no other tall man present.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you undertake to say there were no other men in the street? A. Not that I saw, except the servants - I will not say there were not.</p>
               <p>COURT to SAML. WISE. Q. When you took the prisoner, was he running? A. Yes, as fast as possible - I heard the cry of "Stop thief" two or three times - the moment I turned the prisoner round, Wilson came up - I saw no other men running, but some footmen who came up afterwards - Cliffen identified the prisoner as the man Wilson had scuffled with.</p>

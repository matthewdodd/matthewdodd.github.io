               <p>Q. Did you lose a quilt - A. Yes, on the 1st of June; I lost it out of my room. I had seen it half an hour before I lost it. I lost it between four and five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see it again - A. In about half an hour I saw it again in the prisoner's box in her room. She rented a room of me. I have a witness here that took it out of her box. Her box was not locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner in the house when you went out - A. No, she was not at home when I went out; she was at home when I came back. When I came home I saw her going out of my room. She put my quilt in her box; I saw one corner hanging out. I asked her for my quilt; she sat herself upon the box, and said I should not have it. She said she would stay a month in the room, and let me have nothing.</p>
               <p>- HUTCHINS. I am an officer. I produce the quilt. I took the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is my quilt; it is worth half a crown.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutrix knew I had pawned the quilt; I told her I had taken it out; she came into my room, and took every thing out of the room; she threw four or five pails of water over me, and drank with me after it. The quilt was not taken out of my box.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The prisoner threw water over me first; I did not drink with her afterwards.</p>

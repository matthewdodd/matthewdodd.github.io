On the night of the 24th of July, I met the prisoner near the Angel, public-house, and asked him to give me something to drink - he said he would, but he had nothing but a sovereign, and a half-crown, so I was not to call for any thing very high - we went to the Angel, but it was past the time, and they would not serve us; he went to my room - he called the girl of the house, and gave her half a crown to get drink - she brought him back 1 s. change; we drank a part of it. I then asked him, if he intended to stop all night - he said Yes; and he would give me a sovereign for the night. I asked him several times for it, but he did not give it to me. I said, if he would give me leave, I would go and get some supper. I put a shawl on, and went out of the room for about five or ten minutes; when I returned, I saw a drawer open, which had been shut when I went out, and some duplicates which had been in a little box in that drawer lying on the floor; there had been in that box a crown piece, a half crown, two shillings, and a sixpence I first picked up my duplicates, and then looked for the money, which was gone. The landlady found some duplicates under the pillow, and under the bed she found the box empty. I had seen the box safe a short time before; when I undressed myself I put the pins on the top of it, which is a pincushion. I had then opened the box, and saw the money all right; my landlady went down and brought up the watchman, who asked me if I would give the man in charge - I said I would; he said he was willing to go, but not till a watchman came to take him. I saw him searched, and a crown, a half-crown, three shillings, and a sixpence taken from him, which were in his left-hand trousers' pocket, and some halfpence in his coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you taken the box out to put the pins in the cushion? A. Yes; he said that if I wanted him searched a watchman should be sent for - I had named the money I had lost before I saw it taken out of his pocket - the landlady came up stairs - I asked him for the sovereign several times - I did not go out to get another woman to come and make this charge - I was taken, and searched about a felony, the next night, but it was not true - the man has found his property since - I never went by the name of Wood nor Young, nor any name but my own.</p>

            . I was fetched to No. 1, Collingwood-street, by the landlady - I went to the front room on the first floor, where I found the prisoner and the girl - she said she had lost a five shilling piece, a half crown, and three shillings and sixpence, from a box - the prisoner denied having taken it - he did not say what money he had about him - I asked him if he would let me search him - he said not till we got to the watch-house; he went very peaceably - I had hold of his left arm - they found a crown, a half crown, and three shillings and sixpence, in his left hand trousers' pocket, and some halfpence in his coat pocket - he had no sovereign - he appeared sober.</p>

            . I was night officer. I have brought the little box and the money. The prisoner gave no account of how much money he had. I particularly asked him if the girl had seen what money he had - he said No. I then said to the girl, "What money have you lost?" and she told me. I found a crown, a half crown, three shillings and sixpence, and some halfpence, in his pockets; and in his other trousers' pocket I found a small chain and three keys.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The major part of what has been said is false; this female accosted me, and asked me to treat her, which I told her I had not the least objection to. I put my hand into my pocket, and took out all the money I had, and gave half-a-crown to the servant, and the servant went to get some liquor. The prosecutrix drank some, and then went out of the room for about twenty minutes, and then she and two other females came up and accused me of the robbery.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK to SARAH BROWN. Q. Upon your oath did not this gentleman take the money out of his waistcoat pocket; and among that was a crown, a half-crown, and the silver? A. No, he did not. There was no other girl in the room - the girl who fetched the liquor came to the door - the landlady opened the street door, and I took the light from the foot of the stairs - he did not take any money out of his waistcoat pocket - he only took out the half crown, and I think that was from his trousers' pocket - I was not out of the room more than five minutes - the prisoner saw the box found under the bed, but he did not know that the landlady was gone for the watchman</p>
               <p>MR. WINCH. I am an attorney. The prisoner has been clerk to me about six months. On the Saturday night I had paid him the balance of his wages - he was to return me 12 s. on the Monday, as I am security for a suit of cloaths for him.</p>

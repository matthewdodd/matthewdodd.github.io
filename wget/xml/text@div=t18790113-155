I am butler in the service of Mr. Edward Tyler, of 29, Oxford Square—about 1 o'clock on the morning of the 4th December I was sleeping in Cambridge Mews—I was called up by the police, and found Keefe in their custody—I went to the police-station and charged him—I afterwards went to 29, Oxford Street—I searched the area there, and in it found this jemmy and two wooden wedges—there were marks on the area door where the jemmy had been used, and the wedges had been put into the door—the area gate was locked—I had left the house about 11.15—the area door had been tried from the bottom up to the lock in the centre, close against the doorpost—there were persons sleeping in the house that night, but not on the basement—the door had not been lately opened, but a portion of the bottom was cut away, and the stonework was chipped or broken away for several inches, as if from the use of one of these instruments—the area door opens outwards—it was strained and damaged, but not opened—it was forced, so that the screws of the lower bolt had given way.</p>

About 12 o'clock on Tuesday night, 3rd December, I was on duty in Oxford Square—in passing No. 29 I noticed some dirt on the area gate and footprints down the steps—I turned on my light, looked over the area railings, and saw the two prisoners on their hands and knees at the area door—I could see them both distinctly—I asked what they were doing there—one of them replied, "We were gaffing for some beer, and we dropped half-a-crown down the area, and we had gone down to look for it"—I said, "Shall I come down and help you look for it?"—one of them replied, "Oh no, not now, some other time will do"—they then ascended the area steps, and climbed over the gate into the square—I had my bull's-eye upon them all the time until they were ascending the area steps, then I turned it off; when they got over the railings I secured them both—we had a struggle; I found that the two of them were rather too much for me, I let Wyatt go, and secured Keefe, and took him to the station—I was struggling with them, I should think, about 5 minutes—Wyatt ran away—I searched Keefe at the station—I there saw six or eight persons, and out of them I identified Wyatt—I have not the least doubt of his being the man.</p>

               <p>400 yards from Oxford Square—I met the two prisoners there—Wyatt asked me for a light—I turned my lamp on, and he turned round and walked away sharply; he did not wait for the light—I saw the two prisoners again between 11.20 and 11.30 in Burwood Place, Edgware Road, near to Oxford Square and Cambridge Street—I have no doubt about their identity—in the morning I went with Thurston to examine the area door—I found this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> concealed among the flower-pots with one of the wedges.</p>

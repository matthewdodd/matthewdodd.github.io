                  </hi>. I am the wife of Timothy Halloran—I live in Westminster, and occupy a small house containing two rooms—one down stairs and the other up stairs—I don't know whether the prisoner is a married woman separated from her husband—they took my room as a married couple—the prisoner occupied the room alone, she was to pay 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week for it—I had a black gown hanging behind the door and I missed it—I asked the prisoner what she had done with it—she said she took it and pawned it, and she would bring it home—I afterwards missed my hus<lb></lb>band's trowsers—I charged her with them, and she said she pawned them; some time after I went to a box where I keep sheets and other things—I missed a sheet, and I told the prisoner she was taking everything I had got, and I would see further about it—I said she robbed me of everything I had, and I would give her in charge—she said, "Will you give me in charge?" I said, "I will,"—she said she would prevent my telling the police—I sat by the fire, and she knocked my head against the grate, and then drew a knife across my neck—she was behind me, and I felt something drawn across my neck—a knife lay on the table, a small worn out knife, with a piece of wire on the handle; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>) After I felt this drawn across my throat, I felt the blood—the prisoner ran away as fast as she could—she threw the knife behind the door—I said, "Stop her I stop her!"—the policeman came up—the prisoner hid herself, and the policeman brought her out—I was taken to the hospital—my neck is getting well.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Westminster hospital—the prosecutrix was brought to the hospital—I found on the left side of her throat, a wound about two inches long, and about an eighth of an inch deep—it exposed a main artery, but the artery was not out—it is very probable such a knife as this might have caused the wound—she was under my care about ten days—the wound itself was slight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If a person were going to cut their own throat, they would cut from left to right? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In general they do, unless they are left-handed—I could not say positively, but I think it was from left to right, because there were a few scratches by the side of it, but I could not say positively—it could not so well have been done by a person standing on the left side—but if it were cut from behind it might.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a person intending to inflict a wound had drawn that knife violently across the throat, would it have been a heavier wound than this was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would depend on how it was done—I have known many a per<lb></lb>son cut another, and cut as lightly as this, but not on the throat—it is improbable that such a wound could have been inflicted by a person on the left side, if the person were right-handed.</p>

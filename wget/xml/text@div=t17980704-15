               <p>JOHN SHEPHERD, clerk, sworn. - On Friday morning, the 8th of June, I lost a copper, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040013"></xptr>might have seen it two or three days before, it was set in brick and mortar, as coppers are generally set; it was not missed till six or seven o'clock in the morning; I had been up the night before as I usually am, reading or writing, till one o'clock in the morning. I found one half of the circle of the brick-work knocked down upon the floor.</p>
               <p>CHRISTOPHER CRIDLAND sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Bow-street: On the 8th of last month, between nine and ten at night, I was going upon duty down the Uxbridge-road, and under the wall, going to Bayswater, I saw the prisoner with a sack on his head, which contained this copper,(producing it); I asked him how he came by it, and he said he found it. I took him to the watch-house, and finding that Mr. Shepherd had lost a copper, I desired him to come down to the office.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Shepherd). Is there any road from your house to Bayswater? - A. Yes, the commonest road in the world, infested by thieves every evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that copper? - A. This copper very much resembles mine, I cannot be physically certain, but I believe it to be mine; I sent for a builder, who measured the diameter of the copper and the diameter of the circle, and they corresponded, it was formerly a brewing copper, but has been lately used as a washing copper; the bottom of it was convex instead of concave, but I cannot say whether the convexity of this copper may not have been occasioned by the bruises it has received; there is also an incrustation round the bottom, occasioned by a sediment left from the washing; there was a sheet of lead at the upper part, which went down on the inside an inch, or rather more, and either the cement or the lead had left a little whiteness on the copper, and there is something of that kind upon it now; but that white mark appeared stronger than any white mark that I perceive here.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Shepherd, I have lived with him some years. I described the copper at Bow-street, that I should know it by the rising in the middle, and some dirt round the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember to have seen that dirt after the last time of using it? - A. Yes; it was occasioned by the last time of using it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that copper? - A. I see the same marks very plain.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the appearance so singular as to enable you to swear to it? - A. Yes; and there is a white mark round the top, by which I know it to be my master's.</p>

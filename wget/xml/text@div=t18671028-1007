                  </hi> I live at 142, Bermondsey Street, and am a hatmaker—Taylor is my son—he had not been living with mo for some weeks—I know Dowler—my boy left my house through him—on the night of 28rd September I was the last person about, and went to bed about half-past eleven—the premises were all secure, both front and back—about five next morning a constable awoke me—I went down stairs, and found front and back doors open—some one had got in through the wash-house</p>

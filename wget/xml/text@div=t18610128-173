I am a book-binder in partnership with my father, at 76, Fleet-street—the prisoner has been in our service as carman for about twelvemonths or a little more—on 15th October, he was employed to take some book covers to Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a stationer at 346, Oxford-street—on 15th October, twenty book covers were brought to me from Messrs. Bone, I believe by the prisoner, I am not certain of the person—he brought as invoice—I paid him, and he wrote a receipt—this is the invoice so receipted—I afterwards paid the same person, I believe, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had an invoice on that occasion—the person came the following day for the money and receipted the invoice.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. When Mr. Bone spoke to me about this money, I told him I had made use of it, and had been trying to obtain a loan to repay it; he said if I would acknowledge it as a debt, he would not punish me; he afterwards gave me into custody.</p>

When I had walked about fifty or sixty yards from them, I was seised by a man and four or five women; I struggled to get away, upon which the man struck me two blows with a stick upon my legs, which lamed me; my right leg is not well yet; the man then seised me and pinioned my arms, and held me against the wall, and the women supported him on each side. I cried out loud thieves! several times; the prisoner Creamer seised me by the collar with one hand, and struck me two or three times in the face with the other; she said if I made any more noise she would see my liver, while I was thus pinioned, one of the women put her hand into my right-hand breeches pocket, and from thence took two guineas and nine shillings. Others of them,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150004"></xptr> but which I cannot pretend to say, put their hands into my coat pocket and took out a handkerchief, a three-foot rule, and a pocket-book; then they took off my hat and wig, and dispersed. I saw Creamer (to whom I positively swear) go over the way to the sign of the Sun and Sword; I went over and begged her to give me my hat and wig. She made use of very vile expressions, and told me I must go to the thieves who robbed me. I look upon it Creamer had the hat and wig, but I cannot swear to that; I went on some little way but came back. When I saw her go into the house, I knocked at the door and begged for my hat and wig; she again answered me in the same manner without opening the door. I then told her I would spare no pains to find her on the morrow. The night of the same day I found out one Israels, an officer, to whom I told the story, and he took up some of the prisoners (I believe) that night; he told me to come the next morning; I accordingly went at about nine o'clock the next morning, which was the Monday, and he had then got all the prisoners in custody.</p>
               <p>What kind of night was it? - Darkish, I could not distinguish any of them, so as to be positive to them, except

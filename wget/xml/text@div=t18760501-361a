My husband keeps the Archduke at Walworth—on 18th April I served the prisoner with half-pint of ale; he gave me a shilling—I put it in the till by itself because I noticed the way he gave it to me—I was examining it—I expected my husband to come in a minute—I gave the prisoner 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze, and went on serving customers—the prisoner then asked me for a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. cigar and gave me another 1s; I kept it in my hand and gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I took it to my husband in the parlour and found it was bad—I then went to the till and took the other 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out, and that was bad also; I gave it to my husband—the prisoner made a mistake and went out at the back gate, he found he could not get out that way, came back and went out—my husband went after him and he was taken in custody.</p>

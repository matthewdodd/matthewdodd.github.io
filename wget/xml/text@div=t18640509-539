I am a seaman, of 2, Devonport-street, Commer-cial-road—on 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi> April, I was coming along the Back-road, and the prisoner invited me to take some ale—I went out without waiting to drink it, and afterwards met the prisoner—he said, "You are a d——stinking liar"—I said I never was that in my life—he said—"You are, and I can prove it"—I had only had two or three words with him above an hour before, about drinking, when he told me that I would not pay my share—he offered to fight me—we had one or two rounds, and then he made one or two cuts at me—my coat was cut in several places—I had a cut on my left side, and a small cut here—I have been ill, and am still in the hospital—he cut me with a small spring-backed knife, which, I believe, he threw away—we had been drinking a drop, but neither of us was the worse for it.</p>

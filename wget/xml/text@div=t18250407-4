He told me he wanted a few shillings, and to get it for him upon that bundle. I said I would not, but I would take it home or any where else he chose. I took it home and gave it to a man, named Butler, next morning, to get whatever the prisoner wanted on it. Butler brought me 1 l. and a duplicate - I gave the prisoner the money on Monday morning, when he called; I offered him the ticket - he said he should take the articles out in a day or two, and desired that the duplicate might remain on my mantle-piece. I did not shew it to him - I did not know what was in the bundle. (Looking at a duplicate) this is it.</p>

            . I am a constable of Marlborough-street. On the 24th of March I was fetched to Kirkham's hotel - the prisoner was out - he came in and was shewn into Mr. Unwin's room, and charged with stealing a cloak, which he denied; he at first refused to tell where he lodged, and then said he could not recollect. I took him to the office, and on the road he asked me to go to his lodging, as he wanted me to advise with him; I said I could not - it was for him to do as he pleased about saying any thing of the cloak. He repeatedly asked me to go to his lodging - I at last went; he asked if I should search his wife - I said certainly. When we got to the watch-house he again asked me to go; I said</p>
               <p>"Is the cloak or ticket there?" he said no, but he thought there was a clue that I could get it by. I then accompanied him to his lodging in Adam-street, West, where I found the witness Fennen in bed. The prisoner asked him what he had done with the cloak he gave him; he said</p>
               <p>"What cloak? I have had no cloak of yours." The prisoner said</p>
               <p>"Did you not tell me you had pawned it just by here - I gave it you in the bundle you were to take to my wife." Fennen acknowledged receiving the bundle, and said he took it to his wife, and then that he gave it to another person to take to her. I asked Fennen if he had any duplicates; he said no; I searched his room and found three in a portmanteau, one of which was for the cloak; he then said he had given it to another person to pawn, who brought him the ticket and money, but he gave the money to the prisoner, which he did not deny, but said he had taken the cloak as he was distressed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was his wife there? A. No, she is in service; he spoke of two children - I never heard that he had six.</p>

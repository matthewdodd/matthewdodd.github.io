I had two seven-shilling pieces in the morning; I took and put it in that pocket where I had gold; I had two guineas, four half-guineas, two crown pieces, and six seven-shilling pieces, exclusive of the two I put in on Sunday morning; that was all the money; no silver, excepting the two crown pieces; I wanted to put the money together; the prisoners at the bar, the wife and the husband, were both up, and I put the money out of one purse into the other to make it safe; and the wife, who is a prisoner at the bar, advised me to put the money in a safe place, and not to have it about me, but there was no box or chest in the place that had a lock to it, but the room door; I made to a cupboard, and took out the purse that I had put the two seven-shilling pieces in; I do not know they saw me, if they had had a mind they might; and making over to my wallet, and taking my purse, I put the purse into a pair of gloves, and folded both gloves together; and there was a shirt, saving your presence, I put it into the middle of that shirt, and made a ball of it with two pocket handkerchiefs; I asked the woman where I should put it; with that I put it over the cupboard in the room where we lay.</p>

             sworn. - As I was going upon duty at ten o'clock, this man was waiting for an officer at the watch-house; he said he had been robbed of seven guineas; I went and took the man and his wife to the watch-house; I found on the man a one-pound note, one guinea, and two seven-shilling pieces; when I took them before the Magistrate, he ordered me to give them the pound note for them to subsist upon; I have the guinea and the two seven-shilling pieces; when we found the bundle, I found there was something pledged that evening; they had pledged a coat and waistcoat; it is a very unlikely thing that they had got his money.</p>

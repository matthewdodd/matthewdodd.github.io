             lately in possession of a sloop called the Stephens - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any message you received did you see the prisoner at the bar on the 2d of January last - A. Yes, at 51, <placeName id="t18120513-47-crimeloc272">Great Hermitage-street</placeName>

I asked the prisoner, if he had been enquiring about a vessel that was to be sold of the name of Stephens: the prisoner, answered, yes. I told him, the price was an hundred and sixty pounds. He said he could hardly tell how to act, as it was chiefly upon his father's account that he wanted to purchase a vessel of that description. He said, his father was not in town; his country-house was at the forest; but I was to take a bill of four or five months. I told him I could not give an answer to that until I saw Mr. Haley, who was a part owner with me. He said, very well; he should see his father that evening, and if I would call the next day he would give me an answer. On Saturday, the 4th of January, I saw him again. Mr. Francis asked me if I had agreed with my partner about taking a bill. I told him, yes; but not for a longer date than three months. He asked me, if I knew Mr. Parker of the Tower Dock. He said, he would go with me to Mr. Parker, to have the ship papers transferred: and when we came to Mr. Parker's he told Mr. Parker to transfer the papers as soon as possible, as he was going out of town, and must have them that evening. Mr. Parker appointed four or five o'clock for all parties to be at his house. We met there between five and six o'clock. Mr. Parker filled up the new bill of sale; and, after we had read the particulars of the transfer, the prisoner took out of his pocket-book a bill, and putting it on the table, saying, I must get one of you, gentlemen, to sign this bill. It was ready drawed, and accepted. This is the bill. Mr. Haley then put his name to it. The bill was then delivered over to me, for the pay of the sloop Stephens; and when the bill became due I found no such a house as Francis and Son's, when I went to get the bill discounted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry. When you presented the bill you knew he was in custody - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to 51, Great Hermitage-street - A. I did. There was no such persons there.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, after he had given you this bill. he was in custody upon other frauds, and being in custody he was detained upon your charge, before the bill became due.</p>

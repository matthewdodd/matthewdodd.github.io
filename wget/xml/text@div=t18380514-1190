The prisoner was employed as clerk and publisher to the firm at a salary—among other things, it was his duty to receive money for advertisements, and all monies that came to the office, and to put it down in his regular book—he was to account to me every day, or at any moment that he might be required to do so.</p>

               <p>was present, also the locksmith, and this gentleman—there might have been another female for aught I know, I am not certain—we have not received 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I suppose we have received in the whole 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the debt that was embezzled from the Stamp-office—I have received a transfer of debts from him—that was for the papers—he paid me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we received some money from Mr. Medcalf, and there may be another—I did not owe the prisoner's father 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we thought there might be a balance due to the father, but we have found since that 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and perhaps 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., would not set us to rights—he made out a statement of money due to his father, and we expected it might be right, but we find his father has re<lb></lb>ceived sums of money in conjunction with himself—I have no recollection of deducting 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due from our firm for paper.</p>

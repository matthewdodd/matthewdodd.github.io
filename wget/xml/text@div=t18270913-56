On the 8th of August, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came into my shop, and gave an order into my hands, which I produce; it was addressed to me, and my son, who had been in partnership with me but was then dead - I handed the order over to Bell, my shopman, and desired him to let him have the goods to which it applied; about eight o'clock the next evening he came and presented another order, for a better brooch and diamond pin; this excited my suspicion, and I said he could not have the goods that night, I would send them down in the morning to his employer; he told me he came from Darby and Co., of Fenchurch-street, whom I do business with; he took that order away, and said he would call in the morning - I saw him again next morning. On the 10th, he brought a third order; I was called down, and looked at it; he returned one of the brooches and pins, and wanted a better brooch and a diamond pin for them - I said, "You d-d rascal you have come again to swindle me;" he made no reply, but cried, "Oh! Mr. Young," and made a bolt or two, to get away (Orders read).</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Young - the prisoner came to the shop on the 8th of August; Mr. Young handed me the order - I went into the warehouse to look the goods out, and laid on the counter two gold brooches, and a paste pin - Mr. Young said, "Should you like to take another brooch?" he said Yes, as it was for a customer of Mr. Darby's, a lady at the west-end of the town, and that he would take another pin; they were delivered to him - he took all four away together, they were worth 53s. On the 10th of August, about ten o'clock in the morning, he came again, and put this order into my hand - I made an excuse that I had not got the key of the jewellery; and said to the boy, "Go, and tell Mr. Young he is wanted." Mr. Young came down, and spoke to him; I was not present at first - when I came into the shop again, I saw Mr. Young come out with a drawn sword, and call him a d-d swindler; he was secured - my master said he would use the sword if he attempted to move. He only got the first goods. I produce the order he delivered to me - (order read).</p>

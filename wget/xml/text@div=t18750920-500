                  </hi>. I am now a licensed victualler and keep the Crown public-house in Crown Street, Soho—I was employed by Mr. Sanderson as cellarman from about March, 1871, to the 8th September, 1873—I was sometimes engaged in attending to the wines underneath the house 131, Pavilion Road; they were ports and sherries in casks—the means of access to the cellar was by a flap from the Pavilion Road—when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187509200039"></xptr>
               <p>I first went there there were no means of warming the cellar at all—we always used candles—the cellar was dark—there was a door in it, but it was never used—it could not be used because the large casks were put against it—I remember the beehive apparatus coming to the hotel—I believe Mr. Sanderson was there at the time in the trap; I am not quite positive—the ring with the fish tail burners and the iron pan was brought with the beehive, but not the india-rubber tubing—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced.</hi>) to be the same pan, but I don't think this earthenware beehive is the same, it was a larger one that was there before—the rim used to fit outside on to the feet of the stand—Mr. Sanderson told me to go to the shop of a man named Attridge to get a man to have the piping fixed—he did not tell me on that occasion for what purpose he wanted it fixed, but sometime before he said we were going to have something to warm the cellar with—some short time after I went to Attridge's the apparatus was put up in the cellar and fixed—this 3/4—inch tap at the end of the tube was made by some<lb></lb>body at Attridge's shop—I had nothing to do with fixing it on—it was fixed to a large pipe in the cellar—I was not aware that the pipe commu<lb></lb>nicated directly with the main without any meter—I went into Mr. San<lb></lb>derson's service in March and I think it was somewhere about October that this happened; I can't say, it is five years ago—a thermometer was pro—vided—after the apparatus was fixed Mr. Sanderson instructed me always to keep the pan filled with water when the gas was alight—before it was fixed I went to the cellar say once a fortnight and after it was fixed I went every day if the machine was alight—it was not always kept burning in the winter, it would depend entirely upon the weather—if it was very cold it would be burning all day, we only wanted the cellar at a certain temp<lb></lb>erature—it was turned off at this thumb tap, that is the only place I turned it off—I should turn it down to regulate the heat—in very cold weather it would be left burning all day and all night if necessary—the pan was always kept filled with water in my time—when the beehive was over the fishtail burners you could not see the light from a great distance—the pan stood on the floor of the cellar—I may be wrong in saying this is not the same beehive, very likely it is the same with the rim broken off—the apparatus was only used in cold weather to regulate the temperature—it could be moved about and put in any part of the cellar—there were 17 feet of tubing and that would reach to any part of the cellar—I bottled wine and did the ordinary cellarman's duty in the cellar—the prisoner was generally there when I was there—he came round once in the day at all events—I had nothing to do with the gas in the hotel part of the premises, it was regulated in the bar and I had nothing to do inside the bar—I could—not say whether the gas in the hotel was turned off at night, I did not sleep on the premises—the place next to the two open courts was used as a harness room in my time—that was lighted with gas—the gas in the harness room in my time was at the end nearest the cellar as it is now—the flap of the cellar in Pavilion Road was padlocked at night when we were done, it was fastened with a padlock and key—the flap was easily removed when we went down—I never had any serious trouble with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This apparatus was used by Mr. Sanderson solely for the purpose of heating the cellar—when he spoke to me about it in the first instance, there had been several complaints that the wine, the port especi<lb></lb>ally, had got sick from cold, and as far as I could judge, what was in his mind was the best way of obtaining heat in the cellar—I think now, that it is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187509200040"></xptr>
               <p>quite likely that this beehive or jar is the one that was used in. the cellar—the rim at the bottom might have been broken off—if it had fitted on to this iron I should have had no doubt about it—I don't know whether that would be of service in concentrating the heat—there was a steam from the water, but it did not get hot—the water disappeared somewhere; it wants refilling every day if it is alight—we always continued to use candles in the cellar after this apparatus for warming was put up—it was only in the winter months that it was used, it would depend whether it was a long winter or not, how long was it used, say three months at the utmost—Mr. Attridge was a tradesman in the Pavilion Road—Mr. Sanderson appeared to know him very well—I knew he had an account with Mr. Sanderson—he was a jobbing man—I gave the order to Attridge in Mr. Sanderson's name—there was no concealment of any sort about it that I am aware of—I cer<lb></lb>tainly did not conceal anything, and did not receive any orders from Mr. Sanderson to do so—I should not think the job of fixing the apparatus would take long—it was desirable that an india rubber tube should be used, so that it could be moved about to different parts of the cellar for the purpose of warming, and that was the reason that was used instead of a pipe—I was with Mr. Sanderson about two and a half years—sometimes I should be round at the cellars all day at work, bottling a pipe or a butt—the cellar flap would be open during the whole of the time—that has frequently happened in the winter and in the summer—if I heard the hotel bell ring while I was in the cellar at work, I should go round to see what they wanted, and the flap would be left open—Mr. Sanderson was well known in the neighbourhood—anybody could see him go into this cellar—he his—not dis<lb></lb>guise or conceal himself in any way—he used to come down while I was at work there—I knew that there was gas all over the hotel, and also in the stable, which adjoins the harness room—there is an open court between the harness room and the back of the cellar, and there was a door there leading to the cellar—I never saw that door open—I have been told that at one time the tap of the hotel was situated over that cellar, but I don't know it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Candles were used in the ordinary course to give light for the purpose of bottling, and that was always so—when I was at work in the cellar men frequently came into the cellar on business, and also when Mr. Sanderson has been there—when I have been away to the hotel and returned I have never found any strangers there—nothing but cask wine was kept there.</p>

               <p>again just before dusk—he had to bring a candle with him to finish it—he took the pipe away, and that left a hole which I could see down—I after<lb></lb>wards looked again, and that was the first time that I saw gas in the cellar—there was no escape of gas in my parlour after the pipe was taken away—at the time it was taken I looked down and I smelt gas, and that was the first time I saw gas there—it appeared to me to be little jets in a kind of gas stove—I occasionally looked through the hole afterwards; I put a cork in the hole—I was always timid of the gas, and one day I happened to take the cork out and looked through, and I saw Mr. Frost and Mr. Sanderson down there—I looked down because I knew they were there—I saw the gas burning, but not plain; there was a glimmer of light—there were crevices that I saw the light through—I saw it one night, about 12 o'clock, when I went to bed, and saw it when I got up in the morning—no gas was supplied to any part of my premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Fawcett Street, Brompton—I was a barman and cellarman—I entered the defendant's service on 8th September, 1873—I succeeded Frost as cellarman; I left some time in April, 1875—the apparatus which has been produced was in the cellar when I went there, but it was not in use then; it was always used in cold weather to warm the cellar—I kept the pan supplied with water by Mr. Sanderson's directions—the gas was turned off at the thumb tap when the temperature was high enough—the tubing was attached to a large pipe in the wall—I certainly did not know that the gas was being burnt without passing through a meter—it was never turned off at the point where it joined the large pipe all the time I was there—during the winter months it was always burnt at night, and when it was very cold it was turned on full—I had to, fill the pan with water two or three and sometimes four times a week—Mr. Sander<lb></lb>son has been there occasionally when I have been there at work, but not very often—I slept in the hotel—when the gas has been turned off at the hotel I have found it burning in the cellar when I have gone there in the morning—Mr. Sanderson usually turned off the gas at the main in the hotel—he was the last one down at night—I used to put the key of the cellar in a drawer in the bar—I was barman as well as cellarman—there was no communication from any coal cellar in the hotel to the premises at 131, Pavilion Road—the coals at 75, Sloane Street we're kept next to the stable yard—the coal cellar was almost under the spirit cellar, adjoining the stables—you go through the kitchen of the hotel to get to the coal cellar—you could get to the coal cellar from the stables; they were always taken in through the stable gates—I did not give any information before I was subpoenaed as a witness—I left the service through illness—Mr. Sander<lb></lb>son told me to keep boards in front of the gas to keep the light from show<lb></lb>ing in the Street—that was when I first entered the service—I put some old champagne case lids across in front of the gas after receiving those directions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was my honest impression that the gas passed pro<lb></lb>perly through the meter—I did not say anything before the Magistrate about the boards being put up to prevent the gas being seen, because the question was not asked—the gas in the cellar was not liable to be blown out in any way—if you trod on the india rubber pipe it would go out in that manner, but the wind would not blow the light out—I am certain of that—I am certain the gas was wholly turned off at the meter, it was not partially turned off—I have never done it myself, or seen it done—there is</p>

                  </hi>. I am the superintendent of the London Gas Company—in every case of supplying gas to premises by the company we have a contract with reference to such premises—there is no contract at all with Mr. Sanderson, except for the Cadogan Hotel, 75, Sloane Street—he never to my knowledge applied to the company for a supply of gas to 131, Pavilion Road—I was not aware until July this year that he was burning gas in the cellar at Pavilion Road—the mains which supply gas to the Pavilion Road are separate mains to those which supply gas to the hotel in Sloane Street—I have ascertained since this prosecution commenced, as far as I could, that there is no communication between the premises of the hotel and the cellar of Pavilion Road—there has been no supply of gas charged by the company to the premises in Pavilion Road since 1865 when the meter was returned into store—I have had the district under my charge for nearly twenty<lb></lb>one years—I never remember the house 131, Pavilion Road or 97, New Road, being used as the tap of an hotel—there are three or four entrances to the hotel, two on the side of Pavilion Street and, I think, two in Sloane Street, but none in Pavilion Road; it is a long way off—I should say that three houses intervene between the hotel and 131, Pavilion Road; I should call them three—on 13th July, in the evening,. I went in company with Mr. Neighbour and made some inquiries on the spot near 131, Pavilion Road—I noticed that the cellar flap was fastened with a strong iron bar and a padlock—I saw the person in occupation of the house—I afterwards made arrangements and on the 19th July I met a number of the company's officers and servants at the Sloane Square station and I made certain arrangements—I sent Mr. Neigh<lb></lb>bour into Pavilion Road and I went with Mr. Larkin and Bamford, a gas-fitter, to the hotel in Sloane Street shortly before 12 o'clock—I left a man named Bowers outside the door—we went into the bottle and jug entrance of the hotel and I instructed Mr. Larkin, he being known better, to give a card to one of the barmaids there—the barmaid left and we remained about ten minutes in front of the bar—Mr. Larkin spoke to one of the barmaids again and she left the bar and a very short time after that Mr. Sanderson appeared at a small wicket between the bar and the hotel—Mr. Larkin is the inspector of the company, and he said he wished to see the gas meter—he did not say who I was at that time—Mr. Sanderson said "Very well, you can go down, you know where it is," or to that effect—I went into the hotel cellar with Mr. Larkin and the gasfitter—I saw the cellarman, Boyt, who was doing something to a beer cask, either connecting or disconnecting a pipe; ordinary cellarman's work—there were two or three candles on sticks lying about the cellar—I spoke to Boyt and he left me saying "You had better see the governor," and Mr. Sanderson came down—I told him I was looking at the pipes—Mr. Larkin said, "I must apologise, I should have in<lb></lb>troduced Mr. Tully as the superintendent of the Gas Company to you"—said "I am looking at your pipes, you have a cellar in the Pavilion Road in your occupation, and I think I may as well tell you that I understand you are using the gas there, I wish to see how you get it, is there any commu<lb></lb>nication</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187509200044"></xptr>
               <p>between this cellar and the cellar in the Pavilion Road, it is my duty to see how you get the gas in that cellar"—he said "There is a com<lb></lb>munication, but it is difficult to get at, you will have to go through the coal cellar"—I told him I must see it—he said "Very well, take a light," and he lighted one of the candles on a stick—he then went and spoke to Boyt and Boyt left the cellar; I did not hear what passed—Mr. Sanderson led me into a corner of the cellar; it was very dark and I assumed he was showing me the way—he pointed out a pipe and said "There is a gas pipe, that goes up to my daughter's bedroom"—I said "That is not the pipe I wished to see"—he pointed out another—Mr. Larkin remarked "That is water"—I said "That is not the pipe"—. Mr. Sanderson pointed out another and said "That is water also"—we were all this time in the corner of the cellar—there was a confusion of beer pipes and spirit pipes at that place—at that moment one of the com<lb></lb>pany's men came partially down the cellar steps from the Pavilion Street side—he said "Mr. Tulley, you are wanted in the Pavilion Road"—I said to Sanderson "I am going into the Pavilion Road," and I asked Mr. Larkin to come, and I left the premises by the Pavilion Street entrance—Mr. Larkin and Bamford followed me and Sanderson—on reaching Pavilion Road I found the cellar flap up, and I found Mr. Neighbour and William Murphy, one of the company's men, there, and Boyt, the same man I had seen at work in the cellar of the hotel—Mr. Sanderson got down the cellar first, and he assisted me down—Mr. Neighbour put a light to this rim burner, and it ignited immediately—I told Mr. Sanderson I should take possession of all the apparatus now in court, likewise a piece of the com<lb></lb>pany's service pipe which I found immediately under where the tube was connected—the tubing was attached to a 3/4 inch barrel service pipe of the company—this piece of iron at the end of the tubing is not a usual fitting, it has been made by some gas fitter to fit the service pipe—I told Mr. Sanderson I should take possession of these things—he said "Is there not a meter"—the thing was not then detached, and I said "Look for yourself, can you see a meter, I can see none"—he was about to make some remarks but I desired him not to do so—I told him I should report the matter to my Board when they met on the Wednesday following, and I should advise him to see the Board; at the same time I would not pledge myself that the Board would see him under the circumstances—he then asked me if I would object to accompany him into the hotel—I said "Certainly not"—I saw a screw hammer like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in Boyt's hand, in the cellar—such an in<lb></lb>instrument as that would unfix the fittings of nearly every gas pipe—the jaws will move, and will take any sized pipe—such a tool as that would un<lb></lb>fasten the service from the main—you could not have better—when Boyt was attending to the beer in the cellar of the hotel, I think I saw one of those hammers lying behind him on a barrel—I did not notice whether Boyt took it up after Mr. Sanderson spoke to him, and when he left the cellar—I saw the pipe taken off and placed in the hands of the inspector, and I went to the hotel—Mr. Sanderson took me into the coffee room and said "You were kind enough to tell me when the Directors met, will you write it down for me?" I said "Certainly, I am very sorry for this, a man occupying a respectable position as you are"—I wrote down the particulars of the meeting, and the address—he then put his hands in his pockets and said "Well, what do you call it; what does it amount to?"—I said "Well, in the last case of a similar kind, it was called felony, and it amounted to</p>

               <p>twelve months' hard labour"—he said nothing to that—I understood from him that it was his intention to be at the Board on Wednesday—this was Monday—I have experimentalised on the fish tail burners—the lowest day pressure we have is 10-10ths of an inch, and the highest 15-10ths of an evening—I have tested the india rubber tubing, and it leaked to the extent of a foot and a quarter per hour—there are several perforations in it—the four burners would burn at the rate of 14 feet an hour in the day pressure, and the night pressure would increase it about half—I made a report to the directors—Mr. Sanderson came to the office, but he was not allowed to see the Board—I have traced the pipe from the inside of the cellar to the main in Pavilion Road—there was no connection that I could see between the hotel cellar and the Pavilion Road cellar—it was possible to have a pipe through all those walls, but there was no such pipe—I traced it to its source.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was my information that was laid before the Magis<lb></lb>trate by the company's solicitor—I was the chief officer—taking the supply of gas at the minimum, pressure from July 1870, to July, 1870,1 make it amount to 124<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that is supposing it to be burning day and night during the whole time—I had no other means of calculating; I took the entire time and the minimum pressure—it was increased 50 per cent at night, and I have not accounted for the leakage in the tube, which is continuous—a wrench of this kind is very much used by publicans, and it is used by gas fitters very frequently—I could not say whether it was closed or open when I saw it—I rather stopped what Mr. Sanderson was saying in the cellar—he did not say to me that he had acted in ignorance—I am quite sure of that—he said "What is the meaning of all this, does it not go through the meter"—I did not inquire whether the tap of the hotel was on that spot several years ago, my inquiries were as to the supply of gas—according to my inquiries there had been no gas in that house until it was laid on. For the saddler, and that was, 1860—I made an examination on the 26th August, to see if the gas in the cellar communicated with the hotel—I was' not ordered to do that by the directors—I did it on my own account as a <hi rend="italic"></hi> responsible officer of the company—I employed two or three men for the pur<lb></lb>pose; three I think there were—they were at work about an hour and a half, or two hours—I was not with them all the time they were so occupied—I was there a portion of the time—that was the occasion when I removed the whole of the pipe between the cellar and the main.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> That was after I had been examined as a witness at the police-court, and after I had sworn my information—I had no doubt at any time that the gas was taken from the Pavilion Road main, but after the prosecution commenced I thought I would take up the pipe—in the first instance information was given to the secretary, and the secretary com<lb></lb>municated to me and I acted upon the information and made inquiries—a paper without a signature, was handed to me by the secretary.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant superintendent to the London Gas Light Company—I went with Mr. Tully, on 13th July, and again on the 19th, to Pavilion Road—I stationed myself at the doorway of 131, Pavilion Road—when I was standing at the corner of Pavilion Road and Pavilion Street, I saw a man coming towards me from Sloane Street—I had pre<lb></lb>viously examined the flap door of the cellar, and it was locked—the man came up to the cellar flap—he had a wrench in his hand like this one—I did not see him make any use of it at the flap, but he unlocked the door and</p>

               <p>removed the flap and entered the cellar—I followed him down immediately—I was with Murphy—when I got down in the cellar I saw the man on the left, close by this gas apparatus—he did not do anything to it—I asked him if he smelt an escape of gas, and he said "No"—that was said before Mr. Sanderson came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was standing about 5 or 6 feet from the flap, when the man opened it—he knelt down and turned the iron bar over towards where I was standing, and I shifted about 2 yards further off—there had been a ring on the flap, but it was removed—it would not require any instrument to lift it—there was an upright piece parallel with the house. which the bar fastened, and that is on the flap, and when that is taken out the flap could be removed by putting your hand at the side—he did not say anything to me about opening the flap with the ring on that occasion—he spoke to me about it'last Thursday—there were four men waiting at the end of Pavilion Street, when the cellar flap was opened; Murphy and three others.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an Inspector of the Gas Light Company and have now the Grosvenor district, which includes the hotel in Sloane Street and also 131, Pavilion Road—from the receipts and memorandum put before me I have compiled an account of the consumption of gas at the Cadogan Hotel from 1869 down to April this year—this account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is an exact copy of my book, and it agrees with the receipts which were produced at the police-court—whilst I have had charge of the district I have gone myself from time to time to see the meter—it is the duty of the servants of the company to take the index of the meter every quarter at the least, and sometimes more often—I had not the slightest idea that any gas was being consumed at 131, Pavilion Road—no application was made to me to put it on—Mr. Sanderson never applied to me for the extension of the gas from the Cadogan Hotel to the Pavilion Road—as a practical man, if I had to put on gas at 131, Pavilion Road, I should put it on from the main in Pavilion Road, and not from Sloane Street—from Pavilion Road would be the least expensive—I recollect being sent for on two occasions to see Mr. Sanderson with regard to the gas—we had a complaint that there was a bad supply of gas to the hotel, we went there and found the service pipe was stopped and remedied that defect—I saw Air. Sanderson on one occasion; I forget when it was—there was a second complaint as to the outside lamps not burning properly, and we found there was a stoppage in the pipe from the meter to the lamps—he never made any communication about the cellar in Pavilion Road—I accompanied Mr. Tully on 19th July—I gave a card to the barmaid and afterwards saw Mr. Sanderson—I went down in the cellar with Mr. Tully—I saw the man Boyt there—when Mr. Sanderson came down I said "We have come to see the meter, have you had any alterations made to the fittings lately?"—he said "No"—I said "None at all"—he said "No, only the lamps seen to"—I said "That I know, that was cleaned out"—he said "Yes"—I said "I mean any fittings going to the back"—he said "No"—Mr. Tully told him we had come to make an inspection of the pipes, knowing that he was burning gas in Pavilion Road, and he was asked whether there was any communication between the cellar where we</p>

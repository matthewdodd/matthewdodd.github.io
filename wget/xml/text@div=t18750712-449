                  </hi>. I am a hairdresser, of 22, Holborn—the prisoner is my nephew, and was in my employ six years as assistant—on Saturday, 5th July, I missed two glass bottles containing per oxide of hydrogen, value 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; it is for the hair—on the Monday I went to his lodging, at 4, Took's Court, and with a key I opened a drawer in which I found these two bottles, one nearly empty and the other full—I bought them of Mr. Robins of 372, Oxford Street—I am sure the bottles are mine.</p>

About 7.30 on the morning of 6th July I went to the prisoner's lodging, 4, Took's Court, and saw him in bed—I told him I was a police officer and I should take him into custody for stealing two bottles from his employer, Mr. Favre—I pointed to the bottles—he said, "I have not stolen them, I purchased them at Mr. Robins, 372, Oxford Street—he said, "Then you have been here before?"—I said I had—I asked when he purchased them—he said he bought one bottle on the Wednesday previous, and one on the Friday, from a fair person and thin in the face, in Mr. Robins' employ—I asked if he had any invoice with them—he said he had—I asked what he had done with it—he said he had destroyed it; that the bottles were labelled and he had token the labels off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Messrs. Robins, of 372, Oxford Street—we sell bottles of this kind—I have seen the prisoner at our place occasionally—I knew in whose employ he was—he has never made purchases on his own account—he did not come on Wednesday 30th June, and buy a bottle of oxide of hydrogen, or on the Friday for another—I was in the shop on both those days—I should think we sold these two bottles to Mr. Favre, because we never sell a single bottle like that and tied up in that way—we sell to another customer a dozen at a time tied up in the same way—we did not sell any on the Wednesday or Friday—if the prisoner had bought these he would have had to pay cash, I should not have given him any invoice.</p>

            . I am a constable, and live in King-street, Lambeth-walk. I had known the prisoner previous to the 14th of June, and had made appointments with him, but none had been made for the 14th of June; on that day I went with Lawrence to the prisoner's lodgings, in Wentworth-street; I stood in front of the house, and called Jem - the prisoner put his head out of a window, and told me to come up stairs; Lawrence went up with me - there was a man and a woman in the room with the prisoner; the prisoner said, "If you had come ten minutes sooner, you would have found me making;" he then asked me what I wanted - I said a few bobs, meaning shillings; he said he had been just making fourteen for himself and his old woman, and I might have them if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200050"></xptr>I liked - I said I would take five of them; I gave him one good shilling for them - I then handed them to Lawrence to look at; Haines said they were very good ones- Lawrence gave them to me again; we returned to the Archer's public-house - I there marked them, and gave them to Miers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Pray, what are you? A. A constable of Lambeth, and have been so upwards of six years; the prisoner did not know I was an officer - he lives three or four miles from our parish; the first time I had seen him was on the 13th of May - I had been in his company three or four times; I did not go to tempt him, but to detect him - I did not offer him money till I got the base coin of him; I went to buy coin - I am not regularly employed by the Mint; I am sanctioned by them - I expect to be paid, as a witness, for my loss of time, and no more; I have been the means, with others, of detecting several persons - I received about 1l. 8s., three years ago, for detecting two persons in Surrey; I never have been settled with but once by the Mint, and that is three years ago -I make a minute of the days I am employed; I cannot tell what the Mint owes me now, within a few pounds, without I had my books here - I have sometimes been employed day and night for them; I have only been at work for them since December, and not before for three years; I should think, take one thing with another, they now owe me 40l. or 50l. - I have not asked for it, because I know the Mint officers have been busy in going the circuits and other things, and I did not want; I do not know that I should be satisfied if they gave me 60l.; I think I should with 80l. - my wife is a laundress, and I attend to that; I have been on board a man-of-war.</p>

            . I am a fishmonger, and live at Lambeth - Gollocker is a neighbour. I went with him to the ARchers public-house, in Wentworth-street - Gollocker went down the street, to the house where the prisoner lodged - he called out Jem! the prisoner put his head out and said, "Come up;" he went up, and I followed him - the prisoner said, "Is it all right?" Gollocker said,"It is;" the prisoner said, "If you had come ten minutes sooner, you would have caught me making;" he said he had been making fourteen, and he might have them if he pleased - Gollocker said he would take five, and he gave him five; he gave him one shilling for them - we then went to the Archers, and I saw the money given to Myers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you repeated exactly the words that passed between Gollocker and the prisoner? A. As near as I can recollect; he said he and his old woman had put off fourteen on the Saturday previous, and if Gollcker pleased he might have them all - he then gave Gollocker five shillings - Gollocker said, "I do not want the whole, I only want five shillings," and he tendered him a good shilling for the five - sometimes they call shillings bobs; I cannot say whether Gollocker said bobs or shillings - I have only given evidence in three different cases; there were five cases, but there were three at once, at Maidstone - there was one in the Old Court last Session; I have given orders for counterfeit coin three times, not oftener.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear, last Session, in the case of Bagley, "I have not given more than six or seven orders for counterfeit coin?" A. No, I did not swear any thing about how many times; I believe it is not more than five times - I never had a halfpenny for these jobs; I work for my living daily, and am selling fish at my shop - Gollocker employed me in this business; I do not make a stipulation for what I am to have, but I make a rule of losing very little time - I keep a book; I leave it entirely to Mr. Gollocker; I could not tell how many days I have been employed in the last six months, without looking over Mr. Gollocker's book; I do not suppose I have been half fifty days - I should be satisfied if the Mint pay me 5l.; I never got any money from Gollocker - I think my account begins on the 9th of June; Myers paid my expences to Maidstone - I may have been five times with him, buying counterfeit coin.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Were you with Lawrence at the Spring Assizes, at Maidstone? A. It was the last Assizes- I will not swear that I did not say, at the last Session, that it was the Spring Assizes; I cannot swear, within 50l., how much I have received, within the last two years, from the Mint - I was not asked to bring my books; I said if you wanted them I would bring them; for what I have done, within the last twelve months, I should not be satisfied with twenty guineas, nor with fifty, without I had my books here - I have been employed for them about ten years; I cannot tell how many times; I have been examined for the Mint, and for other cases; I was an officer.</p>

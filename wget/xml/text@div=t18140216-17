            . I am horse-keeper to Mr. Bennett. On the 10th of February, about a quarter before four in the afternoon, I went into the privy; I had not been there above two minutes before this man came in, he went into the factory; he looked in, and went out again; he looked in the yard, and went into the tripe-shop. I heard the water rattle in the water tub, where the goods lay; he came out of the tripe-house. He went across the yards, he saw a blue apron hanging on a brick wall, drying, he took it, and tied it round him. I stepped out of the privy, and said, halloo, my friend, what are you going to do with that; he looked over his left shoulder, saw me, he flung the apron down, and directly he ran out of the yard, and I after him; I collared him, and took him to Mr. Bennett. He had got the tripe wrapped up in his jacket.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner - A. I saw him once before, he came to see one of the men that worked there; he said he was an Irishman. The tripe that he had in his jacket was nine pounds and a half; he took it out of the backs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took it, and he took it from me again; I am a poor cracked brain fellow. I did not know what I was about; the devil was tempting me to take it. I have been in his Majesty's service ever since the day I was born, and now next May I am going to serve my king and country until I die in glory.</p>

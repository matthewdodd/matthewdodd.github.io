                  </hi>. I am a chemist, and live in Coleman-street—the prisoner has been with me nearly nine months—on Saturday, 10th Nov., I was at dinner with him—when I offered to help him a second time, he said "No," and went away—I thought it unusual to go so quickly from dinner—after he went down, I remained in the room perhaps a quarter of an hour—after that, I went down to my laboratory, and found a strong smell of sealing-wax—I looked about and found a box concealed on a shelf—it was in a place where it was not very likely to be looked for—the prisoner was then in the shop, I took the box up stairs and opened it—I found in it thirty-five parcels of drugs—one parcel contained twenty boxes and pots of patent medicines—the parcels are here, some of them have on them the writing of my former assistant who is dead—this, parcel was marked in Oct., 1851; it contains 2 lbs. weight of black cochineal—the prisoner never bought any of these goods, certainly not—I never knew of his buying any<lb></lb>thing of me—the value of these goods is from 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I went to the prosecutor's house on that night between 9 and 10 o'clock—the prisoner was brought to me, and this box—he was given in custody for stealing these drugs I told him he must consider himself in custody, and he most come to the police station—he said he had purchased them from the shop and had paid the money—I asked if he had made any memorandum of the sale, he said fee had not—I found on him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in cash, some letters, and a bunch of keys—one of them unlocked his writing-desk, which was pointed out to me by the prosecutor, and in it I found thirty-five sovereigns.</p>

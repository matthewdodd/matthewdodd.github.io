On Wednesday, the 24th of November, I went to the house in Fludyer-street, and received information—I told them to put the candles out, and I went up stairs—I saw two persons on the roof over the stable—I went and gave information—the police went in the back way—the lead was gone from the gutter—I did not see who the parties were—the house is unoccupied—Mrs. Dillon is taking care of it—Mr. Holmes gave her the care of it.</p>

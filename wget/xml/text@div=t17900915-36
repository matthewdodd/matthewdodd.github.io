               <p>On the 18th of August, I was sent for to Mr. Collins's, to take charge of the prisoners; I took this piece of cloth from the prisoner Hudson, and down her bosom I found this remnant; it appears to be a remnant of the handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Smith. This piece of cloth appears to be the same piece I sold to Hobbs, but I will not positively swear to it; I cannot swear to the remnant of muslin; but the border appears to correspond with this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hudson. I recommend myself to the mercy of the gentlemen of the Court.</p>
               <p>PRISONER HOBB's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>This young woman told me, that she had sent to the prosecutor, and he had sent word to her back again, if he could convict me, and acquit her, he would do it; an answer was sent back, that he could not, without acquitting us both; then he sent word, that he would not do it; this young woman says, that gentleman was very intimate with her, and often gave her things for the child, and that he gave her these four handkerchiefs; and she told the gentleman, that he was her sweetheart some time back; and I really believe there was a great deal of intimacy between them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hudson. We are both equally guilty.</p>
               <p>Smith. My Lord, it is very true; some time ago, the prisoner Hudson had a remnant of muslin from me; the person whom I served my time with, about four years ago, was very intimate with her father-in-law; she came to town very frequently, and came to the shop to see Mr. Coward, the person I served my time with; about three months ago she came to this shop; I had not seen her for three years and a half; she begged of me to shew her some muslin, about three shillings a yard; I shewed her some; she appeared to be in a very deplorable situation; she desired me to cut off two nails of this muslin; I believe it came to two-pence or three-pence; says she, you will not charge me any thing for this; I told her, I was sorry to see her in such a situation, and I would make her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150050"></xptr>a present of it; the apprentice is here that was present at the time.</p>
               <p>Is that the only instance in which you have given her any thing? - That is the only instance that I can recollect; what I might have given her possibly four years ago, I do not recollect; but nothing else, since I have been at this shop.</p>
               <p>Have you kept any connection or acquaintance with her, since you have been at this shop? - Not the least; I never saw her but when she came to the shop, and I believe she has been three times within three months.</p>

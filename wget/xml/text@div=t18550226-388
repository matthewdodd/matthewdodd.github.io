                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police. On Monday evening, 12th Feb., I went, in consequence of information, to a house, No. 9, Harrow-street, Mint-street, in the Borough, between 6 and 7 o'clock—five other constables accompanied me—the back door was open—I entered by it, and proceeded up stairs to the back room on the first floor—the door was not locked, but merely shut to—Neville opened it—I entered the room, and saw the two prisoners and a man—I told them I belonged to the police, and I had received directions to go there, that they were coining—I addressed John Wilson by the name of Holmes—he said, "No, we are not, Sir"—I put the two prisoners and the other man in custody of the constables, and I commenced searching the room—there was a table, at which the prisoners had sat—I found on the table this canvas bag, and thirty-six sixpences wrapped in papers to keep them from rubbing—I saw John Wilson searched, and some good money was found on him—I saw a cupboard in the room, and some plaster of Paris was found there, and this other plaster of Paris under the staircase—I found some wet sand, and a file with white metal in its teeth—these are things that are used in coining.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">John Wilson. Q.</hi> Do you recollect going to that house on, 16th Dec.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I found you there, and another person—you gave the name of Henry Holmes, and said you lived in a house at Paddington, but I believe you have been living in that same house for some months.</p>

On Wednesday the 15th of August I observed a bottle of gin up the chimney in the back washhouse; the same evening I found a bottle of rum in a cupboard in the beer cellar; on Saturday I found another bottle of rum in that cupboard. I missed the first bottle of rum on Wednesday night; when I went to bed it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What had become of the gin that you found up the chimney. - A. I missed that on Thursday morning. In consequence of some advice, a friend of mine marked fourteen empty bottles with a file at the bottom of them; we put them in the cupboard where the rum had been; this was on Saturday. On Sunday morning I got a friend to place himself in the coal cellar a little after six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How is that coal cellar situated. - A. It is opposite the spirit cellar; the spirit cellar is on the side of it, there is a kind of a lattice work or railing; I observed on the Sunday morning a nail drawn from one of the rails, and there were only twelve bottles remaining in the cupboard, and I saw the officer take two marked bottles out of the kitchen; they were behind some washing tubs.</p>
               <p>Q. What did these two bottles contain. - A. One rum and the other gin, they were full.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you rum and gin in that cellar that you are speaking of - A. Yes, in casks.</p>

               <p>Q. How did he used to get in. - A. Over the door, there is a small place open at the top.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen the prisoner go through a hole over the door. - A. Yes, four or five times, and I have seen him bring out liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you always told your master of it. - A. No, I did not, I only told him of it at last.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he used to bring out. - A. Sometimes one sort, and sometimes another, which he thought proper.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Sunday morning did you see him do any thing. - A. No, on Tuesday I saw him go through the hole.</p>

             sworn. Q. You are an acquaintance of Mr. Smart's. - A. Yes, he applied to me on the Saturday night respecting some liquor. In consequence of what he and I agreed on, on Sunday morning about five minutes before six in the evening I concealed myself in his coal cellar, in a way so as not to be seen by any person coming down the stairs; about a quarter after six the prisoner at the bar came down the cellar stairs, he had a lighted candle in his hand, he placed it upon one of the ale barrels next to the liquor cellar; he got two quart bottles and a pint pot, he placed them on the barrel where the candle stood, he then got over the liquor cellar door, he stepped one foot on the ale barrel, and them climbed over; I saw him go over the door, the door is about four foot high; he then took the two bottles and the candle through the lattice.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the lattice open. - A. It was open enough for him to take an empty bottle through, he was then within the cellar, I saw him fill the bottles with liquor; where I was placed I could see all over the liquor cellar by the light, I saw him fill the two bottles, he filled them out of different casks, he took the pot and drew near a pint of gin from the barrel into the pot; having so done, he knocked down one of the bars of the lattice work, and put the two bottles out upon the ale barrel, he then put out the pint of liquor and the candle; he then got over the door the way that he got in. Having done that he took the bottles away, and afterwards took the pint of liquor and the candle, and went up stairs: Where he took the liquor to I cannot say.</p>

               <p>DANIEL BISHOP sworn. I am an officer. On Sunday morning the 19th of this month I took the prisoner into custody at Mr. Smart's, and in the wash-house behind a washing tub I found these two bottles, one containing rum and the other gin. I produce them.</p>
               <p>JOHN ANDERSON sworn. Q. Did you assist in marking the bottles on Saturday. - A. I did, I marked fourteen between twelve and one o'clock, I marked them with a three square file at the bottom.</p>
               <p>(The bottles identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I was servant to Mr. William Moss, a butcher of, Worm-wood-street, London, but have now left—about 10 minutes past 8, on 27th April, I was minding the shop—there were then several quarters of mutton hanging on hooks in the gateway near the shop—I saw one of the hooks swinging, and looked up the court and saw two men, and the prisoner who had the mutton under his arm—I saw him clearly—I went out after him—he ran up the steps at the top of the court—he saw me coming and ran away—the two men tried to stop me—I could not see whether the prisoner had the mutton then or not—I did not see him throw it down—he ran into St. Helen's-place, where there is no thoroughfare—I saw him at the top, and I know it was him, because I watched him as he ran—he had a cloth in his possession when the constable took him—the value of the mutton was 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman,</hi> 635). On 27th April, about 8 in the evening, I was on duty in Peahen-court, and saw the prisoner running out of that court with a long cloth flying under his arm—he ran into St. Helen's-place, Bishopsgate—there is no thoroughfare there—I went after kirn, and took him—I told him what he was charged with, and he said had made a mistake, he thought—I found nothing on him but the cloth—it was a large butcher's cloth, perhaps a yard and a quarter square—he gave me a false address—I did not find he lived there.</p>

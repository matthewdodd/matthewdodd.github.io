I live at 17, Harbour Road, Old Kent Road—on Tuesday evening, 26th February, I was in Long Acre—two young men came up and one put his arms round my neck so tightly that I could hardly breathe—I had a plated chain on and a locket—they pulled at something and then ran away—I was very much frightened, and I ran after them down a short passage and missed them—I missed the locket—Leon Stansbury took me to the station, where I gave an account of the occurrence—next morning I saw the prisoner with twelve others at the station, and I picked out the one I thought was like one of the young men—to the best of my belief the prisoner is the lad.</p>

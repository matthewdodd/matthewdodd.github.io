                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 47, London Wall—on 30th June, about 10.40, I was in Camomile Street—as I was walking in the road the prisoner sprang from a door opposite, and without saying a word, I saw his hand up, and he struck the knife in my cheek—he then retired to the doorway, without saying anything, and sat himself on the doorstep from which he had emerged—I did not lose sight of him at all—I spoke to a policeman immediately, on the spot, and he was arrested—the wound I received was 2 1/4 inches long, across the cheek—I lost a deal of blood, and have the scar now—I had never seen the prisoner before—he was tipsy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the Metropolitan Free Hospital—on 30th June the prosecutor was brought there, suffering from an incised wound on the left side of the face—there was a considerable quantity of blood on his clothes, in front—the wound was just over 2 inches in length, but not of any very great depth—it was not in itself very serious, but in wounds of that nature there is always great risk of erysipelas or abscess—he has gone on well—this knife was brought to me by the constable the same evening—it was quite wet with what I believe to be blood—it is such a knife as would inflict such a wound.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On this night I had come from Broad Street Railway Station. I had only had one glass of ale, and at the top of the street I had a glass of wine. I went down St. Mary Axe, on my way to the Sailor's Home. A young man came up to me, and said "I have been robbed." I said "Where? He pointed down the corner, and asked me to come with him; I refused. He said "Have you any hard?" I said "Yes, but I have no knife." He said "Here is a knife" I took the knife from his hand. He looked over his shoulder, and said "Here is the so-and-so I have done for." He went across the road, and asked me to follow him, and I was close at his heels when the policeman came up and asked what I had been doing, and took the knife out of my hand. I "did not notice the prosecutor, and did not know till next morning whether it was a man or a woman that had been injured.</p>

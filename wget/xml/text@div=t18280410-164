I saw the prisoners at a public-house at Poplar, I have known them two or three years; they asked me to treat them - I paid for some rum for them.

            . I live in this house. I was in my own room, and saw the prisoners bring the prosecutor in; he was drunk, but seemed to know what he was about; they pulled him up stairs - I went up in a few minutes; the door was shut; I looked through the keyhole, and saw Rolph on the bed, the prosecutor on her, and Smith on him, feeling his pockets - I cannot tell whether she took anything - I went to my own room again; Smith presently came, and asked me to go and have a glass; she gave my wife 1s. to buy a frock. I went up into the room, and saw the prosecutor, who said he had been robbed.</p>

I went with her; she gave me 1s.; she pulled out the bag and said, "Here is blunt I have got, but don't say anything about it;" she then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100089"></xptr>went into a block-maker's shop, and said, "Let me in, and I'll send for a gallon of beer."

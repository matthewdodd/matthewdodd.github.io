             and John Carey. In consequence of suspicion, on Saturday evening the 13th of December I took this man to the counter, and the officer afterwards searched the prisoner's apartments, and in a corner cupboard of his room there was found three pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they ever been sold in your shop. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the prisoner. - A. A <rs id="t18070114-26-deflabel174" type="occupation">clicker</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Did you take up any body else that evening. - A. I was about to take up my brother that very evening, but from the behaviour of the two men I had more right to suspect this man than the other. I searched both the apartments, and found none in one, and three pair of shoes in the other.</p>
               <p>Q. That is your argument; you did suspect your brother, did you take him up. - A. I believe I might say for a minute or two, I desired him to go in the coach; he was put into the constable's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they had not been sold in your shop during your absence. - A. His wife said they had been brought there that night.</p>
               <p>Q. She might say that not to injure herself; suppose six pair were brought from the maker, all of one size and of one sort, and three pair were sold, should you be able to distinguish them from the others. - A. Certainly not; I know they are of my make, and they have my daughter's mark.</p>
               <p>Q. So they would if they had been sold. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

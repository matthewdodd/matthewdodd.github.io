G - d d - n your blood, your rings and money, or, G - d d - n your blood, I will shoot you! Sitting close with two ladies in the chaise I sweated, and my watch stuck; I could not draw it out; I believe I said, d - n you, take it out yourself; I put my hand into the pocket I generally keep my silver in; I took out about fifteen or sixteen shillings and threw it into his hat; said he, where are your rings? I said you have had every thing: he kept a pistol against my head, and he held a cutlass in his hand; the other man then jumped up into the chaise, and said, d - n your eyes, you bitches of bell, deliver your money!</p>

               <p>Morrill. There was a very good light came from over the fields; his holding the pistol and cutlass to me causes me to take so much notice of his person that I should have known him seven years afterwards.

It is about a fortnight to-morrow, I went out and double locked the chamber door, the outer door is generally open; when I came home my child says, mother, you have been robbed; and I went up stairs to my room, and I found the prisoner in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing on her? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge her with stealing the blankets? was she an acquaintance of your's? - No, I never see her before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop her? - I did stop her; I sent for an officer to take her.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get at your blanket? - From the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. If you found nothing on her when you stopped her, how was it you had her committed? - I missed the blanket off the bed, and she followed me down stairs, and said, never mind the blanket, and wanted to send for a quartern of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing else? - A candlestick that has never been found.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened after she was taken up? were any duplicates found on her? - The officer found a great many duplicates on her, but nothing belonging to me; she had made away with the duplicate that she had pawned the blanket.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your blanket, since? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I know no more of the blanket than a child unborn; she came to me this morning, and wanted half a guinea of me in the gaol.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you go to this prisoner in the gaol? - Yes, I did; I went to see her along with my lodger, Mrs. Connelly.</p>

                  </hi>. On 18th May I was house-surgeon at Charing-cross Hospital—the deceased was brought there on 18th May—she had a cut on the forehead half-an-inch long, and about half-an-inch deep, as if produced by some blunt instrument; this iron bar (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) would have done it—I dressed it, but did not deem it sufficiently serious to detain her—she came again the next morning; the wound did favourably up to the Wednesday—on Friday, 23rd, I was sent for to No. 2, Taylor's-buildings, about 8 o'clock in the morning, and found her there dead—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and found congestion of the vessels of the brain, and effusion of serum under the membrane, there was no fracture; the heart was enlarged, the stomach, kidneys, and liver were diseased, but the lungs and other organs were healthy—the immediate cause of death was the effusion of</p>

               <p>serum on the brain—the symptoms in the stomach, liver, and kidneys, were indicative of habitual intoxication—that habit might account for the appear<lb></lb>ance of the serum which was the cause of her death, and it would account for the congestion of the brain—taking all the circumstances together, I think it probable that the blow on her forehead accelerated her death—such appearances of the brain might have followed an injury of this kind in a person given to those habits, and also in a person not given to those habits—it is impossible for me to say from what cause death took place, whether from the injury or the intoxication—if I had not heard of the injury, and had found her stomach, kidneys, and liver in the state I did, I should conclude that her habits were habitually intemperate, and that would account for the appearances I found on the brain—I could not say that the blow, if she received one, hastened her death—she may have died sooner from it.</p>

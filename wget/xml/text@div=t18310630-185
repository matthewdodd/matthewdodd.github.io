On the 31st of May the prisoner came to our shop, at a quarter before nine o'clock in the morning - I sell a few second-hand clothes; she asked for a child's frock - I had seen her the day before, when she asked the price of the same frock - she asked leave to try the frock on her child, which she had with her - she did so; it was too long; she asked me for a needle and thread, to run it up, which I gave her - while she sat working, she asked me what time it was; I went to a cupboard where my husband's watch hung, and told her it wanted five minutes to nine - the cupboard was close by where she sat; I am not certain whether I shut the cupboard door or not - a woman with a child in her arms afterwards came to the door, and inquired the price of an article - I stood outside the door, talking to that woman for two or three minutes -I then went in again, and in a short time the prisoner left the house; no other person had been in before she left, and there were no inmates in the house but myself - no one could pass me while I was outside; the door opens into the room - as the prisoner was going out, she asked me to let her leave the child's dirty frock, and the key of her streetdoor, till she returned; I did - she had paid me before she run the frock up; she then went out, and in about half an hour I missed my watch, chain, seals, and key - no other customer had been in the interval; my husband had gone out while she was sitting there - he went out before I had looked at the watch; as soon as I had missed the watch, I went to my sister, who lives next door but one, and she went to some pawnbrokers to stop it - I then went to some other pawnbrokers; I had given a description of her, and when she returned for her key and her child's dirty frock, she was detained - I found her in custody when I returned in about two hours and a half.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Where was she taken into custody? A. At my sister's, who is not able to attend - I only went on the step to speak to the other woman; I did not say any thing to her - the prisoner did not say she was going to leave her residence; she said she wished to leave the key, because it was heavy - my husband did not return till my sister fetched him to the station-house; while the prisoner was in my shop I took a pair of white stockings out of a drawer, and sat down to mend them - I did not get up till I went to look at the watch again, and it was gone: I deal in nothing but wearing-apparel and shoes - I believe there are idle persons and disorderly boys about: the prisoner said, in my hearing, that she had come back for the frock and the key.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Was your husband at home when she first came? A. Yes, he was in the garden, and when he came in she was sitting in the chair; there were two rooms below, and one up stairs - I can distinctly swear that no one entered the shop from the time I looked at the watch till I missed it.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner at my wife's shop - I know the watch had been brought there before, on account of boiling an egg, and hung in that cupboard; the prisoner was there when I went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see it in the cupboard yourself at that time? A. No; I did not return for three or four hours.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning for the frock and the key of the street door, and the prosecutor's shop was shut - I asked her sister where she was, and she said she wanted to speak to me; she took me to her house, and gave me in charge - I said I had never seen it; I had been to look at two houses after I left the prosecutrix's, and called again for my key and frock.</p>

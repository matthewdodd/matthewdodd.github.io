            . I was on board this vessel, and got up in the morning, the 17th of May, between two and three o'clock, I saw a white handkerchief lying on the deck, and two men drop over the side of the ship into the boat and go off, on which I call'd out, and the woman said all her cloaths<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175306070018"></xptr> were gone. I went in a boat on the Surry side, and took the prisoner Cook, with the box and things in it, and that gown the prosecutrix has now on all over mud, he had them in a boat; and I brought him and the things back. Longman was found in a lighter near him all wet, as though he had been in the river Thames.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say Longman was one of the two men you saw go off in the boat?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I will not say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing found in his possession ?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any confession?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No, my lord, he did not. The box produced. This is the same box I found in the possession of Cook.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This box I lost at that time with my things in it.</p>

I belong to a ship that lay next to the ship where the prosecutrix was robb'd, I was awake and heard somebody call out robbers, I ran forwards and saw two men in a wherry, I took our own boat, and two of our servants in her, and rowed after them; but when I came there the two prisoners were taken. I can't say they are the same men that I saw in the wherry, but Cook was never out of the boat.</p>

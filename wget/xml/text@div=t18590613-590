                  </hi>. I am Captain of the ship. "Active"—in April last, about 12 o'clock at night, I was walking along the Commercial-road, and three men got hold of me, one on each side and one behind—the prisoner is the one who was on my right side, and he got my watch from my waistcoat pocket, and broke it from the chain so quickly, that I did not know he had got it—I laid hold of him with one hand, and the guard with the other, and held him; but he slipped away to the other side of the street—I followed</p>

I am potman at the Bedford Arms, Commercial-road—I was closing the house, and saw the Captain getting towards the kerb, with four or five men surrounding him, and clinging to him—I knew him—he had been in to have a glass, and was about returning home—I had just wished him good night—he was not at all the worse for liquor—I was about as far from him as I am from you—the prisoner is one of the men—I caught hold of him, and the captain caught hold of him, and held him till a constable came—he attempted to get away from me—I do not think he was in liquor—I had not noticed him in the house—four men ran away.</p>

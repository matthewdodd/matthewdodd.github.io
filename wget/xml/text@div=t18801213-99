                  </hi>. I am manager to Messrs. Steedman and Co., 272, Walworth Road, wholesale chemists, trading as Harvey, Roberts, and Co.—on 7th January last a man called and left this order for three dozen packets of soothing powders, and this cheque for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I packed them and the man came for them; the prisoner was in a cart outside; the goods were put in the cart, and he went off with them—I believed the cheque to be genuine, and that the address on the note, "Charles Leake, dispensing and family chemist, Whetstone," was the prisoner's genuine address; that was what deceived me—the cheque is signed "Charles Leake"—I gave the man a receipted invoice, but he left it behind—I paid the cheque into my employers' account next day, and it was returned marked "Account closed"—I made inquiries at Whetstone, but could not find anything of the prisoner—I wrote him a letter, and it was returned unopened marked "Gone away."</p>

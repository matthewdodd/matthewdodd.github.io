I took the prisoner on 6th February, and told him I wanted him on a charge of stealing mutton from Mr. Bishop's shop—he said, "If you lock me up, I hope you will send me to some school"—I took him to the station, and when the charge was read over to him he said he knew nothing about it he was at the Victoria Theatre—I saw him in the middle of the day on the 6th, but he escaped from me, and I afterwards took him when I was in plain clothes.</p>

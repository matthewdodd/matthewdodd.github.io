            . I am servant to John Marks. I was going down the ride for a pitcher of water, and saw the prisoner coming towards the door with the cushion; when he saw me he put it on a chariot which was near him, and asked me the price of it; he went into the premises, and said he wanted to look at a carriage; he went out, and Henson followed him.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner take up this cushion and put it down; he took it up again, and went out; I went after him, and asked what he wanted - he said to buy a carriage; I said it was very odd he should take up a cushion, I supposed he wanted to steal it, as he did one in the morning, which I met him with - I told him to come back, but he would not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not I say, "It is not good enough for the person I want it for," and threw it on the carriage? A. No - he took it up from a travelling carriage,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030041"></xptr>and then put it down, took it up again, and put it on a chariot.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he was intoxicated, and had gone to the premises to purchase a cushion for a coachman - that he had been deranged, and in hot weather his intellects were still affected.</p>

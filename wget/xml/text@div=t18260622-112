I believe I gave it to him about twelve o'clock at noon - I am not positive as to the time. I never saw him again till he was apprehended; he was not at all under my control - he was under the Governor. I have never seen the money since.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it in the course of his duty to deliver this money, or was he intrusted as a common stranger? - A. No; I intrusted him as being an officer of the establishment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CRESWELL. Q. Had Mr. Dupleix written by him? A. No - I received the letter three or four days before. The prisoner did not apply to me for the money; he had been up the day before, and I told him I should send it down the next day by him; I gave it to him as a ready mode of conveying it to Mr. Dupleix - I told him it was for Mr. Dupleix, of the Narcissus; I did not mention for what purpose - he was aware it belonged to the establishment; I did not tell him it was for any particular purpose. He had nothing to do with the Narcissus - he was a guard officer on board the Dromedary. I have frequently sent money by officers before, but not by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. ROBERTS. Q. Was the money openly given? A. Yes - I counted it into his hand.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is this public money belonging to the establishment? A. Yes - it is granted by Act of Parliament.</p>

            . I was employed by the Penitentiary on board the Dromedary, in the same situation as the prisoner. On the 10th of April, 1824, I went with him to the Penitentiary - it was a very wet day, and we went into a public-house to dry ourselves - I did not go with him to Mr. Rickford; I waited for him about half an hour - when he came out he said to me, "David, I have got 40l." - it was in his hand, in brown paper; I did not see the money, but I saw the paper; he said he had to take it to the steward of the Narcissus, for Mr. Rickford; we went on board the boat together between four and five o'clock, I believe, or it might be after five; when we arrived at the Dromedary we delivered up our baggage that we had in the boat, and went down into the ward-room - the prisoner said to me, "Now, David, I will wash and put on a clean shirt," which he did before me; it had been a very wet day; he then asked the steward's leave to go on shore, with his dog, for an hour, as he said there was a gentleman coming down from town to buy it; the boat went on shore at eight o'clock, to bring all hands on board, but they could not find him. I never saw him afterwards till now. I mentioned to the steward that he had received the money to take to Mr. Dupleix - I did not see him take it on shore.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What he did with the money you do not know? A. No. It is customary when persons go on shore to ask leave; he had a French dog with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I obtained leave to go on shore I got into improper company, and was robbed of the money - I made my way to town to get my friends to make it up.</p>

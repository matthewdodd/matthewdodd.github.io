               <p>Q. How came you there?</p>
               <p>Milward. I was pick'd up by a young woman in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Milward. No, I was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is that young woman that pick'd you up?</p>
               <p>Milward. I do not know, but she took me to her lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was you pick'd up?</p>
               <p>Milward. It might be between 6 and 7 at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know that young woman if you saw her?</p>
               <p>Milward. I do not know that I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had your watch and money at the time you was pick'd up?</p>
               <p>Milward. I am sure I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you them when you went into the lodging-room.</p>
               <p>Milward. I did not see my watch and money in the lodgings, but I had them before I went into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had them when you was pick'd up?</p>
               <p>Milward. I am sure I had them when I went along with the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a watch was it?</p>
               <p>Milward. It was a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you?</p>
               <p>Milward. I had five guineas, half a crown and three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the woman by when you awaked?</p>
               <p>Milward. No. I was left in darkness; there was neither the woman nor any body else in the room.</p>

               <p>Milward. I knock'd, and there came up a young man with a light, who lighted me down. I inquired if he knew the young woman who brought me there. He said he did, and gave me an account of her name, but it was quite wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he?</p>
               <p>Milward. He lodged in the room below.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name?</p>
               <p>Milward. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he direct you to find her?</p>
               <p>Milward. He went along with me to look for her, first to the Bolt and Tun Inn, and then to the King's Arms, the top of the Fleet market.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the young woman?</p>
               <p>Milward. No, we did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your watch again?</p>
               <p>Milward. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the watch?</p>
               <p>Milward. The woman that was along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is she?</p>
               <p>Milward. I don't know her.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Milward. I cannot swear to her, neither will I.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing to say to the prisoner at the b?</p>
               <p>Milward. I have no more to say against her than what I have said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear her confess she had your watch?</p>
               <p>Milward. No, never.</p>

            . This young woman at the bar and two other young women sent for me to a publick house on the 29th of December last.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the other two?</p>
               <p>Abrahams. They were discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. To what house did they send for you?</p>
               <p>Abrahams. To the Taylors Arms, in Duke's Place.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Abrahams. I keep a watchmaker's shop in Duke's Place. A man came in and told me, that three ladies wanted to speak with me at that house. I was surprised at three ladies coming there, it being but a very poor house. I went thither, and saw the prisoner and two other women. I asked whether any of them had sent for me. They were drinking of punch, and said I was not the person they sent for, but I might do as well. I asked what to do, and they told me they had a watch to dispose of. I asked them to let me look it, and they produced it.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them produced it?</p>
               <p>Abrahams. They shuffled it so from one to the other, that I don't know which it came from, but the prisoner claimed it. I asked her what she must have for it, and they said three guineas. I said it is the wrong day (it happened to be on the Saturday, which is our sabbath) I cannot buy it to day. They said, we deal with your people, they don't mind what day. I seeing there were three of them, and that they came in a hackney coach, said, come to my house, we'll see if we can do any business. When I had them there, I got a constable, and told them I suspected they did not come honestly by it. I took them all three before my Lord mayor, who committed them all, and ordered me to advertise the watch, which I did, and the coachman came and claimed it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say before my Lord-mayor?</p>
               <p>Abrahams. She said she did not take the watch from the prosecutor, but found it on the bed after he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say to you about it, when she wanted to sell it to you?</p>
               <p>Abrahams. Then she said it was her husband's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she confess before my Lord-mayor, that she had been in company with the prosecutor?</p>
               <p>Abrahams. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. When the candle was brought up stairs to you, did you look for your watch?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look upon the bed?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did, and under the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is this young man that brought the candle up?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he take up the watch at that time, without your seeing him?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, he could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your watch when you was in bed?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That was in my breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you dressed when the young man came up?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was; I dressed myself in the dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the watch might not drop out when you was dressing yourself?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, it could not, but I must have heard the sound of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had your watch in your pocket in that room?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure I had it when I went up into the room.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176001160020"></xptr>Q. Was it not in your pocket when you went to get up?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure it was not then in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not likely it might drop out when you went to go to bed?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It never used to drop out.</p>

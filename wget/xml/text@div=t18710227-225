                  </hi>. I keep a shop in the Latimer Road, and am also managing a building operation at Wimbledon—on the night of the 7th February, I went to bed about 11 or 11.15—the house was then properly secured; I did it myself—about 1.30 in the morning, I heard something moving below—I opened my door and a stream of light came up the stair-case—I ran down and saw three men in the parlour behind the shop—two of them got out of the window and one I secured—I kept him there about half-an-hour, till a constable came—we searched him and took everything he had out of his pockets, and went with him to the station—about 100 yards from the house we took Hasey, and after going along a short distance, Dyke came on the scene—he walked behind me about half-a-dozen yards—I saw a movement with his hands, and I received a blow on the head which knocked me down, and the man I had got away—I missed a quarter of a pound of tea from my room, which I had bought that very day—I believe this to be the tea—I also missed about 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—one half-sovereign and some silver from a box in the cupboard, and some copper from the till—I am certain the prisoners are two of the men—Dyke was the man who threw the stone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not excited at hearing a noise in my house—I was quite cool—there were four men to deal with, three in the house, and one watching outside—I saw three men in the room, and I seized the one that was standing nearest to me; the other two got out of the window—they were not very long about it: they got out as quick as they could—the man that I took in the house escaped on the way to the station—the constable took Hasey on the way to the station—I was not carrying the constable's staff at that time—Hasey did not object to being taken—he did not ask what it was for—he never said a word till we got a little farther on, and then he said he should not go any further—I don't remember the policeman saying "You are an associate, I think you are one of them, I will take you, too"—after Hasey was taken, the policeman gave me his staff, and he said if they were violent I was to strike them with it—Dyke was not taken that night—I was called to the station the next day, and identi<lb></lb>fied him in a room full of men—they did not tell me Dyke was in custody—they said I was wanted at the station—I went in the room, and they asked me if there was anyone I could recognize as being in my house, and I picked Dyke out—I have no doubt that this tea is my property—it is in a paper—I won't swear to it; but I have no doubt about it—the man who threw the stone at me in the street was five or six yards off—I did not see</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman X</hi> 69). On the night of the 7th of this month, from information I received I went to the prosecutor's house, about 1.30—when I got there I saw him holding a young man of the name of Charles Langley, who has escaped—I had seen him in company with the two prisoners and another man, about 11 o'clock that night—there were four of them altogether—I told Langley I should take him into custody, and we proceeded to the station—when we got about 150 yards from the house I saw the prisoner Hasey, and took him into custody—he said "What do you want me for?"—I said "I will tell you when I get to the station"—we went into the station—I had one in each hand—the prosecutor was following behind—some distance up we saw the prisoner Dyke—Hasey said then, he would not go any further, and I said to the prosecutor "You take my truncheon out, and strike the first prisoner that resists"—at the time we saw Dyke he threw a stone at the prosecutor, which struck him on the head, and knocked him down—he pulled out three stones from his pocket, and threw them at me, one after the other, and Langley got away, leaving his collar and necktie in my hand—I took Hasey to the station—on the following morning, between 7 and 8 o'clock, I went to Dyke's house, 7, George Street, with Couchman—he was in bed—I told him we should charge him with being concerned, with others, in custody, in committing a burglary in the Latimer Road—he said "I suppose I must go with you"—I searched the room, and found this 1/4lb. of tea on the bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I took Hasey myself—the prosecutor did not say any<lb></lb>thing about him at the time I took him—he said he would give me a de<lb></lb>scription of the other two when I came out of the house—I know a man named Thompson, well—I don't know a man named Briney, by name—I might know him if I saw him—I know Thompson as a companion of Langley, the man who got away—I did not see the first stone thrown on this night—I heard a noise, as though a stone was thrown against some boards; I looked round, and saw the prosecutor lying in the road—it was Dyke that I saw in the street that night—I told the officer at the station, and described him as being a tall young fellow—I knew him well; but I did not know his name—he was about five yards from me when I saw him that night—I was not hit with anything—when the prosecutor was on the ground he threw three stones at me—they did not hit me—I kept the two prisoners in front of me—I heard at the Police Court that Dyke said that the tea was left at his house by Langley—I went to Hasey's house, at 3 or 4, Child's Place, Kensington—I found he was living there with his married sister—she said he came there sometimes, and some nights he was away all night—we went into her room—she said "What is in my room you are welcome to see"—I found nothing in the room—Couchman did not tell Hasey's sister that he would give him a very long sentence—nothing was said about five years; hardly a word was spoken—I was holding the candle, and she said "Anything I have got here you are welcome to see."</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing on the 26th of October - A. We lost some pieces of kerseymere and patent cord which was in the window, the prisoner was in the shop, she cried out thieves. I ran to the window, I saw the pieces falling out of the window; the shop door was locked. I could not find the key of the door. I screamed out thieves; the prisoner said it was of no use, they were gone; she did not seem affected by it. We took the prisoner before the Lord Mayor, he was pleased to release her; after that we thought proper to to search her box, and there we found a few very trifling things indeed.</p>
               <p>- PUGH. The servants box was brought down stairs; Mrs. Pickard picked out these things; the prisoner acknowledged this piece of silk was her mistress's; she said she had never done the like before she knew nothing of the kerseymere.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My box laid in the landing place; my mistress went often to my box; I was taken up and the gentleman acquitted me; as I was going out my mistress told me to call on the next day, she would pay me my wages. When I went she wanted to stop four shillings and six-pence. I asked her for what; she said, if I did not hold my tongue she would put me where I was before; I would not take less than my full wages. At the compter I sent to her for my money, I was almost lost for the want of it; I had nothing to support me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

That carrying the Money to the Bear, the Prisoner and Hughs were both gone; but the Prisoner soon came again, and would have had the Money, saying the Note was his, tho' given to the Porter by Hughs; whereupon he was seiz'd and committed; but Hughs, who was waiting the Success at another House, having Intelligence of his Comerade's Mishap, got away, and is since in the Marshalsea. Mr. Mead depos'd, that he had paid one Bill of 52 l. 1 s. which was sent by a Porter in August last; and had another sent from the Blue Posts in the Hay-market; but that being suspected, and one sent along with the Messenger, they who sent it were gone. The Body of the Note seem'd to be in the Hand of Mr. Barebone, the Duke's Secretary, and subscribed by a Counterfeit of his Grace's Name, both so exactly done, that the nicest Eye could not distinguish them from true.

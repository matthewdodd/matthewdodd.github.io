                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Asylum-terrace, Chelsea. On the 27th of March, at half-past nine o'clock, in consequence of information, I went out and stopped the prisoner going in a direction from my shop—I brought him back, and accused him of stealing a piece of bacon—he took it out of his basket, threw it down, and said, "There it is, do the best you can"—I found a piece of that description missing from my window—this is it—I can swear to it.</p>

I took the pri<lb></lb>soner into custody, and received this piece of bacon from the prosecutor—the prisoner had a basket with three more pieces of bacon in it—he said at first he had bought them, and afterwards, that he had had them given to him by his old woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I received the bacon from a woman I lived with in Spain, and who robbed me of my money and all—I accidentally met her in a public-house—she had this basket and the bacon in it—she asked if I had any dinner for Sunday—I said no, and she gave me the basket and bacon—she was intoxicated, and afterwards regretted she had given it me, and said, "Let me have it back again"—I said, "No"—she said, "If you don't, I will be revenged on you some way or other"—I said, "Do your best," and went out of the public-house with it, and ran as fast as I could, without the least idea that the bacon was stolen—I believe the very woman that gave me the bacon gave the prosecutor the information.</p>

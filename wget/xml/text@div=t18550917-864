I had known Richardson two or three years—he first came to me about this matter about a week or ten days before 5th Aug.—he told me that he knew a person in the silk trade who was in difficulties, and was afraid he should not be able to get on, as he had some bills to meet, and he had a large quan<lb></lb>tity of bobbins of silk by him—he asked if I should like to be a buyer of them—on 5th Aug. the two prisoners came, and Richardson said, "I have brought a few of them here just to show you; there is only twenty, there will be a large quantity if you are likely to do anything with them"—I asked what they wanted for them—they asked me a shilling a bobbin for them—on 11th Aug. they came, and said, "We have got 400 bobbins here to-day, if you will like to buy them"—I told them it was a thing I did not understand—I did not know the value of them, Richardson said, "You know I would not bring them if they were not worth the money"—I told him I did not understand the value of them, I did not deal in anything of the sort before, and did not know what quantity of silk there was—they said they were well worth the money, and there were twenty-four drachms of silk on the bobbins—they said there was the trade mark on the bobbins, some four, some four and a half, and some five grains—the bobbins were marked; that was what the trade mark was, as they told me, and they showed me this bill of parcels.</p>

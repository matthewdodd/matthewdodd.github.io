On the 24th of June, between five and six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked for a pair of shoes; I served her, they came to 4 s. 6 d., she gave me a 1 l. note - I went to the foot of the stairs, and called to my mistress for change, as Roberts, the shopman, was not at home; my mistress said she had none. I asked the prisoner to wait till my master came in, which she did - a customer was in the shop. I laid the note on the desk by itself. Roberts came in in two or three minutes, I gave him the note, he gave her the change, and she went away. After she was gone he made an observation of the note, and asked which way she went, I told him and he went out, brought her back in about five minutes, and asked her to wait while he went and enquired about the note, which she did. He went out - a gentleman came in, and while I was waiting on him she went away - Roberts returned in about five minutes, and fetched her back. He took up the note she gave me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. What did he do with the note - A. He put it in the drawer. I saw myself that no other note was there, and none were taken afterwards. She cried when she was brought back, and walked away while I was engaged.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. King. On the 24th of June I found the prisoner in the shop, the boy said she was waiting for change, and the note was on the desk - she was near enough to hear him. I took it up, and gave her 15 s. 6 d., without particularly looking at it. After the prisoner left I examined it more minutely, and thought it bad. I went out, overtook her in Newport-street, and brought her back. I told her I wanted her address, she returned to give it me. When we got to the shop I asked her if she had any more money, and she offered me a good note. I left that on the desk, and told her to wait while I enquired further about the other, and asked where she got the first one? she said her husband took it for his wages. I went to Mr. Thomas two doors off. In consequence of what I heard there I returned and found her gone - the good note was not there either. I went in pursuit, and overtook her, walking pretty quick across Bedford-street to Maiden-lane, brought her back, and gave her in charge. I just put J. R. on the note, and before I parted with it I marked S. M. C. for St. Martin's-court, and put it in my pocket - (looks at it) - this is it. I saw 15 s. 6 d. found on her, which I had given her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You put it in your pocket with one or two others - A. No, when I take a good note I put it in my fob, I put this by itself.</p>

            , No. 1, Castle-street. The prisoner came to our shop on the 24th of June, and bought a piece of nankeen for 7 s. 9 d. - she gave me a 1 l. Bank note, and I gave her change. I looked at the note and noticed the signature, C. Watts, on it - I then put it it in my till, after making a slit under the letter L. I am sure she is the woman. A young man who lives with me put another note on the top of it - I saw him do it. We had occasion, about a quarter of an hour afterwards, to take this note out of the till, I knew it directly to be the one she gave. In consequence of Roberts's coming, I went to his shop, saw her, and desired<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180027"></xptr>she should be detained till I returned for the note. I fetched it - (looks at one) - this is it; I am certain it has my mark on it. Our shop is next door but one to King's. I saw her there in a quarter of an hour, or less, after she had been in our shop. She was not there when I first went in - I returned, and found her in custody, I then asked her what became of my goods she bought and the silver? she said she did not know anything about me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not specify nankeen to her - A. I do not think I did. I cannot say there was no other note in the till signed Watts, but swear that is the note I took of her, by the slit which I made in it.</p>
               <p>JAMES HARRISON. I am a constable. I took the prisoner into custody at King's, and found 15 s. 6 d. on her, a pair of new shoes, and a bunch of keys.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GLOVER. I am an inspector of Bank notes. The notes are forged in every respect, and are not the signatures of Baker and Watts. They appear to be impressed from the same plate, and are of the same date, and Nos. 3276 and 3376.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Great Suffolk-street, Borough. I have known the prisoner four years - she kept a broker's shop in the New-cut. I was in the habit of working for her and her husband, and one day, when I brought some work home, two women were there, one of whom bought two small mattresses, and the other some chairs - it was about ten weeks ago. She desired me to sit down till she had done with them. I was in the habit of working for the woman who bought the chairs - I have seen her in Giltspur-street Compter this morning. She gave the prisoner a 1 l. note and some silver, and the other gave her a 1 l. note, and asked for change.</p>

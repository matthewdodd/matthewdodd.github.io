"He looked at it and said "Well, I did not notice that"—after that I asked him if he had any objection to Sergeant Fluister marking it—he said "No"—I asked him how it was paid, he said "Partly by cheque and partly in cash"—I asked him to show me the "heel," meaning the counterfoil of the cheque—he did so—it was for 182<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked again how was the remainder paid?—he said "In cash"—I remarked "It was a good deal of money to pay in cash," and he explained that having a lot of loose cash in the house he had used it for that purpose—I asked him if the cheque had been paid—he said he did not know, but would send round to his bankers and see—I suggested that he should stop payment of it if not paid—he agreed to do so, and sent his son with a note to the bank—his son returned and said it had not been paid, and that he had stopped the payment—the cheque was drawn on Stephenson's own account—I asked him who consigned the goods to him, and he said "Edwards"—I said "Have you the advices?"—he said "Yes;" and he produced two files of delivery notes, one, I believe, of the Great Western and the other the Midland—as to the advices he said he had heaps of them and he made search for them, both in his counting-house and in the inner office, but he failed to find any—my attention was called to this delivery note which was pro<lb></lb>duced before the Magistrate, and marked F—there were several of that description—I called Stephenson's attention to the name "Marshall" on it</p>

Trace such as have been sold and give notice to parties not to part with them." We showed Stephenson the telegram, and Fluister said "Tell us the names and addresses of those to whom you have sold the balance of the goods"—Stephenson said he would not do so—then he was shown the telegram, for which he said he did not care, but we must bring a great deal more of pressure to bear upon him than that before he would give up the names of his customers, and he said "It would frighten a little grocer to death to go and tell him that he had goods which had been obtained by fraud, but I will write to them and tell them not to dispose of them; or I will jump in my trap and drive round-and tell them personally, which will perhaps be the best way"—he also asked me "How much have you lost?"—I said "I represent about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth"—my own loss was about 94<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—one or two other gentle<lb></lb>men went to Birmingham on the first occasion—I gave them information—Stephenson's is a large wholesale place of business with a very varied stock, including, bacon, hams, boots and shoes, macintoshes, pipes, cigars, saddle-cloths, string, tea, coffee, sugar, rice, and cocoa; in fact, I do not think you could mention anything that was not in the place—I said "I should say you must have a very large experience to be enabled to dispose of them advantageously"—he said "I am the only man in Birmingham that can buy for cash and sell for credit, I have goods from all over the country."</p>

Thorn and Co. had given me the marks and numbers to enable me to identify their goods, and I found those marks and numbers still on—I took the name of Marshall to be the consignor, as I had found out in London that goods were sent in the name of Marshall—the date of the cheque did not excite my suspicion—I told Stephenson, in the first part of our conversation, that goods were traced to his premises.

               <p>what I said at the police-court is different to what I have said here, that is most likely correct, as it was sooner after the occurrence—I do not know whether I said "He said 'I am T.

I am an inspector of police at Manchester—I set a watch upon 18, Lever Street, Manchester, last Feb.—the name over the door was Lea—six men appeared to be doing business there—Leach was one—from inquiries I heard his name was Lea—I saw him very often for about three weeks—three men would sometimes watch at the Royal Archer when goods were delivered there—the goods were generally taken away to the London Road railway-station—the directions were first taken off—I saw Leach do it, and a man I saw here yesterday, Gold—I watched Gold go into the small office and commence writing and put fresh cards on the boxes—they were all served in the same way—saw the fresh address; it was "Messrs. Stephenson and Son, Dale End, Birmingham"—that was on the boxes of candles and the casks of jam—they were marked S. in a diamond—about the 26th Feb. I saw 60 boxes go off—according to my book they went to Stephenson's at Birmingham—I followed Leach and another man to Mrs. Mendonea's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am goods manager to the London and North-Western Rail way at Birmingham—Stephenson did a large business and transmitted goods from Birmingham and received them from London—in July some goods were lying at the station, which were consigned to Stephenson—they were five boxes of cocoa, three parcels of cocoa, seven casks of chicory, and 15 casks of white lead—Mr. Fluister communicated with me and I went to Mr. Stephenson on other business, and he said "I understand you have some gods at the station that there is some bother about?" I said "Yes." He said "They told me there is some<lb></lb>thing wrong about them, you had better hold them to the order of the consignor." I said "You had better give me that in writing at once," and he gave me this: "To Mr. W. J. Nicholls. Sir,—Please take notice that the goods consigned to us, now at your station, we decline to receive; you had, therefore, better hold them to the order of the consignors.—Yours respectfully, EL.

I am the eldest son of the prisoner Stephenson, and carried on business with my father for some years—I was 24 last August—my father has been in business at Dale End, Birmingham, as long as I can remember—we have shipping and other orders—the turnover is between 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 50,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per year—on account of the bankers' charges we are in the habit of pay<lb></lb>ing away cheques—we deal in general goods, such as grocery provisions of all kinds, and wines and spirits, and cigars—we generally buy for cash—I was present when T. Edwards's card was brought—Leach was not the man who brought it—he brought samples of tea, and father looked over them—I was not present when the order was given—there was an invoice—the traveller came several times—he did not give his own name—these 12 invoices came with the goods—I did not know of the name of Marshall till my attention was called to it—it is usual to put the carman's name on the delivery note—each invoice has the usual men. on it, such as "The above are duly forwarded by the Midland Railway Company to your address"—the goods were marked off against the invoices upon arrival—I was present on the 30th of July when the account was made up—the pencillings on the invoices were my father's, and the totals brought forward, and there is the receipt for the payment of that invoice to the amount of 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was present when that was paid, not when the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid on account—it is dated July 23, that was on a Monday—both are receipted as cash payments; the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is signed "W.

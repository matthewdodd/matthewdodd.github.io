               <p>I lodged in the same house with the prisoner and the deceased; the deceased was about nine years old; he lay in the garret over my head, as I lodge in the two pair of stairs room. While I was in bed, about seven o'clock, I heard the prisoner go up into the garret and beat the boy; he cried out terribly; hearing her coming down stairs, I got out of bed and peeped through the key-hole, and saw it was the prisoner who had been up stairs; soon after that the boy went down. I dressed myself, and in going out of my room I met the boy on the stairs; his head was terribly bruised; I saw no blood at all.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon. The deceased was brought to me on Saturday morning the 18th of April, the day after Good Friday; I examined the head and found it exceedingly soft all round; the skin was slightly discoloured: the contents I thought necessary to discharge. I should suppose it was occasioned by a fall, or a blow from some blunt instrument; all the upper part of the skull was entirely hollow; it was impossible to tell whether it was done by one or more blows; I took upwards of four ounces of blood out of it; I dressed it, and the child went home. There must have been a considerable deal of violence: he was brought to me again the next morning; I dressed him again, and ordered his head to be fomented; he was brought on Monday and I dressed him again; I did not see him again till Tuesday night; he was something worse then; and on Wednesday he was sent to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Mr. VALENTINE JONES sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon at St. Bartholomew's. The deceased was brought to the hospital on Wednesday the 22d of April; I saw him the next day, and perceiving the wound on his head, I asked him the cause of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he apprised that his case was very dangerous? - I apprehend not; he was not from me.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you must not mention any thing he said.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jones. I observed a wound and a discharge from it; it was an external wound; it did not appear to me to be a dangerous one; he had been brought on the Saturday preceeding to have the advice of the surgeons; I was present. Mr. Crane ordered the woman that brought him to get his head shaved, and put a spirituous application to it; and thought it would have subsided, and in all probability it would, if they had taken his advice. I have seen many cases of greater contusions that have subsided; but it was not done. I paid particular attention to him when he was in the house; there was but one or two days that I did not see him; he had a great degree of sever on him; the wound got worse; a large quantity of matter gathered, which induced me to make an opening to let it out; I was then in hopes it would have healed; but his sever continuing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160040"></xptr> very bad: there was no disposition to heal; I believe he was in the hospital eighteen days. I went into the country, on my return, I understood he was dead; it is difficult for me to say what was the cause of his death, but I believe it was owing to his bad state of health; I did not know his history before he received the wound; but I should think, abstractedly from the blow, that he must have had a fever on him; when I saw him I opened his head; there was nothing preternatural to be seen; there was no kind of fracture or any injury to the brain; I found every thing in its natural state, as a person would be in his perfect health; I think his death might have happened abstracted from this wound.</p>

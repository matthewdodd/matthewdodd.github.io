                  </hi>. I am in the employ of John Howell and Mr. James, in Waterloo-place, St. James's—there are four partners—the servants of the establishment sleep in No. 9—the shops are all connected, but not the dwelling-houses—I am connected with the jewellery department, which is No. 9. On Thursday, the 17th of October, the prisoner came there with a lady with a riding-habit on, between five and six o'clock, and asked to look at some diamond-pins—I showed him a tray containing a number of pins, and among them a ruby-pin, of the value of eleven guineas—he said he would take that pin, and I gave it to Arrow, the apprentice, who stood by my side, to place in a box for him—he then asked to look at some signet-rings—I showed him a case—he selected one, and desired it to be engraved with a Stork rampant by the following day—he then said he wished to look at some scarfs and ladies' aprons, which are in another part</p>

               <p>of the establishment—I sent Arrow with him to show him where they were—before he went he desired me to wait, and he would return to me, and in the meantime to make out the bill for the whole, but not to come to him, for he would return to me—I then lost sight of him, he being in another part of the shop—I waited a few moments, and in consequence of what a young man from the shawl department told me, I found he was gone from the place—I went to the outer door of the house, and found the prisoner about to mount his horse, and the lady bad got on her horse—they had both come on horseback—I had not missed the pin then—he said to me that I was to send the bill up to his house at eleven o'clock in the morning, in Hertford-street, May Fair—I had the ring to engrave for him, and was not aware that he had the pin—when I got back to the shop, Arrow gave me some information—next morning I sent a young man named Marsh, to Hertford-street with the bill—he brought back no money—I have not got the bill.</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprentice to Howell and James. On the 17th of October I was in the jewellery shop with Webster, when the prisoner came in—I saw the ruby pin—Webster gave it to me—I placed it in a box, which I put on the counter, and while doing so the prisoner asked to see some rings—Webster showed him some—he selected one, and desired Webster to have it engraved for him, and gave him a card of address where he was to send it when it was done—he then said he wanted to see some scarfs—after the prisoner looked at the signet-ring, and before he spoke about the scarfs, I saw him take the pin out of the box, and place it in his stock—Webster was standing by the side of me at the time, but the prisoner had his back to him—I went with him to show where he could get the scarfs, introduced him to the person who showed them, and then returned back to the shop to Webster—I did not tell Webster what I had seen—I saw the prisoner next day in Duke-street, Manchester-square, followed him some distance, and lost sight of him—on the Saturday week I saw him at the English Opera-house, and gave him into custody.</p>

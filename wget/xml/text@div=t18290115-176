I obtained a search-warrant on the 25th of December, to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150078"></xptr>search for some holly on the prisoner's premises - I could not find that, but I found this bed; the prisoner was not at home - he has a wife; she does not live there - he lived by himself; he said before the Magistrate that he received the bed from George Yates, a man not yet in custody; that he took it out of Mr. Crighton's warehouse window, and took it to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was that taken down in writing? A. I do not know - there were no hopes held out to him in my hearing.</p>

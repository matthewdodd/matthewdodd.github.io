                  </hi> I am a labourer, and live in Victoria-street, Padding<lb></lb>ton—I met the prisoner in Holborn on Wednesday week—he was a stranger to me—he asked if I would have a glass of ale—I said I did not mind, and we went into a public-house in Cannon-street and had a glass of ale, and there came in two or three more men, and one of the men had got a lock, and he made a bet with the prisoner of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he would not open the lock before the other man could count ten—the prisoner had no money with him, and he asked me to lend him enough to make up his bet—I said I did not mind—he did not put any money down himself—he said I should have mine as soon as the bet was over—I put down 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; they went on with the bet—the prisoner said, I will give you your money as soon as it is over—the prisoner showed me the lock, and he opened and shut it to me several times—when I had put my money down he tried to open the lock and he could not do it—the man that was betting against him then took the money and went out—I got hold of the prisoner and would not let him go—he said, "I will pay your money; what do you want with me"—I said, "Well, give it me"—he then said, he had not got any money and could not get any—I had nothing to do with the bet—if the prisoner had won I was not to have got anything—I was going down to the docks, where I expected to find some gold that had been sent me by a cousin—I had told the prisoner that.</p>

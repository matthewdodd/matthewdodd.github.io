                  </hi>. I am in partnership with William Whitehead, and have a shop at 15, Fore-street, in the parish of St. Ann, Limehouse. On the evening of 20th March, I sent my young man out to measure—I left thirty-two or thirty-four yards of doeskin, worth 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the counter, and went into a</p>

               <p>side-shop—after a little time I heard a noise made by lifting the latch of the hatch of the shop-door, I ran into the shop, and the doeskin was gone, and the hatch, or half-door, was wide open—it had been fast when I left, and the doeskin had been lying about seven feet within the hatch-door—there is a passage nearly opposite my house, which leads to Ropemaker's-fields—I afterwards saw the prisoner in custody—the front-shop is part of the dwell-ing-house of my partner; it joins by internal communication.</p>

On 20th March, about eight o'clock, I was passing from Ropemaker's-fields to Fore-street, Limehouse—I saw the prisoner come hurriedly out of a court with some cloth under his arm—I followed him up Ropemaker's-fields, and when he got a certain distance, he commenced running—I got pretty close to him—he turned a corner, and went into a marine-store shop, to which there is a coalshed attached—he had the cloth when he turned the corner, but when in the marine-store shop he had not—I asked him what he had brought in—he said, "What do you think?"—I said, "A roll of cloth"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—the door from the shop to the coalshed was open, and there was a quantity of coals and sacks lying about—the marine-store dealer was in the shop talk<lb></lb>ing with the prisoner.</p>

On the 4th of December, about half-past twelve o'clock in the day, I followed my son into the kitchen; I got in, by unlocking the door with the key - there is a long passage leading to the kitchen; I had locked the kitchen-door at nine o'clock, and at eleven I went there again - every thing was safe; I locked the door, and took the key - about quarter of an hour before I went there again, I gave my son the key, he went for his hat; I went down at half-past twelve o'clock; my son had left the key outside the door - we found it still in the lock, and the door locked; I found my things tumbled about, and the door locked; I found my things tumbled about, and these articles were taken out of the drawers and laid on the dresser - I accused my son of moving them; he said he never touched them - I remained there till my husband went to the closet to draw some tablebeer, and then the prisoner walked out of the close, said she begged pardon, she wanted to speak to the good woman of the house; she was an entire stranger - we keep a school, and cannot always have the street door locked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILIPS. Q. Did not she say something more? A. She said a man had taken her into the yard, and used her in amost cruel manner - and said it was a stout man, and afterward she said it was my son; he had not come up stairs for the key, but took it down, as he left the school-room.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. I got the key from my mother, and came down with it in my hand from the school-room; I went into the kitchen about twenty minutes past twelve o'clock - every thing appeared secure; I only went to the window and took up my hat - I did not notice the things on the dresser; I went out, leaving the key in the door - I returned in five minutes, and picked up a basket of potatoes; I returned to the kitchen, and in ten minutes went out to change a 5l. note; I returned in twenty minutes, and found my father and the prisoner in the kitchen - I had not seen her there before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your father had been giving you some warning? A. Not respecting this person; he has given me lectures, as it is a father's duty to do - he has warned me about women, but I am not that way inclined -I had not been out that morning till then; I have seen the prisoner once, about ten months ago, in Bridge-street, quarrelling with another woman, and an officer of Bridewell called me to assist in parting them - I did not speak to her.</p>
               <p>Q. You remember her well? A. I can remember any one who I have seen before; she said I had been with her, but I strongly deny it - I never saw her, but at the time I mention; I did not tell her where I lived, and have never seen her since - my father never found me at all prodigal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say he had said he would turn you out of doors if he found anything? A. Never - the prisoner did not accuse me on the spot; she did at the watch-house, and she accused my father before me - he was not present, but three officers were; she at first took me for the officer; she said this much, that it was the gentleman belonging to the house, and that he had ill-used her; that it was au elderly gentleman - and then that it was a pock-marked gentleman, in a blue coat; I had not a blue coat on - my father is not pock-marked, nor am I; she did not mention my father's name - I swear I never had any intercourse with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040083"></xptr>her; I never told her my father had threatened to turn me out - he has cautioned me, as it is a parent's duty; if I read my Bible, I cannot help seeing a reprimand against women - my father never saw me with women, or given that way.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the watch. I took the prisoner in charge; when I went into the kitchen Mr. Budd said she had entered the house, got into the kitchen, and moved things from the drawers to the dresser; I took her to the watch-house - she there begged to be allowed to go to the water-closet, and directly she went in an officer said, "You are doing wrong;" he opened the door, and said she was putting something down there, and I took out of the pan these two common keys, which I tried to the kitchen-door - one of them opens it; she said some old man, pock-marked, took her into the house, and left her in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been intimate with this young man for ten months; he has given me a trifle of money - he gave me encouragement to be more sociable with him: he said he objected to go to a house, but when his mother was out he could go to his apartment with me; I met him on this day as the children were coming out of school - he said, "My father is just going out - come here and wait in the kitchen a few minutes till I go up and get the key to open the door, and I will speak to you;" I said I was in a hurry - he said,</p>
               <p>"Wait, for I have not seen you this fortnight;" he went up, came down again, and opened the door: his mother called him up to get change - he said,"Wait here, and if my mother comes down go, into the cupboard, or I shall be turued out of the house;" I staid a few minutes, and hearing somebody coming I went in - his father came to the door, and he ill-used me; I said,"Wait till your son comes back, and I will give you a proper understanding how I came here;" the father dragged me about: I said, "If you will let me stay here till I can give you a proper understanding I shall be thankful;" both mother and father ill-used me - the son came in; I applied to him for assistance - he held up his hand, and said, "Don't say any thing," and so I did not, thinking he would speak the truth to his mother privately, but at the watch-house he turned round upon me, and said he did know me, and then he did not know me; I told him to speak the truth - he said, "Don't say any thing - my father won't hurt you."</p>

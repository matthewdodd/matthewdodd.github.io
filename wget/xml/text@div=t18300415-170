             re-examined. I do not exactly know how many parcels I received that evening: those loaded from Wood-street were put into the boot - Moss and Hewitt assisted me in loading; I locked up the boot at Wood-street; the parcels the carriage of which are not paid are generally tied together, but whether they were on that night I cannot say; it was Moss' duty to bring the Coventry parcels to me - I kept the key of the boot, and did not leave the coach between London and Coventry, except at supper time; I kept the key of the boot - we arrived about half-past six o'clock in the morning; I saw the way-bill before I set out, but we do not take much notice of the parcels - the book-keeper at Coventry compares the way-bill with the parcels; I am not aware of any Coventry parcel leaving the coach, from the time I had the key till I got to Coventry - I do not recollect opening the boot after I left the Peacock. I believe this to be the waybill by the date of it (looking at it) - here is a parcel directed to Mr. Burton; it was the duty of Astel, the bookkeeper at Coventry, to compare the parcels with the way-bill - a porter examines it with him.</p>

               <p>Q. Does the guard do it? A. Sometimes - I cannot tell whether I did it that night; I read it very seldom - I do not recollect whether this parcel was missing that night - sometimes they do not call them over; it was missing afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you hear of it being missed? A. On the Saturday night, as I came up again, Astel said a free parcel was missing, and inquiry was made about it some days after; the boot would be opened at the Three Cups, Aldersgate-street, if they had parcels - I see by the way-bill there was one; I generally stand by the boot, and take all the care I can of it; it was not opened at the Peacock that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to say that nobody but yourself opened the boot at the Three Cups, and when you received the parcel you locked it? A. Yes, my Lord.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Do you think it resembles it? A. I can only see the top of one letter like his writing; it is an open hand - I do not believe the writing on any of the notes to be his.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Look at this paper with the words "Jones, Finsbury?" A. This I believe to be the prisoner's.</p>

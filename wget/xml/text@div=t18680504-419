                  </hi>. I am employed by the Mint—on Monday afternoon of 27th April, I went to Dudley Street, with Police Constable Brannan, two Inspectors and two Sergeants—my attention was called to the prisoner by Sergeant Ackrill—I followed him and he was seized by Brannan And Ackrill—he resisted very much indeed—Ackrill took from his right hand these counterfeit crown pieces—I then said to him, "My name is Brannan, you are suspected of having counterfeit coin"—he said "I believe these are bad, but you will have to prove that I intented to utter it"—at the station Ackrill took from his waistcoat pocket five other crown pieces wrapped in paper as they are now, and also this florin and sovereign wrapped in paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked him where he lived, he said, "That you will have to find out"—I said "You need not trouble yourself, I know where you live"—I had had him under observation for some time—he gave the name of William Thompson, finsbury Square—I said "Where you don't live"—I afterwards went to 160, Albany Street, Regent's Park; a room was pointed out to me—Sergeant Matthews found a counterfeit shilling and a number of fancy costumes, which is the subject of another indictment—the crowns all bear the date of 1818—I was present when he was told about the shilling being found at his house, and he said "I know it was."</p>

At my dinner hour, when the policeman found me, my intention was to go and find the person who put them in my pocket; I could not find him, and was going back to put them behind the fire, when I was taken.

On Sunday night, the 13th of November, I went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock - I was the last person up, and fastened the house up myself; I bolted the street door at the top and bottom, and a chain in the middle - I locked the parlour door, hung the key just inside the bar, then bolted the bottom door of the bar; there are two doors to it - I locked the top door; the back door of my house has no fastening, neither lock nor bolt - I got up next morning just after six o'clock; it was dark - I had a candle, it was not light enough to see a person's countenance without a candle in the open air; I found the bottom door of my bar unbolted - I unlocked the top door, went in, and found the till out of its place and empty; it was on a shelf immediately under its proper place - I had left four sixpences and some halfpence in it- they were gone; I missed two bottles off the mantelpiece, then missed my hat, and a pair of shoes, a tablecloth, towel, aprons, two sheets, and a bag, containing pieces of new linen and other things - they were all taken from the bar; I then went out of the bar, and in the passage found a pair of pincers and a pair of woman's shoes - I then went to the parlour door, and found the box of the lock had been forced off, and and old chisel there, which did not belong to me - she must have got over a partition between the parlour and the bar, which does not go up to the top by twenty inches; it is about six feet high from the floor, but there is a seat close to it, on which a person could stand, reach to the top, and get on a cupboard on the other side, and let themselves down; I went to the street door, found it unbolted, and the chain undone, but the door was shut; it has a spring lock - a person opening that could let themselves out and shut it after them - the prisoner had lived as servant to my first floor lodger for about six months, and left about eighteen months ago - I saw her on the Sunday evening, before this, pass along my passage, and go down stairs; the lodger left at the same time as the prisoner, and there was nobody in the house whom she could come to see - I do not know what she came for; I sent a boy to tell her to come up stairs - she came up, and went out; my wife, in my hearing, asked her what business she had there - she laughed, and said she wanted to go down stairs<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010012"></xptr>(meaning to the water-closet) - it was between ten and eleven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Your back door has no fastening, where does it open to? A.Into a little yard down stairs; a person could not get into that yard without going through my house - there is a chapel behind my house; a person in the yard could not get into the street without getting over a wall, nearly three stories high - I have no kitchen below, only a cellar, which is kept locked - I did not look into the cellar the night before the robbery; I have eight rooms - a person might conceal themselves down stairs in my passage; I, my wife, and three families live in the house - I value the property at about 40s.; I gave the pincers, chisel, and shoes, to Handley - I secured my windows as well as the door, and could find no place where any body could possibly have got in.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On Monday morning, the 14th of November, between four and five o'clock, I was on duty in Long-acre, near James-street, Covent-garden, and saw the prisoner coming from towards Newport-market; I could not know a person at that time without a light - she had a canvas bag on her head, and a hat and tea-kettle in her hand; I stopped her, and asked why she was moving at that early hour is the morning, and where she was coming from, or going to - she said she came from John's-court, Piccadilly, and was going to No.8, Duke-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields; I asked who owned the hat she had in her hand - she said her husband; I then asked what she had got in the bag on her head - she said her husband's shirts and his wearing apparel; I said I knew no John's-court, Piccadilly, I thought all was not right, and should take her to my superior officer for investigation - I took her to the station-house, and on examining the bag, the first thing I found were two bottles of liquor filled up, and a table-cloth partly full of things; I turned the contents of the bag out, and found all the articles which I now produce - she told me the bottles contained cordial belonging to her mistress; I asked who her mistress was - she refused to tell, but said her own name was Mary Elton; she was taken before a Magistrate, and remanded to Clerkenwell prison -I took her there a pair of shoes, which the prosecutor gave me; she said they were not her's - I took off the shoes she had on, and brought them home; I have had them ever since, and the other things also - they have been tied up, sealed, and locked up; I observed to her at the station-house that she had a pair of man's shoes on - she said they belonged to her husband; I have also a chisel, and a pair of pincers, which I got from the prosecutor.</p>

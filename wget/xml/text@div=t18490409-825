                  </hi>. I live at Croydon. I received five packages of half-pence and pence about five weeks ago from Mr. Lewis—I wrapped them in my horse-cloth, and laid them on a load of dung in front of my cart—I saw them safe by Newington Church—I missed them when I got up to the Telegraph public-house at Brixton-hill.</p>

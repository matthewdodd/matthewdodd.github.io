            (to Eliz. Brooks.) Have you lost any thing?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Yes, a strip'd Cotton Gown, and a white short Cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. When.</p>
               <p>Brooks. The 26th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. From whence were these Things taken?</p>
               <p>Brooks. From my Room in King-Street.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Brooks. About Six o'Clock in the Evening I sent a little Child out for a Candle; I went down Stairs and miss'd it, about five Minutes after the Child came in.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I open'd the Street-Door without a Gown; and when I look'd out, before I had Power to ask any Question, the Prisoner said she had lost a Bunch of Turneps.</p>
               <p>Q. She lives then in your Neighbourhood?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Yes, Sir, facing of me. I said to her, Did you see any body come out of my House? She said, she could not look after my House, for she herself had lost a Bunch of Turneps, and she seem'd to take it amiss that I should ask her about any Persons coming in. When the Thing was talk'd of, she, the Prisoner, said, Mrs. Brooks has been taxing me about it. She said I should never hear the last of it. The next Day I sent for her over, for very dishonestly People use her House; I said to her, if you can tell me any thing of my Gown, I shall be oblig'd to you; but she told me I should never hear the last of it. The next Day I went into Rag-Fair, and I found it in Rosemary-Lane, as I was going along; it was hanging in the Window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the Gentleman that you lost it?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I told him it was my Gown, and I desir'd him not to sell it. I ask'd him, if he had such a Thing as a white Short-Cloak, which they had.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they give any Account of the Person that brought it thither?</p>
               <p>Brooks. When they described the Person, it gave me the more Suspicion. Please you, my Lord, this same Woman, the Prisoner at the Bar, was in Rosemary-Lane, and this Woman by; the Prisoner ask'd, if she knew where she could sell a Gown and Cloke; whereupon she carried her to her Master; they told her, they hop'd she came honestly by it; she answer'd, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she taken up?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Yes; but denied before the Justice that she either took it or sold it.</p>

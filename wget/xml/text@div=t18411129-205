                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, living in Aylesbury-street, Clerkenwell. I was at a sale in the Strand on the 19th of Novem<lb></lb>ber, and bought a lot of lead, some pullies, and a truck—the prisoner was present—it required two men to take down some machinery—I sent the men there, and on Friday I went—the men told me the prisoner had been for the lead—I had not authorized him to take it—I have seen it since at Mr. Clark's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. Mr. Cowan was not the buyer of these goods—Mr. Sherman bought them. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. Mr. Sherman bought it, and I bought it of him—I paid the auctioneer for it and have the receipt.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. At the "knock-out" it was offered for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told Mr. Cowan I would give 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, but it was not ready—I considered that I bought it fairly of Mr. Cowan. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. Not a single word passed between us on the subject—if he had purchased it he would have bad the order to get it, but I had the order in my pocket.</p>

I took the prisoner—he told me where he had sold the lead—he said he heard Mr. Cowan offer the lead for sale on the day previous, that he had not the money then, and he took the liberty of going the next morning and getting it—he sold it, thinking to get a few shillings by it—that he had gone to Mr. Cowans, and offered the money to Mr. Cowan's son.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, of 36, Bridge-street, Greenwich—on Saturday night, 11th November, the prisoner came to me to pay 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and she gave me a half-sovereign, and I gave her change—as I was going down stairs, I met the witness Carter coming up—when I was half-way down, she said, "The woman is robbing of you"—I ran upstairs into the shop, ran behind the counter, and she said, "That woman has robbed you"—the prisoner said, "I have only been round the counter to take a biscuit or two"—I looked round the flour-shelves, and missed 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which was there when I</p>

               <p>went down—I accused her of robbing me, and she denied it—I gave her in charge on the following Monday—the reason I did not give her in charge before, was that I had not any one to look after my shop.</p>

I should not have prosecuted—I had not anything to drink on that Saturday night—there was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. there, half-a-crown, two shillings, and a sixpence—I have not a till—I am quite sure the money was there while the prisoner was in the shop; I received it a minute before I waited on the prisoner—the other persons went out as I served her—I laid it down behind—I am not in the habit of putting it in the till—I know Mrs. Carter as a customer—we were not more friendly than I have been with the prisoner—I cannot deny that I have had a drop with her—some-times I got a pot of half-and-half—sometimes I take it in the room behind the shop, and sometimes in the shop—that night she came in out of Union-street—there is a thoroughfare through the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am wife of Charles Carter, of Greenwich—on Saturday night I was going to the prosecutor's shop; I went in the back way—I met Mr. Partridge on the stairs—I said, "I wish to pay my account, Mr. Partridge"—when I got in the parlour, I could see Mrs. Hockley in the shop—I saw her arm brushing the silver off the counter into her hand—it was a little side counter at the back—if I was standing at the counter, the silver would be behind me—she put it in her pocket—Mr. Partridge after<lb></lb>wards came up stairs—I said, "That woman has robbed you, Sir"—he went round the counter, and said, "Yes, you have taken 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—she said, "No, I merely went round the counter and took a biscuit or two"—on the Monday night I was fetched to Mr. Hockley's house—the prisoner was there—a policeman said, "You saw this woman take some silver out of Mr. Partridge's house?"—I said, "Yes"—she asked Mr. Partridge on Monday night if he</p>

               <p>would forgive her?—he said he must see Mr. Hockley—I did not see the policeman till the Monday night, and then I repeated to him what I had seen.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

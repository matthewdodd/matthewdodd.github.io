                  </hi>. I am single. I became acquainted with the prisoner at the latter end of Dec, 1842—I was at that time writing for the un<lb></lb>stamped weekly press—or rather preparing, articles for the press—they were not original—I employed the prisoner to copy for me, and he continued so employed till the 16th of March, 1843—he had not been in my employ more than a fortnight, when he made advances towards me—he was a man in a very degraded position of life; and I rather repulsed them—he induced me to visit Mr. and Mrs. Wheatcroft—they told me a great deal about Mr. Goore, and from their representations, I was induced to say that if I could feel con<lb></lb>vinced in my own mind that his wife was dead, I might perhaps meet his advances—Mrs. Wheatcroft had told me that he had been married—he said himself, when he came to me, that his wife was dead, that he had ascertained that for a fact—he referred me to the Wheatcrofts as persons who could give me some account of him—I did not require him further in my employ, and as he said he was only disabled from serving himself through the badness of his dress, it was said if I could advance him money he would be able to estab<lb></lb>lish himself in some ostensible employment—I advanced him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for that purpose—I considered it still necessary that further inquiries should be made respecting his wife; and Mrs. Wheatcroft's father was employed to write a letter to some person who they thought capable of satisfying me—the prisoner afterwards told me, as the result of the inquiry, that his wife was not dead, but she was in a very bad state of health—I should say that was about the middle of June—I was very indignant towards him for the deception he had practised on me, and instructed Mrs. Bate, the landlady, to shut the door against him—he was not present when I told her that—he used to be there requently—he wandered the streets for ten days and nights after that—he told me so—I saw him again about a fortnight after ordering him to be re<lb></lb>fused admittance, but he called once on me, and very frequently came in front of the house, and excited alarm among the neighbours against me—the next time I saw him was when he was relieved from the workhouse, where he had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184405060036"></xptr>
               <p>been deposited—that was twelve or fourteen days after directing him to be denied—he again prayed admission to the house, and said he was very sorry for his conduct—I told him that was quite impossible, that I could not admit him after the way he had acted, and if I felt disposed to do so, Mrs. Bate would not—he wrote to Mrs. Bate—she said, in my presence, that she was very sorry for what had passed, and she had no doubt he felt he had acted wrong, but he would do better for the future, and under the circumstances she could not refuse him coming as usual—I did not agree to that, but I submitted to it—that must have been on the 12th or 14th of Feb., 1843, I should say—he then came to the house again, and followed his employment the same as before—he still had the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he boarded at my table, but having followed up his annoyances in front of my house, and excited the curiosity of the neighbours, anonymous letters were sent to the publishers, and I received an intimation that my engagement would cease—I lost my engagement to the press—I consider he had something to do with it—I did not learn that from him, but from other parties—I should have taxed him with it, but he was so harsh a man, I was fearful of doing so—about that time he wanted me to marry him—I told him I could not do so, in fact, I should not, because I was not then convinced that his wife was dead—he said he would ascertain as soon as he possibly could, but he could not do it quickly, he did not know where she was—I told him I wished him to leave my employment, his annoyances were quite disagreeable, it was necessary he should seek employment with a different person, especially as my employ<lb></lb>ments were likely to cease—he said he would not do so, he had been so as<lb></lb>sisted by me, it was impossible he could make a return, and if I could not marry him, I ought to come to a determination to do so as soon as I was con<lb></lb>vinced his wife was dead—he enforced it on me, and I said I would do so as soon as his wife was dead—he said he should go to Mr. King, of Red Lion<lb></lb>square, to ask him to draw up an agreement, as he did not think there was sufficient authority in anything I might draw—the agreement was that I would marry him as soon as I was convinced his wife was dead—this is the paper—it is Mr. King's writing—this is not the agreement I am alluding to—on his return he brought me a letter relating to the law of divorce—I have destroyed that letter—we lived together as man and wife—allow me to ex<lb></lb>plain—he told me Mr. King's advice was that we should enter into a closer contract, for the law of divorce was so much out of the reach of the poor man, that the legislature had recently framed a new law in favour of persons situated as he was—that he had not seen his wife for five years, and it ap<lb></lb>peared from his statement that she was a very bad woman—I said I was very unwilling to believe it, it was something very novel to me, but I certainly should like to make myself acquainted with the fact, and I had no objection to visit Mr. King—I went with the prisoner to Mr. King, who was an at<lb></lb>torney, at No. 17, Red Lion-square, but is now in the Queen's Bench prison, and he recapitulated in a very plausible manner all the prisoner had said about the new law—I had a very great objection to the prisoner, because he was very hateful and detestable to me, from his principles and habits, and every obstacle I could throw in the way, I did—he saw that, and was very severe on me indeed—he said that my conduct showed that I had an inten<lb></lb>tion to <hi rend="italic">jilt</hi> him, for he had brought me to a respectable man who was giving him legal advice, and upon that authority I ought to act.</p>

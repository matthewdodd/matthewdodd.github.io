I laid hold of him, but the other man with a truncheon struck me behind the head, that I was obliged to let him go. I got home as well as I could, all in a gore of blood; my landlord and landlady were up all night with me endeavouring to stop the blood but could not. In the morning I saw the prisoner go by; I told my landlord that was one of them that had robbed me. He and the constable pursued him, but lost sight of him, and did not take him till three is the afternoon. I saw him next day before justice Welch, in Litchfield-street, then he was examined and committed.</p>

            . I am a staymaker in Parker's lane; the prosecutor lives with me. On the 6th of May, a little after twelve at night, he came home all in a gore of blood; he could hardly come in, he repeated the circumstances of the robbery as he has done now. We could not stop the blood till a surgeon was sent for next morning. He said the man that robbed him was a short thick man with brown cloaths, and brown hair, upon which I suspected the prisoner, who I knew before by his using a public house just by with bad people, and going backwards and forwards. The next morning between nine and ten o'clock I saw the prisonerin the street with some other men; they appeared to be in liquor; I bid the prosecutor look at them, and see if either of them were the men that robbed him; he pointed out the prisoner, and said, that is the man in brown cloaths, I will swear to him. I heard the prisoner say they were going to the Turk's head, in Dyot-street; I sent for

I watched, thinking they would return, till about half after two o'clock; then the prisoner came to a publick house about six doors from my house; I sent for Wood, and we took him, and carried him to the round house. The next day he was taken before justice Welsh, there he said, he never saw the prosecutor before in his life.</p>

               <p>Carter. A moon light night, and there were two lamps just by; it was light enough to distinguish the man: I know the prisoner is the man by his hair, his cloaths and his visage; he was dressed in the same cloaths he is now, his hair hung as it does now, unless it has been cut shorter.</p>

On the 15th of February I gave him fifteen pairs to press and bone. I went up stairs next day, and there were only fourteen pair; he said the other three were down in the work room; I went down, but they were not there; I went up, and said I insisted on finding them; he said,</p>

            . I was the prosecutrix's forewoman. On the 15th and 16th I gave the prisoner some stays to finish; I missed three pairs from one lot, and four from another. Those produced are what I gave him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The stays are made by my daughter; the room I worked in was used as a bed-room, and every thing was in confesion - a man there said he would prig all he could lay hold of - and one of the witnesses is a common prostitute. The prosecutrix often authorised women to pawn goods for her at that and other shops.</p>
               <p>MARY TOMPKINS re-examined. I swear they are all my property; his statement is false - I never employed him or his wife to pawn goods. She pawned things twice without my knowledge; I did not object to it, but gave her the money to get them out.</p>

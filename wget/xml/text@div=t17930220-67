               <p>I am a porter to Mr. Green; I saw the prisoner take the cheese on Friday, I don't know what day of the month, about a month ago, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; I saw him go to Mr. Hartshorn's cart and take the cheese out of the cart, he had another partner, the cart was standing by Mr Hartshorn's door unloading, he had another partner, and he gave it to that man, I saw him do that; I stopped this man and gave him to Mr. Hartshorn, the other man dropped the cheese and went off; this man was never out of my sight, he stood up along side of the cart and took it out; he stood up on the road and put his hand up, and took it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200142"></xptr>out of the cart, the cart was low, he could reach up to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who packed up the cheese? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell this to any body? - I gave notice to Mr. Hartshorn, he was at home, I went in to his shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the cheese? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of that young man that is here now, Jones? - I do not recollect whether he was at home or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there many other cheeses in the cart? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose cart it was - It was Mr. Hartshorn's own cart; I knew the cart, his name was on it.</p>
               <p>Court to Jones. When had you first notice of this robbery? - I was in the counting house; I did not see the robbery; my master desired me to go and get a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a cart at the door when you went out to get a constable? - The cart was there, it was unloading, it had been at the door about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of the cheese? - Yes, it was brought into my master; who brought it in I cannot rightly tell; all the cheeses in that cart were my master's property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had been at a cook shop; as I was coming along home, I came along Tower-street, as I came along this man came past me, and then as he turned back again he turned me into the cheesemonger's shop, and told the master I had taken a cheese out of the cart.</p>
               <p>Court to Fitzgerald. Are you sure that you saw him take the cheese out of the cart? - I am.</p>

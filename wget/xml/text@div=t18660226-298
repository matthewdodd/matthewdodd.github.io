I live at 42, Union-street, Middlesex-hospital—on 25th January, I went to a public-house in St. Martin's-lane, at about half-past 7 o'clock—after I had been there some time, at about 9 o'clock the prisoner came in—I had known him before, and we had something to drink together—a little after 11, another party was drinking with us, and they took my watch out of my pocket, more for a lark than anything else, and I said, "That won't do for you, it is not good enough, it is only a Geneva"—the prisoner was in the front of the bar, and they all saw the watch—it was not taken away—after I left the house, I went to Dean-street, and some one very much resembling the prisoner came up to me, gave me a push, snatched my watch, and made off with it—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Sam</hi>, don't touch me," or something of that sort; but he snatched it away, and made off with it quickly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know the prisoner very well? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have been upon terms of friendship and drinking with him, but not of late years—I had been drinking very freely on this occasion with him—the man who took the watch away, came up behind me—he did not answer me when I spoke to him—the prisoner certainly looks very much like the man I was drinking with, and who committed the robbery—I knew what I was about.</p>

On the night of 25th January, I was on duty, and had just passed through a court leading from Dean-street to Great Chapel-street, when I saw the prisoner passing me, at about a quarter to 12—he had his hands in his pockets, and was just beginning a sort of slovenly careless run—he seemed to be pretty merry, and I did not say anything to him—about a minute after, the prosecutor came down and told me his watch was gone—I went after the prisoner, but could not, overtake him—the prosecutor had evidently been drinking, but he knew what he was about.</p>

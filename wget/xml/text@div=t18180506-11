On the 2d of April I sent her with a note to Col. Scott, to know how Mrs. Scott was, and offering to set up with her. She brought me word that they would expect me to sit up the next evening. On the 3d of April I asked her if she was afraid to be left alone in the house? she said she would rather be alone than have any person with her. About half-past nine o'clock at night I left home, leaving her in the house, with a strict injunction not to leave it; she said she would not. When I arrived at Col. Scott's, which is in Coburg-place, Brunswick-square, the Colonel was surprised to see me, and said he had sent a verbal message by the servant, to say he should feel obliged by my spending as much time with Mrs. S. as possible, but would not trouble me to sit up. I immediately returned home, suspecting all was not right. I rang the bell for nearly a quarter of an hour; at last the prisoner put up my bed-room window, and asked who was there? I said it was me. About five minutes elapsed before she opened the door. I asked her if she was gone to bed when I first came to the door? she said she was. When she opened the door she was dressed. She said she did not hear me at first. I went into the parlour, and instead of finding it as I had left it, I found a large fire, and the table spread with all the provisions that were in the house. I searched my own and her bed-room, and found no person there. I searched the garrets. When I came to the third garret I found somebody inside resisting my opening the door. I called out; she came up from the kitchen. I threw the door open, and found a man there. I asked him what business he had there? he said he meant no harm. I told him it was improper for him to be there - He said he was the girl's sweetheart, and had known her many years. I said that was impossible, for she had only lived a fortnight with me. I told him that finding him in that improper situation I insisted on giving him in charge. The prisoner said he had lived fellow-servant with her for three years. I insisted on giving him in charge. He instantly seized me by the throat, and attempted to throw me on the floor; he said he would not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181805060008"></xptr>be exposed. He attempted to get down; I got before him just by the street-door, and told him not to make any disturbance, for I insisted on giving him in charge. He seized me again, prevented my calling out, and made his escape. I followed him along Newgate-street - two officers secured him, and took him to the Compter; they then fetched the prisoner there, and found the articles stated in the indictment in her pocket. The key of a drawer, in which I keep property of great value, was found in her box. The man was discharged by the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Did you notice the prisoner's cap when she let you in - A. She was dressed as I had left her. The cork belongs to the decanters-they were not on the table, but on the sideboard. The table appeared to be disturbed, as if the things had been moved in a hurry. The pantry door was wide open.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 3d of April, about eleven o'clock, I was in Newgate-street, with Bailey, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw a man run out of Warwick-lane-we pursued and took him. The prosecutrix gave him and the prisoner in charge - I found the things in her pocket. I found a key in her box, which opened the prosecutrix's drawers, and the duplicate of two shirts, on her.</p>

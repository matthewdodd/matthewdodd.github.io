                  </hi>. I am a haberdasher, and live in Old-street-road. On the 12th of February the prisoner Anderson came to ray shop, and bought a yard of narrow black ribbon for 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he paid me, and went away—soon after, I missed fifteen yards of black gauze ribbon—I followed him—he had then got about two hundred yards from my house, and joined the prisoner Renew—I followed them both for about two hundred yards more—Renew then went into a public-house, and Anderson went into another</p>

               <p>haberdasher's shop—I then spoke to a policeman—Anderson came out, and joined Renew again in the street—the policeman took them, and brought them back to the haberdasher's shop—on Renew was found several pieces of ribbon, and amongst the rest, the piece which I had lost, and the piece I had sold to Anderson.</p>

On the evening of the 12th of February, about a quarter before nine o'clock, the prosecutor came and told me Anderson had been in his shop and stolen a piece of ribbon—I saw Anderson come out of Mr. Sears' shop, a haberdasher, in Fea<lb></lb>therstone-street—he walked up the street, and Renew crossed over to him—I went up, tapped Anderson on the shoulder, and said, "What have you been in that shop for?"—he said, "To purchase a yard of ribbon" I took him back—I found three duplicates on him, and Bean found on Renew a quantity of ribbons.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Was the playhouse very full the night you was there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The king and queen were there that night? - They were that night at the play-house; they were not come in.</p>
               <p>The theatre was very full? - It was.</p>
               <p>What part of the pit did you fit in? - Near the door.</p>
               <p>You was very much crowded? - Yes, very much by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did you detect the prisoner with your purse in his hand, or did you detect his hand in your pocket? - I felt his hand come out of my pocket; I seized him by the arm with my purse in his hand.</p>
               <p>On what side did the prisoner stand? - First on my right, then on my left hand.</p>
               <p>In the immensity of that crowd, how can you take upon you to assert, that the hand you felt in your pocket was the prisoner's hand? - By his crowding me very much: I am positive it was his hand; I had hold of his hand, and took the purse out of it.</p>
               <p>Can you be peremptory in swearing it was the prisoner's hand, under all the circumstances of the great crowd that must be there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was your purse dropped? - No, I took it out of his hand, and secured him directly.</p>
               <p>By what means was he secured? - By a constable, I believe.</p>
               <p>When you called out did you point the prisoner out to the persons to whom you called for assistance? - I did.</p>
               <p>- MARSHALL sworn.</p>
               <p>I was in the pit of the play-house: there was only Mr. Barrington between me and this Lady; she said Mr. Barrington had taken her purse; I charged him with it; he said he was a gentleman of fortune, and lived in Pallmall, and we were taking a gentleman's character from him; he was secured.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did she ever express any doubt about his being the man? - No; at the instant she said she had lost her purse, she held it up; I saw it in her hand, when she said she had lost her purse I saw him draw his hand away across his breast.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Was not the theatre much crouded that night? - It was.</p>
               <p>On what side of the lady did the prisoner sit? - On the left hand, and on my right.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the first falling to the ground of the purse? - It did not fall; I saw it in Miss Dudman's hand; she took it from him, as she said; I did not see her take it from him, but I saw his hand come athwart his own breast; and at that instant she declared that the man had picked her pocket of her purse, and she charged him with it, and so did I.</p>
               <p>Was no different relation given before the magistrate to what is now given before the court? - Only that he crowded Miss Dudman before that she complained to me; I desired him to be civil; he said, civility was not to be expected at that place.</p>
               <p>Did you accompany the lady to the magistrate? - I did.</p>
               <p>She was as peremptory to the prisoner then as she is now? - She was.</p>

               <p>My lord and gentlemen of the jury,</p>
               <p>The evidence which has come before your lordship and these gentlemen, I hope you will not think sufficient to convict a man of the crime of felony; I shall relate the transaction as briefly as possible: I was in the play-house in that part of the pit which is called the standing part, and it was so very crowded that the doors were obliged to be screwed up, in order to push the people in; the seats were all taken, and those that were in the standing part were endeavouring, as far as they could, to procure seats; the crowd was so great that they hurt each other; this lady was before me, making towards a seat; I, as every person then present, was doing the same, and she cried out that some person had their hand in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177701150012"></xptr> her pocket, and that she had taken her purse out of their hand; she looked round immediately and fixed upon me, at the same time that she was surrounded by many people, that it was a minute at least before she could turn round; I immediately professed my innocence, and called upon the company to declare, whether it was possible for such a transaction to happen without some person being privy to it, and seeing it, in such a place where so many people were assembled together; and every gentleman, who was present, was of the same opinion, and were unanimous in saying they were certain I was innocent. My lord and gentlemen, upwards of 5 minutes had passed in this altercation, and the noise in some measure had subsided; but some gentlemen, who had lost their property at the play-house that night, hearing a rumour, came immediately and declared, if there was a suspected person there, it was necessary he should give satisfaction and clear himself; that he should retire to some place and be searched; to this I assented, and was retiring at the time with several people who were there, when we were met by the constable, who told me I must go before Sir

            ; when we were there I was searched, my property was taken from me and detained for 8 days, and then returned, because no person could claim a single article; if the evidence this lady has given is sufficient to convict me of the crime, it is in the power of any one to take away the life or liberty of any person whatsoever; such a crime as this could never happen in such a place without some person being witness to it; the lady might have found a hand in her pocket, and her fear might make her believe the man had her purse in his hand and she had taken it out, but the crowd was so exceeding great that it was impossible to turn; the people were crying out they were so excessively squeezed, and I hope it will have weight with the gentlemen of the jury; I mentioned just now that it was so exceedingly crowded, that, if such a transaction had happened, it was almost impossible to fix upon the person; the lady, I don't mean to reflect upon her, but I am obliged to take hold of every circumstance, in order to extricate myself, the lady is blind of one eye; this I conceive adds to the impossibility of fixing upon the identity of a person; and I would beg leave to ask the lady if she is acquainted with a Mr. Groves?</p>
               <p>DUDMAN. I am: my lord, I received this letter from the prisoner.</p>

               <p>DUDMAN. I don't know his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>PRISONER. My lord, I admit that letter came from me: a gentleman came to Tothill-fields Bridewell, to see one of the prisoners in the gaol, natural curiosity prompted him to ask who I was, he was told; he said he was perfectly well acquainted with my prosecutrix, and had often heard her express her regret for the manner in which she had treated me; and he told me if I would address her with a few lines, as he said it was a disagreeable thing to appear in court, that the bill would be thrown out, and I should have no more trouble; this induced me to do it.</p>
               <p>COURT. You may look at the letter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am bar-maid to Mr. Brown, who keeps the Wrekin Tavern, On the 14th of November, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came for a pint of beer—he gave me a shilling, and I put it into the till among the halfpence—there were other shillings in the till, but not where I put this—I gave the Prisoner the change—I found the shilling was bad, about a minute after he was gone—I am quite certain it was the same shilling, I had thrown it among the halfpence, as I knew had not a sixpence to give him in change I did not pull the till out far enough to get at the silver—when I found it was bad, I put it into a glass basin on the shelf—I saw him again on the 16th and recognised him—I drew a pint of beer which he asked for, and kept it by me—he put down a shilling—I found it was bad—I said he had been before—he said he had not been in the house before, and then he said he had been there several times—I kept the last shilling in my hand, and give them both to the policeman.</p>

I was called in on the 16th of November, and took the prisoner—I received these two pieces of coun<lb></lb>terfeit money from the witness—I asked the prisoner where he lived, he said, "165, Brick-lane, Spitalfields"—I said, "You cannot live there, as my own father lived there thirty years"—not a word passed about Edman's putting the shilling among the copper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FIELD</hi>. These are both counterfeit, but not from the same mould—I was present during the whole time they at the office—there never was a word said about the shilling being put into the till—Edman said it was between eight and nine o'clock, and then it was corrected, and it was stated that it was between seven and eight o'clock.</p>

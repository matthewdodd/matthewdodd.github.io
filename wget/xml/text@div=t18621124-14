               <p>I served the prisoner with half a pound of steak, which came to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me half a crown, and not liking the look of it gave it to my shop boy to be examined next door—he gave it back to the prisoner, and said it was bad—the prisoner put it in his pocket, and asked me if I could change a sovereign, but I declined—he put down the meat and went away—I saw him that evening in the station-house.</p>

I live next door to Mr. Harmer, and am a boot-maker—Bushnell showed me a half-crown—I found it was bad, and marked it with my teeth—shortly afterwards the prisoner came in and asked me to change a sovereign—the boy followed him in and told me what he had been doing at his master's—I gave him the change and did not detain him, but Hudson and Mr. Harmer followed, and sent the boy for the police—after that the prisoner took a half-crown from his waistcoat pocket, and put it behind him in his hand—the constable searched him and found it up his sleeve—it was the same half-crown which I had marked a few minutes before.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 493). I found the prisoner and Mr. Harmer in Mr. Ocken<lb></lb>den's shop—the prisoner was charged with pawing a bad half-crown—I asked him for it—he remained silent, and I searched him, and found the bad half-crown in his coat sleeve—I asked him his address, and he said that it was not requisite—Mr. Hudson gave me a second half-crown—I found on the prisoner 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as he had the change which the boot-maker had given him.</p>

I am a detective police sergeant of Wool<lb></lb>wich Dockyard—on the 15th July I received information of the robbery—I went to the prisoner's house and saw the prisoner at breakfast—I told her I wanted her for stealing a quantity of forks and spoons from the doctor—she said, "I know nothing about it"—I searched her house, and in her box found this tablecloth (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and some other articles not mentioned in the indictment.</p>

I am a licensed dealer in plate and jewellery, at 34, Artillery Place, Woolwich—on 18th June the prisoner came in—I was too busy to attend to her, and she waited there about an hour and talked to my wife—I then asked what she wanted, and she offered me a fork and a dessert spoon—she said that her husband was a discharged pensioner employed in the Arsenal—I asked if they were her property—she said yes, and her name was Brown, of 23, Francis Street, that her husband had been living with a gentleman in the Crimea who was hurt in the war, and gave him the silver plate before he died, and, as she was going with her husband to Scotland, she wished to dispose of part of it, also of a chest of drawers and a good carpet—on the 26th June she came, with tears in her eyes, and said that she was sorry to say her husband had broken his leg, and was taken to Guy's Hospital—she brought a teaspoon and fork, which she said she was very sorry to part with, but she could not get any money—I bought them and put my initials on them, as I did on all I bought—on the 7th July she bought two forks, and said, "Mr. Fisher, I am very sorry this is the last of the plate I had left by that gentleman, but my husband is in the hospital.

I produce the plate.</p>

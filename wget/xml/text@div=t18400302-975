                  </hi>. I am a fisherman, and live at Barking, in Essex. On the 10th of February, we were going out from Barking town, fishing—our boat was in the creek going to join our vessel in the Thames—the creek is about two miles long—I had my jacket, shirt, and handkerchief in the boat—I left the boat in the creek about half-way between Barking and the ves<lb></lb>sel—when I came back to the boat these articles were gone—the prisoner was at work at the marshes at the time—these are my articles—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 328.) I found this property in the prisoner's possession in his own house—he lives three doors from the sta<lb></lb>tion—the Creek is at the end of Woodford-lane, about three-quarters of a mile from the heart of the town; but the boat laid up in the mud, as I was given to understand—the prisoner had got the shirt on his back—the pro<lb></lb>secutor said he supposed it was his—the prisoner pulled it off, and gave it to him.</p>

               <p>(The prisoner received a good character.)</p>

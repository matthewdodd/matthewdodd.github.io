                  </hi>. I am a ticket inspector in the employment of the North Metropolitan Tramway Company—on 4th July, about 11 o'clock, I was near Stratford Church, Broadway—I saw the prisoner get into a car—I watched him and saw him hustle an old gentleman, he stood in front of him and stopped his way and tried to pick his waistcoat pockets—the old gentle<lb></lb>man asked him to let him paas, he wanted to get a seat.—the prisoner did not move—in consequence of what I saw I told him if I caught him on another car I should charge him with attempting to pick pockets—he got into the very next car that followed—I went and told him that I should charge him, he ran away into a urinal—I called a Constable and gave him into custody—he then pretended to be drunk and could not stand; he was perfectly sober when I first saw him and also when he got to the station—he made no answer to the charge, except that he had lost his own watch.</p>

The prisoner was given into my custody by Goulston—he was told the charge; he said he—knew nothing about it and pretended to be very drunk—he was sober when he got to the station—after the charge was taken he said he had lost his own watch—his wife was close behind him and said he never had a watch.</p>

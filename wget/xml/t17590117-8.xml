               <p>Q. Where was your watch and buttons?</p>
               <p>Foy. The watch was taken off a place where it used to hang, and the buttons from out of a drawer; I knew Dayland before; my wife knowing the number of my watch, went to the Pawn-broker's to inquire for it; she found that at Mr Murphy's house; Dayland own'd she took them, for we suspected her; she was seen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175901170008"></xptr> to go up the stairs where we lodge. Before the Justice of Peace, she own'd she took the watch and gave it to Crouch to pawn.</p>
               <p>Mr Murphy. Crouch brought this watch to me; and after that the prosecutor's wife came said she had lost a watch with the same name and number; then I had her taken up; Dayland brought the buttons; Crouch was angry with Dayland, and said, How could you give me a watch that was stole; Dayland confess'd she stole it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that Crouch was innocent?</p>
               <p>Murphy. To me it did: for Dayland said nothing in answer to her question: but at last confess'd she did steal it. The watch produced in Court and deposed to by prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Dayland's defence. The prosecutor's wife lent me the watch unknown to her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor's wife. Did you lend Dayland this watch?</p>
               <p>Answer. No: I did not upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Crouch's defence. Dayland brought the watch to me, and said, a friend of her's desired she would get it pawn'd for some money; and I took it, and pawn'd it to that gentleman.</p>

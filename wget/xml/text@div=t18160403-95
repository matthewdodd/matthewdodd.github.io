            . I live with my mother, Hannah Griffiths, who is a widow a second time; she has two dwelling-houses, one is a public-house, which she inhabits herself; and she lets out the whole of the other in tenements, except the shop, which she occupies as a cook's shop; that shop I shut up at eight o'clock on the night of the 12th of March. I went there again between eleven and twelve, to see if all was safe and right. I was not in the habit of doing so; but I received information that that shop was to be robbed that night. When I went to the shop, I found it had been broken open; I found the cellar flap had the iron forced from it, and the shop door which leads into the passage was unbolted. I found the prisoner at the bar in the shop; I secured<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030055"></xptr>him, and called the watchman. I found the till forced open, and I found ten shillings and five-pence in copper gone; that was the money of my mother; it was taken out of the till, and the prisoner had got it in the side pockets of his jacket I believe.</p>

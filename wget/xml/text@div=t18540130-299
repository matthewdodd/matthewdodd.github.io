                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. John Walker, a corrugated iron merchant and contractor of works in different parts of the country. He bad servants engaged on the execution of works at Gravesend, for which he had contracted at Christmas—the prisoner was in his employ at Gravesend, as superintendent of the works—his duty was to pay the men wages—he had to send a statement of the money he should require for wages, every Friday—on Friday, 6th Jan., I received from him, in the ordinary course, a statement of the money he should require—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is in his writing—on the following day I gave a clerk of ours, William Neary, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to take to the prisoner, and it was the prisoner's duty to send up as</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. I am clerk and cashier to Mr. Walker. The prisoner had the superintendence of the workmen at Gravesend, and had liberty to hire a portion of them himself—Mr. Walker allowed him to have whatever number he thought necessary, and to arrange their wages with them; but he had to leave it for Mr. Walker's approval—the accounts are sometimes sent to Mr. Walker, and sometimes to me—it is very probable that this paper was posted on Friday afternoon—it is not directed to me—he may have had some private communication to make to Mr. Walker with respect to the works—to the best of my recollection, one of them was addressed to me—this endorsement is mine; I made it some little time after I had the paper—the amount here is 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that would be the amount to pay the men for a week's wages, but I do not know whether it was up to Thursday night or Saturday night—it is usual for us to pay them up to Friday night—we sometimes send by crossed check, but on Friday night the amount was sent down by a clerk in money—he changed the check—the prisoner ought to send us on the following Monday an account of how he had expended the money, but sometimes it came on Tuesday—the second appears to be a mere copy of the first—they some<lb></lb>times differed—he puts down at a rough calculation the amount he thinks he shall require for expenses, and we send him the sum he requires by the paper—if the expenses are more, he would pay it out of his own pocket, but that has never happened, according to our books—I know he has always had a balance in hand belonging to Mr. Walker—he has never overpaid—I am certain of that—we should know the exact amount on Monday or Tuesday, when he sends to us—if there was a balance in his hands, I should give him credit for it in the next account—the first paper means, "I want so much money;" and the second, "I have paid so much money"—in the corner of the paper you will see that the prisoner was allowed three guineas salary besides other expenses—(<hi rend="italic">the papers being read, were both alike; they were headed</hi>, "Week ending Jan. 7th," <hi rend="italic">and contained the following entries</hi>—"Hotchkiss, 5 days and 7 hours, at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" "Mullander, 7 days at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" "Wren, 7 days, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" "Blackman, 7 days, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" "Wheeler, 5 days at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" <hi rend="italic">then followed the names of other workmen</hi>—"Bagshaw,"" Rhodes," <hi rend="italic">&amp;c., amounting to</hi> 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., <hi rend="italic">to which was appended a paper containing charges for "hire of boat</hi>, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; loan of ladder, 8 days, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; lodgings, travelling expenses, stamps, paper, &amp;c., <hi rend="italic">making a total of</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.")</p>

I concealed myself to watch the placewhere this book was—I saw the prisoner take it, and the gloves, from thewater-closet—he went up stairs—I followed him, and before he got to thebed-room I caught him, and asked what he was going to do with the book—he said "Going to read it"—I asked what he intended doing with the gloves—he said he found them on the dung—heap, in the farm-yard—he was veryviolent; he pulled out a knife, and attempted to open the blade of it.</p>

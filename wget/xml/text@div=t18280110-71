I said Yes; he said, "I have been getting coals;" he lived at a public-house near, and Brookes is in the prosecutors' employ; I asked Brookes if his master allowed him to sell coals at that time of night; he said, "No; but I hope you will say nothing about it;" I said, "You had better go and see your master;" Mahoney then wheeled the coals away towards his master's house; I walked a little way with Brookes; he said Mahoney had given him 1s. for the coals; he then said he had not locked the shed, and must go back; I walked home, and soon afterwards Mr. Fergusson gave charge of Mahoney.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. Are you in Mr. Fergusson's employ? A. Yes, sometimes; I suppose there were about two bushels of coals in the sack; I know Spratley - he was taken up; Brookes bore a good character - he was considered an idiot; persons used to push him about, and ill use him; Mahoney was in the service of Spratley, who is a publican; he is now in prison, I believe.</p>
               <p>JOHN FERGUSSON. I am in partnership with Mr. Cook - Brookes was in our service at the coal-warehouse; I also keep the Gun tavern; I never allow Brookes to send coals out; he appeared rather an idiot, and might not know what he was doing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you believe he might be persuaded to do wrong, by artful persons? A. Yes; at times he was very bad.</p>

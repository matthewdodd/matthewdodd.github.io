                  </hi> I am shopman to Mr. Arnold, In Watling-street. On 10th March, the prisoner came to my master's shop, from half-past seven to a quarter to eight, for a penny suavely and a black pudding—I told him we had no penny suavely, they were 1 ½<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he would take two black puddings, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a bad sixpence—I bit it in half—I kept it my hand, and told him it was bad—he put his hand in his pocket, took out 1 ½<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said that was all the money he had—I saw there was another sixpence between the three halfpence, and I told him he had one—he said he had not—I went round the counter, and told him if he would not show it me I would give him in charge—he then put his hand into his pocket, and put it up to his mouth—I took hold of him and sent for a police<lb></lb>man—during that time he dropped two other sixpences—I picked them up and gave them to the policeman, and the two halves of a sixpence—I gave the prisoner into custody—I do not know what because of the sixpence he had in his hand—I cannot swear which of his hands he put up to his mouth.</p>

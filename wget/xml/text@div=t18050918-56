               <p>Q. Did he sleep there? A. Yes; about half past nine in the morning he got up; he made the best of his way down stairs without paying for his bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the bed come to? - A. One shilling; I immediately pursued after him down the yard into the street, and caught him by the coat near the end of Abchurch-lane; I said, young man, you have not paid for the lodging; he asked how much it was; I told him, and he gave me the shilling; I told him he must come back with me to see that all was safe; he came back with me into Lombard-street, and there he told me if I would not say any thing he would tell me; he said he had got the sheets; I told him I would not say any thing to any one in the street, if he would come quietly; he came back with me to the chamber-maid's room; he there drew them from his small clothes; I produce the sheets.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) I was in the employ of John Brown, the husband of the prosecutrix, who owed me money for my employment; I applied to him for some money, and he told me to take these articles, but not to mention it to any person - he had the duplicates and money, which the wife has construed into a charge of felony, as I am the chief evidence against the said John Brown for felony, from which he has absconded.</p>

             re-examined. Q. What has become of your husband? A. I do not know, but the shuttles were in my house after he left home - my husband was not indebted to the prisoner for work; my husband was charged with buying some articles, but I do not know any thing of it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CRAWFORD. I live in Quaker-street, Spitalfields. The prisoner is a material witness in a case of felony against John Brown, the husband of this woman; I had the prisoner in custody for offering a tool which his master sent him to sell, and which I lost from my premises- his master absconded out of the office; he had two examinations - it was said there was a person who could prove he bought it, and then he absconded on the 28th of September.</p>

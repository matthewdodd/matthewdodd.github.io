               <p>Are you sure that is the hammer cloth you bought of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - Yes, I have seen him at the place where I bought it several times.</p>

               <p>Court to Rabbits. What might you give for that cloth? - Five shillings.</p>
               <p>Court to Coachman. What is the value of that cloth? - When it was lost I think it was worth one pound ten shillings, it was a new cloth, it had not been above ten months in wear, there was a double row of fringe, and a row of worsted lace round it.</p>

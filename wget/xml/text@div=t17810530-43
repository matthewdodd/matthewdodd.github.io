On the 25th of May, about four in the afternoon, the two prisoners came into the shop, to purchase a very small quantity of clear lawn; my shopman and I shewed them several pieces: there were other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300045"></xptr> customers in the shop, and there was a parcel of muslins lay on the other counter: after they had looked at the lawn, they ordered a half yard to be cut off, which came to 15 d. I saw Price fingering the muslins on the other counter: I went round to her, to shew them to her, and to tell her the price: she said it was too dear: I then went round to the other woman, to cut off the lawn, and take the money. When they were going out, the man informed me, one of them had taken a piece of muslin. I ordered the shopman to follow them: after some time the shopman brought them back; and afterwards two others were brought in: as they were going into the parlour, through the shop, a piece of muslin, about three yards, dropped; but I do not know from whom.</p>

I went and informed my mistress; and, in about five minutes after, she came back; and then the other two women were brought in, and I saw the muslin drop from one of these two women.</p>

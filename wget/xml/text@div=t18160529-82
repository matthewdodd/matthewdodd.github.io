On the night of the 27th of April, I and my wife went out at about eleven o'clock to the grocers' to get some tea and sugar; Nixon and Burn's near Union-court were the grocers. I observed the prisoner at the bar and two more men standing near the door at the grocers shop. We went in; but it was so crowded, that we thought it best to go a little further, and return. We then went up <placeName id="t18160529-82-crimeloc450">Holborn-hill</placeName>

Before I could render any assistance, he said loudly, d-n your eyes, who are you shoving at; my hat was knocked off, and I had another blow. I stooped for it, and felt a sudden snatch at my fob, and by the feel, I thought my watch, chain, and seals were gone; the chain was broken, and left the watch behind. The watchman was very near the prisoner, and would not stop him, nor spring his rattle; the prisoner ran towards Gloucester-place, and the watchman would not follow him. I look upon it Browne snatched my chain. I was surrounded by girls and different people; I cried stop thief, and after that, I went to the pawnbroker's, and told him how I had been used, and the officer advised me to go to the watchhouse, and Mr. Brand and some more City officers went round until two in the morning; I afterwards saw Mr. Barnley. The next time I saw the prisoner was about five o'clock in a public-house at Cow Cross, on Sunday, the 5th of May; that was in consequence of what my son told me. The prisoner refused to go with the watchman, and asked what for; he was told for the robbery on Saturday night; he said, Thursday night, Friday night; but he did not like Saturday night at all. I never found my chain or seals again.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I was with my husband at the grocers; I observed these men near the grocer's shop door; I knew the prisoner well; he has bought hats at our shop. He and two other persons came up to us near Gloucester-place; they came a breast of us, and the prisoner at the bar first struck me a violent blow; I was going to say, Browne are you tipsy, when my husband cried out murder, watch, and I heard his hat fall; I called out also, and the watchman could have stopped him if he chose, but he did not; and we pursued them up the back alleys to Gray's-inn-lane; but lost them; we could not find them. Then we went into the pawnbrokers, and my husband went about with Mr. Brand all night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About three months ago, Mr. Barnett bought a ring of me, and he bought it quite on hazzard, and gave me ten shillings for it, which was spent in gin, and I and my wife and child used frequently to call in at his house, and have a drop of gin; and he told me this ring was not gold; and he said, when he got made a petty officer, he would false swear my life away; and he met me after that, and told me he had been robbed; and on the Sunday following he had me apprehended. I had been buying some roses for my wife, and I went up Church-lane to Mr. Poole's, and Mr. Barnley came in, and said, I was his prisoner.</p>

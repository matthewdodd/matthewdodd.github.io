I told him I only drove it for Mr. Mackrel. - He then demanded my Money; I said I had none; with that he punch'd me in the Face with his Pistol and broke my Head with it, and turn'd my Pocket inside out to search, but could find no Money. I got from him once, but he fetch'd me again and beat me. I got away a second time, and ran to my Master Mackrel, and told him how I had been abus'd, and so I crept into the Waggon; I was hardly well in, when the Prisoner came riding up, and said, Damn your Blood, here I am again.

             how he had been abused, a Man came galloping up to us with Pistol in Hand, and said, Damn ye, here I am again, and what then? - I left him and Eastman disputing together and went round my Horses. The Highwayman rid after me till he came so close, that one of his Horse's Feet stood upon one of mine; I ask'd him what he meant by serving me so? He demanded my Money; I gave him my Bag, which had in it two half Crowns, a Shilling, and some Halfpence. He did not meddle with my Waggon, but when he had got my Money he rode from me to Mr. Sadgrove, whose Waggon was about four Lugg* off. - I can't swear the Prisoner is the Man that robb'd me: I had no Lanthorn, and it was not light enough to see his Face, and besides I find I was mistaken as to the Colour of his Horse, for I thought he rode upon a black Horse, but others that were assaulted by the same Man, say it was a dark bay Horse. So that all I can be positive of is this, I was robb'd by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173305100007"></xptr> the Man who said, Here I am again. Early next Morning when I came to Kensington I found the Prisoner was taken up there, and I said then and afterwards before Justice Lilly, as I said now, I was robb'd, but could not swear to the Man.</p>

             Between 9 and 10 at Night on the 30th of April, as I was coming over Hounslow-Heath with my Waggon, I heard somebody galloping hard after me; I turn'd my Head and perceiv'd a Man upon a little serubbed Horse just behind me. Whose Waggon is this? says he. Why, says I, whose Waggon do you want? Damn ye, says he, let it be whose it will, if you don't stop it immediately, I'll shoot you thro' the Head: So I stopt my Horses, and then says he, What Passengers have ye got? Why what do you want with my Passengers? says I, Why I want their Money, says he, and damn ye I'll blow your Brains out, if you don't tumble 'em out of the Waggon-Tumble out my Passengers that I get my daily Bread by? that would be fine Work indeed! thought I to myself, so I told him I had no Passengers. Damn ye you lie, says he, - But however, give me your Money and your Bag and all. So I gave him my Bag with 3 s. in it. Now turn your Pockets, says he. I did so, but yet that did not satisfy him. For, says he, you have not so good a Hand at searching as I have; so he stopp'd down and search'd my Fob and my other Pockets himself, but he found only a steel Buckle, which he took away. He again enquir'd if had any Passengers? No, says I. You lie, you have, says he. Why then, says I, if you won't believe me, you may get off and look. And upon that he gave me a knock with his Whip, and knock'd me quite under my Horses; if they had gone forward I should have been crush'd to Pieces. Then he rode off, but he came back again presently, and giving me a cut with his Whip, told me, that if he should ever come to know that I had any Passengers that Night, I should never travel that Road again. Then he ask'd me where about the other Waggons were, I said I did not know. He told me I ly'd; and taking a Pistol out of his Pocket, he presented it towards me, and said, I have a mighty Mind to give you a Pill before I go. But he went off towards London without doing me any more Mischief. He had not been gone long before I heard a Pistol go off, upon which I concluded that he had overtaken the other Waggons. This was on the Monday Night; I got into London on Tuesday Morning, and returning thro' Kensington on Wednesday Morning I went to see the Prisoner, who was in Kensington Round-house. I told him I thought he was the Man that robb'd me: He desir'd me to do him Justice; Aye, says I, then I must hang ye; and so I went on upon my Journey and the Prisoner was sent to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Court. How far was you from Mackrel's Waggon when you was robb'd ?</p>
               <p>Sadgrove. His Waggon was 3 or 4 Lugg behind me; and he told me, that the same Man that robb'd me, had robb'd him and abus'd his Man but a little before.</p>
               <p>Mackrel. Yes, the Highwayman went directly from me to Sadgrove; I heard the Blow that he gave him, and was afraid he would have murder'd him.</p>

            . My Master Fullbrock and I were upon the Road to London; he drove the Waggon and I the Cart; I forgot the Day and Hour, only I remember it was on a Monday Night, and the same Night that Mackrel and Sadgrove were robb'd, tho' neither I nor my Master saw any thing of those Robberies, for we were a Mile or better before Sadgrove: But as we were coming out of Hounslow, the Prisoner rode up to my Master, and shook Hands with him, and said, Honest Countryman ! How go Affair, in our Country? There was a Light in a Room pretty near us; I suppose somebody was going to Bed, and by this Light I could see the Prisoner plainly: He parted from us, and we drove forward along Smallberry Green: By and by I heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173305100008"></xptr> a Horse coming hard behind me, I gave the Way; the Prisoner came up and cry'd, Damn your Blood, where's your Passengers ? I want their Money! Grand look, says I, and ask 'em for it. Upon that he beat me, and going up to the Head of the Waggon he tore the Tilt to look in; I struck at his Horse with my Whip, and his Horse moving a little, he pull'd a Pistol out of his Bosom and fired at me; the Bullet just graz'd on my Cheek; he did not stay to examine the Waggon after he had shot, but rode towards London. We hollo'd out to the Turnpike Men to stop him, but they let him pass; tho' when we came up they own'd they heard us hollo, but pretended that they did not know what we hollo'd for.</p>

            , Watchman in Kensington. On Tuesday Morning, between 1 and 2, I heard a Horse trampling and prancing at a Brandy Shop Door in Kensington. I went up to see who was there, and found the Prisoner sitting on a little bay Horse, and drinking Gin with a Soldier. The Newbury Coach had been robb'd but the Saturday before, and a Man then rid by me full Speed on such a Horse as I now found the Prisoner's to be. This gave me the first Suspicion that he was one of those concern'd in that Robbery, and made me take the more Notice of him. He ask'd me what a Clock it was ? I told him it wanted a quarter of Two. He pull'd out a Watch, and took the Case off to look at it. I thought by the Manner of his handling it, that he had not been much us'd to a Watch. As he put up the Watch I perceiv'd a Pistol in his Breast, and this made me conclude that he was one of the Highwaymen that robb'd the Newbury Coach, for I had not then heard of the Waggons being robb'd. So I resolv'd to get Help if I could and take him. But that he might not mistrust me I staid a little to drink with him, and then told him I was going to call up some Market People, tho', God knows my Heart, I was going for Assistance to apprehend him. I went to a Tallow Chandler's and a Baker's, and told their Men, who were at work, that there was a Highwayman at the Brandy Shop Door, and if they would assist me, we might easily take him. I hey seem'd then afraid to venture, and so I went back; but in a little while I found two of them (Paget and White ) at the Gin-shop. We drank two or three Quarterns, and then I was for taking the Prisoner, tho' they were still afraid, but I swore, - yes, I did swear, begging your Lordship's Pardon, - that now was the only Time, and so I seiz'd him, took the Pistol out of his Breast, and clapp'd it to him. He struggled and endeavoured to get his Hand to his left Pocket, and if he had done that, Gods knows, I might have been kill'd, for he had got a Pistol there, but others assisting me, we prevented farther Mischief. We had scarce well secur'd him before the Waggons came up. The Waggoners were overjoy'd to see him; and as poor People are apt to swear an Oath now and then as well as their Betters, they all swore that he was the Man that had robb'd and abus'd them.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Mackrel there then?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes, and Sadgrove too, and they both swore positively and heartily that he was the Man. - As soon as ever they saw him, they cry'd, This is the Rogue that robb'd us! But they were afterwards afraid to swear<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173305100009"></xptr> positively before the Justice, for as they constantly travell'd the Road, they thought their Lives would be always in Danger. The Prisoner was searched, and a Pistol ready charg'd and 8 loose Balls and some Powder and other Things, were taken out of his Pockets. The Pistol that I took from him was not charg'd. I suppose that was the Pistol he had discharg'd at one of the Waggoners: For one of them (a little Fellow) came in with his Face bloody, and said the Prisoner had shot at him, and that the Ball graz'd upon his Cheek. - So we carried the Prisoner to the Round-house 'till such Time as his Magistrate the Justice was up. - Have I told a Word of a Lie now? [To the Prisoner.]</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes, in saying that you saw me ride by you in Kensington on the Saturday before, for I was sick a-bed then.</p>
               <p>Court. How was the Prisoner dress'd?</p>
               <p>Clark. He had a white Horse-hair Wig, a light Coat, black Waistcoat and Breeches, and no Boots; I ask'd him why he rid without Boots, and he said he had worn 'em out.</p>

            . Clark the Watchman knock'd at my Master's Door about 2 a-Clock on May-day Morning, and ask'd me to go and take a Highwayman at the Brandy Shop. He said he had call'd upon Will. White too, but Will. was then lock'd in, and could not get out immediately. Clark went away and I call'd upon White, and took him with me to the Gin-shop Presently we heard Clark crying 2 a-Clock, and White call'd him in. - When we had drank together, says Clark, I'll go and seize him now, or he'll be gone. So he went to the outside of the Prisoner's Horse, clapp'd his Hand to the Prisoner's Coat, took a Pistol out of the Prisoner's Bosom, and holding it up, threaten'd to shoot him. - The Prisoner lean'd back, and went to put his left Hand to his Pocket, but I prevented him, and holding him by the Coat he fell back, and his Heels struck thro' the Brandy Man's Window. Two or three Shillings and a Six-Pence fell out of his Pocket. I kneel'd upon him to keep him down, and took a Pistol out of his Pocket. the Constable came, and then we ty'd the Prisoner's Hands and search'd him farther, and we found upon him two Handkerchiefs, a Snuff-Box, a Silver Watch, and a Pewter Watch (such as they have to please Children,) seven or eight loose Bullets, a little Powder in a Bag, a Fleam, a Silver Buckle, and a Steel Shoe-Buckle. In a quarter of an Hour three or four Waggoners came in, and swore he was the Man that robb'd 'em. The Soldier that was drinking with the Prisoner, said the Prisoner was a Gentleman, and went to push me from him, but upon my holding the Pistol to the Soldier, he march'd off.</p>

            . Paget call'd me from Work to help the Watchman. I went up, and looking at the Prisoner I saw no Pistol, and so was forgoing away; but the Watchman coming in, said, he was sure that the Prisoner had a Pistol. The Man of the House said, Have a Care what you do, fo r he's a Gentleman. - The Watchman seiz'd him, took a discharg'd Pistol from his Breast, and Paget took a loaded one from his Pocket. We pull'd him back, and in falling he broke the Window with his Feet, and dropp'd some Money. The Waggoners came in, and swore Damn him, this is the Man that robb'd us, - and this is his Horse.

            , Constable. When I came up to the Prisoner, White and Paget had just pull'd him off his Horse, and there was a Soldier, who, I believe, had a great Mind to rescue him. The Waggoners came in and said, This is the Rogue that robb'd us on Hounslow-Health and Smallberry-Green. Do you say that I am the Man? says the Prisoner. Yes, and will swear it too, said they. I ask'd him why he had abus'd the Waggoners? He said he had neither been upon Hounslow Health nor near it, not any farther on that Road than Kensington, where he then was. But upon searching him, we found, besides other Things, two Turnpike Tickets for that Day,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173305100010"></xptr> one for Smallberry-Green, and another for Kensington. And when he saw them, he said he did not know where he had been. I ask'd him what Business he had with those Pistols and Bullets, and he told me he was a Gunsmith by Trade. The Money that we found about him was 13 s 6 d. in Silver, and 2 d. 3 Farthings. The first Day that he was carry'd before the Justice he would confess nothing; but the second time, when he found he must go to Newgate, he own'd he had committed several Robberies on t'other Side of the Water, but still said, that he neither robb'd the Waggoners, nor. knew any thing of them.</p>

               <p>Court. What Facts?</p>

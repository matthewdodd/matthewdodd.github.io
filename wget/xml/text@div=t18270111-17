On the evening of the 29th of October, I was in Kingsland-road; there was a riot at a public-house - I staid there a little while, when three or four officers summoned me, in the King's name, to aid and assist in taking a man to the watch-house; I went with them, and placed three or four men in the watch-house; as I returned some children and women were screaming Murder! in <placeName id="t18270111-17-crimeloc104">Red Lion-passage</placeName>

               <p>The Court ruled that this offence did not come within the meaning of the statute, as, had the prosecutor died from the wound, the offence would not have been murder.</p>

               <p>me if I would lend him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to pay for two pictures he had given him to be framed—I communicated with my wife and said I would not lend it to him—I had no communication with him after he left on the 28th until I had a letter from him—the same day I received it I went to him and asked him what he meant by sending me that letter—he said he had put it into other parties' hands and had nothing to do with it—he said, "You owe me the money, and I shall have it"—George Westlake was with me—the prisoner said he had not received anything during the first six months, and only half-a-crown a week during the last six months—I said, "I owe you nothing, William, I paid you all; I paid you every week."

I am a hairdresser—I have been in Mr. Ginn's employment some time between August and September—I saw the prosecutor's wife pay the prisoner half-a-crown in Tothill Street—I am not sure whether there was one or two sixpences, and the rest in coppers—I think it was on a Friday, but I could not say.</p>

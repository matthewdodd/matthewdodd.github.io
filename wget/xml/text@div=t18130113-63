               <p>Q. Does he sell medicines there - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing the prisoner in his shop any time - A. I do not. I never saw him until I apprehended him on the 12th, at eight o'clock in the evening. I was extreme busy near eight o'clock; I had occasion to go into the back parlour. When I thought I heard a footstep I went into the shop. There was no person in the shop at that time. I returned to the back parlour, and when I got as far as the fire place, I saw a man standing with a child in his arms. I immediately ran out of the shop, end pursued as far as the church.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is this shop - A. It is opposite of <placeName id="t18130113-63-crimeloc366">Compton-street, near St. Giles's church, in the parish of St. Giles in the Fields</placeName>

               <p>Q. You went out, and what did you see then - A. I saw the prisoner go under a gateway, which is five doors from our house. I did not follow him under the gateway: I did not like to run the risk, knowing that part of St. Giles's. I then proceeded straight up, until I came to Lawrence-lane. The prisoner came out of Lawrence-lane, and by the description the man gave me, I put my hand inside of his coat. I perceived then there was a bottle. I secured the bottle, and took it out from under his coat, and laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What bottle was that - A. It is my master's shew-glass; it stood on the counter; it is full of refined liquorice. I had this bottle in the shop; it was taken from the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before you heard this footstep had you seen it on the counter - A. Not five minutes before I saw it. The value of the bottle is seven shillings, and the contents worth five shillings and four-pence. The prisoner said he had bought it for sixpence at the corner of the gateway. The bottle and the contents are my master's property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was coming along a boy overtook me; he asked me if I would buy that, and before I had time to look at it he ran up the gateway. I ran after him, and on my coming out of the corner of the gateway the gentleman catched me.</p>

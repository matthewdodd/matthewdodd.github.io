I am ostler at the Waggon and Horses, at Ealing—on the Monday before the 16th September the two prisoners and another man came up in a cart—the horse and cart was left at the door—they remained there over three hours—the cart and horse remained at the door the whole of that time, in my care—they were in and out of the tap-room and parlour—the tap-room is on one side of the bar, and the parlour on the other—there is a passage which leads directly through the house into the garden, and a staircase leading from the passage up to the first floor—my mistress's bedroom is the first door on the first floor—they were in and out of the house many times that day, and passed along the passage several tinea—on Monday, 16th September, they came again about 2 o'clock, in the same cart, the same horse, and the same harness—I am certain the prisoners are the same persons—they spoke to me many times—Clark asked me the price of beans—I had got three other horses attending to outside—we had no other conversation—they were in and out of the house several times while they were there—they came in and out of the front door, opposite the garden; along the passage which leads up the stairs—they had their refreshments in the parlour, on the left-hand side—they were there for about three hours on that day—they had some half and-half and gave me some gin, and then they went away like a shot—about eight or ten minutes after they were gone I received some information, in consequence of which I took a fly directly, and followed them to Notting-hill—I heard of them all along the road, and lost trace of them at Notting-hill-gate—before I went after them I went up to my mistress's bedroom, and saw that the cash-box had been broken open, and some odd silver and some papers were scattered all about the bed—the door of that room was usually kept locked—I took two police with me in the fly.</p>

I have two children in their coffins, and another not expected to live; my wife is waiting to know whether I shall be restored to liberty or not, and I can speak no more</p>

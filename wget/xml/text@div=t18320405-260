            . I was shopman to Mr. William Blackburn; the money in each case was his. On the 7th of December, the prisoner came and offered me an olive coat for 18s., which I agreed to lend her; she wished to pin it up herself, and I gave it her for that purpose; while I was writing the duplicate she shifted the parcel, and left this worthless black coat, not worth 1s.; I had agreed to advance the money at the time, and I did advance it - I gave the coat to her merely for the purpose of pinning it up; I would not have advanced the money, without I supposed she had left the olive coat - I did not intend to part with the possession, or my claim on that coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The coat I pawned that night, I redeemed in less than an hour. Witness. There was one night she redeemed a coat, and brought it back in less than five minutes, and this may be the coat; I cannot say that she did not redeem this one afterwards; she did not take a coat out that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 54, Nelson-street. I have known the prisoner rather better than three years—I lived with him that time—he is a shoemaker by trade—he lived at No. 6, Mount-street, Bethnal-green, at the time I lived with him—I left him on the 13th of October—I met him in Shoreditch on Sunday, the 18th, at half-past eleven o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing—he asked me how I was—I told him I was very well—he asked me where I was going—I told him not far—he asked me where I lived—I told him it was no business of his where I lived—he followed me to the corner of the church—I asked him what he was following me for—he asked if I would have any thing to drink—I told him I did not want any thing to drink, and refused to go—he asked me more than once—I walked away from him, and he asked me again—I still refused—I asked him what he was following me for—he told me he was not—he was close behind me—I pushed him away once or twice from me, and told him if he followed me or came to annoy me when I was at home I would <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> a pail of water over him—I crossed over, and went to my own door, No. 61, Castle-street—the door was shut—a little boy opened it who was in the house—when I got in I endeavoured to shut the door, but the prisoner prevented me—he caught hold of me by the shoulder and stabbed me directly—I cannot say where the first stab was—I had one stab on my shoulder—he stabbed me five times—he stabbed me in my throat—I saw the blade of something in his hand, but I cannot say what it was—I called out, "Murder," and laid hold of him by the neck-handkerchief—he said, "You b—let go"—he cut the corners of his handkerchief off with what he had in his hand, and got away—I bled very much—I was taken to the hospital, and was there from the 18th of October to about three weeks ago—this is the bonnet I had on at the time—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I and my husband lodge in the parlour of this house, in Castle-street. On the 18th of October, while I was in the par<lb></lb>lour, I heard the cry of "Murder," and went out—I saw the prisoner there—he had hold of the prosecutrix by the front of her bonnet, holding her down, and was stabbing her through the crown—this is the bonnet, and here is the hole in the crown—(<hi rend="italic">showing it</hi>)—I took hold of her by the shoulder, and said, "Come away from him;" and as I pulled her, he struck her with the knife in the back part of the neck—the knife drew out, and I pulled her away from him—I saw him strike her twice—she had hold of his handkerchief, and he said, "You b—let me go"—he cut the corners of the handkerchief off, and then ran out of doors down Cock-lane—I ran out after him as quick as I could, and he was stopped by a a miller.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 58, Castle-street, three doors from the prosecutrix. On the 18th of October, I was in my own house—I sent my wife out for something, and came out at the door to look for her—I saw a man and woman standing at the door of No. 61—I saw her go in first, and the prisoner followed after her—I heard a scream immediately after, and went to the door—I saw the prisoner struggling with the woman, and saw him draw his hand from her neck, and saw blood on his hand as he drew it away, and I distinctly saw the blade of a knife—it was like the point of a penknife—he instantly came out of the house—I followed him—I had a child in my arms at the time—I saw him taken, without losing sight of him.</p>

On 18th Oct., the prisoner Francis came for half a pint of porter—he gave me in payment a shilling—I put it in the screw, and bent it—I said, "This is a bad shilling"—he looked up, and said, "I am very sorry, but I am glad you found it out, it might have got me into trouble"—he took the shilling back, and paid for his porter with a penny—he then left the house—it was then about 5 minutes after 8 o'clock in the evening—my house is about 150 or 200 yards from the Three Goats in the Wandsworth-road.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Page, of 8, Pump Court, St. Luke's—on Sunday morning, about half-past 12, I was walking up Berkley-street, Clerkenwell, with Mrs. Maunders and Mrs. Parker—I saw the little prisoner (<hi rend="italic">Richard Tyrer</hi>) and the tall one (<hi rend="italic">Venamore</hi>)—I do not recognise the other one—there were four or five together—when I got up to them, the shortest one knocked up against me as if he was going to fall back—Venamore struck me in the eye and then in the back, and I was knocked down—I had a purse containing 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my hand, and when I got up I had not got it—I afterwards got it from a little girl, and it was empty—I have not seen my money since.</p>

Q.</hi> Were you alone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not—my husband was a few yards in advance of me, with Mr. Maunders and another gentleman—Mrs. Maunders and Mrs. Parker were walking with me—we had had a very great deal of trouble, having lost a child, and we had been to a raffle for my husband's expenses—it was at a public-house in Cow-cross—we were quite sober—I had nothing at all myself—I had never seen either of the prisoners before—there were a great many people running in all directions after I was knocked down—the policeman came up—I did not tell him I could not recognise the prisoners—I said I knew the tall one, the one that hit me—he was the first one taken—he was taken shortly afterwards, it might have been a minute or two—the other two were brought into the station afterwards, I should think somewhere about two o'clock.</p>

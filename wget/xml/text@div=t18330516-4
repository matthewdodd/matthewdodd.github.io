            , my father; it is in the parish of Shoreditch; I don't know whether it has any other name - I keep a ladies' clothes shop - on the 13th of May, at half-past 10 o'clock in the morning, part of a square of glass was pushed out of the window; I heard the glass fall; I turned round and immediately ran out and saw the prisoner, and took him - the glass was part of the window; I saw it had fallen inside; it had been cut the week before, and I had a piece put in, and it was made secure - on running out I saw the prisoner with his hand on a shawl which was in the window - it was just out of the shop; I took him and held him till a young man came who I gave him to; he is the boy; he struggled to get away from me - the shawl had been on the shewboard with several others.</p>

               <p>Jury to E. ALLEN. Q. Did you see the prisoner's hand in the act of taking hold of the shawl? A. Yes; he had hold of it, and was drawing it out - I laid hold of him within a minute - the shawl was about half way out of the window; I did not see him break the glass.</p>

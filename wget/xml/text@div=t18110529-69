On the 20th of April, about four o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed by a violent noise at the door; I have two doors to my house, one in Red Cross-street, and the other in Three Tun-court; I laid in bed, still I heard the noise, I looked out of window, I heard three men in the passage in Three Tun-court, trying to break in, and I heard them talking; I stood with the window up five minutes, with my rattle in my hand; I could see nobody to assist me. The watchman came down Paul's-alley; I said watchman, you secure the court, there are thieves breaking into my house; I knew it was no thoroughfare. The moment he came up two of his comrades that stood at the court, one ran up Cradle-court, into Whitecross-street, the other ran the other way; he secured the court untill I came down. We went up the court, and we took the prisoner, and the moment I opened the door I saw the moulding and the staple of the door were all forced off by an iron crow, we found the iron crow, it fitted the marks in three places. We took the prisoner to the watchhouse; when he was before the Alderman he had the offer to go for a soldier; he said he would sooner swing first.</p>

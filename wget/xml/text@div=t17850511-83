               <p>I live in Gracechurch-street, I am a haberdasher; on the 4th of November a young man that lived with me at that time, brought me some goods, and I looked at them; his name is Pearce; I went to the public-house where Pearce directed me, but before I went to the public-house the goods had been at my house a day or two, during which time somebody had sent two or three times for the money; I gave for answer that I suspected they were not come honestly by; when I came to the public-house, I saw the prisoner there; I told the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110103"></xptr> that I would be glad to know before I paid him for the goods, how he came by them; the young man shewed me the prisoner; the young man told me the price; I mentioned to the prisoner the price that had been asked of me for the calicoes, which was a guinea a-piece; I recollect that I told him there was a gentlewoman, a country shop-keeper, that is now waiting at our house, and she said she should like to have chintzes at the price; he said he bought the goods of a sailor, going to France; he did not know him; they were prohibited going in there: I told him to go before an Alderman.</p>
               <p>Court. They were called chintzes? - Yes, chintz patches, they were English manufactory; the prisoner said he came very honestly by them, he was willing to go before the Alderman; the Alderman ordered me to appear there that day se'nnight, and the prisoner with me; I attended on the Thursday, the prisoner did not attend; the chintzes were claimed by Mr. Schooley, as his property: the prisoner lives in Crucifix-lane, Bermondsey-street; I went there with a search-warrant, to a house which I was informed was his.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Council. These were chintz patterns, were not they? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Pearce is not here? - No.</p>
               <p>When you came to Smith to the public-house where were the chintzes then? - At my house, I did not carry them there.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. Have they been in your possession ever since? - No.</p>
               <p>Where have they been? - Mr. Flint left them at Mr. Harrison's, I know they are the same, there is no mark, but nobody else can have them but myself.</p>
               <p>You did not know you had lost any of those? - No, Sir, nor when I searched, I did not then find them missing.</p>

               <p>Court. We cannot convict on his single testimony; now as to the fact of their being stolen, there is not a single title of evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is not my duty to press the case.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. The question is as to the propriety of examining him at all.</p>
               <p>Court. You must lay a ground for examining him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you know of any callicoes having been delivered to Smith the defendant? - I know nothing of them.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had any conversation with Smith the defendant about three pieces of callico? - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I beg leave to say, for the sake of Mr. Schooley, that this man has made an ample confession.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no doubt but it is a very proper prosecution.</p>

I am a navy and live at Bristol—I came up to town with my brother on 2nd April—we arrived at Paddington about 2.30 p.m.—we met a man in the road and went with him to the Victoria public-house, where we saw the prisoner, but no conversation took place for awhile—the man asked us if we would have anything to drink—we had a quart between us and the prisoner had a glass of gin—about five minutes after we went in the prisoner asked the other man whether we were relations—I told him "No"—they were on each side of us—the prisoner said that he was up in London about a lawsuit with a railway company, and if he spent 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to-day he could get 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more to-morrow—he showed us a purse which appeared to have bank notes and sovereigns in it—we did not know that they were medals—we all four left the house together and went into Hyde Park, and the other man said "I shall wish you good day" and went up the first turning—the prisoner then said "If you are hard up, if you can show me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will give you another 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "We have only 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said "As you are hard up I will give you 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if you will lend me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and then he wrapped a coin up in a handkerchief and gave it to my brother and I gave him a five-shilling piece and afterwards 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had an odd halfpenny, and I said "I will keep that for luck"—we went into a public-house and he asked us what we were going to have to drink—we said "A pot of beer between the two of us"—he said that he would not have any—he wanted to retire, and asked the landlord if there was a back way—he went out at the front, and my brother took the coin out of the handkerchief and saw "This is a bad one"—I went out and found the prisoner behind a</p>

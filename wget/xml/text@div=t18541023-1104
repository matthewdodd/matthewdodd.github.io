                  </hi>. I live at the Ship and Bell. On Thursday evening 19th Oct., the prosecutor came to our house, and the two prisoners—I knew the prisoners before; I am sure they are the persons—I noticed when the prosecutor came in that he had a guard going to his waistcoat pocket—there was no one in the taproom besides him and the prisoners—I took him in some beer—I left the room, but peeped through a little hole in the wood, about as large as a thimble—it was a pane that had been filled up with wood, and there was a knot out of the wood—I could see distinctly into the room—I saw M'Carthy on the left side of the prosecutor, and Bryant at the door that they went in at—the prosecutor was about two yards from the door—I saw M'Carthy put her arm round his neck, and take the watch out of his pocket—Bryant walked up to her, took it out of her hand, and put it into her breast—one of them then said, "I won't be long," and they went out of the room, and stepped up the street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You saw this through a hole the size of a thimble? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I only saw the kiss twice—I remained there about five minutes—</p>

               <p>that was nearly all the time they were there—there was no one in the house, only my little sister, who is twelve years old—there was nobody in the house but she and I—when the prosecutor came out to pay, there was only my sister there—I saw a watch on the Thursday—it was a something I saw—at the time I did not know what it was—I afterwards heard that the prosecutor had lost a watch, and then I thought it was a watch—the first time I heard he had lost a watch, or lost anything in fact, was when he came out of the room—I knew the names of the prisoners before—if I had seen them take the watch I would have gone in and told Mr. Fanner.</p>

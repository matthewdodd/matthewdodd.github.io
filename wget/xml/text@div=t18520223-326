                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 136). On Sunday night, 15th Feb., I was on duty at East Ham, between 9 and 10 o'clock—I went towards the clock-house, and heard voices speaking inside the house—I waited, and heard foot<lb></lb>steps go up and down stairs—I waited a considerable time, and saw the prisoner come out of the front door, and looking about he saw me turn my light on—he ran off, and I ran and took him—he said, calling me by my name, "For God's sake, do not take me; it is the first robbery I ever com<lb></lb>mitted; I am very sorry"—I sprang my rattle, and my sergeant came and assisted me to take the prisoner.</p>

On that Sunday night I was on duty, and heard the rattle spring—I hastened in the direction, and saw my brother officer had got the prisoner in custody—he told me that the pri<lb></lb>soner had run away from the clock-house—I told him to keep the prisoner in custody, whilst I went and looked over the premises—I went and saw a quantity of lead convenient to the back-door—I took the lead, and sent for Mr. Holloway—I looked at the lead, and the part where it was said to have come from—I took a piece of lead from that part—I compared that with the lead I found down stairs ready to take away—it corresponded exactly, and here it is now—it is a fit, there can be no doubt about it—on the way to the station, the prisoner said, "It is the first robbery I ever committed; I am very sorry for it."</p>

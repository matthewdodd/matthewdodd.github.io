               <p>Q. When did she quit the service. - A. On Michaelmas day; she had lived there a month.</p>
               <p>Q. Before she left the service did you miss any part of your property. - A. Yes, a bunch of keys that belonged to some boxes of mine. I missed nothing but the keys till after she was gone; on the 4th of October I borrowed a key of my mistress to open my box, I missed my three one pound notes; it was all the money I had in the world. I made enquiry for my keys while the prisoner was there; she said she knew nothing of them. I never saw my notes again. The officer has got the lace frill.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BLACKMAN. Q. You are an officer of Bow-street. - A. I am. On the 5th of October I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280020"></xptr>to the prisoner's lodgings, No. 3, Southampton-street, Tottenham-court-road. Mrs. Clark brought her to the office in a coach. When I got into the coach she told me her lodgings was there; she gave me the keys; I found when I opened the box a bunch of keys, a lace frill; in one of the boxes I found a one pound note, Mrs. Clark said it was her servant's keys; the prisoner did not deny it. The prisoner said it was her note. I produce the keys, the frill and the one pound note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That one pound note was in my pocket, it was not in the box.</p>
               <p>Blackman. I took it out of the box.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Creswell. Look at these keys. - A. This one undoes one of my boxes. The ring without doubt is mine. The frill is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you tried that key. - A. No, not since.</p>
               <p>Q. There is nothing you can know your note by. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The money belongs to me, it is mine; I picked up the frill when I was making the bed, and the keys, I did know I had got them; I intended to take the keys back again, when I went to ask for my character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer in the army, and reside in Surrey-place, Hyde Park-gardens. On Monday afternoon, the 1st of Dec., between four and five o'clock, I hired a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in the Haymarket—I saw a portmanteau and a carpet-bag belonging to me put into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I waited at the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> door a short time while the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> was gone in for more luggage—I then went away for about three or four minutes, and on my return a man came and told me something, and I missed my carpet-bag from the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—it contained the articles stated—I afterwards saw it at the station—this now produced is it—I know the bag, and these things are all my property, and have my name upon them—I afterwards saw the prisoner in custody at the station—he then had on a pair of boots belonging to me—they were made in Canada—I know them to be mine.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On the 2nd of Dec, about a quarter to one o'clock in the morning, I found the prisoner in Long-acre—he had this carpet-bag in his hand—I asked how he came by it—he said it was his property, and he had come from Gravesend, and he was going to his brother in St. Martin's-lane, where he was stopping—I asked him again if it was his own property—he said, "Yes"—I saw the padlock was open, and it was tied at the top with string, or a kind of handkerchief—I took him to the station, and asked him where he got the shirts from—he said he had bought them when he was down in the country—I asked him if there were any marks upon them—he said, "No, no marks at all"—I looked at them, and found Mr. Dick's name on four of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 66, Leadenhall-street—on 19th November I was in Leadenhall-street, in the middle of the day, with this bag in my hand, containing a parcel and my purse—the chain was fastened to my arm—the prisoner snatched the bag, and broke the chain—I had got the purse between my fingers, inside the bag—there was from 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—the bag dropped, I picked it up, and the purse was gone—he did not run away with the bag, only the purse—he took out all the money and threw down the purse, there being some addresses in it which he was afraid of being identified by—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

I am a cooper, and work at 9, Bury-street, St. Mary Axe—on 19th November, in the middle of the day, I was in the shop, pull<lb></lb>ing some nails out of some staves, when the prisoner furiously ran in and knocked me down, staves and all—I can swear to him—a mob came round the door directly, and the prisoner was up in a corner hiding—they said</p>

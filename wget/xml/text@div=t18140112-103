I lost my money and the notes on the night after Christmas night. I met with the prisoner in Ratcliffe Highway. I went home with her to her room in <placeName id="t18140112-103-crimeloc539">Blue Coat Fields</placeName>

I am sure I had my money in my jacket pocket when I was in the room with her; it was in my pocket-book. I undressed myself and went to bed with her, and when I awoke at five in the morning the prisoner was out of the room. I called for a light, and said I was robbed. The prisoner then came into the room, and the landlady brought a light. I was not sober; I felt my money when I was going to bed. The prisoner laughed at me, and said she knew nothing of my money; there was another girl in the house; it was a bawdy-house. The prisoner was searched, none of my money or notes were found upon her. When she came in the room at five o'clock, she was not dressed; she said she had slept in another bed. The landlord of the house has absconded.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JACKSON. I am an officer. At half after six o'clock I took the prisoner into custody. I searched her, I found nothing on her. The landlord escaped. I took the landlady in custody. Dayley nor any of the notes have not been found since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor would make no agreement with me. I told him to go out of the house. I never saw any of the money. I would not go to bed with him; he would not go out of the house. In the morning when he called out he was robbed, I went into the room.</p>

I am a manufacturer of hair nets and crinoline, at 15, Finsbury-pavement, under the firm of Coldrey and Davies—I knew the prisoner four or five years in the employment of Messrs. Nathan and Sons—be came to me on 22d March, about 12 o'clock, I think, and said he wanted two dozen crinoline skirts for John Nathan and Sons, for a foreign order—I give them to him—I should not have given them to him except from the observation that they were for Nathan and Sons—the value of them was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw the prisoner write this receipt (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "March 22d, 1862. Received from Messrs. Coldrey and Davies, 43 crinoline skirts, at 43<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., J.

Coldrey and Co., for Nathan and Son, four dozen skirts"—I should not have parted with the foods bat for the supposition that they were for John Nathan and Co—I subsequently called on them to pay—that is how I found it out.</p>

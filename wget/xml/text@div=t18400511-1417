I am inspector of the letter-carriers at the Branch-office, Charing-cross—the prisoner was a letter-carrier there on the 20th of April—it is the duty of the carriers to sort the letters in the office, without reference to whether they are in their own delivery or not—these pieces of cover bear two stamps, one of the Islington office, and the date stamp of the post-office, St. Martin's-le-Grand—that would come to the office in Charing-cross</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police. On Wednesday evening, 22nd of April, I saw the prisoner in Gardener-lane station-house in custody, charged with stealing two letters—I asked where he lived and his name—he told me No. 18, Eccleston-street East, Pimlico—I asked what part of the house—he said the first floor back—I went there—I received a letter from the prisoner before I went, and a key of a box was taken from him in my presence, and delivered to me—he said the key belonged to his box—I went to his lodging with Mr. Gapes, and was shown the first floor back room by Kenny, the landlord—he opened the room door for me—it was not locked—in the grate among several other pieces of paper torn up I found these six pieces—there was no fire in the grate, but a piece of paper put there, and these pieces were behind it with several others—on putting them together, collecting them from the other pieces, I found it formed this address—the other pieces appeared to be parts of a letter smaller than this—there was a box in the room—I unlocked it with the key which he said was his—I found nothing suspicious there.</p>

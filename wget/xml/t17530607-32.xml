             my sheep were all gone, and the gates broke open. I made all the enquiry I could about them. I desired one Mr. Hill that buys skins, if he should see any such to take notice, and inform me, he knows my clip. On the 19th of May he sent me word he had three of them; I went and found them to be mine, and swore to them.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your clip?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. It is a clip down the face, and two clips on the off shoulder; they where red back'd sheep, but no brand mark; I bought them in Smithfield. As Mr. Hill told me he had the skins of the prisoner at the bar, I took him up, and search'd his house. I ask'd him how he came by them sheep, he own'd there were ten of them, and that he bought them in Smithfield. I ask'd him how he came to buy them with a butcher's mark upon them, (for when we butchers buy we have different clips and marks, so that we and the men that are used to the market know whose they are) he said he saw no mark at all. I ask'd him how he could handle them without seeing the marks, he said the sheep were not put in a pann, and that he cheapen'd them coming down Holborn, and bought them on Snowhill, in an alley; he said the same before justice Fielding, and that it was a little after six o'clock on the 11th of May, and brought them home about ten, and the man he bought of was nam'd Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the prisoner live ?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. He lives in Bloomsbury-market.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them ?</p>
               <p>Stevenson. Seven of them cost me 23 s. a piece, and three cost 19 s. a piece.</p>

            . I was employ'd by Mr. Stevenson to give an eye to these sheep on the 10th of May last. There came a gentleman to my house in the evening, and told me there were two men looking at these sheep, I went into the field, saw no man, but found the sheep there. The next morning, being the 11th, I went and found the lock of the gate broke, and the sheep were gone.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Hill that deals in sheepskins. I am employed to fetch them in for him, that is, to go round to the butchers with a horse, and carry them to market, where master sells them. On the 19th of May in the morning, about 10 o'clock. I met with the prisoner in Bloomsbury, he order'd me to take up three skins for him, and said to me, take no notice ; he laid them out at the door, I went and took them up, and carried them to my master at Wood's Close Market; they were very stale; I knew them particularly. I deliver'd them to Mr. Hill ; he took one of them in his hand, and said, this is Mr. Stevenson's mark, I had told him where I had them, and of whom. There was a clip down the face, and two clips on the off shoulder ; we observed the other two, they were the same. I took horse, and rode away directly by master's order to Mr. Stevenson, and informed him of it; he came and own'd them after market; we went and took the prisoner up. He first said he bought them in Smithfield, after that he bought them on Snowhill, in an alley, of one Brown, a Hortfordshire man; but he did not know the man. Justice Fielding ask'd him, what he meant by bidding me take no notice ; he said, he meant that his wife should not know of it.</p>

On the 11th of May I was at Smithfield, Mr. Stevenson was enquiring about 10 sheep he had lost, and desir'd if I saw any of the skins (as I well knew the clip) I would stop them, after this three skins were brought to me to market by my servant the last evidence, with Mr. Stevenson's clip from the prisoner ; I sent for the prosecutor, he came, and swore to them; we took up the prisoner, and had him before justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. Have the butchers all different marks?</p>
               <p>Hill. I don't know two butchers that mark alike, if they did the drovers would not know them to take them home.</p>
               <p>The rest, as the other witnesses, with this addition, that the prisoner said he gave Brown 16 s. 6 d. a piece, and that he bought a halfpennyworth of red oaker, and redded them in the alley.</p>

               <p>Jenns. His character is, what he trades for he pays very honestly: I take him to be an honest man, far from a sheep-stealer.</p>
               <p>- Carr. I lodged at Mr. Miland's when the prisoner lived there, and all the while he was there I never heard any complaint at all of him.</p>
               <p>- Laws. I have known and dealt with the prisoner for a year and better, I live in Great Russel-street, he always dealt fair and honestly with me as any man in England, and I never heard a bad character of him in my life.</p>

               <p>I buy sheep in Smithfield market almost every market-day, they are generally bought in penns or rails.</p>

               <p>Brown. I know Cow-lane, it leads up into Smithfield; it is not usual to buy sheep there, nor I never heard of any being bought there, or any alleys thereabouts. There are always houses appointed by the salesmen to pay the money at.</p>

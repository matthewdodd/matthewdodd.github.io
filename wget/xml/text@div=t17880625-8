               <p>How long was he with you together? - I suppose about two or three minutes; I am quite sure he is the man, and he did not quite me; the handkerchief was taken out of my pocket that moment.</p>
               <p>The handkerchief, was out of your pocket before he struck you? - Yes, I felt it go out, and I turned round, and he knocked me down directly; there was a great crowd gathered round; I do not know what became of the other party, I lost my stick, it was a suple-jack, the prisoner took it from me.</p>
               <p>Did you strike at him with it? - No.</p>
               <p>When did he take it from you? - I was down and he wrenched it out of my hand, I am quite sure; I am quite positive he was the man that took the stick out of my hand; I was so knocked down I could not speak a word, but a young man that is here came and helped me up; he was at a shop door, and saw the transaction, his name is

               <p>About nine, on the fifteenth of May, I heard a noise against a door in Oxford-street, I live at No. 89, I saw some people assemble, and this gentleman in the kennel, I ran to his assistance, the prisoner was upon the gentleman using him very ill, I asked him what they were doing to him, and he did not make me any reply.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - No, as soon as I got up to him, he had hold of one end of the stick; and Mr. Imberty the other, he threw him on the ground, when I came up to him, Mr Imberty let go the stick; I turned round to assist Mr. Imberty, I saw him strive to get up, but he fell down again, I lifted him, the prisoner got off and ran down Nags-head-yard, and turned up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250013"></xptr>London-mews, I saw him jump down an area, the left hand side of Queen-street, I was pursuing him all the way, I did not see what became of the stick; we knocked at the door, the gentlewoman came with a light, he was laying in the area, he got up, he said he had not robbed any body, I caught hold of his collar, then we took him, and he began to swear till he saw we were resolute, then he dropped down on his knees, and begged pardon; he was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Had you threatened, or promised him any thing? - No, he never was out of my sight, he did not set off to run, till I got Mr. Imberty upright, he never was out of my sight till he jumped into the area.</p>
               <p>Jury. When you took him to the watch-house, you gave him in custody of the serjeant of the watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he searched? - He was not at that time.</p>
               <p>Did the prosecutor accuse him of robbing him? - He gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE</p>
               <p>I was coming down Oxford-street, and saw this gentleman; two men were using him ill: Mr. Imberty struck me with a stick, and I laid hold of it, I know nothing of the handkerchief; the next morning he said it was a silk handkerchief; then he said it was a kind of a cotton handkerchief, worth about six-pence; then they fell a beating me over the shins, and I was taken; I expected my father here, but his business lay another way.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Recollect you are upon your oath, and that man's life is in danger; in this business, did you or not strike at any body, before you was knocked down? - No, I did not speak, or strike with my fist, or my stick.</p>
               <p>Did you strike him on the shins at any time? - I might in my struggle, but I do not remember it, I did not strike at him.</p>
               <p>Did he speak to you, and say why do you strike, in that way? - Not a word, not one person spoke to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The gentleman was in liquor? - I was not quite sober; but yet I understood what I was about.</p>
               <p>Jury. In the charge that you gave to the officer; did you give charge as for an assault; or as for a robbery? - He gave it in, that he had lost a handkerchief and stick.</p>
               <p>Jury. Then I conclude from that, that the man immediately searched him; because we are very particular upon those matters; I am one of the vestry of that parish.</p>
               <p>Court. We have such instances? - Mr. Imberty did not take upon himself to say, that this man had taken his handkerchief; I saw him take the stick myself.</p>
               <p>Did you see what he did with the stick? - No, I did not, nor I did not see what became of it at all.</p>
               <p>Court. What was was the value of this stick? - I gave a shilling for it.</p>

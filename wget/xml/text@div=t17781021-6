            ; there was a trunk which had been left at our house for four years which was to be sent for; I received a note that the prisoner at the bar was to fetch it; the trunk was emptied, and the things that had been in it which are the things mentioned in the indictment were tied up in a bundle and laid on a chair near the trunk. On the twenty first of July when I was up stairs, my mother who was below stairs called to me and said the woman who had fetched the trunk had ran away with the bundle; I immediately looked out at the window, and saw the prisoner running along with the trunk under her arm; I pursued her, but could not overtake her, and I did not meet with her till three weeks after; then I took her up; she insisted then that it was not she that had fetched the trunk, but that it was her sister, and she endeavoured to throw the theft upon her sister; her sister was taken up; nothing appeared against her sister, and she was discharged. The prisoner fell upon her knees before the justice, and owned she had done it, and begged forgiveness. I found this cap upon the head of Mrs. Reynolds, at a publick house in Broad St. Giles's; I knew it to be mine as soon as I saw it.</p>

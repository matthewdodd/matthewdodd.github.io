I was running towards Temple-bar, I thought it had been somebody I knew, and I immediately stopped and turned round, and saw it was a stranger, and asked him, what it was to him? I then walked on, and he came up to the side of me, and he asked me if I did not know him? that was the prisoner Hyser; I told him I did not know him, I said no; he then asked me if I did not intend to give him something? I asked him for what? he then said, do not you remember unbuttoning my breeches, and putting your hands in? I was very much frightened, I told him he was an impudent rascal, and to go along about his business; I immediately crossed the way, and went down into the Strand, I thought it was a more publick place; he said, I will follow you, and by God I will charge the watch with you, if you do not give me something; he still kept talking to me, and said, he would charge the watch with me if I did not give him something; I told him he might, I was ready to go any where with him; I then met the prisoner

               <p>Who let you in? - The maid servant; the next day at twelve o'clock, as I was coming home, I met Ellison in Jewry-street, I did not know him again, he accosted me; says he, I have been at your house about that affair of last night; says he, they tell me you are master of that place, I told him I was not; then says he, I suppose you are a clerk, yes says I, I am; says Ellison I called for money, and expected a genteel present; but I have no money about me, said I, I must get you to call at five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Then had he asked you for any money, that you said you had no money about you? - Yes, directly, as he met me, he said, he called for some money of the affair of last night.</p>
               <p>You said nothing about money at first? - When first he met me, he said, he had been at my house; why says he, they say you are master of that house; I told him I was not.</p>
               <p>When did he say any thing about any money? - After that, he said, he called at my house for some money, and expected I would make him a genteel present; as soon as I told him I was not master of the place, then he said, he supposed I was a clerk, and he called for some money, and expected I would make him a genteel present; I told him I had no money, but to call at five o'clock; says he, I shall not leave you, I shall see you into the counting-house that you belong to; I told him, if he would call at five, I should be sure to be at home; he said, he insisted upon seeing me to the counting-house; for, says he, your life is in my hands, and if you was master of that place, I would not make it up for less than 100 l. I called on my taylor directly, instead of going home; he lived in Smart's-buildings; Ellison walked by the side of me; I told him that was the counting-house; I rung the bell; I waited a considerable time before they opened the door; and he stood down the gate-way<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230024"></xptr>all the time; I staid about ten minutes at my taylor's, and then I came away; the prisoner was not there when I came out; then I went to Mr. Pinner, the constable, he lives in Jewry-street; he was not at home; I desired his wife to send him to me as soon as he came in, she sent him in a few minutes, and I told him the whole story, and that they were to be there by five o'clock, and that I meant to charge a constable with them; I desired him to be there as an officer; he asked me if I thought he had a right to take them without an authority from a Magistrate; I told him I would run all hazards of that; I went with him to Sir

I said, yes; and Ellison said, I only called to return the four shillings; and he threw down some silver on the table, which the officer took up; they insisted I should go with them to the Compter; and Mr. Cook said, I know Mr. Burrell very well, I shall take you; I shall not take him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoners Counsel. You are a master hackney-man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had been at the play this evening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Alone? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had not been any where after the play? - No.</p>
               <p>You was returning in Drury-lane? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had come down Drury-lane so as to come near this side of Temple-bar; you had not been at Somerset-house at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Not in the course of that evening? - No.</p>
               <p>The first time Ellison made his appearance was after the conversation between you and Hyser? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That conversation began by somebody calling to you in rather a familiar way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That somebody immediately charged you with committing some indecencies? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He then told you that he would charge the watch with you if you did not give him something? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You d - d him for a scoundrel, and said, you would give him nothing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He did not take to his heels and run? - No.</p>
               <p>He walked on side by side; he was met by Ellison, and had some conversation; upon which, Ellison joined in the persisting that you should make some satisfaction for your supposed misconduct? - Yes.</p>
               <p>We heard of some things which must at present be unintelligible to the Court; what may be the meaning of his having been at your house, and found out that you was the master? - What is the meaning!</p>
               <p>What did he mean by that expression; why, they tell me at that house you are the master! Did not you tell him that you was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230025"></xptr>not the master, and that your name was Thomas, and that you was the clerk? - I did not, I only said, I lodged there.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him that your name was Thomas, and that you was clerk there? - I did not; he never asked me my name.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him your name was Thomas? - I did not, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>You did not tell him you was a merchant's clerk? - No, he asked me if I lodged there, and I told him I did.</p>
               <p>Pray, you walked all along with these people from Temple-bar to Crutched-friars? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A rainy night, passed several stands of coaches, a vast number of watchmen, and these people walking, sometimes by the side of you and sometimes just before you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It rained pretty fast; did it not occur to you to call a coach? - No, Sir; I had a great coat on.</p>
               <p>So that not only protected you against the weather, but against the attack of two people that charged you with an unnatural practice; it did not occur to you to call a coach nor charge the watchman with them? - I thought if I had charged the watch with them, I must have gone to the watch-house with them, and it was a very late hour of the night; besides that, I should not have had an opportunity of explaining myself to them.</p>

               <p>You mean by that, that there would have been charge for charge? - He told me, however innocent I might be, there were two of them to swear against me; that did not strike me before; I dare say it is in my examination.</p>
               <p>Why did not you stop at some watch-house? - Exactly for the very same reason; I had two men to swear again me.</p>
               <p>Why, you are a house-keeper? - But they did not know that; and I had the same reason at Crutched-fryers.</p>
               <p>What did you think of it when you got to your own house, where you have a watchman of your own? - I have not; there is a watchman in the street opposite to my dwelling-house, but not belonging to me.</p>
               <p>He might know you? - I dare say he might; the reason I did not apply to him, was, because these men had just the same plea then, and I thought if they called the next day, I should have a friend there; I applied at two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you apply till you had met Ellison? - No, I did not think they would have the impudence to come again.</p>
               <p>Why, you told me this instant, that you intended to have got a friend to come in the morning while they were there; then you did not feel that it was necessary to get a friend ready to attend? - I did not apply to any body till I met Ellison.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a hackney-man? - Almost ever since I have been born; my father has been one these forty years.</p>
               <p>You have had a variety of servants, in the course of your time, and some of them have been promoted to a considerable dignity? - No, not of mine; my father had a coachman that was killed in the pillory for unnatural practices; I was not then a master hackney-man; that is about nine years ago.</p>
               <p>This man insisted upon going home with you, and told you he would call again the next morning? - Yes, I never said a word to him whether he was to call again the next morning.</p>
               <p>You left no directions with your servants in case persons of suspicious character should call? - No.</p>
               <p>How many servants do you keep? - I keep eight or nine servants; they were gone to bed; they were at home.</p>


               <p>Then I understand, that till after you had met Ellison the second day, you never mentioned this to any human being? - I do not recollect that I did.</p>
               <p>Do not talk so? - Then I did not; I was about my business as usual, and I staid at home two hours later than usual, meaning if this man came to secure him; I could have secured him.</p>
               <p>Why, had you desired any body to attend,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230026"></xptr>or taken any precautions? - No, I staid at home two hours, if he had come, but I did not think he would have the impudence to come.</p>
               <p>The first thing this man said, when he met you in Jewry-street, was, that he had been at your house about this affair of last night? - He said, he expected I should give him some money.</p>
               <p>He told you he had been at your house, and found you was the master? - I know now, he has been there; I do not at this moment know what he said; I never asked nor never heard.</p>

               <p>The first thing he said was, why, they tell me you are master of that place? - I had not spoke to any body, till I went to my taylor; I told Ellison that was the counting-house I belonged to.</p>
               <p>There you staid ten minutes, till he was gone; did you tell your taylor what passed? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Did you tell any body? - Nobody; I went to Mr. Pinner directly; I did not speak to any body; I gave no information to any public office.</p>
               <p>What part of the house did you sit in, in the play-house? - The two shilling gallery.</p>
               <p>Alone? - Alone.</p>
               <p>Upon the second day, this man told you, I shall not leave you, I shall follow you home; I will have satisfaction of you, and he went with you till you came to your taylor, insisting that he would not leave you, though you told him if he came at five, you would give him money? - He said, that he would not leave me if a bayonet was run through him.</p>
               <p>Did not he add this, I would not leave you if a bayonet was held to me; your conduct is too infamous to be passed over? - No, he did not; I desired one of the constables to continue in hearing; I thought I had two people there to swear against me, and they would naturally speak the truth.</p>
               <p>That truth, as far as it goes, was this, they said they demanded nothing; had there been any thing said from you to them, that this was an infamous charge against you? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Why did not you begin the conversation thus; why do you say that I am guilty of practice which my nature abhors? - It did not strike me; he told me money was what he wanted.</p>
               <p>You say now, that you told them that they knew you was innocent; why did not you mention that sooner? - I did not recollect it; I said, you know I am innocent of what you lay to my charge.</p>
               <p>You stated the whole conversation; did you say any such thing to the prisoners when the constables were present? - I mentioned every thing that I recollected, and you saying it, made me recollect it now.</p>
               <p>In what part of the conversation did you say that to them? - I said it in the course of the conversation; they came in; I asked them what they demanded; he said, he demanded nothing; but I must give him something, then he would tell me whether he was satisfied or no.</p>
               <p>Tell us then in what part of that conversation it was that you said, you know I am innocent of the charge? - When they rung at the bell; when I let that man in I asked him where the other man was, and when the other man came in, I said, you know I am innocent of what you lay to my charge, but what do you demand? I did not mean to give him any thing.</p>
               <p>Have we got now all that passed? - I think you have, and I thought you had.</p>
               <p>Did they say any one syllable to import you was innocent? - They did not do it; all they said, was an assent to my proposition to give them a guinea apiece.</p>
               <p>So your reasons for not calling a coach and not calling any watchman when you came to your house, was the threat that these men would make a counter accusation against you? - They said they would, and therefore I knew they would; they said, they would call the next day.</p>
               <p>And then you was totally unprepared for them? - I was totally prepared for them.</p>
               <p>Did you meet any body in the Minories, particularly that day? - No, Sir, no.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230027"></xptr>Did you meet nobody to whom you gave money to get their dinner that day? - No, Sir, nobody; I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Not on the day after you was at the play? - No, Sir, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>When was that four shillings taken which was returned? - On the preceding night.</p>
               <p>Did not you give that four shillings to any body in the Minories? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Do I understand you right, I think I understood you as saying, that you did not think they would have the impudence to call again; is that true? - I really did not upon my oath, think they would have dared to have called again.</p>
               <p>Then not expecting them to call again, how came you to let them escape that night when you had so many opportunities of taking them? - I thought they would charge the watch with me, for they both of them said, they would swear it; and I thought if they had called the next day, I could have had somebody by.</p>
               <p>Suppose they had not called, you were contented they should have escaped for this crime? - Yes, I must.</p>

               <p>Of the two prisoners, which came in first? - They were both there before I came; they were both in the parlour before I came; I endeavoured to hear what passed, but I could not hear a word spoken; my brother officer says to me, let us go in at once, do not let us us lose any part of our time; so we went in; Mr. Burrell said, that man, George Ellison, has got four shillings of mine.</p>

               <p>I am constable and under beadle of the ward of Aldgate; I went to Mr. Burrell's house; I was in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Did you hear what passed? - Not a word; I said, what signifies our sitting here, we can hear nothing; let us go into the parlour, and hear what they have got to say directly; we went into the parlour, and at the time I went in, Ellison had four shillings in his hand, and he said, I will not have it; and he threw it down on the table, and said, I will not have it; and that was the first that I heard or saw; I put my hand into my pocket, and pulled out my staff, and I says to Mr. Burrell, do you give charge of these men? yes, says he, I do; says Ellison, I shall give charge of Mr. Burrell.</p>
               <p>Of, What? - I do not know that he mentioned any thing; I said, I know Mr. Burrell, he is a man of credit; I shall not take charge of him; he will be forthcoming.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You would not have taken Mr. Burrell, if the charge had been made the night before? - I would have been bail for him for 1000 l. Mr. Burrell is a man of an upright character, and there are enough in Court that know it.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You said that one of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230028"></xptr>the principal reasons why you did not take up these men the night before was, because you wished if you did take them up, you should have somebody that should overhear their conversation? - Yes; I thought it was morally impossible for them not to hear, for the room adjoining had a thin partition, and I opened the door, that I might hear the men, and I expected that they had heard it all.</p>
               <p>I think you said before, it was Hyser who took the four shillings from you? - The other demanded it; he desired me to give it to Hyser.</p>
               <p>How came you, when Mr. Pinner came into the room to say that Ellison had got four shillings of your money? - I meant them both, to put them both alike.</p>
               <p>Because Pinner was very correct, I asked him two or three times; then he is mistaken in that, is he? - I spoke of them both together; I thought them equally guilty; I did not know their names.</p>
               <p>But you did not point to Ellison as the man who had the four shillings? - I did not point to either of them.</p>
               <p>Is it true, that the moment the officers came into the room, Ellison laid down four shillings on the table, and said he would not have it? - Yes, I understood him that he said he called to return the four shillings.</p>
               <p>Then tell us the last part of the conversation that passed before the officers made their appearance. - While I asked them if a guinea a-piece would do, they said yes, that was very genteel, the officers came in.</p>

               <p>I see this man will take our lives innocently to save his own character; I had been taking leave of my brother, who was going into the country the next morning; I parted with him at the bottom of Wych-street; coming along Wych-street, I turned up the new street; I had occasion to ease myself, without intention; this man came to me, and asked me how I did? I said, I did not know him; he said, yes you do; he said, you have been in my company a night of two ago; he unbuttoned the flap of my breeches; I said, you villain, what do you mean? he made a scuffle; I followed him without buttoning my breeches; I caught him at the pastry-cook's which is opposite the street; I pursued him; this young man happened to come by at the time; I related to him the story; the young man said, charge him with the watch; I called the watch two or three times; he directly said, do not charge me with the watch, for God's sake; I am a merchant's clerk, and it will ruin me; I beg you will go and see me home; the other young man said, we will walk with you a little farther; he asked the other young man, what are you? says he, I am a servant out of place; says he, it is in my power to help you to a place; we walked along the street, and entered into conversation about his being out of place; the young man said, when he was out of place, he was a <rs id="t17870523-17-deflabel88" type="occupation">hair-dresser</rs>

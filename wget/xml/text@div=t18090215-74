            . I am a City constable. On the 7th of this month, a little before nine o'clock in the evening, I was in Sun street; I met the prisoner with two others; they were coming from Finsbury square towards Bishopgate street; the prisoner had a velveteen jacket on, and the buttons covered with the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before - A. I knew him as perfect as my own brother; I have known him for several years; he had this piece of baize upon his left shoulder; I first passed him a little; the others that were with him were in conversation together; I heard the word Wake, it is a slang word among thieves, that they are to be put awake to it; I heard the word Wake distinctly; I turned short round and went between the prisoner and Mr, Matther's shop window, which had a very great light; it gave me a perfect view of his countenance; the instant I looked at him I knew him perfectly well; I asked him where he was going with it; he said what was that to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you - A. I do not suppose he did. I told him I was an officer and insisted upon knowing where he was going with it; I changed the stick into my left hand, for my right hand to have hold of him; he threw the load against me and made his escape; he ran as hard as ever he could run; I called out stop thief; I throwed the load into Mr. Matthers' shop; the next morning I gave information to Bishop the officer. This took place on the Tuesday evening; on Thursday morning he was taken in custody. I am positive he is the same man.</p>

               <p>Q. Whereabouts is this Angel - A. It is the first public house in Whitechapel near Brick lane; Mr. Hedge went away first, I joined no other company; the clock had struck ten when I went home.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this - A. Tuesday week, the 7th day of this month.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you first of all applied to come here - A. Last Friday was a week; by the gentleman that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150037"></xptr>was in the prisoner's company, he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he took you to Mr. Harris - A. No; the prisoner's wife took me to Mr. Harris; she has paid me for my trouble at other times, but not then. I live at No. 55, Fashion street.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a very lucky thing that as the prisoner did not know you his friend should find you out - A. On Friday evening he came into this house. I was in the house drinking with Mr. Hedge again; he recollected me and asked me to be a witness; he took me last Sunday to Clerkenwell to see the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the man then tell you who he was - A. No; I do not know what he is now, nor his name, nor where he is to be found; he came to me to day about ten minutes after eleven o'clock and fetched me out of my master's premises and gave me a paper and a shilling and told me where to come to, and away he went.</p>

             - A. Yes; I was with him at the Angel tavern on Tuesday night; I recollect seeing the prisoner there that night, last Tuesday was a week.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go there - A. Twenty minutes before eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what time the prisoner came in - A. To the best of my knowledge five or ten minutes before eight; we had been drinking porter there; this man said sit a little further Stumpey; I said you have no call to call me stumpey, you are stumpey enough yourself. I went away from the public house past nine o'clock; I left the prisoner there.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons might there be in the public house - A. There were four soldiers, a young man and me drinking together, and the publican's brother, Gillman, he was rather intoxicated; I am sure it was the prisoner that was there, he had a brown coat on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You went there twenty minutes before eight - A. Yes; I had only about two minutes walk from my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. And you looked at the clock before you came out - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There were four soldiers there, another man drinking with you, and the publican's brother - was the publican there too - A. He did not come in all the time, nor his wife; my daughter kept the tap room; she lived at the house about two months.</p>
               <p>Q. So the prisoner said, sit further up Stumpey, you moved and he sat down - A. Yes; he drank with another man.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the other man - A. I do not know him; the other man was in two or three minutes before him; they did not come in together; he was a thin, tallish man, thin faced; I have seen him since, I saw him at the Angel last Sunday, he came in while Huntington and I were drinking together; he said there is the two men that were drinking together on Tuesday night; Huntington asked him what song he sung on Tuesday night; he said he sung part of three songs. The prisoner's friend asked Huntington whether he knew the person that was sitting on the seat next me; Huntington said he did not take so much notice of him as the old man did; we went to the prison on Sunday to see the prisoner; he told me the man that called me Stumpey was taken up; and I saw the prisoner on Thursday where he was taken to.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it the people drank that night at the public house when you saw the prisoner - A. The prisoner and the other man had a pot of porter; I suppose between Huntingdon and me we had three pints of porter, we might have four pints for what I know. I left the prisoner there when I came away; and Huntington and I came away together.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure that you did not leave Huntington behind you - A. I do not know whether he was behind or no; I came out first.</p>
               <p>COURT. When did you last see the man that came to you in the public house - the prisoner's friend - A. I saw him to day about eleven o'clock; I saw him at my work; he came to fetch me.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner and his friend came into the public house did they appear as if they had been running - A. No, not at all; they were quite cool.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 7th of February do you recollect your father being there in company with Huntington - A. I do; and I recollect the person of the prisoner perfectly well; I recollect the prisoner coming in a quarter before eight, he called for a pot of beer and gave me a sixpence; I took notice he had lost one joint of his finger. He continued in the tap room till after nine, then he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were there in the tap room - A. Three soldiers, Huntington, my father, and another man, I did not take particular notice of him; there was no other person there, man or woman, that I am sure of.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you draw beer for them - A. I did; I at first drawed a pint: they had five or six pints.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that they had at least six pints - A. No; I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went away first, the prisoner or your father and Huntington - A. The prisoner; he went away better than an hour before my father and Huntington; he went away about a quarter past nine, and my father and Huntington went away a little after ten.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any body that the prisoner drank with - A. No; he sat by my father, and the other man sat next to the prisoner; he had a pint of beer and the prisoner had a pot; I never saw the prisoner before; I have seen him this morning in the dock.</p>

I am a carpenter, and live at 28, Russell Street, Beth<lb></lb>nal Green—on the night of 15th May, I was in Norfolk Street—I saw the prisoner running—someone said "Stop him! stop him!"—I caught hold of him—he said "What are you holding me for?"—I said "I am going to hold you till a policeman comes, and then I am going to give you in custody"—he made a sudden blow at me on the left arm—I thought he had hit me on the muscle of the arm—I saw him lift his hand again, and I saw a knife in his hand as he was preparing to give a second blow—I let go his arm then—he took to running—I found the blood running down my arm—I followed him something like 500 yards, I suppose, and I found that I was getting exhausted—I took up a stone as he was running, and threw it at him, but it missed him—he then turned round with the knife and made another stab, which missed—I was exhausted then and falling, and he stabbed me on the back—I fell on the kerb, and dislocated two of my fingers—I have hardly been able to do any work since—I got up and fol<lb></lb>lowed him as far as I could, till I became so dizzy I could go no farther—I</p>

I am a surgeon, at 107, Globe Road, Mile End Road—on Monday evening, 15th May, Hall came to me—he was led into the surgery totally exhausted from loss of blood—he began to reel, and fell into a chair—I took his clothes off and examined him—I found two wounds—on the left side, over the sixth rib, there was a deep punctured wound, which, by the probe, went down on to the rib 2 in. in depth—I found that it glanced from right to left for 3 in.—it struck against the rib and glanced 2 in. or 3 in. to the left—it was just such a wound as would be inflicted by this knife—it must have been given with great violence—had it gone between the ribs it would have entered the pleura and caused death—I also found a wound on the arm, not very deep, but 2 in. in length—it bled most profusely—it was not such a dangerous wound as the chest wound—I had him conveyed to his bed, and kept him perfectly quiet several days—he is quite out of danger now—his fingers were very much sprained—it will be some time before he gets the use of his hand—I saw the knife at the Police Court; it had blood on it then.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I object to that.</p>
               <p>Court. It is more properly cross examination to be sure.</p>

               <p>Who directed you to write these? - I cannot positively swear; I do not recollect who it was, but I suppose it was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. What that directed you to write the jurata? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Certainly not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow I understand that you at some time had a conversation with this woman in the presence of Mr. Letwyche? - I believe I had.</p>
               <p>I only wish to say this to you, at the same time, I believe, you said, you would not take advantage of any thing that did pass in a particular conversation? - I believe I might.</p>
               <p>Then, I believe, my Lord will tell you, that any thing that did pass at that conversation must not be mentioned now? - I meant to carry my engagement no further.</p>
               <p>State what was the engagement? - That no advantage should be taken of what passed at that time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then I object to your stating any thing that you came to in consequence of that; do you know any thing that you came to in consequence of that conversation? - I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. I am not going to ask him any thing that passed in consequence of that at that time, I believe the conversation that I am enquiring after, passed previous to that time, and if it should happen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250129"></xptr> to have passed after that time, the engagement being, that what passed at that time should not be disclosed, does not come within agreement; it is the duty of Mr. Knight, in the office he is in, to enquire into seamen's wills, before the commissioners make any payment upon them; the application made to him was made by the prisoner as the representative of Druce previous to that time.</p>
               <p>Court. If it is brought into the shape of an objection of which I can take notice, it must be that of the common objection, that something has been said to this woman which has induced her to say something; I shall object to that as not fit to be heard; but as to the point of honour I have nothing to do with that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was what you are going to state previous to what passed, or subsequent? - I think it was previous.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. Did you at any time apply to Doctors Commons to search for the wills of seamen? - I did.</p>
               <p>When was it? - In the month of April last.</p>
               <p>Did you find the will of Druce? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you any time, and when, after see the prisoner? - In the month of April or May I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did you take any measures upon it to the payment of wages? - I saw the will, I thought it suspicious, and I gave notice to the Pay office not to pay the wages till the suspicions were cleared up; in consequence of the wages being stopped the prisoner came to my office, and brought a man of the name of

               <p>Court. Now before you examined her, did you inform her that you had any evidence that the will was forged, or make her any promise? - No, none in the world, I took minutes from her into this book which I have in my hand.</p>
               <p>Court. You may refresh your memory. (Looks at it.) She said the will was filled up and executed, at the same time, to the best of her knowledge, her business with me, was to clear up my objections; and to procure a certificate from me to enable her to receive the wages; she said, the deceased then belonged to the Monsieur, that he ran from the Monsieur, and then changed his name to White, and entered on board the Lord Mulgrave, by the name of

               <p>Where was the ship in April 1781? - At Gibraltar; she arrived at Spithead the 20th or 22d of May following.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How often do you muster your men when you arrive in port? - The clerk musters them every week.</p>
               <p>If a man is marked run, we are not to take that as the exact day, but as the next muster day? - He is allowed three musters if in port.</p>
               <p>Therefore these three men being marked run, at Portsmouth, on the 7th of June, and you arrived the 20th of May; do not you take it that the probability is that they ran soon after the 20th of May? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Baldwin. I call this man to prove, that he has sent some letters to his mother informing her he had signed such a will, and giving his reasons for signing his name.</p>
               <p>Druce. I am a distant relation to the deceased, as far as third cousin.</p>
               <p>Did you know him? - Very well.</p>
               <p>Did you know his hand writing? - Very well; we had our education together.</p>
               <p>Look at this letter, is that his hand writing?</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. I beg leave to read three letters.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Druce. Are you a seafaring man? - No.</p>
               <p>How lately have you seen him? - Not for the space of eight or nine years.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen him write from the time you finished your education together? - I have received letters from him, and I have seen him write several times.</p>
               <p>How long had you left school before he died? - I suppose as much as fourteen or fifteen years.</p>
               <p>Was it the last eight or nine years that you had seen nothing of him? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Had you been much acquainted with the changes of his life, how he has been disposed off? - Yes, Sir, I knew very well that.</p>
               <p>How many different ways did he spell his name? - Druce; I never knew any other way of spelling his name; I never saw him write after he went to sea, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Look at these letters. - I have, I believe them to be his hand writing.</p>

               <p>Will you look on the direction of that letter? - I have known him sixteen or eighteen years; this letter was sent to me; I received it with his will and power in it.</p>

               <p>Did not you say also before the Lord Mayor that it was not his mode of writing his name? - Yes, Sir, I did.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether it did or did not turn out on that examination, that amongst the letters produced of his, that you recognized that he spelt his name three different ways? - No, Sir, he had made a mistake in one letter, Duce.</p>

               <p>Why did not you bring the letter with you? - I did not know.</p>
               <p>Did you know what you was to say when you was subpoened? - I did not; this is the first I knew of it, and I never knew any more of it; I have been two years and a half in London.</p>

               <p>What business did she follow? - When I first knew her she followed bomb-boating, which is a sea term for those that credit sea-faring people on board the King's ships in general; she credited considerably on board a ship that I belonged to.</p>
               <p>Was she understood to be that sort of woman as to be able to credit? - Yes, there were many to my knowledge belonged to the same ship that gave her wills and powers sometimes; I am very confident the seamen have no other security to give; I always found her a very honest woman; I have lent her money at times when I belonged to the ship, and she always paid me very honestly.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. In the first place, when did you come into Court? - I am here about an hour.</p>
               <p>Why did not you answer when your name was called? - I was not here then. I was drinking a pint of beer over the way in the Old Bailey with two or three acquaintances.</p>
               <p>Who were they? - I cannot recollect their names.</p>
               <p>Do not you know who they were you was drinking with? - No, Sir, they were round there, I was not well acquainted with them; I do not know their names.</p>
               <p>Can you write? - Yes, Sir, a little.</p>
               <p>Court. Give him a pen and ink and let him write; how long have you been disabled, how long have you lost your arm? - I believe in November 1777, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Now write your name on that paper.</p>
               <p>(Writes his name with his left hand, given up to the Court and compared with the will, and shewn to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>What are you? - I was bred up to the currying business, but I failed for a thousand pounds, and I could not pay it at that time, and I went to sea.</p>
               <p>What ship did you serve in the year<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250138"></xptr> 1780? - I was not on board in the year 1780; I came home in the year 1780 from taking one of the galleons, in the Sharke privateer, belonging to Messrs. Newby; after that I came to Gosport and resided there.</p>
               <p>In what way? - I lodged in O'Hara's house, at the Wheat-sheaf in Cross-street.</p>
               <p>When was that that you lodged there? - In the year 1780, 1781, and part of 1782, I lived upon my prize-money, at that time I received upwards of two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Did you know Druce? - I have seen him but not to know him.</p>
               <p>What did Druce belong to? - By all account he belonged to the Magnificent and Monsieur, and an Indiaman; the time I saw him he was dressed in a light coloured coat and leather apron, and a trowel under his apron; I saw him at Gosport in company with the prisoner, it was at O'Hara's house; they went to Mr. Hinde's at the upper end of Middle-street; that is a navy agent, to have a will and power made, or something of that kind, and Mr. Hind nor his clerk was not in the way, and they came back to the same house, and the house was full of men and women, women of the town, and men, the boats crews; they had been telling their business, some of the sailors said to them, d - n your foolish blood, it will cost you a crown to have it filled; why we will fill it says one, and we will fill it says another, and it was filled by a sea-faring man that was in liquor, I cannot tell his name; there was hundreds and thousands in the house in the course of the week.</p>
               <p>What became of it then? - The woman desired me to sign it, and I signed it for one, and there was one

             signed it for another; I would not know him if I was to see him; he was a lowish man; that is all that I remember; this was some time in the summer 1781, I cannot recollect the time.</p>
               <p>Where was O'Hara at the time? - I cannot tell; he was out of the way at the time; he was not present I know.</p>
               <p>Did you know Druce, was you acquainted with his person? - No, I was not; I drank with him two three times in that disguise that he was in to prevent him from being pressed as I thought, which was the case with many sea-faring men at that time; I had heard he had run from the Monsieur.</p>
               <p>Is that sort of secret well kept amongst a number of you? - Yes, it is, for I have run from a King's ship myself before now; I was on board the Hector man of war in the year 1777, and in a privateer in the year 1779, and took a galleon and brought her in.</p>
               <p>How many times might you have seen Druce before you was called upon to sign this? - Three or four times, or perhaps half a dozen; I have often seen him with this woman in the streets of Gosport, and I believe three times at O'Hara's.</p>
               <p>What was his business at your house? - I believe he came there to drink, I cannot say his business; it was a great house for sea-faring people.</p>
               <p>You yourself lived there, did not you? - I did.</p>
               <p>How many rooms were there in the house? - I believe there were six rooms.</p>
               <p>How many bed-rooms? - Four.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to recollect who there was that lived there beside yourself at the time? - It was impossible, for boats crews were constantly coming and going; this was in the back parlour.</p>

               <p>Was you ever at her house? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him there? - Yes, I saw him there one night.</p>
               <p>Never but once? - Never but once.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether he had any lodging there? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>If he did not lodge at her house, you do not know where he lodged? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>(Looks at the will.)</p>
               <p>Is that your hand-writing? - It is.</p>
               <p>And that is Payne's hand-writing? - It is the man's that I saw sign it.</p>
               <p>How came you to be desired to sign it? - I have signed many for many people in the same house; there have been many things done in the same house, and in many houses in Portsmouth besides.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. I see you have had a misfortune in your arm? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you ever the misfortune to break your leg? - I broke my shin but not my leg.</p>
               <p>When might that happen? - Sometime in June 1781 to the best of my knowledge, I think, I will not be sure.</p>
               <p>Can you be sure when this will was executed? - It was executed about that month.</p>
               <p>Have you ever given any other account of this? - Yes, I gave an account to Mr. Knight as well as I could once; I did not go to Mr. Knight; this woman applied to me; I came from Portsmouth as a witness to another will.</p>
               <p>Did not you go with the prisoner to Mr. Knight's to get a certificate? - I know nothing of any certificate.</p>

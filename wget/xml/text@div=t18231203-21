On the 19th of November, between twelve and one o'clock in the day, I was in the shop, and saw the prisoner, who is a stranger, coming from up stairs, and go into the street. Knowing I had left the first floor door open, I ran up, and missed five table spoons off the dining-table, where they were ten minutes before. I came down, and called my brother to go after her with me. I pointed her out to him, and said she had stolen the spoons. He overtook her, and when I got up, she was delivering the five spoons to him out of her shawl or apron. She was taken to the watch-house. My brother gave them to my husband.</p>

I said, "If so, take them." My husband died in the Navy, and I lost a son at Waterloo.</p>

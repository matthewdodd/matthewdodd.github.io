My neighbour, Mrs. Hanson, called me down, and said, I had lost a hat. I looked and saw there was one missing from the door. Mrs. Hanson told me that Mr. Hanson was gone after the prisoner; and soon after Mr. Hanson brought me back the prisoner, and the hat. This is the hat; it is a new hat; it is mine.</p>
               <p>MR. HANSON. I am a shoe-maker. I live opposite of Mr. Silverlock. On the 24th, a gentleman of the name of Easted came to my door, and informed me, that the prisoner had taken a hat from Mr. Silverlock's door. I pursued the prisoner, and overtook him about two hundred yards from the place, with the hat upon him. This is the hat I found upon the prisoner. I asked him how he came to take the hat away. He said he had done nothing. I took the prisoner to Mr. Silverlock's house. A constable was sent for, and he was delivered into the hands of the constable. I took the hat from under the prisoner's coat. I delivered it to Mr. Lee.</p>

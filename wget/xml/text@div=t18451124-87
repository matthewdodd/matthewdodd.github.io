                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On the 1st July I went into Mr. Morris's service, and three weeks afterwards his wife parted from him; I was left sole mistress; I used to buy and sell in the shop; we wanted to part with the business, and he said to me, "Betsy," which he used to calcine, "should you like it?" I said, "Yes" Mrs. Bark then applied for it, and she said, would I remain with them if she took it; I said, "Yes;" and then Mr. Morris said to me, "Buy as little as possible; I don't wish to increase the stock." I bought tome, and what I thought was reasonable I bought for myself, and took to my ownroom. When Mrs. Morris was there, the used to sleep with me, and her things were left there. I wrote last night to Mr. Morris's own lister, and Isaid, "If there is anything of Mrs. Morris's, let me know." I bought the seal of a man named Howe, and these handkerchiefs are my own.</p>

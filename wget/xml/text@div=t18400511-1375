                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Lucas-street—the prisoner was my servant. I had a sovereign safe on Sunday evening, the 19th of April, when I and my wife went to church—it was in my wife's drawer in the bed-room—there was other money there, and that was safe on the Monday morning, but the sovereign was gone—I spoke to the prisoner about it—she burst into tears, and said she knew nothing about it—I called in a policeman, and we looked about the place, but could not find it—she was taken, and a sovereign was found on her—my sovereign was not marked.</p>

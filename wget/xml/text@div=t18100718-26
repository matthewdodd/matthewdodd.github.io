            . Q. I believe you live with your father, who is a coach-maker in Long Acre - A. I do. On the night of the 14th of June I was returning from my friend's house by Chalk-farm, about half after eleven at night; it was a very fine night, the moon shone very bright. As I came down the <placeName id="t18100718-26-crimeloc154">Hampstead road</placeName>

This was on Thursday. On the Monday I saw the prisoner at Bow-street; I saw the three dollars and the shilling; the shilling was marked; I am almost confident that was the shilling that I had in my pocket before he robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what sort of a hat the prisoner had on - A. He had a hat turned up at the back part of it, and a frock coat on.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any thing over his face except his hat being on - A. No; I had full opportunity of seeing his face; I observed particularly his face and person at the time he robbed me, that I can speak to him again.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he go after he had robbed you - A. I was coming from Hampstead, he went over the field on my left hand; that is the right hand going up to Hampstead.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came up from Bath to get some prize money that was due to me; finding that I could not get it I went down to Hampstead a baymaking, being tired I went into this field and went to sleep, and when I came into the road they said there was a robbery done, and that I was the person. This pistol I found on the road, I took the priming out of it and put it in my pocket.</p>

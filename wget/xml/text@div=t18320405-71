On the 19th of March, about half-past three o'clock, the prisoner came in to buy several articles, and asked for watch-keys, among others, but bought nothing; I put nine or ten keys on the counter, and turned from him to get some seals and a watch from the window for him - my back was to him; he was about three-quarters of an hour in the shop, and selected a few articles - he said he would pay me part of the money, and if I went with him to Holborn, he would pay me the rest - while he was saying this, I missed two keys from the counter, and told him so; he said I had better look on the work-board, to see if I had not put them there - I turned to it, but did not find them, and on turning suddenly round, I saw him shake one of them from his left hand sleeve; he had had several in his hand - his sleeve was very large, and one might probably get there by accident; I charged him with having another - he said he had not and that I had better look among the others on the board; I did so, but did not find it - in a few minutes he said, "Here it is," and gave it to me from the other end of the counter; I heard it fall on the counter, but do not know where from - I had laid the articles I showed him on a leather; I shook that leather, and possibly it might have got there - it is very probable; I said I would search him before he left, to see if he had my property - he said, "Oh no," then opened the door, and went away; I, not knowing whether my property was all safe or not, unfortunately pursued, and brought him back, but no property was found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q. What is the length of the counter? A. It is very short; he tried on a watch-guard - the key might have dropped into his sleeve, when he put up his hand to put the guard over his neck; I beg to say, before my servant gives evidence, that I cannot take her word at all times, and beg your Lordship and and the Jury not to consider what she says - I would not believe her, and intend to discharge her when her month is up; from what has occurred since, I should not like her evidence to be taken - she was behind the glass door of the parlour.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM MARCH, jun. sworn. - I am a fishing-tackle-maker: I was putting up my shutters on Tuesday evening, about seven o'clock, and I saw the two prisoners standing at Mr. Moggridge's window; I looked at them and they walked away, but returned back almost immediately, and went away again, and just as I had finished putting up my shotters I observed them coming across the way a third time; I told my father I thought they were going to cut Mr. Moggridge's window, and I put on my hat and went out; Tally was then going past our door, and I saw him putting a shoe under his coat; I immediately laid hold of Tally, and called out to stop the other boy; on laying hold of him he fell down, and the shoe was under him; I delivered him into the hands of another person and went after the other boy, who had not got more than four or five yards, and in taking Mullings into Mr. Moggridge's shop I kicked the shoe before me; I took him into the shop and delivered him to the officer.</p>

            , jun.) Q.Was the shoe that you kicked before you the same that you saw Tally putting under his coat? - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Moggridge. Upon examining the window directly after I came home, I found it had been cut; it was broke before, but had been mended by a glazier; the glass was cut in a three corner square, sufficient to take out the shoes; it was impossible they could have fell out, they were the top pair of a pile of seven that I had taken in from the women binders at five o'clock that evening; they laid one in another upon their sides; there is no particular mark about them, only that they are my own cutting and trimming, and they correspond in the number; there are six pair left.</p>

               <p>Q.What may the value of them be? - A.Four shillings.</p>
               <p>William March, jun. When they were searched Tally had a knife in his waistcoat pocket, which I saw taken from him.(Mr. March, sen. produced the knife).</p>
               <p>Mr. Moggridge. The putty was quite fresh, and might have been taken away with the finger, it was removed all round; I made particular search after the glass, but could not find it; it was puttied inside and out, and some sacks put in to strengthen the frame.</p>
               <p>Tally's defence. I was coming up Fleet-street, and that young man laid hold of me; I saw a pair of shoes lying upon the payement, and I went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180102180024"></xptr>pick them up and that young man knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Mulling's defence. One of my sisters was taken very sick; my father works at London bridge, and I was going to fetch him, and that young man followed me and took me back to the shop.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Tally, called his mother and the mother of Mullings, who deposed that they had never heard any thing amiss of him before.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Mullings called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

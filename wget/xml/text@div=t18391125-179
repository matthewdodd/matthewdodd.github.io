                  </hi>. I am foreman to Andrew Mann, a general dealer, who keeps the Windsor Castle public-house at Pimlico. The prisoner was in his employ as a plumber—this lead was taken from a house—the pri<lb></lb>soner had access to it—when he left work on the 19th of November I suspected him, and asked him if he had not got something that did not be<lb></lb>long to him—he denied it—I took him back to the house and found this lead concealed in the waistband of his trowsers—here is 29lbs. of it—I have compared it with some lead on our premises, and it had been cut from it.</p>

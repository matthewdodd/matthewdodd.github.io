               <p>Hunt. The 2d of this Month, between the Hours of five and six, I was going cross my Yard, and I saw the Prisoner at the Bar (the Woman, not the Boy) and being very much surpriz'd, I asked her what Business she had there. She told me that having came out of Kent she came into the Yard to sleep. I told her, I had been robb'd before, and she should not go out of the Yard till I had search'd her. Then she wanted to come by me, and as soon as she did so, the Goods were under her.</p>
               <p>Q. You know nothing then of Galder (the Boy?)</p>
               <p>Hunt. No. I was the Evening the Robbery was committed, drinking a Dish of Tea with Mrs. Hughes, and I asked the Prisoner what she did there, and said, that she had committed a Robbery, and that we would have her before the Justice; she said, she came from Kent, and that a Boy, that had got in at the Window, and thrown the Goods into the Yard, was then in the Fields to receive them, when she got out.</p>

               <p>Gough. Not before this Time. This Girl (the Prisoner) wanted to make a Bargain to go out a Thieving: At first, I said, I would not, and afterwards, I said, I would. And going along Leicester-Fields we met the Boy, Roger. The Girl (the Prisoner) saw the Entry-Door open of this Gentlewoman's House, the Stocking-Shop: And the Girl and Boy went into the Yard, and so they got up the Ladder; I follow'd them to the Door to see which Way they went.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see them when they were in the Yard?</p>
               <p>Gough. They got up the Ladder, and got over some Leads.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they both get up?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see them?</p>
               <p>Gough. No. But I heard the Girl say so. She said she got into the Gentlewoman's Window. And so the Boy had got something up in a Bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you by the Yard?</p>
               <p>Gough. I was the outside of the Yard.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they gone?</p>
               <p>Gough. About two Hours.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time was this?</p>
               <p>Gough. About Eight o'Clock. The Boy got the Bundle, and the Girl went down the Yard, and the Boy toss'd them to her.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Gough. The Girl told me so.</p>

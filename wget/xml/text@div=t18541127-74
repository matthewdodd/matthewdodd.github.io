                  </hi>. I am a stereotypes, living at No. 2, Wine Office-court, Fleet-street—the prisoner Ann Hyatt lodged in my house. On 25th Nov. I was coming down Wilderness-row, about half-past 6 o'clock in the evening—I met both the prisoners—they were together—I have seen the other prisoner several times; I did not know her name—I have seen her several times with Hyatt—when I met them they each had a bundle—I then went home—I was informed I had been robbed, and I found I had been—I missed two black frock coats, a pair of trowsers, a child's frock, and several other things—I could not replace them for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is my handkerchief, and this is the coat and trowsers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—all these I can identify.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Taylor.</hi> I can only say I am quite innocent; I never saw this gentle<lb></lb>man at Hyatt's house; on Saturday I was never out of my own place from 4 till half-past 8 o'clock. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I am quite sure I saw her with Hyatt—I spoke to Hyatt—I had known the other previously.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>). On Saturday evening, the 25th, I went with the prosecutor to Hyatt's house—I found there a latch key, which would unlock the prosecutor's door—while I was searching, the prisoner Taylor came in—I told her Mr. Strong had been robbed, and that she was seen with Hyatt carrying a bundle in Wilderness-row—she said she had not seen Miss Hyatt that evening—I then told her I should like to see the contents of her pocket—I took from her pocket is. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a latch key, that will open Mr. Strong's door, and a duplicate for a pair of trowsers, pledged on Saturday for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I learned from her where she lodged—I went there—I found this handkerchief under the bed—I also found six dupli<lb></lb>cates behind a picture—they do not relate to this matter—Mr. Strong picked this up from the fire, at Taylor's—I saw him do it—it is one of Mr. Strong's cards.</p>

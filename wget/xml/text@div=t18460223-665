                  </hi>. I am an officer of the City of London Union, West-street, Smithfield, and am also a constable of the City. On Monday, the 9th of Feb., I was on duty in the Union-house, and at half-past seven o'clock in the morning I went to the upper ward to open the windows, and see that all persons were out, and to lock the ward, which was my duty—I saw the three prisoners in the ward—Murphy and Dench have been some years in the house, but Golding not so long—they ought to have been down at breakfast at that time—I proceeded to open the windows, and when I had opened about three, Dench passed me towards the door, from the other end of the ward—Golding and Murphy were on the right-hand side, about half-way up the ward, by the side of their beds—I passed Golding, got up to Murphy, and, on turning in between the two beds, to open the next window, just as I passed Murphy, I received a violent blow from his right hand—I saw the blow coming, but could not get from it—it knocked me down—Dench and Golding immediately came to his assistance—they kicked and beat me about very severely—Dench and Golding both kicked and struck me while I was on the ground—Dench placed his foot on the pit of my stomach, and said, "Get the b—r's staff, and give it him"—Murphy and Dench endeavoured to get the staff, and in doing so got hold of my body coat, and tore it up the back under my arm—my staff was in my pocket—they tore the skirt of my coat up to my armpit—Murphy eventually got the staff, and Dench struck me a blow on my right temple—it was swollen very much—he immediately re<lb></lb>peated the blow on the left temple—when I found my staff being seized I tried all I could to get up—I got hold of a bedstead, but they bent me over the edge of it—I was glad to get down on the ground again—the blows produced blood—the first blow covered my face with blood—the second caused my eye to swell as big as an egg—I then got on my feet, and made towards the door—Dench and Golding then left me, and shut the door that I should not get out—I went to the window, and held by the bar, calling "Murder!"—they continued beating and kicking me till they heard Wakefield, the porter, picking at the door—they then said, "Let the b—r go," and they ran down stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was done to you after the blow in the eye? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They continued beating and kicking me—I was struggling to get from them—I was almost insensible—I was confined to my bed for a week, and now am unable to return to my duty—I was taken to Dr. Lynch, and have been under his care ever since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Murphy.</hi> Golding had nothing to do with it; this is a very different statement to what he made before; he said he did not know which of the two took the staff, and that he did not know what he was saying at Guildhall;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602230024"></xptr>
               <p>I was lying on the bed—he asked if I meant to get up; I said I was unwell, and wished to lay a little longer; he pulled the clothes off; I asked what he meant; he pulled out his staff, and said if I did not get up by fair means I should by foul; I got up, put on my things, all but my jacket; I was walking down the room, and had not got many feet from my bed before he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me along with his staff, saying he would have no nonsense, poking me in the back with his staff; I turned round and asked what he meant; as he was going to strike me I seized the staff: he seized me by my neck-hand<lb></lb>kerchief, and almost strangled me; in the struggle the staff fell down; he kept hold of my throat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Not a word he says is true—when I entered they were up and dressed, even to their caps—I said at Guildhall that Murphy took the staff and struck me—when there I was much confused from the blows—I had no less than seventeen wounds—the doctor did not lay any stress on any but the two I received from the staff—I did not speak a word to either of them till after the assault commenced—I did not touch his bed—my staff was in my pocket till he took it out—the first thing Golding did was to kick me when on the ground, and he continued striking me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am gate-keeper at the West Union workhouse. I was on duty on the 9th of Feb., about half-past seven o'clock, and heard a cry of "Murder!"—I went towards the upper ward, and met the three prisoners on the stairs, running down—I asked who was crying murder—one of them, I do not know which, said, "It is <hi rend="italic">Baskey</hi>"—the prosecutor goes by that name—they went on about a yard and a half—Murphy turned round, pulled a staff from under his jacket, and stepped towards me to make a blow at me—an inmate who was standing by said, "For God's sake, don't strike Wakefield"—one of the others said, "Oh don't strike Wakefield"—Murphy brought the staff, and gave it into my hand without saying a word—I then took him into custody—I went up stairs and found Bristy bleeding—I brought him down—he was taken to the lodge, and my wife bathed his face to get the blood off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Murphy. Q.</hi> When your back was turned you say I drew the staff; how could you see that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I stood sideways.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inmate of the West London Union. On this morning I saw Murphy coming down stairs—I had charge of the door, and "when Bristy went up I locked the door to prevent anybody coming in—in a minute or two I heard cries of "Murder!" repeated—I did not know where it came from, but recollected that Bristy had gone up—I saw the three prisoners coming down together, and saw Wakefield and the night porter come up—I saw Murphy turn very suddenly round when he saw Wakefield—he drew the staff from under his coat, and raising his arm high, was about to make a tremendous blow at him—I said, "Oh Murphy," or "Stop Murphy," and he did not strike—I have before this heard Murphy say, in a conversa<lb></lb>tion with me, the very first opportunity he had he would lick Baskey's b----y head with his staff—he said no power on earth should put down the young men of the West London Union, and "The very first chance he gives me I will punch the b----y b----r's head with his own staff," for it was impossible for the governor or any Magistrate to keep down the spirit of the young men of the West Union.</p>

                  </hi>,. M.D. I am surgeon of the West London Union. On the 9th of Feb., about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was sent for, and found the prosecutor in bed—he complained of giddiness in his head, and stated that he had been beaten—I found two contusions on the side of his head, extending along each temple—on the left eye was extravasation, and it was considerably swollen, so much so I could not see whether the eye itself was injured, the effusion of blood was so considerable—on the other side I found considerable effusion, but that was the result of a minor contusion—on the temple was an abrasion, the skin scraped off, and blood streaming down that side of the face—there were several minor wounds in different parts and several small scratches on the temples either done by the hand or a kick—there seemed five or six of them—it was necessary he should keep his bed some days—I feared for two or three days there might have been concussion of the brain—the blows on the temple might be struck by this staff.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Dench. Q.</hi> Might the blows be struck with a fist? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The abrasion might—there would be some indentation from the knuckles if all the blows were from the fist, and they were too large contusions to be done by a fist.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Dench.</hi> The staff was never used at all; it is the same as charging Golding, that he should not be a witness for us; what blows he had was from the fist; he got Murphy down and said he would serve me the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Murphy's Defence.</hi> Bristy assaulted me first, and not being satisfied with that, he pulled out his staff and was going to strike me; it was natural to make some resistance, but I should not have struck him had he not kept his grasp of my throat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Dench's Defence.</hi> When I saw Murphy on the ground I told Mr. Baskey it was unmanly to hurt him, so he said, "You—, I will serve you the same;" then I certainly acted in my own defence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist at Barnes, in Surrey. On 13th Dec., the two Drennans came to my shop—Jane had a child as she has now—she asked for a powder for the child—I gave her two powders, and she gave me a shilling—I placed it in my till, where I had no other silver—I gave her 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in change, and they left the shop—I looked at the shilling in a few minutes afterwards—I had then no other money—I took it out, and it was a bad one—I marked it, and placed it back again—I had marked it through the head—the same evening the prisoner Lewis came from 5 to half past 5 o'clock, she asked for an ounce of salts for the bile—I said she had better take a couple of pills—I served her with some—I put them in a box—they came to a penny—she gave me a shilling—it remained on the counter; I gave her change, and she left—I then took the shilling from the counter, and it was bad—I followed Lewis out of the shop, with the shilling in my hand—I saw her join the other two prisoners at the corner; I called her back, and she came back; I asked her if she was aware that she had given me a bad shilling—she said, "No"—she gave me back the change, and paid me for the pills with a good sixpence—I broke the shilling, and returned the pieces to her—I can say that the shilling was bad—I saw the pills afterwards, at the Court at Wandsworth—I believe they were the same I had sold to Lewis—I gave the first shilling to the constable, about half past 5 o'clock—it was about 3 o'clock, when I received it from Jane Drennan—it had remained in the till all that time, and no other money had been put in.</p>

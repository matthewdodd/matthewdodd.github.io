                  </hi>—(<hi rend="italic">through an inter<lb></lb>preter</hi>.)I occupied the house, No. 4, Queen Anne-street; Admiral Donelly was my landlord. I paid 320<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year rent—the prisoner was in my employment—when I came from France, he was my interpreter, and when I became acquainted with the profession, he became my assistant, and then my secretaire, as I cannot write. English—on the 30th of July, this year, he said to me that Admiral Donelly had told him I was again about going abroad, and that he would be much obliged to me if I would settle the quarter's rent about to be due—I replied, it was very strange that when I had just paid the quarter due during my absence, the Admiral should make such a request, and said, "I was desirous to prove to the Admiral that I feel the want of delicacy in his demand," and on that account, the very morning the quarter should be due, he should be paid—I said, "Write a cheque for him, and I will sign it"—the cheque being written, the pri<lb></lb>soner presented it to me to be signed, and I saw on the margin that that cheque was intended for the rent up to the 1st of August, 1838-here is on the margin, "30th July, rent to 1st of August, 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—this is the cheque—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I requested the prisoner to send it—he took it up, and folded it up in an envelope, and that was all I saw of it—I did not desire him to ask the Admiral's indulgence as to the rent—I asked him, shortly after giving him the cheque, whether he had remitted it, and he said he had given it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you and the prisoner been connected in affairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Since 1830—I did not know him having any profession—he was introduced to me by Mr. Powell, a surgeon—I was living at No. 4 or 5, Parliament-street, at that time—he came as interpreter—Mr. Powell on introducing him said, "You have asked me for an interpreter, here is one"—he always remained with me as interpreter—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter dated November</hi> 3rd, 1835, <hi rend="italic">commencing, "My dear Master</hi> ")—this letter is in the prisoner's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. In the year 1835, and since, was the prisoner in the habit of perform<lb></lb>ing operations in surgery for you, on your patients? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not any other</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183811260124"></xptr>
               <p>than to introduce sounds or probes—that is a very small operation—it is not the custom in France to address an older, or superior surgeon, by the title of "master," but it is done—I have done it myself, not often—I have not counted how many times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you provide for the prisoner while he was in your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When he was first in my service he merely had his maintenance—after being with me a short time I told him, "I will not give you any employ<lb></lb>ment pay, but I will give you some compensation"—he did not manage my house-establishment, except as an intermediary, an agent, or in<lb></lb>terpreter, as I could not speak English—he paid bills for me after having permission from me—he did not act entirely for me while I was abroad—I left money with him, with express directions how to act, but I cannot give you the precise explanation thereupon through an interpreter—I left him some for the wants of the house, and that was also specified—so much to the butcher and baker, and other tradesmen—I never trusted to the pri<lb></lb>soner's discretion as to expenses—I had confidence in him, and I permitted him to receive money for me from my patients, but he invariably gave me an account of what he received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to swear, when you went abroad, yon left sufficient money with the prisoner, and with sufficient directions for its appropriation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I swear it—that is, money that I left, or money that he might receive during my absence—I have remained abroad a longer time than I have said I should, when I left—when I left I did not always determine very exactly the time I intended to remain abroad—the prisoner had enough money for the expenses of the establishment in my absence, and he might draw on me—he often had more money than was necessary—I have never left him without money or the means of getting it—I do not remember it—I never left him without money—I departed last to go abroad on the 31st of March—the prisoner then had in his possession 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. White—he had it previous to my departure—(<hi rend="italic">referring to his papers</hi>)—on the 16th of February I had given the prisoner a cheque of 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he had 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 19th of March, and I know he received some during my absence—I gave him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the butcher; 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the fishmonger; butter, eggs, &amp;c. 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; expenses during absence, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with requests to pay the servants, and finally to Mr. Biggs on his own account, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I went abroad, in March, 1837, the prisoner told me he had paid every thing, and I had 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at my banker's then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the prisoner in the habit of pledging things for you at the pawnbroker's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I have property now in pledge amounting to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and more—I have never employed the prisoner to pawn for me—I have not paid interest myself on things he has pawned—I cannot say what account I left at my banker's in March, 1837—it is an account to be in<lb></lb>quired into—I had overdrawn my account, but it was by a cheat of the pri<lb></lb>soner's—I had lent 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. White, with a condition that, when I should want it, he would return it—I had then requested Mr. White to send 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to my banker's—the prisoner had written to me that Mr. Gooch, one of my patients, had sent me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I thought I had consequently at my banker's 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, for he had told me that 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was at the banker's, also the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-upon the faith of that, I gave the cheque, and overdrew the account, without being aware of it—I became apprised that I had no money at my banker's, but they honoured my cheque, although I overdrew them—I have asked Mr. White for money for other transactions—I had nearly</p>

               <p>1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. White, on a special agreement that the money was to be<lb></lb>come my own-in 1835, 1836, and 1837, I was not rich, but I had enough. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have not you told the prisoner repeatedly to raise money for you how be could, but money, money, yon must have? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember that at all—I can swear I have not—I never induced or requested the prisoner to obtain money for me by any means—I may have said I did not know how to procure funds, but I never told the prisoner to obtain it by any means whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it true that in 1837 you did not know how to obtain money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It appears I knew how to obtain it, since I did obtain it—I did not say I did not know how to procure funds, but that I wanted to procure them—I had always the intention to undertake some speculation—I have never been at a loss-a man who, like me, has a house, a carriage, and a horse, is never at a loss, as I can always reduce my expenses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not repeatedly told Mr. Biggs you must pawn or sell your horse or carriage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but Mr. Biggs deceived me—he had in his hands 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. belonging to me, which he was spending-in 1836 he pro<lb></lb>cured 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from one Branfield, as a loan—I cannot say whether I received 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of that, and the prisoner the other while I was abroad, because I sent Mr. Biggs to Mr. Branfield to send the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot remember whether Biggs received 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it for his general purposes—I never authorised the prisoner to borrow some hundreds of Mr. Borden, of Gros-venor-place—he did not decline, and refer me to the Lithontriptic Society—I will swear it never happened—I know Mr. Borden, of the Bank—I never applied to Mr. Borden to lend me money, nor desired the prisoner to do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know that the Lithontriptic Society voted you a gratuity of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, on the consideration of your distressed circumstances? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Had it been given on those terms, I would not have accepted it—I do not know in what year I received the first payment—I was not in distressed circumstances at the time I became acquainted with Mr. Borden—I am never in want of funds, as they come to me in an unexpected manner, and at all times—it depends entirely on my profession, which is fluctuating—I did not authorise die prisoner to borrow money of Mr. Gillet—I sent him to fetch money from my friends—Mr. Gillet told me, when I first came to England, whenever I wanted money to apply, and I should have it—since I have been in England I have borrowed money of him, and paid him, and I now owe him 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I very likely borrowed 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of him, but I cannot say—I have no recollection of applying that 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., by means of the pri<lb></lb>soner, to pay an acceptance that was overdue—I will swear I do sot re<lb></lb>member it—it is very likely I may have accepted a bill of £80 for a Mr. Taylor—I remember that bill was paid, but by what means I do not know—I was in the hands of the prisoner, for, in general, I did not read English—this is my writing—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>)—I do not know how this piece came cut out of it—the last time I saw the piece in it was when I wrote it—I have never seen it since—my solicitor has had the charge of the letter for the last two months.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever authorised the prisoner to borrow money of Mr. Lam<lb></lb>bell for you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I requested him to write to my friend Lambell, to whom I had lent money, to send me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in consequence of the prisoner having kept the money obtained from Mr. White—I never authorised him to bor<lb></lb>row money of Mr. Lambell—I told him to write for money—Mr. Lambell had owed me money before, but not then, but then Biggs was merely an</p>

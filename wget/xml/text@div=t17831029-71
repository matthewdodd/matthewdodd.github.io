               <p>- PARKER sworn.</p>
               <p>My brother is a pawnbroker. He has two shops, which join tog ether. The prisoner brought these knives to me to sell, and asked if we bought old silver; I told him yes. I suspected him of having stolen them. I asked him where he had them: he said of a gentleman's servant who lives at No. 35, in Windmill-street. I went to Windmill-street, and found no such person, and I stopped the prisoner.</p>
               <p>(The things shewn to Mr. Phillips, who said they were so worn he could not speak to them.)</p>
               <p>Court to Phillips. I see a great reluctance in you, Mr. Phillips; it is very kind, but, at the same time, justice demands your evidence: have you missed any thing? - Sometime ago I lost a great many.</p>
               <p>Do you believe these to be yours? - Yes, I think they are.</p>
               <p>Court to Parker. This is very laudable in you, to do as you have done.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290159"></xptr>Prosecutor. The prisoner had an opportunity of robbing me of a great deal, and I never found him dishonest in my life.</p>
               <p>Court. Would you take him again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. There is no absolute proof that this man took these things; they are in his custody, and he gives no account how he came by them. I know, Gentlemen, your inclination is both for justice and mercy. His character, you hear, is most excellent.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. You see what service a good character is of. You are under infinite obligations to your master, and he says he will take you again. I hope all the world will not induce you to behave ill again.</p>

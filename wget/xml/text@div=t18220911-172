               <p>MRS. LIZEY DONNOLON. I live in Lower Lisson-street, Paddington. On the 29th of July, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I delivered the prisoner a caravan box, a large and small bundle; they contained the articles stated in the indictment; the servant had fetched him from the public-house; he was to follow me and Mrs. Twycross, who is my mother, to Newcastle-street, Strand; they were delivered to him at our house; he followed close to us as far as Blackmore-street, Clare-market. I kept my eye on him till then - and at the corner of <placeName id="t18220911-172-crimeloc900">Newcastle street</placeName>

            . I keep a public-house in Gray's Inn-lane. About four o'clock in the afternoon of the robbery, the prisoner brought in a trunk and a bundle, tied in a red handkerchief. He lodged in the neighbourhood. He sat down drinking, then took the red bundle into my kitchen, and I saw him take a flannel petticoat and some other things out, and ask my servant to pledge them for him, which I forbid; he went out with them, leaving the trunk and the rest of the bundle - he returned in about half an hour, and staid till near nine o'clock at night. I insisted on his taking them away, as they were in my way; and spoke to him about his taking some out to pawn. He said they belonged to his sister, who was either leaving her place or going to one. He called again next morning, with the box. I said,</p>
               <p>"Smith, you have broken that box open since you were here;" he said, No, he had not, for he was taken to the watch-house with it the night before, and he did not know what they had done with it there. I noticed that the cord was off.</p>

            . I live in Tash-street, Gray's Inn-lane. On the 29th of July, soon after nine o'clock at night, the prisoner came to my room with a small trunk and bundle, and said he had come to make a return to my husband for giving him victuals when he was out of work; he was very drunk, and when my husband came home, he asked leave to stop all night. He lay on the floor with the box and bundle under his head, and in the morning he asked me to pawn some things for him. I pawned a piece of lace at Nicholls's, a veil at Cree's. I brought him the duplicates; he said I might do as I liked with them - they were of no use to him; and I sold them to Davis. I saw him burn the duplicate of a white gown. This was Monday the 29th; he left on Tuesday afternoon, with the box and bundle tied on his shoulder, and came again in the evening; but my husband would not let him in.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 15th of August, I apprehended the prisoner, and asked where the ladies' box was - he said he got tipsy with some women<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110085"></xptr>in Drury-lane, and went from there to the White Conduit-fields, and while he was there asleep, somebody came and stole the box from him. I told him he had been to Pitway's, he said he had, and to a house in Tash-street. Davis delivered me a gown, a petticoat, a pair of shoes, and a towel.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was obliged to stop for a moment, and lost sight of the ladies. I met three women, one of whom I knew; I told them of it, and they said I had better take the things back to where I brought them from. We went to have something to drink - one woman went out. I missed the bundle, and went to look for her; I enquired at several places for her, and was asked to drink, got intoxicated, fell down, and burst the box open. I went to West's, and pawned the things to buy liquor for her. I went out at night, and in the morning I found myself in the fields, stripped of every thing.</p>

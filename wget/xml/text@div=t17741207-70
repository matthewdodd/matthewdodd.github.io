            , Esq; I am Comptroller of the bye-nights; the prisoner at the bar was an officer in my department; his business was on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, in an evening, with other junior sorters, to sort the letters that come out of the country, and which were to go into the country again, and on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, it was his business to attend in the morning after they are sorted, these letters are to be carried over to the respective roads, to be dispatched that night. The letters that don't go that night, are put over to the respective roads, to go on Tuesday night; on Monday the 26th of September, the prisoner was upon duty, as usual in sorting letters; he had been ill from the 11th of April to the 18th; but from that time down to the 26th of September, he attended as a sorter of letters; a letter from Lewis in Sussex, to Lymington, might therefore probably go into his hands; there are six or seven persons in all employed in that business; a letter of Saturday the 24th of September, coming from Lewis reaches the office in town on the 26th, about eight or nine o'clock, it must come to our Office in London to go to Lymington, because there is no cross post from that place, and they set out from our office about two o'clock on Tuesday night, or Wednesday morning, and itwill arrive at Lymington in the usual course late on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any appointment in writing?</p>
               <p>Mr. Balton, The mode of appointing this office is in the book; he was appointed a junior facier, upon the death of one Dixon, but after that, they gradually rise without any new appointment, and become a sorter: there is no appointment in writing after the first. I am the person that appoints them: and now we have a great many more officers than formerly we had upon the bye nights, as there are a great many more letters: we used to have not above three, now we have six or seven sorters.</p>

            . I am assistant Clerk of the Kent-road, on Monday the 26th of October. I was at the general Post office. I opened the Lewes bag and counted the number of letters. I found them agreeable to the Lewes postmaster's bill, and the charges that were therein. If any letter had been taken out, I should have discovered it by the letters not agreeing with the bill of the post-master; the charges are made at Lewes, and sent up with the bill to the post office at London.</p>

               <p>Dunstan. We examine the seals, in order to see whether they are broke: a post-boy may take a letter after the bag is sealed, and deliver it at the next post town, but not into the bag of the post town.</p>

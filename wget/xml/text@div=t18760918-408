                  </hi>. I live at Shepperton—on 4th September, about 9.15 p.m., I was going home, and saw three men near Doomsday Stile—the prisoner was one of them, he had a straw hat, the others had black hats—I went over the stile into the meadow, and when I had gone about 200 yards the prisoner passed me about 4 yards, and then turned round and hit me a blow on my forehead with his fist, and I fell on my back—I struggled to get up, but he took a stick from my little grandson and com<lb></lb>menced beating me over my head and arms—I was knocked down again twice, and was very much hurt, you can see the bruises now—I screamed "Murder!" and put up my arms to save my head, and received the blows on my arms—I begged him to leave me alone—I got up in a stooping position, and he struck me a blow on the back of my head and knocked me down again—I lost my senses, and when I recovered, I went to the Cricketers—I found the stick and gave it to my little boy—it was a large withy stick—I had a basket with a candle in it, and a clasp-knife and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—a coachman found the basket next morning, but I have never seen the money or the knife since—a doctor attended me till last Saturday, he is not here—this was on a Monday night, and on the Wednesday I was sent for to the station and saw ten men standing together—the prisoner is one of them, and I identified him as the man who robbed me, he was wear<lb></lb>ing a straw hat—my grandson was with me all the time—there are several gaps in the fence which runs by the pathway in the field.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I started about 6 o'clock, and went to the fields to get some mushrooms—I then went to the shops, which are about a mile from the bridge, they were closed, and I met a friend or two and we stood talk—Ing—I met Sherwood, the carrier's wife, and walked with her—I went into the Cricketer's public-house—I have been in Chertsey all my life, and am well known there—they call me <hi rend="italic">Old Mother Doggett—we</hi> live at Doggett—I have a large family, and have brought them up—I do not know that I am known there as a person of ill-fame—I am a prudent married woman—I do not know what people say, but I have been very much respected—I stopped at the Cricketers about ten minutes—I did not drink there, I went in for a candle, and had to wait while the landlord's little boy fetched one—I also went into Crispin Payne's house, I have know him for years; I had nothing to drink there, but I had a glass of ale at Mr. Tulford's—I left Payne's about 8.30—I did not go down the steps of Chertsey Bridge with Blisset, a labourer; and I do not remember going down the steps—I believe I went down the middle of the road—I said before the Magistrate that I saw Blisset that evening, I could not recollect where—I saw no one near</p>

                  </hi>. I live with ray grandmother—I went over the stile with her into the meadow about 9.15—she picked up a stick as thick as my wrist on the way and gave it to me—the prisoner and two other men were at the stile, the prisoner was wearing a dirty straw hat; he came up to us about 200 yards from the stile and knocked <hi rend="italic">Granny</hi> down and I then struck him three blows with the stick, he took it from me and thrashed my grand<lb></lb>mother—she was knocked down three or four times—he struck her on the head and on the wrist and back, she cried out and I ran away to find some<lb></lb>one, leaving her on the ground—I saw the prisoner kick her—I did not see a man named Blissest, no man of that name spoke to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She was attacked about four minutes after we left the stile—I was before the Magistrate the second time she was examined and heard her say that we had gone about 200 yards across the meadow—I hit the prisoner on the head several times with the stick as hard as I could.</p>

I am a mason's labourer—on 4th September I was with the prisoner, we went over Cherstsey Bridge, and as far as Doomsday Stile, it was then a little after 9 o'clock—he had had a little drop too much drink, he was wearing a straw hat—I had a black hat and so had Sanders who was with us—I saw the old <hi rend="italic">lady</hi> and her grandchild go over the stile into the meadow—a man named Tickner went over the stile before them and went down the Shepperton Road, and in two or three minutes I started the prisoner down the road towards Shepperton—that road runs in a line with the footpath in the meadow, but it widens a little from it—I do not know whether there are any gaps in the hedge—I then went back with the other man over Chertsey Bridge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known the prisoner eleven or twelve years—he is a shoemaker and bears a very excellent character—I have heard that a great number of respectable people have raised a subscription to defend him—the prosecutrix is well-known in the neighbourhood as <hi rend="italic">Old Mother Dockett</hi>—I was about quarter of an hour at the stile chatting with Sanders and the prisoner, and we persuaded the prisoner to go home because he was drunk—he had some leather with him and I put it inside his trousers and buckled it round for him so that he could not lose it—Sanders is not here—I saw the woman and the boy at the foot of the bridge before they came to the stile—it was getting dark, but the moon was just rising—it was dark at the ime she passed the stile—I stopped about a minute after I persuaded the prisoner to go home—we walked quick across the bridge—it is lonely and open there.</p>

I am stationed at Staines—I received information and went to the prosecutrix's house, and from what she said Pook and I took the prisoner on Wednesday morning at 5.45—I told him I should take him in custody for violently assaulting Mrs. Poulter and taking from her 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a pocket knife—he made no reply at first, and then he said "I never saw any woman that night, I was in company with Sanders and Wicks and parted with them at the bridge"—I took him to the station—he was placed with ten other men in working clothes, eight of whom, besides himself, had. straw hats on, and directly Mrs. Poulter saw him she identified him—he said that she was mistaken—she said that she was not,</p>

               <p>she was quite confident he was the man—he said that he had parted with Sanders at the stile, but did not say where he went—I went with Mrs. Poulter and her grandson to the place where the assault was committed and measured the distance from the stile to that spot; it was 190 yards and the footpath at that point is 13 yards from the road—there is a quick fence with gaps at certain parts by which anybody could readily get into the meadow—Mrs. Poulter's head was very much swollen and she complained of being bruised on her back and her head.</p>

               <p>Q. During the course of that employment were you led to any suspicion of him? - A. I certainly was.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of these suspicion were you induced to question him particularly respecting the receipts of the 27th of November? - A. Particularly so; I particularly cautioned him to account for all the monies he had received on that day and previous to that day.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you so questioned him? - A. On the night of the 28th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Was their any mention of the receipt of a fare of nine shillings? - A. No; I did not ask him particularly as to every fare; I said, Sperinck, have you put all your parcels and passengers upon this bill; he said they were all put down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he produce to you a way-bill of the 27th of November? - A. He was about to settle the way-bill with the book-keeper, who always settles it with him; the way-bill of the 27th and 28th are upon one sheet of paper, and settled at one and the same time; (Produces the way-bill), this is the way-bill settled.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they kept distinct? - A. Although they are on one sheet of paper they are kept separate, one is the down bill of the 27th, and the other the up bill of the 28th.</p>

No; I am the proprietor of the coach from London to Buckingham, and Mr. Pratt from Buckingham to Banbury; the distance between London and Banbury is agreed between me and my partner to be seventy-seven miles, my share is sixty-one miles.</p>
               <p>Q. Your share of what? - A. Of what the coach earns; suppose the coach earns seventy-seven pounds in a week, in four weeks, after the duty, the expences of the tolls, and the use of the coach are deducted from it, I should take sixty-one pounds and my partner would take sixteen pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you take the whole earnings of the coach? - A. The whole earnings of the coach are calculated upon.</p>
               <p>Q. Instead of proportioning upon miles, you have a certain share upon the whole earnings? - A. Yes; I have sixty-one shares out of seventy-seven.</p>
               <p>Q. In the same proportion you are answerable for loss as well as profit? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Your business, like any other business, is divided into seventy-seven shares, of which you have sixty-one? - A. On that coach.</p>
               <p>Q. You, however, having so many shares, have the sixty-one miles nearest your own dwelling? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. All the expence of the first sixty-one miles is borne by you? - A. No; the horses have nothing to do with the nature of a stage-coach account, each person upon the ground that he horses a coach finds his own horses; the duty, the tolls, and other incidental expences are borne in an equal proportion according to the number of miles. I will state to your Lordship the manner in which we settle stage-coach accounts; we settle every four weeks, the nett is then divided by the number of miles that the coach goes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you both contribute towards the expences? - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Who hired the prisoner, you or Mr. Pratt? - A. I hired him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the sole controul over him? - A I had the greatest controul over him.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not go so far as Mr. Pratt's dwelling? - A. Not as my servant; I believe he has gone the whole way; I hired both the coachmen, and they were paid out of the joint earnings of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you no other partner in your share? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has Mr. Pratt any body concerned with him in his share? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was the driver of the coach that day? - A.

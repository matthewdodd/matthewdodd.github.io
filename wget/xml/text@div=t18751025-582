               <p>Bishop's Road which is a receiving office—in consequence of some complaints to me I made up a test letter on 5th October; I enclosed 180 penny postage stamps in a blue envelope which I securely fastened and sealed and addressed it to Miss A. Walwyn, 3, Wood's Cottages, Buckland Road, Dover—I had marked each stamp with invisible ink—I posted the letter at Bishop's Róad office at about 5.15—the box closes at 5.30 and the prisoner would then make up the collection' for the letter-carrier, who would take it to the Spring Street office, reaching there shortly before 6 o'clock—a communication was made to me and I went to the Bishop's Road office again shortly after 6 o'clock—I saw Mr. Hutchins outside—I did not go in then, but I went past the office several times between then and 7.50—I also sent several persons into the office to purchase stamps and I went in myself, but the prisoner did not know what I went in for—Miss Crossley was there and the prisoner—Miss Crossley left at 7.50, leaving the prisoner in charge—the box closed again at 8 o'clock, and the carrier called for the letters at 8.15—it was the prisoner's duty and no one else's to take out the 8 o'clock collection—I went to and fro several times, I intended going in at 8.10, but saw the prisoner engaged very busily at the post-office counter—I went on and returned again and about five minutes afterwards I went into the office with a policeman—the prisoner was then at the extreme end of the batter's counter putting on his hat and coat to go home—I said "I belong to the Post Office, where is the 8 o'clock collection?"—he said "There it is"—I went inside; the bag was tied and sealed, I cut it open and found that the letter was not there—I tied it up again and said "Did you make up the 5.30 collections"—he said "Yes"—I said "I posted a letter here by that collection addressed to Miss A. Walwyn, search has been made for it and it was not there, do you know anything about it?"—he said "No"—I said "Did you make up the 8 o'clock collection?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Did you" dispatch the whole of the letters to Spring Street office?"—he said "Yes"—I stooped down and pulled out the drawers of the box—which the letters fall into, one under the other, so that there is no possibility of their going on to the floor; I looked down and saw an unobliterated postage stamp which had been torn from an envelope; I looked at it and found that it was the marked stamp which I had put on the envelope addressed to Miss Walwyn—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw these pieces of paper on the floor, the half-sheet had been torn into sixty two pieces—I said "Why, here is the stamp and a portion of the enve<lb></lb>lope I have been speaking to you about"—he said "I know nothing about them"—I said "Where are the keys of the till?"—he said "There they are"—I said "No"—he said "They were there before you opened the bag"—I said "I am certain they were not"—Miss Crossley then came in and said that she had left them on the counter—the constable spoke to him and they walked to the other end of the shop, and Butler returned with the keys with which I opened the post-office till and found there one piece of twenty-four penny stamps, ten pieces of twelve, ten of nine, and others, amounting altogether to 241 stamps, 108 of which I identified by my test as coming out of Miss Walwyn's letter—I told the prisoner that and he said "I know nothing about them"—I gave him in custody—next day at Bow Street Mr. Angle handed me these seventy-four stamps—I have applied my test to them and seventy-one of them came out of Miss Wahwyn's letter—only one is missing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a post-office letter receiver, of Bishop's Road, Paddington—the prisoner came into my employment about a year and a half ago—he was to attend to the hat customers and to assist in the post-office generally—it was his duty to clear the boxes and hand the letters to the letter carrier who called for the collection, and he always did it—Miss Crossley is my clerk—she has nothing to do with collecting letters from the letter-box; her duty was confined to selling stamps, attending to the telegraph business, and money orders, the savings bank, and the general business of the post-office—she had the keys of two drawers in the post-office counter—there was also a drawer which was allotted to the prisoner for keeping stamps in, which he could sell before Miss Crossley arrived in the morning—no other persons were employed in the shop—the prisoner was paid by wages, and I took into account the duties he discharged in the. post-office; it was understood that he was to do all he could to assist in the post-office business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was part of your agreement when you first came to look after the post-office—I should not have employed you unless you had agreed to serve in the post-office—my son, Frederick Thomas, was in charge of the post-office when you came—I do not remember what he was indebted to the post-office then; I had to pay some money which was lost during the time he was there—I do not know that he borrowed money out of the post-office—I do not remember saying to him "If you want money borrow t of me, and don't take it out of the post-office drawer"—after he left a lady had charge of the post-office, before Miss Crossley came—I told you that Mr. smith told me to be very careful of that lady, as she was wrong in her accounts—I do not remember that after she had been there ten or twelve lays she was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. short—Frederick Angle did not go upstairs and find the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and say that it had just dropped out of the box; it was not in his bed-room, it was in my desk—your private drawer had no lock or key; anybody could go to it—the drawer where the stamps are kept has, I believe, been opened without a key by a good deal of wriggling, which I found out after<lb></lb>wards—the letter-boxes are difficult to draw out, but they are perfectly new; no one could get them out without being heard—they are not locked; anybody in the post-office could take a letter out, and anybody could have made the collection at 5 o'clock instead of 5.30—I never saw letters all found the box—I do not know that we have found letters there days after wards—on one occasion my son Sidney paid money out of the till after you had gone of a night, and I told him never to do it again—you told me of it the same day, and I gave you the half-crown out of my pocket—I do not know that you complained to me of his abusing and threatening you for telling me; he is here—you were generally given the post-office keys of a morning before Miss Crossley came—you had the private drawer to keep a pound's worth of stamps in—when you closed the shop you sometimes gave the key to me and sometimes to my son.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk at the Bishops Road receiving office and have been employed in the post-office seven months—the prisoner assisted me, he was in the habit of collecting the letters out of the box and making them up, and they were handed over to the carrier—a communication was made to me a fortnight previously, that a test was going to be applied to the office, and on 5th October, I was there at 5 o'clock, and I remember the prisoner making the collection at 5.30—no one but he and I were engaged in the post-office—when he had collected the letters out of the box they were given to the collector—they are not sealed at that hour, only at 8 o'clock—I left at 5.50, but was not away more than five minutes, when I returned and remained, till 7.50, and left about 140 penny' stamps in the till—I locked the till and left the prisoner in the office when I went away—I put the keys on the post-office counter, that was the practice—I returned that evening with Mr. Stevens, who asked me where I had left the keys; I said said "On the counter"—they were not there then, and he asked the prisoner where they were—he said that he had not touched them—next morning when I went on duty, Mr. F. T. Angle made a communication to me in consequence of which I went to the prisoner's private drawer and found seventy-four postage stamps there which were put into an envelope and given to Mr. Angle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had finished my tea when Mr. F. Angle came back to the shop, but I had not made up my account then; I made it up after<lb></lb>wards—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the two papers on which I made it up—they both tally as to the amount of stamps, the one made up late and the former one—I make up my accounts every night—I have only twice made imaginary accounts when Mr. Angle gave me permission to leave early, and I made a guess at the number of stamps I had sold during the day—you always cleared the boxes as a rule, but occasionally I did it if you were out of the way—the postmen have cleared the boxes themselves—the stamp drawer will open whether locked or not; it comes open with a jerk—that is the drawer where the seventy-five stamps were found—the keys were there after I left, and you could go to the till—I do not recollect Mr. F. Angle borrowing money out of my till—I do not remember saying to you one morning when you came "Mr. F. Angle has borrowed a half-crown out of your till; he will pay you to-night"—I do not recollect his paying me a half-crown one Friday night—I cannot recollect being thirty-seven short—I was short occasionally, and I always made it up, not out of my own pocket but by buying stamps of the public, there is a commission of so much in the pound—I do not remember saying to you "If it is done again I shall acquaint his father, I am not going to have money taken out of my till, if you do out of yours"—I had generally gone before the 8 o'clock letters were tied up.</p>

I went with him—I heard some inquiry made for the keys and assisted Mr. Stevens in searching for them—we could "not find them—I wont to the prisoner and said "You must know where the keys are, because there has been no one else here but you since Miss Crossley</p>

He urged that the Jury could not rely upon the evidence when they had seen the loose way in which the business of the post-office had been conducted, that the drawer was unlocked and anyone would have put the stamps in, and that he neither stole the letter nor the stamps</hi>—</p>

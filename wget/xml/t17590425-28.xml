            , that lodges at the same Inn. I show'd him the place where it was broke; he said, He was very sorry for it; it was very hard men did not know their own. There were several other people looking at it at the time. He was going out, I asked him where he was going? he said, he was going of an errand for his master to St James's-Street. His master advised<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175904250037"></xptr> me when he was gone to take him up upon suspicion; he said he had had no money from him for a fortnight, and he had changed two or three guineas with me a little before; I went to get a warrant and went to Justice Fielding to have it back'd, in order to go and take him up in Westminster, but he came soon back; then his master sent me word he was return'd and they had detected him, and he had deliver'd the money up to his master; and when I came back, the prisoner own'd to the robbing of me of forty-two pounds five shillings upon my charging him with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say in what manner he did it?</p>
               <p>Gray. He told me he broke in at the casement in the tap-room, and came in at the little room door, and broke the lock of the buroe open, where my money was in a drawer; the buroe stood in the corner of that room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the drawer lock'd over night?</p>
               <p>Gray. It was: and the prisoner own'd he broke the lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what time it was that he did it?</p>
               <p>Gray. He said it was between the hours of three and four in the morning?</p>

The prisoner was my servant; I had a suspicion that he was guilty, he having more money than I thought he could come honestly by; when Mr Gray was gone out in order to take the prisoner, he came in and ask'd for me; I met him at the door and took him by the collar, and shew'd him the place that was broke, and ask'd him if he was guilty of breaking that; he at first deny'd it, and afterwards owned he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed him to have much money about him?</p>
               <p>Long. He had two guineas and an half in his pocket then and some silver, besides a purse of thirty-eight guineas and an half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him wages sufficient to supply him with so much money?</p>
               <p>Long. No. I ask'd him whether that money belong'd to Mr Gray or not; his answer was, yes; and he said, he broke the drawer open?</p>

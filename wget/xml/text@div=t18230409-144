On the 16th of January, the prisoner applied to me, stating that he knew a great many respectable people, and wished to sell goods for me, at 2 1/2 per cent. commission. I let him have fifty-six yards of lutestring, worth 12 l., upon his promising to return the money or goods that night, or by nine o'clock next morning - he did not come next morning, and I sent my apprentice after him; but did not see him for two days, when he came to my place, and said he had fallen down on Blackfriars-bridge, and hurt himself; that he had sold the goods with some gloves to Mr. Attfield in the country, and wanted more goods; that he had an order upon Messrs. Fry's, bankers, for 50 l., by letter, which he did not produce. I never saw Attfield; he gave me this paper, (looking at it) - I was to keep it, and he was to send a copy of it to Attfield, to remit up the money; I have not received the goods or money. I had delivered him other goods, between the 18th of January, and the time this letter was written. I found the property in pawn on the 28th of February, and went to the Sun, tavern for the prisoner, but he had absconded.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You knew him before - A. Yes; he lived at a wholesale house. I met him in the street - he said he was selling goods on commission. I had three transactions with him.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. He was to bring the money or goods back next morning for the first goods - A. Yes. I let him have more in consequence of his stating that he had an order to receive money at Messrs. Fry's, on the 15th. I have found another piece of goods in pawn, which I supplied him with.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 133.) On Friday night, the 22nd of February, I was in Chiswell-street, about seven o'clock—I saw the prisoner in company with two women and a man—I watched them, and saw some<lb></lb>thing pass from another woman to the prisoner, and those two went on to<lb></lb>wards Bunhill-row—the prisoner turned her head and saw me—she looked confused—I went up, and seized hold of her left hand, which I saw her put up to her mouth—I struggled with her till the sergeant came up, and in her hand was found a rag, with four sixpences in it—she was then taken, and said she had been led into it—that she saw them made, and if we would go with her she would show us where they were made—I took her to the station-house, and next day she told us the same—she took us to a house, and led us to a room—we burst in, and it was not there—she then took us to another room, and we burst in there—there was no one there—she then said it was another house, and then she said she did not know where it was.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was very tipsy—I met a man and a woman—they took me to a house—I do not know where it was—in coming along they gave me this in a bit of rag—I never saw what they were—the woman asked me to hold it—when the officer took me—I said, "Don't hurt my hand, and I will show you what I have got"—I said, "I will show where I got it"—we went—it was in Red Lion-market, but I do not know whether it was a one-pair room or two—I never offered a bad sixpence in my life.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant G</hi> 20.) I came to the assistance of Tate, who I saw struggling with the prisoner—I saw him take a piece of rag out of her hand, which was very near her mouth—we found in the rag four counterfeit sixpences—she had been drinking, but was not drunk—I went the next morning with Tate to every house, and she pointed first to one place and then to another, and then she said, "If it is not here it must be somewhere else."</p>

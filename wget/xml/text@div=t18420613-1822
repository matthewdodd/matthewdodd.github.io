                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Hugh Edwards, and live in Bedford-row. On Thursday, the 12th of May, I took a cab from home to go to Pall-mall, and went to the Water Colour Exhibition with a young friend—the prisoner drove the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I had a bag on my arm, and a purse in it, containing 2 sovereigns and 3 shillings—I had seen the money in the purse a few minutes before I left home—I referred to my purse before I left the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and I imagined that I put it in my bag again—when I got up the steps of the Exhibition, and was going to pay the admission-money, I discovered my purse was gone—I went down as quickly as possible into the street, but the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was gone—I went into the Haymarket, but it was no use—I have not seen my purse again.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Pall-mall East. On Thursday, the 12th of May, I was standing at my window, which is directly over the Water Colour Exhibition—I remember a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> coming with Mrs. Edwards to the Exhibition—immediately she had got out I saw a purse lying in the gutter—I saw the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-man, when he got down to shut the door stoop, and with his right hand take up the purse, then he got on the box and drove away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A lodging-house keeper—the door of the gallery does not project—it was a wet day—I do not re<lb></lb>member whether many <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> drove up—I was only there a few minutes—I saw the number of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I gave a number, but I cannot tell what number I gave—I gave a wrong number—I did not know the prisoner's person—I saw the two ladies run out, as if going to try to overtake the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—when they came back, I saw Mrs. Edwards at the door—I went and told her—I do not remember that there was any one there who opened and shut the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> doors—I saw the purse through the steps of the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> it</p>

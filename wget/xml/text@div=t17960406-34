               <p>Q. Had you any information from Ody, about your having lost a sheep? - A. Yes; and I went directly to Iver Moor, on the 12th of February, about three o'clock, to see whether I had lost one or not, and missed a ewe sheep.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN ODY sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am bailiff to Squire Higginson; I live within half-a-mile of Weatherby's</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Gowlett? - A. Yes; I have known him about a twelvemonth: On the 12th of February, I was going from Uxbridge towards Iver; I met him at the distance of forty or fifty yards from me, with a sheep, with a small cord tied round the horns, driving and dragging it along; the sheep had a very fine turned horn, with an old riddle mark across the shoulder; I helped to shear Weatherby's sheep, and I believe I have helped to mark them; I have been at the marking however.</p>
               <p>Q. You were well acquainted with the appearance of his sheep? - A. Yes; and to avoid me, he took over the Moor, through a lake of water, I suppose, knee deep, up to a bridge that goes over the New Cut; and that was the last I saw of him.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a singular thing, driving sheep through water? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That made you observe him the more? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any doubt whose sheep it was? - A. I had a thought it was Mr. Weatherby's; but I did not see his name upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing particular about the horns of Weatherby's sheep? - A. Nothing more than that it is a fine turned horn.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that, did you give any information to any body? - A. Yes; as soon as I got home, I told my master, and he sent another servant to let Mr. Weatherby know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You are servant to Mr. Higginson? - A. Yes.</p>

            Not to the prosecutor? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it was not likely that a man should be afraid of meeting you on the road, with a sheep not belonging to your own master? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At about forty or fifty yards distance you first saw this sheep? - A. More than that when I saw him first; but the nearest I was to him was forty or fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been at the shearing of these sheep; were you at the last shearing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When they are sheared, are the marks cut out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you mean to swear to that mark, at the distance of forty or fifty yards? - A. I swear to the mark I saw; it is a usual mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Many other farmers use the same mark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear to the crooked horn of the sheep? - A. I could swear to it, if I saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you swear to the crooked horn of this sheep at that distance? - A. I took that notice, that what I saw I will swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Norman, the constable? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you and Norman had any conversation about this sheep? - A. Yes, to be sure; that the sheep was gone so and so.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not asked Norman, before he went to the Grand Jury, what he said before the Magistrate? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath. did not you ask Norman some questions, as to the manner in which he swore to this sheep? - A. I don't think I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you believe you did not? - A. I cannot tell that I have had any conversation in that respect.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not ask Norman what he said before the Magistrate in the country? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I will ask you again, and remind you of the language, did you not ask him by what mark he had sworn to the sheep? - A. To the best of my knowledge, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not ask him, what kind of description he had given him, by the prosecutor, of this sheep? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said, that unless Norman would tell you what he had swore before the Magistrate, you would not undertake again to swear to the sheep? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this sheep dirty or clean when you saw it? - A. Very dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said it was so dirty you could not tell whether it was black or white? - A. I said, it had more the appearance of a black one than a white one.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you will swear to the marks? - A. No; you try me too hard there; I said, it had more the appearance of a black one than a white one.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, will you, not with standing that, venture to swear to the mark, at that distance? - A. I swear to what I see; I said, I saw an old ruddle mark upon the shoulder, and a fine turned horn.</p>
               <p>Q. But you don't mean to swear it was the prosecutor's sheep? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. My learned friend has asked you, whether it was likely Gowlett should get out of the way; likely or not, is of no consequence; did he in fact avoid you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. Q. Have you never heard of a reward for prosecuting a sheep-stealer? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard it from the constable? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear it in your life? -

               <p>Jury. Q. Do you mean to say that it was black on account of the dirt? - A. Yes; being dragged over the Moor.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are farmers used to change their marks? - A. No; he has stuck to that mark these ten years, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You immediately gave an account of this to your master; that he had got Mr. Weatherby's sheep? - A. He had some sheep which I thought to be his.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Weatherby.) Q. What marks had your sheep? - A. A mark of a W on the near side; a black pitch mark, and a ruddle mark, along the neck and across the shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the information you had had from Ody, where did you go to? - A. I went to Uxbridge to make enquirles what to do; I was a poor man, and did not know.</p>
               <p>Q. After receiving any information, where did you go to? - A. I went to Mr. Bishop's, the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Read, the prisoner? - A. Yes; he is a little butcher, at Hillingdon end of Uxbridge town; I went to his house before I went to Mr. Bishop's; I asked him whether he had not got a sheep brought to him; I did not mention Gowlett's name; then it was about four o'clock; he said, he had not bought any such thing for a fortnight; I said to him, sir, you have had one brought to you within about these two hours, or thereabouts; and I told him, Gowlett had brought it; says he, now Mr. Weatherby, I will tell you the truth of it; I met him in Cowley fields, and I bought it of him, and gave him 16s. 6d. for it.</p>

            What is the value of that sheep? - A. About a guinea; she was big with lamb; it was not fit for marketing; we kept them, at that time, to breed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Then no butcher would have bought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060028"></xptr>A. I should have thought so. Then I asked him to let me see it; then he humm'd and haw'd and said, he did not know where it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shew it you? - A. No; I never saw it at last; I asked him several times, and told him, if it was not mine I would not own it; but he would not shew it me, and I left him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. How long was it from the time you had seen the sheep, till you understood you had lost it? - A. The Thursday night, about five o'clock, I saw them there; and I lost it on Friday, between one and two.</p>

On Wednesday morning he came down to me, and told me. he had not told the skin; he told me, it was in a little shop he had under the market-house, he told me to go and take it; I went with him to look at it, and it resembled the marks of the skin that I had had a description of; I took the skin, and kept it till I went before the Magistrate, but they would not swear to it; it is here, I put a particular mark upon it.</p>

            There is nothing particular about this skin? - A. Yes, a mark across the shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. You went away with the skin, and left the prisoner there? - A. He was taken afterwards by a Hillingdon constable.</p>
               <p>Q. And he staid at his own house from the time you first made enquiry, till he was taken up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Weatherby's sheep previous to this time? - A. Yes; but never took any particular notice of them.</p>

            Therefore, whether this was the skin of Mr. Weatherby's sheep you cannot say? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Ody, when you were going to the Grand Jury, ask you if you recollected what you said before the Magistrate? - A. Yes; I believe he did.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if Ody has said he did not ask you that, he has told a falsehood? - A. I told him we were bound in a twenty pound bond to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not ask you what you said about the marks of the sheep, and that if you would not undertake to swear to it, he was sure he could not? - A. He did say something as to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a constable of the town? - A. Yes; and a corn-chandler.(The skin was produced in Court).</p>

            Whether you recollect the particulars of the conversation that passed between you and Ody? - A. He asked me, up at the Grand Jury, what we were sworn before the Bench of Justices, and I told him I was bound in a twenty pound bond to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Weatherby.) Q. Is that the skin of your sheep? - A. No, it is not.</p>

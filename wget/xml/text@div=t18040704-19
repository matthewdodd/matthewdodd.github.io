            ; I went out of an errand on Whit-Monday, I was coming home, between one and two, I met these two women in Vere-street, Clare-market; I knew the old woman, Mrs. Holland, the other I never saw in my life; she asked me how I did, and I asked her the same; I said, Mrs. Holland, I cannot stop; they followed me, and I said to Mrs. Holland, when she came up into the room, you are welcome; I made as much of these two women as I could afford, I gave them victuals and drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober yourself? - A. We were all sober together; the gown and aprons hung over my head while they were in the room, this was on Monday, I wore them on Sunday, and the two handkerchiefs hung over a chair in the room; they staid with me about an hour, Holland went out with the gown and apron; I called to my husband for assistance, he was at work at the back part of the house underneath, he did not hear, nor did he come; this young woman, when I was going to run out of the room-door, gave me a very hard blow, and I lay all in agore of blood on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. What was taken away? - A. The gown and handkerchief; I cannot say they took them, there was nobody else in the place to take them.</p>

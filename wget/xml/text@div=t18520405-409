                  </hi>. I am twelve years old—on 6th March, between half-past 3 and 4 o'clock, I was going through St. Paul's Churchyard, and went to the pump to get Some water to drink—while drinking, the prisoner came up and said, "Halloo! I want some of that"—I gave it her, and in so doing dropped two sixpences from my hand, where I had a half-crown and four sixpences belonging to Mrs. Landon, who I work for—I picked the money up, and the prisoner said, "Halloo! I know you"—I said, "Do you?"—she said, "Yes," and asked me to go a little way with her to her aunt's, and told me to tell my mother her name was Thomas; and she said she knew my mother when I was a little thing—she told me I lived at Mrs. Green's in Broad-street—I had lived there, but not then—I went with her down a street opposite the Post-office, and she bought me a pennyworth of sweet-stuff—she gave me a little knitted basket, and saw me wrap my money up, and put it into a little bag, and then into a box, and put the box in my basket—I stooped down to do something to my dress, and put my basket down to do it—she took up my basket, and I said, "Put that down"—she did not do so, and I got up and took it from her—a little while after she told me to go down that street oppo<lb></lb>site, while she went to her aunt's to get some playthings—I waited for her five or ten minutes, looked into my basket, and found the knitted bag sad As money gone—the little box was not gone—I had never seen her before—I am quits sure the prisoner is the person—we were together three-quarter of an hour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward James Poulter. We keep a boot and shoe shop at Chelsea—the prisoner was in my service from the 14th of Aug.—in consequence of some suspicion I went to her box—it was a new box—I had another box made like it, and I tried the key of my box to hers, to see if both locks were alike—I opened her box—she was not present—I found in it some pieces of fur-skin of my own, and some duplicates—her box had been locked—I gave the policeman the duplicates, and he went with me to see if the goods really were mine—I spoke to the prisoner in presence of the policeman, and told her she had been robbing me of the boots, and she must have opened the door before I was up in the morning—she made no answer—the boots are here—they are my husband's.</p>

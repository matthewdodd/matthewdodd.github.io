               <p>I had the money taken out of my pocket, and I suspected the prisoner, and I took her up, and delivered her to the watchman; there were two of them. The other one picked up this one's patten, which she throws off her feet to run up a court, with the money; the other one I took her to the watch-house first, to secure her, to find out this; and I came back, whereabouts I had lost my money in the street, and there I found the other one, (I live at No. 15, Wigmore-street, Cavendish-square) I took her by the hand, and held her, and charged the watchman with her; the watchman took her to the watch-house. On Monday morning, she went to Marlborough-street. and she offered to pay me the money, and his Majesty would not let her, she offered to pay me the same money I lost, which was one half crown, one shilling, and six pence; the magistrate said, he durst not do it, to let her make it up.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170087"></xptr>Q. The two persons then were together? - They came up to me together as I was going along.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she get your money? - The prisoner dipped her hand into my waistcoat pocket, while she was discoursing with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going up Oxford-road last Saturday night was a week, going up as far as a court that leads into Oxford-market; I met the two women, and the prosecutor stood talking to them; I could mention their names, I knew them, and I asked them how they were? With that he cursed his eyes, and said, he had been looking for me these two hours; he said, I had robbed him of three guineas, and he would take me to the watch-house. I went with him to the justice's on Monday morning; and he said, I had robbed him of half a crown, one shilling, and six-pence, and he took me over to the public house, and said, if I would give him three shillings, he would make it up; with that I pawned the handkerchief off my neck, and my apron, and sent home for an old bed gown, to give him the money; and he went to the justice's to get me discharged, and he sent me here. The witn sses that were there were two constables, that saw me give him the money, the three shillings.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you know this woman before? - No, I never see her before.</p>

            Was it light or dark? - Eleven o'clock at night; it was a thick cloudy night, not moon light.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you take her up? - In one hour, it did not exceed an hour before I came back from taking the other to the watch-house, and I found her coming out of the court that she ran into.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body present when she offered you the money? - Yes, there was the watchman that I delivered her to; he is not here.</p>

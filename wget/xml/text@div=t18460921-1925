                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to the prosecutors. Last Tueday evening, at half—past six o'clock, I shut up the warehouse—I then went round to the back—the passage door was shut and locked—Mr. Colville tried it, and he went home—I went to the back of the premises for a few minutes—I came back through the passage, and tried the door again—I found it a little loose—I gave it another <hi rend="italic">shove</hi>, and got it a little open—I <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> It again, and it gave way—on going in, I found the prisoner—he gave me a parcel to give to Mr. Nicholson—I don't know who Mr. Nicholson it—the prisoner had no business there—I caught hold of him—he dragged me out with him—I held him till the constable came, and gave him in charge.</p>

I took the prisoner—he said it was quite a mistake, that he found the door open—he had a paper parcel containing this canvass bag—this is the parcel he gave to Ure—when I got the prisoner to the station, I was going to search him—he said it was unnecessary, and he pulled out these three other bags from various parts of his person—he took out this screw—driver, this dark lantern, and four pieces of string ready cut—he had this skeleton key in his hand when I took him—it opens the warehouse door where he was—he had this knife, and this other skeleton key.</p>

            . My mother is a laundress. On the 24th of February, rather before half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I was in <placeName id="t18250407-2-crimeloc11">Tothill-street, Westminster</placeName>

I fell down or I could have caught hold of him I was so near; when I got up I still followed; he turned to the left, at the bottom of the Almonry and I lost him; he was taken that night, but not in my presence. I am positive he is the boy, I was so agitated.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the very reason why you should not know him? A. I can safely swear to him - it was light enough in the Almonry - it was almost day-light; I did not notice whether the lamps were lighted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The passage is not twenty yards long. Witness. It is: I did not lose sight of him when I fell; he was at the top of the court when I got up - I saw him take the bundle with his left hand.</p>

            . I hawk goods about the streets. On the night in question I heard a female call out murder, in the Almonry; a boy ran by me; I saw the left side of his face; he wore a blue coat, light knee breeches, and white stockings; he had a bundle under his coat, under the left arm - I could not see what colour it was - I looked towards the prosecutrix or I could have stopped him - I knew him before by seeing him about Westminster, and am quite sure the prisoner is the youth who ran by me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I left my sister's at half-past six, and went to Drury-lane - I was not at Westminster from half-past six till half-past twelve at night; when I was coming home, and knowing my sister was a-bed, I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070006"></xptr>to the Almonry to get some supper. The watchman came and said</p>
               <p>"How many times am I to tell you not to come here?" I said he had never seen me before; he looked at me and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, it is not you," but he must take me under the disorderly act. He took me to the watch-house and said he thought I was the boy whom he had information against about a robbery. Byron swore at the office at first, that I was not the boy; he afterwards swore that I was - I suppose the prosecutrix promised to make him a present if he would say so.</p>
               <p>COURT. His deposition before the Magistrate agrees with his evidence.</p>

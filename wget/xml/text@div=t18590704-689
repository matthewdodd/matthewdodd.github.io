               <p>I love my life, at whatever time we both shall fix or be most convenient to us; and should you be separated from me by death, and that you should prove faithful to me, I shall never marry another woman beside thee, whom I love so tenderly. I therefore look upon thee from this day forward as the partner of my days, and as a token there of I give thee my hearth and hand, and this lock of my hair, together with my handwriting, to remain with thee for ever. Whatever shall come to disturb us, this sacred promise is always to keep us faithful to each other; no matter what parents, friends or the world will say or do; and should we be separated for any time, or by any chance, we must always bear in mind this sacred promise of love and affection, never to be broken, which we have made this day, and correspond with each other if time and opportunity should permit; at the same time, I expect from thee that thou wilt make no acquaintance with any other man but me, that love thee; and if we have any cause to be offended in each other, we must at once reveal the mystery and make peace, always loving each other, if possible, as we now do; at the same time, we must not hear each other spoken ill of; that we must put each other on our guard against harm or slander, and keep our secrets from others. I humbly hope that this great vow will be kept unviolated; and any unconscious violation we both can forgive by confessing it to each other, otherwise the guilt shall be on the head of the offending party; riches nor anything under the sun must not cause any of us to violate this vow, which we have unanimously made this day, and ever may God bless our union.

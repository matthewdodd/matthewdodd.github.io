                  </hi>, I am a smith, and live in Windsor-street, Bishops<lb></lb>gate-street. On the night of the 21st of August I came out of a public-house in Chiswell-street—the prisoner came up to me, and took a half-sovereign out of my pocket—I seized her hand, took it from her, and gave her into custody—I did not owe her any money, nor promise to give her any.</p>

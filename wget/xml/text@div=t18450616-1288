                  </hi>. I live in John-street, Adelphi—the prisoner was my housekeeper for about four months. On the night of the 14th of May I marked a number of shillings and sixpences—I do not know how many—I put them into my trowsers or my waistcoat pocket, which I left in my bed-room—I missed two shillings next day—I did not say anything, but I still left the marked money purposely in either the waistcoat or trowsers pocket, and next morning I missed one shilling—(I had missed money the whole week)—I then spoke to the prisoner about it—she denied having taken it—I asked her to produce what money she had in her pocket, which she refused—I called in a policeman, and she produced about a sovereign's worth of silver out of her pocket—I selected three shillings which I had marked—these are them—I am able to swear these are the three which I had marked, and more especially to this one—she had nothing to do with my money—I am a medical ageut—I do not keep a till—the prisoner had access to my bed-room for domestic purposes.</p>

            . I am a linen-draper, and live at the bottom of Holborn-hill. I was standing with a person at the end of Friday-street, Cheapside, this evidence called, stop thief! The prisoner came cross Cheapside, and into Friday-street. I was at his heels. He ran into a warehouse; there I took him by the collar. Mr. Alderman Kirkman's servant said, he saw him pull something from his pocket. We looked about, and found the handkerchief lying on the ground. The mob wanted to duck him *, but I being an officer, said, they should not, and insisted he should be brought to justice.</p>
               <p>* The prisoner's companions generally proposed that of Ducking, with intent to get him off.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Alderman Kirkman. I was in our warehouse, making up a parcel, between one and two, as near as I can guess, that day. The prisoner ran down the street, and into the warehouse, and throwed something from his bosom behind the door. I went and looked, and there found the handkerchief. (Producing a silk handkerchief.) This is it.</p>

               <p>I was walking along Cheapside, there might be eight or ten people together; there was a coach and a cart. A person trod upon a dog; he sell a barking. One of the men dropped a handkerchief, I took it up; a man came and said he would have it; I said, No, you shall not; then I went down that place. I was going to Billingsgate to buy some mackrel.</p>

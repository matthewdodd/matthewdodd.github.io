                  </hi>. I am a servant to Mr. Cole, the prisoner's husband, at Brunswick-place, City-road—on Thursday, 7th August, between 3 and 4 o'clock, in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner come up stairs—she came down again and went into the back kitchen, but I did not see her—Mrs. Dor<lb></lb>rington then called me, and sent me up stairs—I went into the first-floor front room—I saw nobody there, but in the back room I saw Mrs. Cole's child lying on the floor dead—I saw that its throat was cut, the front part of it—its name was Charles Cole, and it was fifteen months old—it was lying by the side of the bed; not on the bed, with its face towards the bed—I had seen it alive five or six minutes before, and in good health—I saw Mrs. Cole carry it up five minutes before—I asked her if I should take him, and she gave me a <hi rend="italic">shove</hi>—I went downstairs and said something, and then went for a doctor.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a nurse at the prisoner's about seven weeks—Mr. Cole is a cabinet-maker—on 7th August, about half-past 3 in the after<lb></lb>noon, I saw the prisoner—the child was then with me—the prisoner had been up stairs, and she came down speechless—we asked her if she had broken a blood vessel, but we got no answer—we took her into the kitchen, and sat her down on a chair—she brought the child down—I took it out of her arms and it was playing about—she went up stairs—I do not know whether she took the child up with her—I saw no more of her till she came down stairs—I observed nothing then which attracted my notice—I saw nothing on her hands then, but the last time she came down I saw blood on her hands, and on her throat, and on her dress—it was then that I asked her if she had broken a blood-vessel and she made me no answer—I went up after the girl, went into the back room and found the child dead, and bleeding from a wound in the throat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was she in bad health? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and always appeared very fond of her children—after I saw the blood on her hands and dress, I found that her throat was slightly cut, but not for blood to come—she had made a slight attempt on her own throat, but not for blood to come—it was smeared from her hands—during the whole time I was in the house she appeared to be in a very low desponding state, and very fond of reading the Bible—I have observed something peculiar about her eyes and in her manner which attracted my notice—she looked rather strange to us at different times, and used to complain of her head being bad.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at Mr. Cole's house on this day—he was out at his work—I saw the prisoner go up stain between 3 and 4 o'clock—I did not go up into the room, or see the child—she had blood on her hands when she came down—a medical man was sent for, and I called for the nurse—after the prisoner came down, the servant girl in her presence said, "Mistress has murdered the child"—the prisoner said nothing to that—I saw a scratch on her throat—there was a little blood from it—I asked her if she had brought up blood again, as she had on a former occasion—she made no answer—she said nothiug at all to me—I said that the child was found—she made no answer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician and surgeon, of 117, Old-street, St. Luke's—I was called to Brunswick-place, and saw the child dead, with a wound in the throat, such as would be inflicted by a knife which I saw—the prisoner was walking about the room—I spoke to her, but she seemed quite unconscious—I found three or four superficial wounds on her throat, and dressed them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you been attending her some weeks or months previously? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a month previously—I was called to her on 4th July, early in the morning, for spitting of blood—she was then in very bad health physically—I noticed nothing particular in the state of her mind, but once or twice there was a wild expression about her eyes—when I was called in found she had inflicted wounds on her throat, and after I had dressed them she attempted to rush out of the room, saying, "The child is crying, I want to go to if—I had a consultation with Dr. Davis, of Finsbury-square, nearly a month previous to the child's death—she was very low and melan<lb></lb>choly during my attendance on her—she complained of pains in her head—she was certainly not in a state of consciousness when I was called in to dress her wounds and see the dead child—she remained under my immediate attendance until she had recovered—she was in a very low state mentally, and I believe she was decidedly insane at the time this act was perpetrated—I was in attendance on her previous to this visit, and was attending on her subsequently, and according to my judgment she was not in a sound state of mind—I state that as my opinion from the result of my observations—on the evening of the murder she told me she was full of evil spirits, and asked me to cure them; and on the Saturday following she told me she was haunted by evil spirits, and that she saw the spirits murder the child before her eyes, and the next moment she denied the child's death altogether, and insisted on its being alive—she said that it was crying in the next room, and wanted to go to it—I have not given particular attention to diseases of the brain—it is an undeniable feature in cases of murder that the violence has been done to those nearest and dearest in blood—those acts are sometimes accompanied with attempts on the life of the person themselves—that is known in the profession as a homicidal monomania, and is very frequently produced by religious delusions among other exciting causes, and it is pro<lb></lb>duced</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186209220030"></xptr>
               <p>frequently by grief—I have been present during the whole of the examination—the state of low desponding melancholy which has been described is decidedly that which would be precedent to the developments of the homicidal impulse—it is also characteristic of homicidal mania, that it is developed suddenly, and exercised on the person most loved, and without any motive—she was, in my opinion, quite unconscious of right or wrong, and incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong at the time of the act.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the illness you were attending her for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Consumption and spitting of blood—that would produce a low state of body, which would act upon the mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You would not say that everybody in that state was unconscious of right or wrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I merely express my opinion that Mrs. Cole was in that state—I do not mean to say that everybody affected so would be so, but they might be—I have not seen many cases of homicidal monomania—we are always taught that melancholy is incidental to the development of the homicidal impulse—that is the opinion of our first medical men—I do not speak from experience, but from books—the cases alluded to in the books are, I believe, recent, but I cannot swear that—I gave the prisoner tonics, which would act upon the low state of her mind and body—I never dreamed of her having a tendency to homicidal monomania before this act—I say that she was unconscious because I asked her if she knew me, and after some seconds she said "Yes"—I asked her what my name was, and she could not remember—I believe she said that she could not remember, or that she did not know—she was walking about, supported by her husband, and was throwing her arms about—this was after the child was dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at 68, Basinghall-street, and am a merchant and dealer in Indian and glass goods—about 12 o'clock on 18th July, the prisoner came to my warehouse, and told me he dealt in glass things, and sold them to pawnbrokers, hawkers, and others—I asked him to give references—he declined to do that, but said he would pay cash for what he had—he selected goods to the amount of about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was to have 2 1/2 per cent. discount on paying cash—he said he was going to a Mr. Staggerwald, in Newgate-street, for something I had not in stock, and asked me to get the goods ready, and he would come back—when he came back he asked me to send the porter with the goods to him to 28, New North-road, and I told him to pay the porter 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on delivery of the goods; and I told the porter, in the prisoner's presence, to let him have the goods against the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it happened that I had no receipt-stamp in the house, and I asked him if he could give the porter one—he said he would—he then left with the porter—the porter afterwards brought back some part of the goods but no money—I have seen the goods since; the police have them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Krausse—on 18th July he sent me with two hampers of goods on a truck, with the prisoner—I was directed to go to the New North-road with the prisoner, and he would pay me some money for the goods in the truck—I stopped about six doors off my employer's place, and told the prisoner I should go the nearest way to the New North-road—he said I was to go to Goswell-street with him to call at two places—I asked him whether Mr. Krausse had given his consent, and he said yes, he had—I then went with him as far as Barbican, and he then left me, and said he would meet me on the road—he stopped me at Mr. Britton's the auctioneer's, in Goswell-street—he said he was going to take some goods out there to put into a sale—he took a part of them out—I said, "If you break the goods you must be answerable for them"—I meant if he damaged them—he then said he should not call at Mr. Johnson's that day, but he would take me down to the New North-road, where I fully expected he was going to pay me for the goods—we then went to Wharf-road, City-road—he stopped me opposite the Wharf-road, and took a pair of vases out, saying he was going to show them to a customer, and he would return in five minutes, or shortly—he returned in five minutes, or it might be less, without the vases—he took me down Murray-street, Hoxton. and asked me if I could drink half a pint of beer—I said, "Yes, I could," and he took me to a public-house about ten doors from the place where we ought to have taken the goods to—we went into the public-house, and he asked me if I could drink a pint, and I said, "Yes"—he took a glass him<lb></lb>self, and then asked the landlord if he had got a back entrance to the house—he went out the back way, and I did not see him again till he was in cus<lb></lb>tody—I waited twenty-five minutes altogether.</p>

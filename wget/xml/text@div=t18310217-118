            . I am a Police-constable. On the Saturday before the 17th of January, I was on duty in Bunhill-row, at nine o'clock - I saw the prisoner about a quarter-past nine, carrying a quantity of lead in a bag, on his shoulder; I stopped him, and asked what he had there - he said backs of stoves, he was going to Mr. Hunt, at Blackfriars, with them, and he had them from George-street, Spitalfields; I said it was out of his way to be in Bunhill-row - he then said he had been to his mother, who lived in Whitecross-street; I took him to the station - I found the bag contained this sheet lead; on the Monday following I spoke to him again about it, and he said he got it from Mr. Smith's, his landlord, in Whitecross-street - I went there and fitted the lead to the roof of the garret window; it fitted in every part - the edges were quite bright; it appeared to have been recently cut with a sharp knife - I compared the nail marks and the crevices of the lead; it corresponded in every part - there was about half an inch of lead left on, and it seemed to agree with it; altogether there were about 70lbs. of lead.</p>

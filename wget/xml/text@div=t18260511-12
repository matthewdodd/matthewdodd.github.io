On Sunday, the 16th of April, between one and two o'clock, I saw the prisoner, with a youth, at the corner of Bull and Mouth-street, <placeName id="t18260511-12-crimeloc75">Aldersgate-street</placeName>

I looked up Bull and Mouth-street, and saw the prisoner shuffling something into his pocket - I followed; he began to run, and I lost sight of him only while he turned the corner; when I had nearly overtaken him he threw down the handkerchief from his pocket; I picked it up, still pursued, and stopped him at the corner of Little Britain.</p>

            . I am a constable. I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running. When he was stopped I searched him, but found no money or anything on him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I humbly implore your merciful forbearance, in consequence of my heart-reading situation. About the 6th of February, in consequence of the severe conduct of my father, I unfortunately left home, to await till his anger was abated; I kept out all night, and was afraid to return home, in consequence of his passionate temper - I love him as an honest industrious parent, and gratefully acknowledge that he instilled into my mind the necessity of industry.</p>
               <p>Several witnesses gave the prisoner a most excellent character - one of whom engaged to employ him.</p>

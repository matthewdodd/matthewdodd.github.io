No, says I, gentlemen, he does not belong to me at all; I knew the man that laid down; I told the girl, if she went down to the White-horse they would find a constable; but they all of them went into the Pea-hen again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (to Callaghan.) Q. You came from Ireland? - A. Yes, I did; the last place I was in, was at Newgrove.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that near Cork? - A. I must come through there to come to England.</p>

               <p>Q.How often have you been taken up? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The question is, have you been taken up since you have been in London? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. For what? - A. The same as for what happened the other night, for people beating me.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200009"></xptr>Q.Have you ever charged any other person with robbing you of twenty guineas? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The whole of it was this: you indicted some woman for robbing you of twenty guineas, and she was acquitted? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you know there is reward of forty pounds for a person who convicts another of robbing him? - A. I have heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. The girl was acquitted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever happen to he taken up for any offence which was alledged you had committed upon a woman? - A. I never heard of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing them at the time a charge of this description was made against you? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, if you think there is a ground to go any further, we will; but there does not appear a ground for charging this prisoner - It appears, this man had been a little noisy in his house, there was a little scuffle, and he threw him down; then, he says, another person came up, and took, according to the witness's account, four pounds three shillings out of his pocket. The whole evidence goes to shew, that the prisoner was doing that which he had a right to do, to turn a man of this description out of his house.</p>

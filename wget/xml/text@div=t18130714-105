I was looking at two boys fighting, and while I was looking at the boys fighting I felt my pocket move; I turned round, and found the prisoner putting something into his smallclothes; I felt my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone; a minute before that I had occasion to know that my handkerchief was safe in my pocket. I kept an eye upon the prisoner; I saw him leave the crowd; I followed him into Berry-street; I charged him with it; he denied it, I conveyed him into a public-house; the landlord would not send for a constable; the landlord of the public-house at last said to one of the men in the house, you know where the constable lives, tell him. When I took the handkerchief out of his breeches he begged my pardon; he said, he had never done such a thing before; if I would forgive him he would never would do the like again. The keeper of the watchhouse has the handkerchief.</p>

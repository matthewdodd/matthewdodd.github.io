            , the counsel; I have got my living since as an hackney-writer, and collecting debts. On the 7th of March, about ten o'clock at night, as I was passing up Fleet-street I saw the prosecutor going down Fleet-street, four men were following him, two of which were near to his person, one of them touched his person which caused me to follow them: I was going the contrary way, but on the same side of the way. The prisoner was one; there was two tall men and two short men; the prisoner was one of the four; I cannot positively swear whether he was the person that touched the pocket or no; he was in company with the other man that was near to the prosecutor. The two tall men stood talking to a girl of the town while the two short men were pursuing the prosecutor, they stood for the space of five minutes, and then went on; I then followed them, I was behind the two tallest, I saw one of the short ones touch the prosecutor's pocket; I followed the two tall ones that went in the direction to where the two short ones were, and the prosecutor, I followed them all; they came together again, and when I came up to them I saw the prisoner at the bar, he was next to the prosecutor; I saw him take something from the prosecutor's pocket, but what it was I could not tell, and at the same instant he put his hand towards a pocket in his great coat, a side pocket at the top of his coat; they then turned round; the two short ones turned round, and came behind the two tall ones, they were then trying of his other pocket. I went up to the prosecutor and asked him if he had lost any thing out of his pocket; he stopped, and the four men surrounded him; he put his hand into his pocket and said, yes, I have lost an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080032"></xptr> under waistcoat; I said one of these men have robbed you; I laid hold of the prisoner and the other short man, I gave the other man to the prosecutor, and said this is the man that has got your property, at the same instant I put my hand into his great coat pocket, and said, this is your property in his pocket; the prisoner said it was not, he had picked it up on the step of a door. I had hold of his great coat, it was unbuttoned; he turned his arms out of his great coat, left the great coat on my arm, and ran away; I pursued him and cried stop thief, and took him in Salisbury-court; I conveyed him to the watchhouse; the constable of the night knew him; the constable of the night has got the property.</p>

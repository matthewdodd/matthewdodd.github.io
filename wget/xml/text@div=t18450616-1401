                  </hi>. I am a coachmaker, and live in Paradise-street, Finsbury. On the 13th of May I was at the Railway-station at Green<lb></lb>wich, at about twelve o'clock—there were a great number of persons col<lb></lb>lected about me, and the prisoner Dodson had his arm projecting in my face—I asked him to be so kind as to remove his arm—he said it was almost impossible he could in such a crowd—the side of his arm was to<lb></lb>wards my face—he then passed his arm over my cravat, and as soon ai he removed it I found my pin was gone—it was a union-pin, two small gold pins and a chain—I had seen it safe not a minute previous—I saw him pass his hand towards the other prisoner—I charged Dodson with taking the pin, and collared him immediately—the policeman came up, and I gave him in charge.</p>

I saw the prisoners together at the railway station—I saw them try a gentleman's pocket—I then saw them go to the prosecutor, one on each side of him—I saw Dodson take a pin from his cravat (I was then in front of him,) and he passed his band to Trinder, who put up his hand, and at that moment the prosecutor seized Dodson—I am quite sure I saw the pin in Dodson's hand, it was directly under a gas-lamp.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in company with the prosecutor—he spoke to me about his pin, and I assisted in taking the prisoners—I saw the pin in the prosecutor's cravat five or six minutes before—there was a great crowd there.</p>

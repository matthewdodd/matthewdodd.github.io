               <p>*** The indictments, in the cases No. 659 to 665 inclusive, were found by the Grand Jury at the last September Sessions, when the prisoners stated that they had been previously convicted at the Middlesex Sessions at Hicks' Hall, but were unable to produce a copy of the record. The Court granted time for an application to the Court of King's Bench for a mandamus, calling upon the Court to furnish the said copy. Upon Bowman being brought up at the last Session, he put a plea of autre-fois convict, and a copy of the record; the Court granted till the present Sessions, for the Crown to reply; and they having now put in a replication of nul tiel record the Court decided, on the production of the original record by the proper officer from Clerkenwell, that the said replication was good. The prisoner then pleaded, "Not guilty." The other prisoners, having agreed to rest their cases upon the decision in the above case, also pleaded, "Not guilty."</p>

About nine o'clock in the morning of the 22nd June, I saw the prisoner running out of the back kitchen - I followed him up the area steps - he appeared very bulky - I ran and collared him - he was running away - I brought him back - he was a perfect stranger - the policeman took some of these articles from him, and some he took himself - the area gate was left on the latch, I believe.</p>

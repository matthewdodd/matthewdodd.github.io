                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Tipton, Staffordshire. Last Monday, about half-past four o'clock in the morning, I was at the Red Lion, in the Strand—the prisoner was there, and nine or ten others—I was standing, talking to some people, and the prisoner got up, and began sparring with me—I was afterwards leaning against the bar, and a woman came up and pushed me, and my watch was snatched clear away from me—I cannot say who did it—the prisoner was standing next to me—the young man serving at the counter said, "Your watch is here"—I turned round, laid hold of the prisoner, and in turning him round the watch dropped either from his side or the person next him—there were three or four others there—a friend with me laid hold of the prisoner, and said, "You stole his watch"—he said he had not—I gave him in charge—I did not see him do anything.</p>

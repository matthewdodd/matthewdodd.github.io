            . I am a labourer, and live in White's-yard. I was standing at the corner of the yard, and saw the prisoner running down Rosemary-lane, pursued by several persons, calling, Stop thief! I stopped him, and asked what was the matter; he said he was fighting, and obliged to flee, as there were so many against him; his coat was torn, and he was bloody; the mob gathered round him, and he said the first who struck him he would fight.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not I desire you to save my life? A. He said they were going to kill him.</p>

            . I am a headborough. I was fetched to quell a disturbance at this public-house; there was a cry to Stop thief! and about two hundred people were running after the prisoner; I got into the crowd and took him; the prosecutor was not sober; he could not stand; he told me he had had part of six or seven pots of beer and half-and-half; he told me at the watch-house that White had knocked him down and robbed him.</p>
               <p>E. BUTLER. I was sober; I had not drank half a pint of beer, for it made me ill; I was sober enough to go home.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he had been drinking; that the prosecutor had called him a thief and other bad names, for which he struck him, but never touched his property, and that the prosecutor's friends surrounded him to take his part, which induced him to run away.</p>

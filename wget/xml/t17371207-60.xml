            . I was in the Country when the Spoon was taken; when I came Home my Servant told me she suspected the Prisoner had got it. I went to her in St. James's Workhouse, and asked her how she could take the Spoon? She told me she was drunk when she did it, and own'd she took it from the Dresser in the Kitchen. I took her before Justice Lambert, and he committed her to Tothill fields Bridewell As we were carrying her thither, she told me she had pawn'd it at Mrs. Martin's in Peter-street. I found it there; and paid 6 s. and three half-pence for it again. The Prisoner liv'd by blacking Shoes, and <rs id="t17371207-60-deflabel292" type="occupation">sweeping the Streets</rs>

               <p>Richardson. No; I did not. I told her I knew a Gentleman that was acquainted with Justice Lambert, and if she would let me know where the Spoon was, I would get him to do her what Service I could; upon which she told me where I might find it.</p>

On 17th April the prisoner Wood, to the best of my belief, came to my shop about seven o'clock—he asked for a quarter of a pound of roast pork, and gave me what I considered to be a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece—I put it into my till—I had no other—it remained there about three hours—I then gave it to a policeman—I had not put any other 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece into the till in the mean time—when Wood came into my shop, Brown was at the door, to the best of my belief—I speak as to his height and clothing—the pork that I served the man with, was rather underdone—next morning some pork was shown to me that resembled that I had sold—I cannot tell how much it weighed.</p>

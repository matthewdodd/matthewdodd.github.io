                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Edmund Spall, a silk agent, of No. 120, Cheapside. On the afternoon of 1st May, about half past 5 o'clock, I left the premises with my master, who fastened the door, and took the key—the warehouse is on the second floor—on the following morning I went to the warehouse, as usual, about 10 minutes to 9 o'clock, and about a minute or two afterwards a policeman came up to me—I found that the door had been broken open, and fastened again with a hinge; the policeman took it off, and we both went in—on looking round I missed a parcel of nlk aprons, which had been on the counter, and the cash box, which had been in a little ante-room on one side, and contained two sovereigns, and a few shillings in silver; it was safe on the Thursday evening—there were nearly twenty pieces of silk, and they were worth about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the 2nd I went with an officer to Mr. Duke's, a pawnbroker's, in the New Cut, and two pieces of silk were shown to me there, which I immediately recognized, as a portion of the silk taken from the warehouse—three other pieces of silk were shown to me at Mr. Cole's, in the Waterloo-road, on the same after<lb></lb>noon, which also formed a portion of what I had missed; and last Saturday I saw two more at the Mansion House; they formed a portion of the same silk—I do not know the prisoner.</p>

On Thursday night, 1st May, from information I received, I went to Mr. Spall's premises—the housekeeper opened the door—I went to the warehouse on the second floor, and found that the box of the lock had been forced off, and the lock rendered entirely useless—I saw no other marks of violence, and, not being able to ascertain where Mr. Spall lived, I got a strong hinge and fastened up the door, leaving the place in the care of the housekeeper—I got there in the morning, just after the last witness.</p>

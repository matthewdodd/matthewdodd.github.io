                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 184). On 20th June, at 1.30 a.m., I was on duty on the south side of Tottenham Court Road, and saw the prosecutrix—she was drunk, and was going towards the Euston Road—the prisoners, who were coming from the Euston Road, surrounded her, and Bosworth hit her; but whether she fell from the hit or from being drunk I do not know—I saw them take the things from her—I followed them with the shawl and bonnet, which they dropped in Tottenham Street—I picked up this ear-ring behind them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and said that I should take them in custody; they both said that they knew nothing about it—this (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) is the corresponding ear-ring belonging to the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When they dropped the shawl I picked it up—I was twenty yards from them—I charged the prosecutrix with being drunk and incapable—I had seen her before that night; she was then going along the road just as anybody else would—Bosworth said she knew nothing about the shawl; I said, "Yes, you do; it was behind you"—she said that she had exchanged bonnets with the prosecutrix—she claimed one bonnet as her own at the time, but ultimately tore it up as if out of spite; that was a black one—Bosworth dropped the shawl behind her, and the prosecutrix came up and said "That is my shawl"—they both said that they had all three been drinking together at a public-house—I had never seen the prose<lb></lb>cutrix till that night—I have heard this morning that she was looked up last night for being drunk and incapable—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the prisoner's bonnets, which was left on the prosecutrix's head, and this is a portion of the prosecutrix's bonnet, which was torn up by Bosworth, and this is the shawl.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dressmaker, of Francis Street, Tottenham Court Road—on 20th June, about 3.30 a.m., I was in Tottenham Court Road, the worse for drink, and was wearing this shawl and bonnet—I remember them being taken from me—I was knocked in the mouth, and have never been well since—I have a very large lump behind my ear, but I do not know how I got it—I had not been drinking with the prisoners; I never saw them before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been drinking, but I was not insensible till I was knocked down—I went into a public-house, and had 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of brandy; I think it was somewhere in the New Road—I never spoke to anyone there—I only remember going into one public-house; I do not know the name of it—I do not remember meeting the prisoners that night—if we were all drinking together I should remember it—I do not remember quarrelling with anybody that night; nothing of the sort—this is my bonnet; it is torn up, and this is one which was left on the ground, and which I put on when I found I was without one—I am not in the habit of getting into this</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you give him leave to sleep there for any particular time? A. No; he could go whenever he pleased.</p>
               <p>Q. He married your daughter, did he not? A. I do not admit the marriage - he was married to her three years ago, without my consent - she was in the house at the time, I supported her - she and him have carried on business together, but she slept in my house all the time - the house is my own.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has your daughter lived with you? A. Ever since the marriage - he said he had a situation in view, at Gravesend.</p>

On the 27th of October, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I put the watches into the iron chest, which I locked, and put the bar across them, padlocked it, and put the key in the parlour closet; next morning, about eight o'clock. I looked for the key, and it was gone. I went to the iron chest, and nine or ten watches were gone - they were chiefly silver. The prisoner was out - I did not know he was going to leave.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was to go away when he pleased? A. I believe so - he had not mentioned any particular time that he was to stay.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you remember every pledge which is brought? A. By referring to the book I tell - but I have a perfect recollection of this; he came into the shop, not into a box, and was there about five minutes - no other customer was in the shop; I never saw him before - I looked at him to see who I was taking the watch of.</p>

               <p>Q. And after that he came himself to your house, and you had him taken? A. No; he sent for a person out of my house - he was apprehended three hundred yards off. I am told that my daughter is since married.</p>

               <p>London, Nov. 8th, 1825.</p>
               <p>MR. JACKSON,</p>
               <p>"Dear Sir - Though I do not think myself worthy to address you now, I think it my duty to return my sincere thanks for your kindness, expressed for me and my safety. Believe me, Sir, it will ever he remembered with kindness. There may come a time when I may have an opportunity of returning it; but, oh! when I think upon what I have done, it chills my very soul. What could I think of - but it is past - God have mercy on me. Once I was respected by every one who knew me - beloved by all my relations, what am I now? - hated, cursed, and shunned. But there is another world and a better one, where I hope you and I shall meet again, if we can meet no more in this. May heaven protect you through this world; may you be prosperous and happy, and may you and your intended spend many a happy year in comfort. For Mr. and Mrs. Leah's kindness to me, I hope, if I have not an opportunity of rewarding them, heaven will. It is impossible for me to express my feelings whilst writing this letter. Ah, it is past. Once I thought I should have been happy. If the news has not reached Gainsborough all may be well-if it has, then all is over. I do not mind about Mansfield - I could not be in my senses. Pray give me love to Matilda - and give my thankful remembrance to Mr. and Mrs. Leah; also to Maria. I must now conclude - and, if it is for ever,</p>
               <p>Farewell, dear friend, unfortunate</p>
               <p>LAUGHTON.</p>
               <p>"N. B. My cousin, B. Robinson, I understand, has said a deal about me, without occasion; he is a bad character amongst the worst of women, I can safely swear, though he took them to a house where he said I frequently went to, it is false - I have known none but Matilda since we made it up. - ADIEU."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is a malicious prosecution, carried on by my father-in-law. My wife has not only committed bigamy, but has been guilty of very bad conduct - a gentleman offered me a situation, and this is the reason the charge was brought against me.</p>
               <p>Nine witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WHEELER re-examined. The watch he pawned with me I lent two guineas on - it is capped and jewelled - it would sell for six or seven pounds. Every watch here is worth more than 40 s.</p>

            . On the 15th of February, about twenty minutes past seven o'clock in the evening, I was walking with Miss Clark, in <placeName id="t18220220-61-crimeloc333">Crawford-passage, Ray-street, Clerkenwell</placeName>

               <p>"You are one of them," he said nothing, but knocked me down; Clark flew at him, and laid hold of his handkerchief, which gave way, and he got off, but was secured - nobody was near us but the four men we had passed; they were all in company together talking. I was pulled round with the force of the pull, and am certain of the prisoner's person. They let the man pass, between them, and then impeded our pursuit. My chain, seals, and key cost 17 l. 11 s.</p>

            . I was with Mr. Skinner. Four men rushed against us, no others were near; the prisoner came before us, to prevent our pursuing the man who snatched the chain, we followed, and at the bottom of the arch, Skinner collared him, but he knocked him down, and I caught hold of his handkerchief, which gave way. He was taken at the corner of Eyre-street-hill, without my losing sight of him. I am sure he is one of them.</p>

            . On Friday evening the 15th, I saw the prisoner, in company with three others, near Crawford-passage; I afterwards saw him and Skinner struggling together; he knocked Skinner down - I pursued and took him; I had a perfect view of him, and am positive of him; I only lost sight of him in turning the corner; I had seen him in a public-house, with the other three that evening - Clark was pursuing them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Had either of the three men a light coat on - A. I think not, but cannot speak positively.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been in the public-house most of the afternoon. I left at six o'clock, returned, and three men were sitting there. I came away; and at the corner of the passage heard a bustle, and the prosecutor collared me; I pushed him away, and he was going to strike me again, and I ran away.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

             (policeman). On the morning of the 17th of January I was in the neighbourhood of this house, about a quarter after three o'clock, and saw the door of the Queen's Head (which is the prosecutor's house) open a little, and some person was looking out - I went across, and the door was closed against me - I suppose he saw me coming, but I do not know - I pushed the door, it would not open, and then I called Mr. Dummert - when I found he did not answer me, I pushed the door open, and saw the prisoner standing in the passage, by the light of the gas<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200006"></xptr>which was burning in the passage - when he saw me he turned into the tap-room, and from his manner I thought he was going to throw something away - I told him to come into the passage - I asked if he had any thing about him - he said, "Nothing;" - I asked what business he had there - he said the landlord had given him leave to sleep there - I then commenced searching him, and in an inside pocket I found this rag, with some money in it, 8s. in silver, and 4s. 61/2d. in copper, in another pocket 71/2d. in copper, and in his hat, (I believe it was,) I found a penny loaf - I called the landlord down stairs; when he came down I asked if he had given the prisoner leave to sleep there - the landlord said, "No, certainly not;" the prisoner was present - the landlord's sister came down - I told her to look into the cupboard, and she missed a penny loaf in the prisoner's presence - I took the prisoner to the station-house - he never got out of custody - at the station-house he said he got the eight shillings from St. George's Workhouse - he did not account for the copper, and in the morning I told him I would take him to St. George's Workhouse to see if he got the eight shillings there - he then said he got but two shillings there.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I met the prisoner on Monday, the 1st of November, a little after seven o'clock in the evening, in Fox-court, with a bag on his shoulder. I asked what was in it - he said rags, which he had got from a woman in Leather-lane, to sell for her, and he was to have 6 d. for his trouble; that he did not know the woman, but she lived at No. 47. I took him into a public-house and searched him. I found a glass in his hat. I sent my brother officer to Leather-lane to find the woman, but he could not.</p>

               <p>On the 6th of April I was at the house of Mr. Walter, in <placeName id="t17810425-34-crimeloc166">Brook's-court, Brook's-Market</placeName>

I saw in his hand, which was partly under his arm, a sleeve of the shirt I had been working on: upon my laying hold of him, he threw the sleeve down, and catched up the shirt, and endeavoured to put it under his arm; I pushed him against the wall, and called out three times for Mr. Walter; the prisoner struck me, and got one of his hands loose; he then shoved me into the kitchen, shut the door, and locked me in; Mr. Walter came down, and ran after him.</p>

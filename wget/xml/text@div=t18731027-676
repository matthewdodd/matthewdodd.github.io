I am a tailor, and live at 103, High Street, Kingsland—on Friday, the 19th instant, about 10. 40, I shut up the house before going to bed—the cloth and other articles were all safe then—I was aroused about 4. 45 in the morning, and on going down stairs I found the house had been broken into, and I missed 170 yards of cloth and other articles, to the value of nearly 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there had been a ladder in the next garden the night before, and in the morning that ladder was in the area, pushed up against the back-parlour window; that window was shut the night before, but I don't know whether it was fastened—I found it closed in the morning, but that was the way the thieves had got in—the parlour was all in confusion—I sent for the police—these two pieces of cloth produced are mine, I can speak positively to them, and they were safe overnight—two waistcoats, a writing-desk, a jacket, and other things were found in my garden—this pair of trousers produced by Briden are mine—I had worn them two or three times, the buttons have my name upon them—this waistcoat had only been brought home on the Friday, and had not been sent home; the binding has been chipped and a few other things done to it to make it appear old, but I am quite sure of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw some cloth in a bag at the station, about 4 yards in one piece, and 1 3/4 yards in the other—I sell such cloths in made-up clothes, and I sell a length if required—I identify both these pieces by certain peculiarities in the cutting—no doubt the manufacturers sell such cloth to other persons—this piece is the remains of some from which I made a suit for a gentleman's son; I can distinctly swear to it; I bought it at Shoolbred's.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer K</hi>). About 9.30 on Saturday 27th I went to the prisoner Green's house, with detectives Briden and Smith—I told him that I had received information that he had been buying stolen property—he said "No, nothing of the kind, you are quite at liberty to look over my place if you like"—I searched the place—I found this piece of 4 yards of cloth in this green bag—he said he had bought it to make himself a suit of clothes, and he had had it some time—I also found a seal<lb></lb>skin waistcoat, two or three other pieces of cloth, three leathern leggings, and other things—the clock was up stairs in a cupboard, on the top shelf-Green said he had had it four or five years; it was an old relic belonging to his father-in-law, who had been dead some time, and he begged me not to take it away—it has since been identified—I took Green into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The only cloth I found at Green's, was in the green-bag, on a chair in the back-parlour—he is a greengrocer—I did not say before the Magistrate that he said he had had it some time—it did not strike me at the time, but he really did say so—he said he had had it two years—I was going to mention that I wished to add something when my deposition was read over, but I was told to stand down, that it was not material.</p>

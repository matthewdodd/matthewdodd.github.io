                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>). On 3d January I went with another constable to 104, Back Church-lane, Commercial-road, Whitechapel—I had previously been there, and was told that Lane lived there—I saw her leave the house, and followed her in the direction of Cannon-street-road East—when I got up to her I said, "Mrs. Lane"—she immediately turned round—I said, "Your name is Lane?"—I believe she said, "Yes, it is"—I said, "You pledged some spoons; I want to know how you became possessed of them—she said that her sister, who was in service in the City, gave them to her to pledge"—I said, "You must go back with me to Mr. Fuller, the pawnbroker, in the Commercial-road, which she did—I asked the assistant, in her pre<lb></lb>sence, "Is this the person who pledged those three spoons at your place?" he said, "Yes it is"—I took her to her residence in Back Church-lane, and said, "Are those three spoons all that you have had?"—she said, "Yes, they are"—I said, "Have not you seen any more?"—she said, "No"—I searched her lodgings—she endeavoured to find the ticket relating to these three spoons, but could not—I took her to Bishopsgate station, and left her there, while I apprehended Lynch at Mr. Geddes'—she was brought to the station, and when they were both together, Lynch said to Lane, "The truth must be told; you know you had the other four"—Lane immediately went on her knees and solemnly protested her innocence, calling on God to witness that she knew nothing about the other four, and Lynch as solemnly pro<lb></lb>tested that she was guilty of having them—a few minutes after the charge was booked, she produced three duplicates of the three spoons—she was then locked up—they were taken before the Lord Mayor next morning, and re<lb></lb>manded till the following day—when they were locked up in the cell Lane said, "I instructed my daughter last night to go and redeem the other spoons, but I did not like to tell you; you will find one of them pledged at the bottom of the street, in the name of Allen; the other three you will; find pledged at Mr. Carpenter's, in Cannon-street, for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in the name of, Crampton," which I found to be correct.</p>

I said "Are they your property?" She said, "Decidedly they are, or I would not send you." She said, "Where did you pawn them?" I said, "At Mr. Fuller's and Mr. Carpenter's, where I have been about twenty-five years." I have known her to have such things by her. Her husband has been a solicitor and ship owner. My husband was out of work, and I have a large family. When the offices came I told him that I had pawned the spoons at Fuller's, and that they were my sister's property. I said, "Pray forgive her;. do excuse her." He said, "It is more than I dare do."</p>

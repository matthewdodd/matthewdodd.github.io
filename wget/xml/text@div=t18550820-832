                  </hi>. I am a grocer, of Artillery-place, Woolwich. On Saturday evening, 7th July, about 8 o'clock, the prisoner came into my shop and asked me in an under tone for change for half a crown—I placed the change on the counter, took his half crown, and put it into the till—he then said, "I did not say change for half a crown, I said 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of Robing' patent groats"—I gave them to him, and he said that they were not the sort he wanted; he wanted them packed in tinfoil, as they were to go to the Crimea—they are never packed in tin foil, and I told him so—he stood a minute, and looked at me—I was busy at the time—he then said, "Please give me my half crown back again"—I hesitated a moment, and thinking I might have taken my change back, I threw him the half crown, and he left the shop—there were several people in the shop—I know now that he had both the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the half crown.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Jeremiah Warner, who keeps a grocer's shop, at Woolwich. On Saturday, 7th July, about 9 o'clock, the prisoner came there and asked for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for half a crown—I took 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of the till, and he said "No, I do not want change, I want 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of cream cheese on straw"—I put the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. back into the till, and told him we did not keep that kind of cheese—I am quite sure I did not receive his half crown—he remained at the counter some time after that, and I asked him what he was waiting for—he said that he wanted his half crown back—I told him he had not given me one—he said that he had, and that he wished either for the cheese or his money—I told him he would have neither, and went on serving other customers—he walked out of the shop.</p>
               <p>

Q.</hi> How long have you been in Mr. Warner's establish<lb></lb>ment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nearly eighteen months—mistakes occur sometimes, but I am quite sure there is no mistake in this matter—there were a great many people at the counter—it was Saturday night—I swear positively that nobody else came in for change at the same time—I swear that the prisoner</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 114). On Saturday evening, 7th July I was on duty in Woolwich in plain clothes, and saw the prisoner about 9 o'clock at Green's-end, entering different shops—I saw him enter Mr. Warner's shop, Mr. Joblett's public house, and Milbourne's—a person named Sullivan was with him, but they did not both go in—the prisoner went in and then came out, and went into Mrs. Taylor's shop, and made inquiries—he then went with the other man to the Salutation public house—Sullivan was looking in at the door—Clancey came out and gave him something, and they went over the road to another public house, the Royal Mortar—Clancey went in, and Sullivan looked in at the door—Clancey came out in two or three minutes, lifted his hat off, and Sullivan went in—I went in at the side door, made inquiries, came out again, and lost sight of them—I afterwards saw them in Church-street, about a quarter of a mile off—Clancey went into the Sheer Hulk, opposite the dock gates, and Sullivan stood at the door—Clancey came out again in half a minute, went up to the railway station, and I took him on another charge, and found 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a half crown on him.</p>

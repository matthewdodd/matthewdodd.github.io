                  </hi>. I am a grocer, at Skinner-street, Somers-town—the prisoner came into my service on 1st Nov. On 15th Dec., at half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was sent for by the young men—I went and found the prisoner very much intoxicated—she owned she had been taking some elderberry wine, and it had got into her head—I told her to go to bed, and get up early in the morning, and pack up her clothes and go—I went next morn<lb></lb>ing at ten o'clock—I found her intoxicated then—I went two doors off to another shop of mine, got the housekeeper, and told her to assist her to pack her things together—the things were brought down into the parlour by the other housekeeper—a hat-box came down with the bottom nearly out, and out rolled some money and 1/4 lb. of peppermint—that raised my suspicion—I called my young man to bring my peppermint—I compared them with those lying about the floor, and they tallied—I went up stairs—the prisoner wished me to search her box before she left the house—I said, "Give me the key of your box?"—she was five or ten minutes before she could find it—when it was handed to me, I opened her box—I took out some clothes, and found the box half full of grocery—her bed-room was strewed with tea and coffee—about 4lbs. of candles were in her bed-room—she said she had selected these things for the use of my young men—I gave her 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. every Monday to keep house, and whatever she had in the shop she used to purchase, the same as any other person—there were two young men and herself—she was not confined to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. it was sometimes 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

               <p>weeks at Christmas—the prisoner stated at the Police-court that she had been in a lunatic asylum—it was about two hours after I told her to go, that she asked me to go and look at her box—she was not so tipsy as not to know what she was saying—she said she should like me to see her box before she left, not thinking for a moment that I should assent to what she said—the policeman counted the things, and I wrote them down—the list is correct—the indictment was copied from it—the prisoner got Mr. Boulton, of Houndsditch, to give her a two years' false character.</p>

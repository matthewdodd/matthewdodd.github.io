               <p>Mr. Scott of Council for the Prosecution, thus opened the case.</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, to favour me in support of this prosecution. The original prosecutor in this indictment, which was preferred ever since July sessions last, is lately dead, but whilst living, he had retired from trade, and had a house at <placeName id="t17840225-36-crimeloc200">Paddington</placeName>

               <persName id="t17840225-36-person479">
                  John

            , in repairing the wall; all the scaffold and the scaffolding boards, and every thing else that belonged to this business, were the property of Mr. Beresford, the prosecutor, he provided all these things: the work however, was no sooner compleated but he missed the things mentioned in the indictment; indeed Mr. Beresford had from time to time missed many things; but Mr. J. Pond was one of the last men in the world that he had any suspicion of: after this work was finished, it seemed that there was a part of the paling of Mr. Beresford's garden, that was not repaired, and the premises of the prisoner immediately joining to those of the prosecutor, when the carpenter came to open the paling, he immediately opened into a shed of the prisoner's, and in that shed all these things were found. Mr. Beresford was informed of it, and was a good deal surprized, but being a man of a very humane disposition, I take it for granted, no prosecution would have been heard of, as the things were returned to Mr. Beresford, there being no doubt of the property: but Mr. Pond a little time after, had the assurance to bring an action against Mr. Beresford and his son, and a carpenter, for the several things stated in the first indictment; a great space of time has elapsed between that indictment and the present time, and the conduct of Mr. Pond has been putting off this matter from time to time; and with respect to this action, which was the very reason, why the Court did not try this cause before, you will find that action has never been taken the least notice of whatever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood, Prisoner's Council. The man had not money enough to go on with the action, and it was non-prossed, and he is now a prisoner for costs; it is a most wicked prosecution.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott. I opened the matter some sessions ago before your Lordship, and you was then against our going into the business till the action was tried.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. They never took him before a magistrate, nor never got a warrant against him.</p>

            , of Chelsea, I believe he was a bricklayer; the prisoner took down the scaffolding that I purchased there; the burnt mark was endeavoured to be erased out, but was not done so effectually but that it is possible to be seen now; I put a private mark on them, and they have been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Can you identify at all the deals? - I think there is not a doubt, I can tell them by the wood, the grain of these planks was so exceedingly hard, that the saw jagged every time it cut, and would not make a clear cut; there was also found in the same shed with the putlocks, a shaft of a cart, piled up, ready for business, as if it was the prisoner's property; I knew we had the fellow to it on my father's premises, and it is here to produce.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it a broken shaft? - No, it was sawed off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood, Prisoner's Council. What kind of a shed was this, was it an open shed? - It was very near inclosed.</p>
               <p>The man lived next door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was his shed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The shed was in the garden? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The garden was not fenced in, otherwise than by paling? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you there when the boards were taken away from this man's premises? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did not he claim them? - No, his wife did, she said you take them away without any authority.</p>
               <p>You carried them away? - They were taken away, I did not carry them.</p>
               <p>By your order? - By my father's order.</p>
               <p>Did you go before any magistrate? - No.</p>
               <p>How long was it afterwards before you, your father, and the carpenter, were served with copies of writs? - On the 31st of March, the prisoner at the bar brought a letter to my father, and the contents of that letter was this, to the best of my recollection -</p>
               <p>Court. Was you present when he brought it? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Then do not be forward to relate it. - I am not forward, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. Hear me, Sir; what day of the month was it when these boards were taken away from the prisoner? - I apprehend about the 22d, or 23d.</p>
               <p>Who was the letter wrote by? - Mr. Fowler.</p>
               <p>He is an attorney? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(The Letter read, dated March 31, 1783.)</p>
               <p>"Sir,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Pond, the bricklayer, has been</p>
               <p>"with me, complaining of your behaviour</p>
               <p>"in taking away his property; if therefore</p>
               <p>"you do not make him immediate</p>
               <p>"restitution, and satisfaction for the injury</p>
               <p>"done to him, I shall be under the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250108"></xptr> " necessity of taking disagreeable measures."</p>
               <p>When was the action brought? - I think on the 3d of April.</p>
               <p>Court. How far was this cottage where the prisoner lived from the house in which you father lived? - About forty or fifty feet from my father's house.</p>
               <p>Whether between the 22d of March and this 31st of March, the date of the attorney's letter, the prisoner was at home as usual? - There is not a doubt about that.</p>
               <p>Did you or your father accuse this man of felony from the 22d of March till after the time that letter was sent? - At the time the things were taken away, it was looked upon as a base thing; his wife was told, if he did not quit the town he would certainly be prosecuted.</p>
               <p>Did you hear that? - I am clear in it.</p>
               <p>What did your hear said to the wife? - I said it myself.</p>
               <p>When? - The time when the deals were taken away, I would not say an ill-natured thing on any account whatsoever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. Then from the 22d to the 31st, you say he was public at his own house? - There is not a doubt of it, I should imagine so; I took the letter to Sir Sampson Wright, and he bid me go and tell Mr. Fowler, you may do what you please, for we will indict him; I told Mr. Fowler I was sorry he was concerned in such a dirty piece of business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. You only told your own story to Sir Sampson; but now, if this man had committed a felony, and you was so great with Sir Sampson, how came you not to have warrant? - My father being a man in an advanced state of life, he did not like any kind of trouble, he knew he was justified in taking his property.</p>
               <p>Was not there a bill preferred for petty larceny? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was the consequence of the bill? - The parties were not examined, I was not, nor the carpenter; my father went in and nobody else, but he could not speak to the whole of the business, and the bill of indictment was thrown out.</p>
               <p>Then you never applied to the magistrate? - No.</p>
               <p>And the action went on? - It did.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you mended the evidence, and attempted the second time? - The next quarter sessions.</p>
               <p>During all that time the man was public? - He was, I believe.</p>
               <p>In July this bill was preferred by your father? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he never was carried before a magistrate? - No.</p>
               <p>As to the putlocks, you know they were your father's property? - Not a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Might there have been no others with that mark on them, when that man's goods were sold at Chelsea? - I am very clear I bought them all.</p>
               <p>Court. How many might you buy there? - I suppose in the lot about one hundred and ten.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. As to the bolts, do you know them? - I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Do you swear the bolts you have in the yard, are the very bolts you took out of this man's premises? - I do most undoubtedly.</p>

               <p>You say so? - There is not a doubt of it.</p>

               <p>Court. How did you find them? - After I had done this house, there is a garden-fence belonging to the house that Mr. Beresford lives in, and he ordered me to put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250109"></xptr> up a new fence; he asked me what were become of the deals, he thought they went off too fast; I told him I could not tell; one end of the sence was against the house that the prisoner lived in; old Mr. Beresford told me to knock the fence down; within about a yard, or very nigh to this fence, there was a door-way into a room, and I saw these deals in that room; they are a kind of stuff I never saw before, though I have been in that branch thirty years, and one of them has a very particular mark upon it, it is cracked almost from end to end; I went up directly and told Mr. Beresford of it, he came and went into the shed, and when he returned, he said, if every one had their right, John, there are more things of mine in that shed; we then found the putlocks, and some of the marks were fresh cut out, but not cut deep enough, and there was a shaft of a cart found, I had the fellow to it, which exactly answered, for a post.</p>
               <p>Did you measure it? - Yes, I put them both together, I paired them.</p>

               <p>It was open and joined to his garden? - Yes.</p>

            ? - Yes, there were two deals and three put-locks.</p>
               <p>Should you know them again if you was to see them? - Yes, one was narrower than the other, I knew it particularly, I often saw it, I brought it in the cart from Westminster-bridge, and there was never such another deal in the cart. (The deals deposed to by this witness.) I can safely swear to the narrow one.</p>
               <p>Court. What led you to take notice of these deals? - I took notice one was narrower than the other, I never minded them so particularly before, I can swear to the deals.</p>
               <p>You can be sure that these were the deals that were found on the man's premises, but do you know they were the deals that belonged to Mr. Beresford; had you taken particular notice of both, or either of those deals, before they were found on the prisoner? - I had not taken very particular notice.</p>
               <p>Then you brought such sort of deals as those for your master from Lambeth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott. Was there any mark on that narrow deal? - There is a piece slit off of</p>
               <p>Court. Had you observed that piece slit off of it before you saw them at the prisoner's house? - No, Sir, I had not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. How many did you bring from Lambeth in the cart? - Twenty-four or twenty-five, I am not sure which.</p>
               <p>Did you load them yourself? - Me and another man.</p>
               <p>Are you a carpenter by business? - No.</p>
               <p>And do you say now upon your oath, that you took so much notice of any particular deal that you could know it at this distance of time? - Yes, because he had them to build the scaffold, and they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250110"></xptr> new, and we had no other that were, and when he struck the scaffold he took them away.</p>
               <p>At the time when you loaded the cart, did you take notice of this deal any more than the other? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Which way did he get out of the garden? - He got over the pales, and he slipped over the pales, and a nail of Mr. Beresford's side, caught hold of his coat, and he recovered himself, and he took them under his right-arm, and put them in his own shed; he went back and knocked at Mr. Beresford's shutter for the boy to get up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. Did you ever mention any thing of this between that time and the 30th of March? - No.</p>

The reason why I could not follow the cause in the King's Bench was, I was at the bar here before, and was sick a matter of ten weeks<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250111"></xptr> with the gaol distemper, and my wife and I were so ill, that nobody would come near us.</p>

               <p>Why did you measure them? - He bought them on purpose to make some rafters for a shed, and having a job to dig a well he intended to use them for that, and I persuaded him they were too thin; I measured them several times over; I thought them not stout enough.</p>

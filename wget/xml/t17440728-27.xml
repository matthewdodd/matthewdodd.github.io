I had given him leave to go out to play, when he came home he sat down at the bottom of the stairs . I went to him and said, Tommy, why don't you come up and eat some supper? He was very dull. I had some bacon and greens but he did not eat any of them, only a bit of bread: he did not say any thing of his being hurt that night; the next morning between 7 and 8 o'clock I thought I saw some disorder in my child, and asked him what was the matter with him; I said there was some disorder more than ordinary .

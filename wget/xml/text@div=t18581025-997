                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live at 4, Guilford-street, Clerk<lb></lb>enwell—between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning of 2d October, I was in Moorgate-street, and saw a truck there, containing some paper parcels—it was going along to Hounsditch—I saw the male prisoner following—when I got past Cutler-street, I saw him go behind the truck and take a paper</p>

               <p>parcel out of it, and go up Cutler-street with it—I followed after him up Cutler-street, and could not see any more of him—I then communicated with the policeman in Cutler-street, and told him what I had seen—in consequence of what he said, I went to Bishopsgate police-court—after that I went into the neighbourhood of Shoreditch—I saw the male prisoner in the company of the female prisoner, and the female had something bulky under her shawl—they went up Church-street, Shoreditch, till they came to a pawnbroker's shop at the corner of a turning; they parted—the female went down the turning, and crossed over to go into the pawnbroker's shop—the male prisoner stood outside—she returned in about 5 or 8 minutes, and she gave him something which appeared to me to be a pawnbroker's ticket, and after he had it he rubbed his hand as if he was rubbing the sand off the ticket—they walked back along Church-street—I then met a policeman, and told him what I had seen—I went up to the male prisoner, and said, "I charge this man, with stealing a parcel off a truck in Houndsditch"—he was off his guard, and did not make any reply—the policeman laid hold of him, and I said, "I charge this woman with pawning that parcel"—she resisted, and tried to get away—we then walked along Shoreditch, till I got another policeman—I then transferred the woman into the hands of another policeman, and told him to look out that she did not drop anything or pass anything to anybody—as we were going towards Bishopsgate-street police-station, a man came up to me and said in the hearing of the woman, "This woman has dropped this piece of paper"—my attention was drawn to the colour of the piece of paper, corre<lb></lb>sponding with the colour of the paper in which the parcel was wrapped—we then went to Bishopsgate-street police-station, and after that the police<lb></lb>constable and I went to the pawnbroker's with the female prisoner—previous to going into the pawnbroker's shop, the female prisoner said that she was known at the shop—when we got into the shop, the young man that is a witness in this case was not present in the shop, but he was called—as soon as he made his appearance, the female prisoner said, "I have not been here this morning, have I?"—and the young man said, "No"—I said to the young man, "It is very possible that whatever it is that has been pawned would have been brought in a large piece of paper, and the party might have taken the paper back with them"—he said, "Have you got a ticket?"—I said, "It has not been found"—he said, "I cannot tell you what has been pawned"—I said, "Is this the woman that has been in here this morning?"—he said, "No, I cannot say that it is"—we then went back to the station-house, and both the prisoners were taken before the Lord Mayor on the following Monday—I am quite positive that what she said was, "I have not been here this morning, have I?"</p>

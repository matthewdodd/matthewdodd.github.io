                  </hi>. I am landlord of the George the Fourth, Kentish<lb></lb>town—on Monday, 5th March, about a quarter to 5, the prisoner came in for a quartern of rum—it came to sixpence, and he gave me a half-crown—I put it in the detector, and it bent—I told him it was bad, and asked him where he got it—he said he had it in change for a sovereign at the green-grocer's</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Falcon beer-shop, Grafton-street—on 5th March, the prisoner came with two others about a quarter-past 5—my house is about two minutes' walk from Mr. Newman's—the prisoner asked the two men what they would have to drink—one said he would have a glass of "cooper," and the other a glass of "bitter," which they had—that came to fourpence—the prisoner said he did not require anything—one of the other men paid for it—the prisoner pressed the others to have some more, and one said, "I will, providing you have a glass with us"—the prisoner then had a glass of bitter ale, and the others had the same as before—the three glasses came to sixpence, for which the prisoner gave me a shilling, which I put in a glass at the back of the counter—there was no other shilling in there—I did not find out that it was bad until the policeman came to me about a quarter of an hour afterwards—I then found that the shilling the other man had given me was also bad.</p>

I went to the Falcon on 5th March, about 7 o'clock—Mrs. Hart gave me a shilling, and at the station she gave me another—I took the prisoner into custody in a room at the Carlton tavern—he had his head on the table as if asleep—I told him I should take him for uttering several pieces of counterfeit coin in the neighbourhood—he said, "I suppose it is all right"—at the station I searched him, and found on him two counterfeit half-crowns, two counterfeit shillings, and nine sixpences, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4½<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, good money.</p>

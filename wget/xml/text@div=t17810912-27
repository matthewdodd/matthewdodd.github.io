On the 21st of July, he and I went up into the chamber, to go to bed, at about 11 o'clock. I got into bed; and he pulled off his things, to get into bed: but he said he had to speak to some of the rest of the lodgers in another room, and so he put on some of his cloaths again, and took the candle, and went into the other room; and I never saw him after till the Monday following. I fell asleep soon after he went out. When I waked, I missed a coat and waistcoat, and two pair of Nankeen breeches; and two guineas and an half in gold, and some silver, and a silver watch, which were in my breeches pocket. My breeches lay in a chair, by the bedside.</p>
               <p>Were your breeches gone? - Yes; but they were found in the dust-hole the next day. I lost a silk handkerchief, and a white dimity waistcoat. I got up, and went in search of the prisoner, with another young man, who found him the next day, which was Monday, between seven and eight o'clock. I understood he found him somewhere near Drury-lane; but the place I can't tell; I am quite a stranger in the town. We found the watch in his pocket: he had the white dimity waistcoat and Nankeen breeches of mine on, and a silk handkerchief of mine in his pocket, and two guineas and one shilling; but I can't swear that the money was mine.</p>
               <p>Did you find him yourself? - Yes.</p>

               <p>- CROSS sworn.</p>
               <p>I attend Mr. Triquet's office, in Hart-street, Bloomsbury. I took the prisoner. I found upon him this watch, two guineas, and a shilling, in his breeches pocket. He had this dimity waistcoat on, and this handkerchief.</p>
               <p>(They were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>I bought the watch and the waistcoat in Holborn, at the corner of Red-lion-street. I sent for the man to come here.</p>

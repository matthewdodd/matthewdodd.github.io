                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and live at Mr. Turner's, in High-street, Shadwell. On the 14th of Jan., about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I was paid off—about six o'clock in the evening I went with my shipmates so the Bull's Head—I do not know where that is—when I went in I had five sove<lb></lb>reigns in my pocket-book, in my right hand trowsers pocket—there were four or five young women there—the prisoner was one of them—I did not treat them—my shipmate and the prisoner were tossing for half a pint of rum—I changed a sovereign, and after paying for half a print of rum, and giving 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to a man, I put the rest of the change into my pocket-book—I was at the house all the evening—I had been drinking and playing at skittles, and left about a quarter to twelve o'clock, as near as I can guess—I paid for the rum half an hour before I left the house—the four and a half sovereigns, and the rest of money in silver were in my pocket-book with my register when I left—four of us left the house together and went to the Mile-end-road—one of my shipmates went across the road, and the prisoner came up to us in the street and wanted me to go home with her—I would not—she put her hand in my right side trowsers pocket, took the book out, and ran away—I was sober enough to know what took place, and to swear to her the next morning.</p>

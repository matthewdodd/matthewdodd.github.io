On the 1st of October I went a journey, and returned on the 6th, then I found my house had been broke and robbed of the plate mentioned in the indictment; my brother lived with me; there were people in the house; I had a great suspicion of the prisoner, by reason she had robbed me before; she had lived about Chertsey and Woodham, or thereabouts, and by enquiring we found she was gone to London. About a fortnight after I came to town, (I had met her some time about August, I asked her where she lived; she said, I am out of place, but I shall be at Mr. Bogey's in St. Martin's-lane, opposite Chandois-street, where they sell tobacco;) I called at that shop, thinking they might give me some intelligence of her; I asked there for Mrs. Turner, (a name she went by;) the woman of the house said she did not lodge there, but she had lodged there, and she had seen her that week; I said, if Mrs. Turner should call here again, tell her there is a relation or an acquaintance of her's from Chertsey would be glad to see her. On the Monday evening I and Mr. Spur, an attorney, called at Mr. Bogey's house; I went in, he stood at the door; I asked for Mrs. Turner; said the woman, she lodges in the house up three pair of stairs, and was at home; then I said to Mr. Spur, come in; we went up; there were two young women that it seems lodged with her, they said Mrs. Turner was gone somewhere about Soho-square; I left word with them I would call the next morning. In the morning I went to Sir

When I came to Mr. Bogey's on the Tuesday morning, the prisoner was gone out with one of these young women, there was Mr. Noaks with me; he searched the lodgings but found nothing. After some time the prisoner and the other young woman came home; the other came up; I said, where is Mrs. Turner; she said she was below; Mr. Noaks ran down, and whether he took her in the house or street I can't say; she came up along with him, and said, how do you do, master; I said, where are the tankards and mugs you have robbed me of, I am almost sure you was one concerned; after some little time she said, I am a dead woman, More forgive me, you shall have your things again; I told her it was out of my power to forgive her, she must take what the law will allow; she took Mr. Noaks and I to a house in Compton-street, and shewed us a deal box with my plate in it, (produced, and the plate deposed to;) we went to Sir

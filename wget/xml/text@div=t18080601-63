            . I lodge with Mrs. Ayscough in Bridges street, and I live with Mr. Murray, bookseller. On the 30th of May, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was standing opposite of the corner of Bridges street in Great Russel street; the prisoner came about me, I desired her to go, I was talking to a friend at that time; I wished him good night and crossed the road and left him; on turning round I saw the woman following me down <placeName id="t18080601-63-crimeloc357">Brydges street</placeName>

I would have nothing to say to her, I was going to bed; she slung herself about me, and picked my pocket; I felt her hand in my pocket, I laid hold of her by the arm and told her she had robbed me; I put my other hand in my pocket, I found a dollar, a half crown, and two shillings gone; I then told her if she did not immediately give it me I would take her to the watchhouse; she denied having it, and wanted me to go home with her; I told her as I did before, I would have nothing to do with her; I called the watch three times, no watch coming; three young men passed me; I desired them to send me the first watchman they saw; immediately I saw a watchman turn the corner, they called to him and he came to my assistance; I told the watchman the girl had robbed me; I heard the money drop into her pocket as I took hold of her arm; in taking her to the watchhouse she made several attempts to put her her hand in her pocket; I was obliged to pull her hand out; going through Covent garden I found her hand in her pocket and out fell a shilling or two; I desired the watchman to pick it up, she was taken to the watch-house; there was found upon her a half crown piece, two shillings, and a dollar.</p>

            . I am a beadle; a little before twelve o'clock the prosecutor came in the watch-house with the prisoner and two watchman, relating that he had lost a dollar, half a crown, and two shillings; she pulled off her pocket, I found half a crown, and two shillings upon her; he seemed to know one of the shillings; I took her into the yard, she stooped as if to pull up the heel of her shoe, which caused a suspicion in me that she had hid something in the gutter; I saw this dollar standing in the gutter on the ground.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got that dollar out of the change of a half guinea that day; and I had four shillings in silver; he wanted to come home with me; I never saw a halfpenny of his money.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Do you know one of the shillings - A. There is a star on the opposite side of the reading; the other shilling has a stamp upon it; I know both the shillings. She offered some money to the watchman; he would not take it.</p>

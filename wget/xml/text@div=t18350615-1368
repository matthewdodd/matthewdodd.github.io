                  </hi>. I am an engraver, and live in Mornington-place, Hampstead-road, in the parish of St. Pancras—I keep the house. I went to bed on Monday night, the 8th of June, and about half-past two o'clock I heard a knocking, which seemed to be in the house—I got up—it was quite dark—I walked down stairs, and between the first and ground floors I saw the prisoner in the corner of the staircase—I asked what business he had there—he returned no answer—I alarmed my mother, who called in two men, into whose custody I gave him—on the road to the station-house, a policeman overtook us, and I gave the prisoner into custody—I examined the house the night before—the windows were shut and the doors also—after the alarm some table-cloths were found displaced, but I don't know how they were the night before—I found the kitchen window open, and a pair of shoes and a hat in the front area—the prisoner had neither shoes nor hat on—he requested to have his hat and shoes brought to him, which was done, and he claimed them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>, He said at first his wife shut the house up, and she said the servant did—he said he found my hat and shoes in the kitchen—I had them on my feet—I was not inside his house—I was outside the door. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>, He was inside the house on the staircase—his shoes were in the front area—they were not on his feet till he sent for them and put them on in my presence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Michael Sharp, and stepmother to the prosecutor—I live at his house. On Monday, it being a holiday, the servant went out, and at ten o'clock I went down and fastened the bottom of the house—the sash of the window had been fastened all the winter with nails—I shut the shutters and fastened them with a bar—my son alarmed me in the night—I afterwards examined the kitchen window—it was forced open, the shutters undone and the nails taken out—the top sash was forced down—the prisoner must have put his band through a hole which was cut to admit the light, I suppose, and undone the bolt—when the alarm was given, I saw the prisoner standing in the house, by the first floor window—I found the drawers ransacked, the china closet open, and these table-cloths removed from the china closet—they belong to William Sharp—the policeman has got them.</p>

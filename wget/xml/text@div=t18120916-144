            . I am an officer. On the morning of the 12th of July, I was coming along the Strand, I saw the prisoner; she had a basket in her apron; it appeared that she had something heavy. I asked her what she had got. I observed a large stone bottle in the basket, and the liquor in it was rum; I am sure of that. She said she had nothing at all. I told her I was an officer, and with violence I took the bottle from her, and I put it down on my right side; she came round my left side and gave the bottle a kick, and broke it all to pieces. I afterwards picked up the pieces of the bottle. I produce two pieces of that bottle; Northumberland-street, Strand is one of the pieces. I made inquiry, and that inquiry led me to Mr. Morris. I searched the prisoner, and took her before a magistrate. I took some duplicates from her; she said her name was O'Donnel. I looked at the duplicates, and said, it is Pullen. I think she said she lived in Portpool-lane.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did not the woman say, that she had received it from her husband - A. No, she said she bought it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Mr. Morris to the watch-house; Mr. Morris recognized the prisoner as one of the wives of his servant. I asked her where she got the rum; she said she bought it at the Hole-in-the-Wall. She said, she lived in Portpool-lane. I went to her house, and found this can; it smelled strong of spiritous liquor; that made me bring it away.</p>

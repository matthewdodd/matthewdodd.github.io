On the 7th of October, about six o'clock in the evening, in consequence of an alarm, I went into the yard, saw the prisoner there, and immediately collared him; I asked him what he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270012"></xptr>wanted there - I put my hand under his coat, and pulled out my shirt, then took him to the threshold of the door, and charged Lees, a soldier, to assist me, and we took him into the taproom - he dropped another shirt. I picked it up, and sent for an officer, who took him into custody. He was searched, and three waistcoats found on him - they were then wet, as he had taken them off the line.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get into the yard - A. He came through the house. He said he had agreed to buy the lot as they hung on the lines for 5 s. 6 d., and was waiting for his friend. Nobody was in the yard.</p>

On the night of 24th June, I was on duty standing outside the Nag's head, about half-past 12 Mr. White came out and entered into conversation with me—while he was conversing with me he put his hand up to his head, and caught hold of the prisoner, saying, "Policeman, she has hit me on the head with something"—the prisoner was standing about four yards from him—I heard something fall heavily upon the pavement—I caught hold of the prisoner and said, "What do you mean by cutting the man's head open?"—I saw there was blood on his hand when he took it down—she replied, "A b—y good job too, I wish I had killed the old b—"—I searched, and found this stone close by, there was some blood upon it—there was no other missile near—Mr. White had not said anything to the prisoner, he did not see her—on her way to the station she said, "I have been in a lunatic asylum mind, recollect that, and I don't know what I am about"—I believe her sister is here to prove that.</p>

I was house surgeon at the London Hospital—the deceased came there on the morning of 25th June, about 1 o'clock—I found a scalp wound at the back and upper part of the head on the left side—it was such a wound as might have been caused by a stone of this description—I dressed it—there was a great deal of blood—he went away at that time and returned between 9 and 10 in the morning—he was then admitted as an in-patient—he remained till the following day, and then left at his own wish—I saw him again on 13th July, he was then suffering from erysipelas re<lb></lb>sulting from the wound—he died next day.</p>

He knocked me down first, and called me a common prostitute, which I am not. He called me a common thief, which I could not be, as I had only been out of Colney Hatch a month. I had been there nine months; I came out in May last. That is all I have to say, but that he hit me and kicked me, and then I threw the stone at him.</p>

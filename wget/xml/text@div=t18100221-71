On the 16th of January, about eight in the morning, my servant called me down stairs; and when I came down, I saw the prisoner standing there; he said, he wanted a ship; I told him, I would get him one; I asked him, if he had had any breakfast; he said, no; I said, I will get you a ship, and give you a breakfast. He sat down, and presently started up and said, I have two Americans that wants a ship, and they will go where I go. He went away. I had no idea that he had taken any thing at that time; he went into no other place than my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that there was any shawl in the shop - A. I saw the shawl the night before in the shop; about eleven o'clock my wife pulled it off. I cannot take upon me to say, that the shawl was in the shop when the prisoner came in. About two o'clock the prisoner returned, and was in the shop; my wife accused him then of taking a shawl out of the shop; he said, he knew nothing at all about it. I told him, if he had made away with it anywhere to tell me, I would fetch it out, and he might go about his business: he persevered in denying it.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Joel. On the 16th of January, about eight o'clock, the prisoner came into our shop; I called Mr. Nathan.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he came in, did you see any shawl in your shop - A. Yes, my mistress's shawl was there. The man went away, and about nine o'clock, when my mistress got up, and we missed the shawl. About two o'clock the prisoner came again; I asked him, if he had not been there in the morning; he said, no. I charged him with having taken the shawl; he said, he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>- WALLIS. I took the man in custody, and put him in the watch-house. Miers came in the watch-house, and looked at him; he said to him, you are the fellow that I bought the shawl of this morning. I sent for the shawl; this is the shawl.</p>
               <p>Joel. I could almost swear to it; my wife gave half a guinea for it in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Messrs. Richardson &amp; Co., Cornhill—I have been eight years in their employ——they had a warehouse in Billiter Street—they are East India and Colonial agents and bankers—they have large quantities of valuable property entrusted to their custody——while I was in Billiter Street the prisoner Potter was employed by a firm whose premises were in the same place——seven and a half years ago I knew him—remember before leaving Billiter Street a conversation with Potter about</p>

               <p>an old piano we had there——he wanted to buy it——it was in very bad order considering it had been under water——he said he had a friend who would do it up——I said "I have nothing at all to do with it, you must speak to Gil<lb></lb>bert"——Gilbert is a collector now——Potter said subsequently it would pay him and me to take it away and put something in it, giving me to under<lb></lb>stand to make money——we had at that time some plate chests deposited in the Billiter Street warehouse——seven or eight months after the last conver-sation about the piano I remember going out to get a diamond circular for the firm showing the price of diamonds——on my way back I met Potter in Gracechurch Street——he said then he considered he had bought the piano—I said "It is nothing at all to do with me, you must speak to Gilbert about it"——I told him "I do not think we have got any place chests in the place, what do you think about diamonds?"——he said "It will suit me better, because they are more easily carried off; come and have a glass of some<lb></lb>thing to drink," and I went——while it was being consumed he further said "I have some friends who have got money, and if you do get twelve months there's your money when you come back to set up in business"——on the 3rd February, about 12.30, I saw Potter in 'Change Alley——I got leave to go out and see him, and I saw him and two other men——one of them was Herd———Potter said "These are my two friends I spoke about; they have been thinking I have been humbugging them, and they do not mind if you have got diamonds; however, we will go round the corner and have a glass, come along"——I went with the three of them——inside Potter said "There is too many here, come outside"——we went outside, when Potter said "These are the friends I have spoken to you about; they have got the money, do you mean business"——I said "Yes;" not the business they thought, though——I ultimately arranged to meet them between 7 and 8 o'clock, and I left them——I made a communication to my employers, and the police were communi<lb></lb>cated with——at 7.15 I found Herd at Reeves'——he said "What are you going to have to drink?"——I said "A glass of ale," which I had——we came out into Lombard Street, and walked together down Birchin Lane——on the way he said "Is this a genuine affair, and what have you got?"——I said "I have got a plate chest, it is a heavy one; since I saw you we have got a consignment from the Cape of diamonds. I won't show you, they are rather too heavy, but bullion I think it is, according to my instructions"——he said "That will suit me better"——I said "I can let you have one of them"——he said "When can I come and get it, to-night?"——I said "No, we are so very busy; to<lb></lb>morrow morning you must call between 8 and 8.10 not later"——he said he should be there, and "Shall I come upstairs to you?"——I said "No, knock on the stairs; it is rather heavy, you will have to bring something to take it away in"——he said he would bring a bag——on the Friday Underwood and I put some leaden weights into a bullion box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and it was put in the basement——on the Saturday morning the detectives were on the pre<lb></lb>mises——at about 8 <hi rend="italic">o'clock I heard</hi> a rapping <hi rend="italic">on the</hi> stairs——I went to the door and saw Herd; he was standing with his hand before his mouth——I said to him "I have got a beauty for you, it's precious heavy"——he then came in, and I said "Wait here and I will fetch it up"——he brought this carpet bag (<hi rend="italic">produced)—</hi>—I made a clumsy job in putting the box into the bag to give the detectives time——it ultimately got in, and he was walking off——I said "You are not going off like that, I want something from you——he gave me nine sovereigns, and said "You will always find me a gentle<lb></lb>man"——I said "That won't do for me; you will always find that bullion"—</p>

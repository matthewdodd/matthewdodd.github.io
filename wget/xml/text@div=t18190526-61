On Thursday, the 22d of April, about ten minutes before nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to our shop, bought two ounces of tea and a pound of moist sugar, and paid me a 1 l. bank note. I asked him his name? he said Mr. Hewett - I asked him where? he said No. 2, Phipps-court, Tottenham-court-road, and that he was a painter and glazier. I had not sufficient change in the till, and took the note into the parlour to my master, leaving him in the shop. I returned with my master, who gave him the rest of the change, which was 18 s. 3 d. in all, out of the cash-box. I wrote the name and address on the note - (looks at one) - this it; it has that name and address on it, and my initials - he went away. My master was not satisfied with the note; I pulled off my apron, and went after him, crossed the way, and lost him immediately - he had not been out of the shop above a minute and a half. I went and inquired for Phipps-court, but could find no such place. I returned and told my master, shut up shop, and went out again towards Oxford-street. As I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181905260023"></xptr>was crossing in Oxford-street, I saw a man put his hand to his mouth, and call out</p>
               <p>"Oh!" then crossed over to the prisoner at the corner of Charles-street and Oxford-street - they joined company together; I followed them, and between Chapel-street and Wardour-street I saw the other man give something to the prisoner; they went on as far as a cheesemonger's shop in Oxford-street; the prisoner went into the shop, I passed them; he came out in half a minute - the other man was on the opposite side; they joined company again at the corner of Wardour-street, and went down there. I inquired for a watchman. I saw them looking into another shop, they went on farther. At last I saw a watchman at the corner of Little Pulteney-street, I then laid hold of the prisoner, the other man ran off. The prisoner was taken to St. James's watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say anything - A. He said he was not the man. As we were going to the watch-house I said,</p>
               <p>"Ought you not to be ashamed of yourself for seeing me in the shop, and passing to me such a note?" he said,</p>
               <p>"Why did you not take the right man?"</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Did he not say</p>
               <p>"I am not the right man - A. No; he said,</p>
               <p>"Why not take the right man?" No person was in the shop when he came in. I had had very few customers that evening. I am sure he is the man. I took him about forty minutes after he left the shop. I did not find the change, nor the tea and sugar on him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you ever the least doubt of his being the man - A. Never, I suspected him when he was in the shop, as he held his head down under his hat while we were looking at the note, which made me take particular notice of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with George Castrey, at Holloway End Glass Works, Kingswinford, Staffordshire—on 7th February the agree<lb></lb>ment produced was signed by my partner, myself, and—theprisoner—he owed me about 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—to the best of my belief it was about 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to pay the other debts—we paid a composition—from that date he acted under the agreement as a servant—he was allowed to send in weekly sheets and memoranda of expenses, as agreed upon—the amount was mentioned by his own suggestion—he had two guineas a week and a guinea for expenses, exclusive of the horse and trap—no time was mentioned in which the busi<lb></lb>ness was to be returned to him—it was not to return under any circum<lb></lb>stances—could he find the money to repurchase the business we should be quite willing to entertain it, and we should have no objection to his having it again—from the first week in February to the last week in July he sent in the sheets regularly—the paper produced contains the result of the sheets for each week, under each particular date—there is one column with RE on it, which means receipt—on the back of the sheet the expenses are set, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for expenses, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for wages, and two guineas for horse and trap—the amount received shown on the sheets is 470<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the back of the sheets the expense is 469<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., leaving a balance of 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—after 29th July, he refused to supply the sheets when asked for—we tried all we could to get them from him; and after that we went to make inquiries—when he was taken into custody he did not account at all—we did not suspend him from his duties until he was taken into custody—he has not accounted for the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Mr. King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> According to our cash-book it took us over 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I believe it was nearer 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. independently of the debt—I should like 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound for the business, and will take it from you now if you can give it—the expenses are all explained in your own writing—these are from your own books—we want to hide nothing—the paper I put in is a summary of all the receipts from the first payment to the last day he delivered them.</p>

I am the London Manager of Castrey &amp; Gee—on 29th February I saw the prisoner give in the sheets and the books as well; they are all in his own writing; they come down to 29th July—the figure 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is a balance due to me—I saw him on 29th July, he promised to come and make the sheets up, but never did so—I saw several times afterwards—I asked him tocome and make the sheets up on the Saturday previous to his being arrested—he never disclosed to me the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Mr. King, or accounted for it in any way.</p>

On the evening of the 27th I looked in the prisoner's drawer, I found five or six sheets of proof paper, I shewed it to Mr. Scott and then replaced it in the drawer the same as I found it, on the next morning, Saturday, the prisoner came to work sooner than usual. I then stated to him that I believed we should have something to do on the Sunday, so that if I had occasion to call upon him I might know where to find him, he gave me No. 3, Bull's Head Court, Peter Street, Saffron Hill. After the prisoner was gone to breakfast I looked in the drawer again, and found the paper gone from the drawer. The work that he was upon I counted out and missed fifty or sixty sheets out of about three thousand five hundred. I obtained a search warrant and went to his lodgings that he had described. I searched the lodgings on the Saturday afternoon, and found the six sheets that I had found on the over evening, it was hanging upon a line to dry, it had been wetted fit for work. I found also a quire of royal paper, which was part of the paper that he was at work, and part of that I had missed. I found some sheets of printed paper, some sheets of what I was printing of Blairs Sermons, and some sheets of the Monthly Review. This is the property that we found. I am certain that the paper is the property of Mr. Strahan and Mr. Preston.</p>

            , in Smithfield market, they were Norfolks; seven of them got into the prisoner Plata's flock, as they were driving them home. My sheep were marked with a P. round the face and down the back; I found five of the seven afterwards in Plata's flock, and in the evening I found the other two at the Green Man, in Portpool-lane; they were dressed ready for market, or ready for a butcher's shop to cut up. We found no skin there, I have seen a skin that was one of the two, which Mr. Reed shewed me. The head of one was not taken off, and upon one side the skin and the wool still remained, that was the side where the loop of the P. round the eye; the skin that Reed produced was fitted to it, and made up the whole of the P.</p>

               <p>I am a smith; on Monday, the 11th of April, I was at the Green Man in Portpool-lane, I saw the prisoners there, in company with Malpas, who is not in custody; Plata came in all in a sweat, and said, b - t the bloody Norfolks, I never had so much trouble as I have had to-day. There were a drove of sheep at the door. Colliss said he would toss him for a pint; Plata said he would have a glass of gin; he did so. Malpas and Colliss went out and pulled in two sheep into the passage, and put them backwards into a stable; Plata was in the house at that time; Malpas and Colliss said to Jackson, the landlord, are these the two sheep you bought at Smithfield-market today? Jackson made answer, yes; (I cannot tell whether Plata heard it,) Colliss said marked J. S. Jackson said, yes. I went and looked in backwards about twenty minutes afterwards, and Colliss and Malpas were dressing them. I had often seen Colliss at the Green Man, he was a drover. I saw Plata in the back kitchen, just in the place where they were dressing. Mr. Jackson and his wife are gone away. Plata staid about two minutes after the sheep were dragged in.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - About two o'clock, then Plata went away with the rest of his drove.</p>

I saw Plata at the justice's, he is the man that came in; I know Malpas, he was one that was dragging them in; they were dragged into the stable; about two hours afterwards I saw two sheep hanging up; I went away I believe before Plata.

               <p>You and Plata, and the boy, went all together to Clerkenwell-green? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had not you been to Back hill before Mr. Pooley came to you at Clerkenwell? - No, we had not.</p>
               <p>Which way did you go? - Along Cow-cross.</p>
               <p>So then from Smithfield bars to Clerkenwell-green, Plata went strait without stopping any where but at the public-house at Clerkenwell-green? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Had he never been at the Green Man? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You have told us you have known him ten years, and never heard any harm of him before in your life? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He has attended Smithfield-market that time? - I do not know, he was on board a ship.</p>
               <p>He was a fellow servant, you knew him very well? - I never took notice about missing him.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear, that for the last ten years you have never missed him out of the service of Mr. Harwood, except when he was on board ship? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you never visit him in Newgate? - No, Sir, he might be there for what I know, but I do not know that he was.</p>
               <p>Do not you know, or have not you heard, that he was tried here? - I have heard he was tried here, but not for truth; I do not know when he went away, nor I cannot be certain.</p>
               <p>Did you see him from the Wednesday till he surrendered in July? - I do not know what day it was he went away, it was the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Plata. Gentlemen, the day I went into the Green Man was the day before; please to examine the boy.</p>
               <p>Pooley. The man he mentions, my lad, was the person that the prisoner sent to me to tell me he would wait for me on Clerkenwell-green; I do not know where to find him, he has left my service three months.</p>

               <p>I am a sawyer, I came for both the prisoners; they are entire strangers to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What do you shake so for? - I cannot help it; I was in a public-house in Leather-lane, last Monday evening; this woman and another man, Smith I believe he is, came in and told the landlord they had been to find a bill against the two prisoners; the woman asked the landlord if she was to have any reward for prosecuting<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140070"></xptr>the two prisoners; she was told that they thought she would, if they were prosecuted; but she said God forbid she should, for she knew nothing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Who told her so? - The landlord and the people of the house, and I might when she asked the question; she went towards the bar, and the man Smith came towards the box where I sat, and said, she be damned, she will swear black is white: about two or three minutes after that, I was by the woman herself, and she told me, that this man Smith, was keeping her, what she called in tow, that is, treating her, I suppose, on purpose to make her swear the same that he did; he said the prisoners were both of them dead men, and he would be damned but he would have the reward; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. (Cross Examination.) This was last Tuesday? - Last Tuesday about four in the evening.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A sawyer, I work for Mr. Hobbs, right opposite to this public-house.</p>
               <p>You never was in this court before? - Not as a witness.</p>
               <p>No, a witness! no; how long was it since you was here? - Six years, eight years, I was tried here.</p>
               <p>God bless me! what for pray? - Tried, I was arraigned, there was no witness against me.</p>
               <p>What has you arranged for? - A charge of house-breaking.</p>
               <p>God bless me! house breaking! so you did not know either of the prisoners at the bar? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>You went into the house promiscuously? - Promiscuously, no; wilfully; it is a house I go into to get my beer.</p>
               <p>Who did they say they had been finding a bill against? - Plata and Collis, and another man, they mentioned their names.</p>
               <p>And when did you first mention this to any body? - I went to the gaol, and enquired for the prisoners directly, and told them this story.</p>
               <p>What is the name of the landlord? - His name is Bewitt, the sign of the Windmill, Leather-lane.</p>
               <p>Is six years ago the last time you was in custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Never in custody since or before? - Not any where.</p>
               <p>Where have you been? - At work in different parts of the town; I have been on board a man of war some time, on board the Latona frigate, part of last summer, Albemarle Bertie was the commander.</p>
               <p>How long was you in Newgate at that time? - You ask me questions nothing tending to what I come upon.</p>
               <p>How long was you in Newgate? - Seven weeks.</p>
               <p>How happened that? - It was the long vacation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Smith. Now, upon the oath you have taken, is what this man has said, true? - No, and please you; it was half past five before I left the Crown Tavern on Clerkenwell-green; I was at that public-house he speaks of, but it was seven or eight, I did not see him there, I do not know the man, I have seen him in Leather-lane.</p>
               <p>Is the account that he has been giving true, in any one part of it? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Margaret Ford. Is this account, true? Nothing but a falsity, as if I was to say        .</p>
               <p>Did you say that this man was keeping you in       ? - No, Sir, I never saw the man before that I know of.</p>
               <p>Never you any body that you and God forbid you should do it for reward? - No, I never did it, what was said is absolutely false.</p>
               <p>Court to Arnett. You work for Mr. Hobbs now? - Yes, he is a wooder.</p>
               <p>How long is it since your mistress was prosecuted and transported? - It is not that Hobbs.</p>

               <p>I work at Mr. Hobbs's: I came as much<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140071"></xptr>for one prisoner as the other; for I heard it of both; I say as this, that I was over the way, getting me a pint of beer, at the Windmill, at four in the afternoon; I heard this man and woman talking about the affair, about persecuting of these people; she said she would not persecute them on no account in the world, in case she thought she could take their life; with that she went out; and I heard this man say, when she was gone out, it was her falseness, for that she would swear away any man's life for the lucre of gain; more than that, he said she would swear that that table was white, which was a wainscot table, and a very dirty one; when she came in again, Smith said to the woman, he would give her 10 l. for her chance, and he would persecute them, and have the reward, even if it was but twopence, for they were all dead men; that is all I have to say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow (Cross Examination). Who did they talk about persecuting? - Why these here two prisoners.</p>
               <p>What did they call them? - They did not call them by any name, not to me; but they did before, in my hearing; not when he said he would persecute them.</p>
               <p>What did he call them before? - Upon my word, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was it Greenhill and Johnson, are you sure? - No, that is not the name; the one was Plata, the other I cannot remember.</p>
               <p>Was it Malpas? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you think it may be Colliss? - It may; I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Who was there? - Mr. Arnett was there, and one Mr. Ball.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Mr. Arnett? - I believe about six weeks, to the best of my knowledge; he lodges at the Windmill, and saw for Mr. Hobbs; the landlord's name is Blewitt, or some such name; the landlord was not present then; Arnett and me, and Ball, were there.</p>
               <p>Pray, Mr. Gray, what way of life are you in, if it is not an impertinent question? - I am a porter there, at Mr. Hobbs's.</p>
               <p>Where is Mrs. Hobbs now? - I never knew any thing of her.</p>
               <p>Oh, dear me! why she is gone abroad lately. Where did you live before? - I know nothing about that; I lived, the last place, at Mr. Flintoff's, in Smithfield, the end of Long-lane; and I lived at Mr. Fleming's, in Chandos-street; he is an upholsterer and cabinet-maker.</p>

             went to the door and spoke to her; what they said, I cannot say; I was sitting upon the top of the table, in the tap-room; and this young man said, says he, as to what she says about swearing does not signify a farthing, for she would swear that that was white, which was a dark table.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow (Cross Examination). You work for Mr. Hobbs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was watering-time, so that you are sure to the time? - It might be a little before four, or a little after.</p>
               <p>Not a quarter of an hour either way; it is what you call watering-time? - Yes, what we call our tippling time.</p>
               <p>They did not mention the names of the prisoners? - After they mentioned the names of the people, that is, after we mentioned this story, we made it our business, that is, Arnett did, to go to the bar, and write down these names; their names were Plata, Colliss, I think, and Malpas.</p>
               <p>You did not ask the landlord to write it down for you? - No, Arnett wrote it himself at the bar.</p>
               <p>Have you seen that paper to-day? - Yes, I saw it this morning.</p>
               <p>Who shewed it you? - Arnett, of course.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Arnett. Let us look at it.</p>
               <p>(Handed to him.)</p>
               <p>Ball. I have worked for Mr. Hobbs five weeks last Monday; I have known Mr. Arnett, off and on, I suppose, these four years.</p>
               <p>You did not know him when he was in Newgate? - I never knew he was there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Smith. Is there a word of truth in what this man has been swearing? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ford. There is no truth in it; for we were not from Hicks's-hall till half after five.</p>
               <p>Court to Pooley. You was with Smith and Ford at the Sessions-house? - To the best of my knowledge, it was past five.</p>
               <p>What time did you leave the Sessions-house? - A little after four; then we went to Mr. Bilson's, the Crown; there we continued, I suppose, till half after five; I am sure it was past five before I parted with these people.</p>
               <p>From the time that you left the Grand-Jury room, till you parted with them at half past five, had Smith and Ford been ever out of your company? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Smith. If I understand you right, you do not deny that you was in the public-house that day? - I was in the public-house, at seven o'clock, which they mentioned, the Windmill.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, being at the public-house at seven o'clock, that none of those witnesses that have been speaking were in that room? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure they were not in the room? - Yes, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Can you venture to swear that no such people were in the room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you there any time before seven? - No, only once all the day.</p>
               <p>And you mean, as far as you can swear, that you have no recollection that any of those witnesses were in that house? - No, not that day; I have seen that man, Arnett, before, but not the rest; I have seen him in that public-house, the Windmill, but he never spoke two words to me.</p>
               <p>How far is the Windmill from Clerkenwell-green? - A quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you there before you went to Clerkenwell? - No, that was the first time I was in that house all that day.</p>
               <p>Was that the only time you was in the house that day? - Yes, that was seven o'clock.</p>


               <p>Court to Mrs. Ford. Was you with Smith at the public-house? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140073"></xptr>Was Arnett, or any of the witnesses, there at that time? - Not to my knowledge; they were not in our company; there was no other person in our company; we might be there half an hour; we had a pint of beer, that was all; I do not recollect that any body else was there besides the landlord, or somebody belonging to the house; it was seven o'clock when we were there, and that was the only time we were there; I never was there, except that evening at seven, and since this affair happened: I have known the house a great while; it is not a great way from us.</p>
               <p>Did you see these witnesses in the house that day? - Not to my knowledge; I have seen Arnett backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen him in that public-house? - No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you been at Hicks's-hall before you came to the Windmill? - Yes, we had been there, and staid there with Mr. Payne and Mr. Pooley; we had been examined, and then we went to the Windmill.</p>
               <p>Court to Payne. You attended on Tuesday, with these witnesses, before the Grand Jury? - I did.</p>
               <p>At what time was the bill presented? - I cannot recollect; but, to the best of my remembrance, it was about four o'clock; after I had been called in, I went to the Crown; we went together.</p>
               <p>Did these people continue with you while you were at the Crown? - I took no notice of them; I was the second person that was called, and these witnesses were to go in after me, and I waited for them; they were not out of my sight at all, except while I was in the Grand-Jury room.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you go with either of these witnesses to the Windmill? - No; I do not know where the Windmill is.</p>
               <p>Where did you meet together before you went to Hicks's-hall? - At this public-house, at the Crown, Bilson's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Read. You went before the Grand Jury? - Yes, I met the other witnesses at the Crown.</p>
               <p>What time? - I do not know; about ten in the morning: it was past four when I was called in; I was the last but one that was called in.</p>
               <p>From ten, the time you went, till you was called to the Grand Jury, were Smith and Ford in your company? - Yes, they were, all the time; we went back to the Crown from the Grand Jury; I suppose they might continue in my company some time after.</p>
               <p>Can you be sure to the time? - It was certainly past five.</p>

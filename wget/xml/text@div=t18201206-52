He used a very horrid and shocking expression to me, which terrified me. Being so strangely accosted, I turned my face to look at him, being struck with amazement for a moment.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words - A. He came and said,</p>
               <p>"You are a b - dy liar." I turned my face, and felt something very sharp, like a twitch - I clapped my hand down, and found my watch was taken; I immediately received the blow - my seals were hanging out. I cried out Stop him! - there were two other men by - they ran off, crying out Mad bull! I followed him down a court, I saw him in Bennett's-court, and then lost him. I saw him again in two hours and a half, he appeared to be dressed as before. I had some doubt of him at first sight, but entertain no doubt now. He threatened to shoot me. When I looked close to his eyes I was certain of him; and on hearing his voice before the Magistrate I was the more confirmed of his being the man, and from his black eyes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did he assign any reason at the office for using these expressions - A. I think he said I would swear any man's life away. It was light, and I could see him plainly - I think I had seen him about before. I do not know which of them robbed me. I recollected him much better when I saw him by daylight. He did not look me in the face above half a minute. Whether the blow or push was intended or not I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You only swear to him by his black eyes and his voice - A. No.</p>

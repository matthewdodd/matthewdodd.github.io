On the 5th of Nov., at a quar<lb></lb>tes tes past six in the morning, I was in Gray's-inn-lane—I observed the pro<lb></lb>secutor standing at the bar of the Guy Earl of Warwick public-house—the prisoners Smith and Clark were there—I called the attention of the constable on the beat to it—the prosecutor was very tipsy, and they drank two half pints of gin while I was looking at them—while they were there the prosecutor took his gold watch out and looked at it—I saw it had a gold chain to it, which was round his neck.</p>

I received information from Sergeant Archer, and I remained in the lane nearly half an hour—I saw Smith and Clark at the bar with the prosecutor—I then went round my beat, and when I returned they were gone—I remained in the lane about half an hour longer, and then I got information that there was a cry of "Murder" in a house in George-yard—I went there, and in a room I found the three prisoners, and two other women, and the prosecutor, in a scuffle together—the prosecutor said, "I have been robbed of a watch, a chain, and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note;" here is the watch, and I received it from his hand—he charged Smith and Clark with robbing him, and one who is not here with taking a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and running down stairs with it—I bolted the door, and kept them all in—I sent for another officer, and we searched the room—the other officer found part of a chain below the front of the bedstead—I took the prisoners to the station—this is the watch.</p>

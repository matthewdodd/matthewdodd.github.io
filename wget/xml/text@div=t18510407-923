                  </hi>. I am a constable in the London Docks—the prisoner was a landing and shipping foreman there, at the West Quay. On 25th March, about twenty minutes past four o'clock, as he was passing out at the west gate, I stopped him, and said, "I want to speak to you, Barrell step this way"—I then said, "I have information you have something in your hat"—he said, "No, nonsense"—I said, "I must look," and he said, "Take it off"—I did so, and in it found 11<hi rend="italic">b.</hi> 4 ozs. of black tea (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked if he had any more—he then put his hand in hit right coat pocket and pulled out a little more—I put my hand in and pulled out 6 ozs. altogether (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked him to sit down, as he seemed overcome—I asked him where he got it from; he said he got it from the West Quay, under the shed—I said, "Did you get it out of a chest?—he said, "Out of a chest," and that it was sweepings—it was clean tea, free from dirt—the next morning, as soon as the Custom's locks were taken off the sheds, I went to the West Quay shed and found a chest of tea broken, and about the same quantity of tea gone from it as there it here—this is a sample from the chest (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—in my judgment they are both of the same sort.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, at 6, County-place, Mile-end-road, and am independent. I have known the prisoner twenty years, and have had frequent opportunities of seeing him—I always knew him to be a respectable man—about four years ago he was attacked by paralysis, and I never apprehended he was exactly right afterwards—he lost the use of his left side, and was unable to put on his coat—about two years ago he had fits frequently: I never saw him in one—I conversed with him about three weeks ago—I consider now that at times he is not right in his mind.</p>

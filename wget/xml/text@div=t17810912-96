I turned, and saw the prisoner, with a pistol, which he presented close to me. I struck him with my whip, and desired him to keep off. I then thought I had been rather rash, as I had two ladies in the phaeton, but that, having resisted, I must make the best of it. I struck at him again, and drove him to the head of my horses. I then heard the sound of horses and persons. I called out, A highwayman! Upon which the prisoner went off. I presently met two men: I told them the story; and after some persuasions, telling them he was badly mounted, they pursued him, and took him. I saw him at a public-house. I have no doubt of the prisoner's person.</p>

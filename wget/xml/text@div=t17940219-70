               <p>I am a constable and patrole of Dowgate Ward. About six o'clock last Monday night I was going my round, I saw the prisoner at the bar just going by me, I was just going across the lane where he was going up, I was going by Bush-lane, he had this bundle under his arm; I stepped up to him, I said, my friend, what have you got? he said he had got nothing but an empty bag; I asked him if there were any thing in it? he said, no. I felt the bag, and I thought there was something in; he said no; I felt the bag and I thought there was something in it, and I found in it the indigo which it contains, I have kept it till now; I asked him how he came by it? he said he found it. I took him down to where he worked, he worked with Edward Hanson, and Co.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you see in these parcels? - Indigo. I examined the samples and went down to the chest where they were taken from, and I am positive they are the same sort; one parcel was taken out of the chest where there is but a small parcel of indigo, not common; they were taken out of two different parcels and two different sorts.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sorts were there in the bag? - Two sorts.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they blended together or separate? - They were in separate papers, they are in separate papers now.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there the same quantity found as you missed? - That we cannot tell, because the chests are repacked, whether there was more or less lost I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether that corresponded with what came out of the chest? - I am sure this came out of the chest.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I worked with Messrs. Hanson, Pearson, Stiles, and Pearson; I worked with them sometime, and on Monday I went first to Chequer-yard, there I continued till half past two o'clock, first piling some wool, then I went down to pile some silks, then I went from there and went to my dinner, and a man came in and said, Green, you must go with me; I immediately went with him, it was then a quarter after three; I went with him to the Steel-yard, and worked with him twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour; I came up again, and Mr. Green ordered me to go with this man up to the warehouse, in Mud-lane, which I did; when we had done I asked this man to lock up while I went down into the necessary, says I, I shall be off nearly as soon as you. I went down to the necessary, and afterwards, in running along Thames-street, I picked up this sack, I saw it laving as I ran by, I ran by it and saw it, and went back and took it up; afterwards I met this man, Wainwright, and he said, Green, what have you got there? but before this' I went and threw it into Mr. Barker's, the public house were we are paid; I goes to Mr. Pearson's and there I gets my note for my day's work, two shillings, I goes and gets my two shillings, and has a pint of beer and drinks it; a man says to me there, what will you have for this sack? I said, you shall have it for a shilling, not noticing then there was any thing in it; after I got out and was a little up Bush-lane I thought I felt somewhat, and then I met Wainwright, he said, what have you got there? says I, I don't know, and with that he took me to the counting house. I have no witnesses: if Mr. Wainwright had got that man for me that he promised to do, he would be a witness; and Mr. Hanson knows, and Mr. Pearson and them, that I have never been in the indigo warehouse since I have been in the Steel-yard. Mr. Hanson weighed the chests, and the chests weighed the gross weight as when they came.</p>
               <p>Hanson. I went down and desired the merchants clerk to weigh it, and one was weighed by those that, no doubt, had a hand in taking it.</p>

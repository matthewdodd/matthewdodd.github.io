I fastened the house myself-the wash-house door was fastened with a piece of string, it was also latched; between half-past eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I thought I heard something, and came down stairs. Abouta quarter before twelve I came down again, I then went up, looked out of window, and saw a person standing outside the gate - I do not know who it was. I had seen four persons standing there about half-past ten o'clock, the prisoner, Gurney, was one, Whitley, and a boy named Howlett, were two others - I knew them, but I did not know the other. About twelve o'clock I came down and found the washhouse door open, which is part of the dwelling-house, and missed my son's and my husband's great coats, and my son's jacket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I saw the washhouse door fast about eleven o'clock. No person could have gone through to unfasten it.</p>

            . My father is a milkman. I am sixteen years of age. I live near the prosecutor, and go out with milk - I know the prisoners. On Monday the 8th of June, I was with them near Mr. Goodwin's premises, I was not near the gate between ten and eleven o'clock, I first went near the gate about twelve o'clock; we had agreed to get over the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Who proposed it - A. I did. We had been talking about going to get some coats - They agreed to go; when we got up to the gates Gurney got over and opened them, and we all three went in; we went towards the washhouse door, which was fastened with a string, we undid it, went in, took the coats, and put them on - We took two great-coats and a jacket. We came out of the gates, and went into Aldersgate-street, up a coach-yard, and slept in a coach until half-past four o'clock, then went to Smithfield, and from thence to Field-lane; Gurney made us take off the coats, and he went and sold them; he told us to wait, when he returned he said he had got twelve shillings for them, and gave us four shillings each.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I never lived with the prosecutor, I have slept there, and knew the premises.</p>

            . I am beadle of the parish. On the 9th of June I apprehended Gurney at the Little King of Prussia, Hoxton. I found nothing on him. I took Lowe on the Wednesday following, at his master's, who is a watch-pendant maker, in Brick-lane; his master asked him if he had anything to do with the robbery? he said, Yes; he was neither threatened or promised; he said he was with them, and Whitley was concerned in the robbery; that all three went to the gates, Gurney got over and opened them, and let the rest in, they then got into the wash-house, and each took a coat, that Gurney sold them for twelve shillings, and they had four shillings each.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I never had Whitley in custody.</p>
               <p>GURNEY'S Defence. I was out of work. Whitley said he could get three coats if we would go with him; we went about twelve o'clock, Whitley got over the gate, went to the wash-house, cut the string, and brought the coats out.</p>
               <p>LOWE'S Defence. Whitley brought them out to us.</p>

I live in the lower part of the house, the rest of it is let out in different tenements; the owner does not live in it-there are five different families living in the house, besides mine. On the 22d of May, when I went to bed, I left every thing locked up safe; I got up at eight o'clock next morning, found my windows broken, and the articles stated in the indictment taken out-my wife and two of my children were in the house at the time, and some of the lodgers. I went round to the shops and gave information. I lost thirty-eight screen sticks.</p>

            . My mother lives at No. 2, Drury-court. I was going on an errand at seven o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner, and another man, the prisoner put his hand in the glass and took the sticks - He put them under his coat, came out of the passage, and went away with them. I knocked at Mr. Goodey's back-parlour door, but no person answered; I then saw him cross over the road, go up Craven-place, come back, and stand at the corner of Craven-buildings. I am sure the prisoner is the man that I saw take them - I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>GEORGE FIELDER. I am a gold-beater, and live in Greek-street, Soho. On Friday last, the 23d of May, about nine o'clock in the morning, the prosecutor gave me information that he had lost the articles stated in the indictment, and requested me to stop them if they were offered for sale. About eleven o'clock the prisoner called with some of them - He said he had those and a number more; wishing to get the whole in my possession, I told him if he brought all that he had I would buy them. In about half an hour he returned with the rest of them. I then told him I understood they were stolen, and should detain him; he appeared very willing to stop. I sent for the prosecutor. The constable came and took him into custody.</p>
               <p>EDWARD LONGLEY. I was sent for and took the prisoner into custody; he said he found them in St. James's Park. (Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went out about half-past six o'clock, and found them tied up in a bundle in one of the seats in St. James's Park. I told Fielder how many there were. I stopped willingly till the prosecutor came.</p>

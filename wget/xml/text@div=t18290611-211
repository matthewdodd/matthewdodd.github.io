               <p>JOHN LEACH. I am in the employ of Mr. Sweet. On the 8th of May, in the morning, this drawing was in the window, which was closed; the shop door was open; I was opening the shop, and just as I took the shutter in I saw the prisoner come in and take the picture; he went out with it; I went after him directly - I lost sight of him and overtook him in Fetter-lane with it, under his arm - I met a gentleman, and got him to lay hold of him, which he did; I took the picture; he said nothing.</p>
               <p>THOMAS LIGHFTOOT. I am a constable. I received him in charge about eight o'clock in the morning.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. A lad came up, and asked me to carry it; he ran away when the gentleman came up.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

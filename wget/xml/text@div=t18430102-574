                  </hi>. I am a policeman. Last Friday evening I was in the Westminster-road, about 500 yards from Mr. Gautier's bouse, and met the prisoner carrying a bundle—I followed him about half way down the New Cut, and asked what he had under his arm—he said, "A gown"—he could not tell what else—I asked him to let me see them—I took him into a potato-warehouse, and asked him again if he knew what was in the bundle, before I opened it—he said he could not exactly say—I took him to the station after great resistance—he threw himself down, and said he would not go, and used threatening language—I found then the bundle contained two silk gowns, one cotton one, a jacket, a frock-coat, and apron—I found a latch key and a drawer key on him at the station, with a box of lucifers—I went to Mr. Gautier's afterwards, tried the latch key, and found it opened the door with ease—when I first saw the prisoner he said a woman had given him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to carry the bundle to a street on the other side of Blackfriars-road, and at the station he said a man gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to carry it, and refused to answer any further questions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He began to knock me about—he was dressed in private clothes, and I said I would not go with him. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not knock him about at all—he threw me down, and kicked me very much—he put his hand into his pocket, as I thought, to get a knife—it took three or four constables to take him to the station, he was so violent.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a patten-maker and reside at the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich—on 22d October I was in the Beresford Arms—I went in for a pint of ale, and while paying for it the prisoner snatched my purse out of my hand and ran away with it—I had taken it out of my pocket to get money to pay for the ale—I had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—I had not said anything to him or he to me—I ran after him—he had a cap on—I am quite sure he is the man that did it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could he have got rid of your purse without you seeing it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he might have thrown it away—it was about 11 o'clock in the morning—I was about ten yards behind him—he ran up towards Rolfe's wharf, that is by the side of the river—there are houses on one side and the river on the other—he was taken about 300 yards from the place where he took my purse—he had got outside the door before I started—he had a cap on when he started—I did not see it come off—it was not on when he was taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman at Woolwich—on the morning of 22d October, I saw the prisoner running in a direction from the Beresford Arms—the prosecutor was following him—I did not see him stopped—Rolfe's wharf is by the side of the river, about 200 yards from the Beresford Arms—the water was not high—it was down about 20 yards from the side—I did not see the prisoner after he left High-street—he had three corners to turn before he was taken—he had to pass the Bell water gates—he went down High-street turned into Sergeant-street on to Trover's wharf and then to Rolfe's wharf—I did not see him on the wharf—I saw him run down High-street—he had no cap on.</p>

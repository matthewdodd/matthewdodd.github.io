I took the lodgers of that house to the pawnbroker, on hearing the watch had been pawned - Rowe was one, and I apprehended him; he asked me if I had heard any thing more about the watch; I said, yes, one man had been taken up and I would not lose sight of him - he ran away, but I took him; he then said he took the watch when he went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140048"></xptr>in for some water; he said he was intoxicated, and when the liquor was in, the wit was out, but Jack Franklin had split upon him, or he should not have been taken; he said they had had a drop of gin together, but they should not have many more drops as he should go over the herring-pond.</p>

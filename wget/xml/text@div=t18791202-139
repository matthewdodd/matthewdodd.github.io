                  </hi>. I live at 70, King and Queen Street, Walworth, and am a general dealer—on Saturday night, Oct. 18, about 9.45, I was in St. George's Road going home, when the prisoner Smith knocked me down; he caught me under the leg with his hand, and I fell, and he fell on the top of me; he threw himself across my stomach, kneeling, tore open my buttons, and snatched my watch and chain while Nickless held my hands—I was hurt on my back—I did not know then that they had taken anything else—after taking my watch they ran away—I got up and ran after them; I saw them running—I saw three private policemen and a constable; they spoke to me, and I complained to them, and they joined me, and we all ran after the prisoners—I caught sight of them; the private policemen caught one by Bedlam, about twelve yards from where I was knocked down—I am sure the prisoners are the men—when I got home I found that I had lost my purse and card-case; the purse contained two shillings and a threepenny piece—they were in my right-hand trowsers pocket—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my puree and card-case—I was very much hurt, and felt very great pain across my stomach—I did not go to a doctor; I only took medicine at home—I do not feel the effects now; I did not feel any pain in my back till the next morning—it lasted about twelve days.</p>

On Saturday, 18th October, about 7.30 p.m., I was in the London Road in plain clothes, about five minutes' walk from St. George's Road; Detectives Hunt and Chamberlain called me; I saw the two prisoners and another man, and watched them—they kept pushing about in the crowd—there were a great many persons about going to market—they went to Newington Causeway, crossed over down the New Kent Road, came back again, and went into a public-house—after waiting an hour I saw them come out and go down the London Road again—we watched them there till about a quarter to 10—they went into several public-houses; I followed them into St. George's Road, where I saw the prosecutor—the two prisoners and the other man all ran up to him; there were not many people about then; they knocked him down—I could not see who knocked him down, but they all hustled round him, and I saw him fall on the ground—I could not see exactly what they did when he fell—they ran away and doubled back into the Lambeth Road—I ran after Nickless and caught him—I did not lose sight of him—I said "I shall take you into custody for robbing a man"—he said "You have made a mistake"—the prosecutor staggered across the road, and called out "I have lost my watch—his face was smothered with blood—Smith was brought up by this time, and the charge was made—we took them to the station—we had to assist the prosecutor there—he charged them both—I then went back, and in the Lambeth Road, just out of the St. George's Road, where they had doubled back, and where they were apprehended, I found this purse in the gutter, containing a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece and a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., piece, and this key and card-case.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 31st of Aug., about twelve o'clock, I was sit<lb></lb>ting at work in the lower warehouse belonging to Mr. Johnson, in Narrow-street, Ratcliff—my brother, who was also employed on the premises, came down stairs, and asked me something; in consequence of which, I went im<lb></lb>mediately to see if the prisoner was outside—he was nut—I then went up</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Johnson, at his premises—my brother is the foreman. The prisoner was employed as plumber, to lay the gutters—about ten minutes past twelve o'clock I was on a platform, a little below the roof, on Saturday, the 31st of Aug., and saw the prisoner in an alley which runs between Mr. Johnson's premises and Garner and Co.'s, and heard something very heavy fall from the roof—there is a small gate at the end of the alley, which is no thoroughfare—I looked at the gate and saw the prisoner enter, and pick up two pieces of lead, place one under his left side, and the other under the right side of his jacket, and button it with one button—he went out at the gate, keeping his arms close to his side, to keep the lead up—I went down, and gave information to my brother—I went to look for the prisoner, but he was gone—I had seen him on the roof during the morning—the dinner hour is twelve o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where do you suppose it fell from? how far from the gate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might be a dozen yards—I was on the platform on the water side of the building, twenty, thirty, or forty feet from the ground, not above forty feet from the gate—we had two carpenters, a bricklayer, and plumber—I did not see any of them go away to dinner—I never had any words with the prisoner in my life—I have known him several years living in the neighbourhood—he was only employed on our premises the day before.</p>

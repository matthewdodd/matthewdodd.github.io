                  </hi>. I live at Ruislip. My mother, Bosetta Tollitt lives there, and keeps a grass farm—I act as foreman, and assist in her business; the prisoners were in her employ on 14th March—Hill's duty was to take hay to market—Ruislip is about fifteen miles from town—Hill was allowed a bottle of hay as provender for his horses; that is about forty pounds, and he had his feed in nose bags—on 14th March, some hay was shown to me by a constable; I could identify it as belonging to my mother; it is now here.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 75). On 14th March, I was in Mrs. Tollitt's rick yard, about half past 1 o'clock in the morning—I saw Hill there, he went to the stable through a small paddock or meadow—I followed him, and saw him in the stable—I heard him say to Lavender, "Now, <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, fill your sack"—I "had not seen Lavender at that time—I then saw Laven<lb></lb>der bring his sack outside the stable door, and then Hill brought out his sack—they brought them to the rick yard; Lavender placed his sack on the side of the cart he was going with; and Hill placed his on the side of the cart he was going with—I know what a bottle of hay is—each of the carts had a bottle of hay on them, which was on them at 9 o'clock the night before, when the carts were loaded and ready to go to London—I took the sacks of hay in my possession, and have had them ever since under lock and key.</p>

               <p>the prisoners came home about 9 o'clock the next night—I waited till they came home, and took them—I handcuffed them together, and took them to the station—they were bailed that night, or the next morning.</p>

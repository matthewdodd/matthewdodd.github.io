I said, I did not care, if they would come in; we went in, and I paid for a pot of beer for them; the prisoner asked me where I had to lie? I said I was a stranger, and did not know; she said, she could get me a good bed for a shilling; I gave her a shilling, and she took me to a room; when we came into the room, she said, soldier, are we not to have something to drink? I said, I did not care; what would she have? she said, a drop of gin; and I gave her sixpence to fetch it; when the went for the first, she asked if we should have any more? I then gave her a shilling, and she gave it to the other woman; she then came by me, and snatched hold of the chain and pulled the watch out of my pocket; I made a catch at it, and got hold of the seal thinking to recover the watch, and this (producing the seal.) broke off; there were two sixpences hanging to the chain.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the watch? - A. She ran down stairs with it as fast as she could; I ran after her, and, at the top of the stairs, I catched at the watch, and broke the seal from it; I came back into the room to get the candle to go after her, and fell down stairs, and cut my nose.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this? - A. Between seven and eight o'clock; I never saw her again till Mr. Treadway, the constable, sent down to me to come up.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you do when you had lost the watch? - A. I went immediately to Treadway the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after was the woman taken up? - A. The last Sunday but one, this was the 15th of December; Treadway took me to several houses in Drury-lane, to see several sets of them; at one house I saw the prisoner, I knew her immediately; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170010"></xptr>took me to two or three houses in Parker's-lane before we found her.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your sixing on her, she was taken into custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the prisoner? - A. That is her; she said it was a pity a red bugger should ever wear a watch, the sailors ought to have them.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable, I took the prisoner; the watch was not found upon her. The prosecutor came to me, on Tuesday morning, the 16th of December, to Bow-street, to go and take a woman who had robbed him; he took me to No.7, Parker's-lane, and the woman had left the lodging and gone away; I asked him where he was to be found if I found the girl? and he gave me a direction. On Sunday week last I found her, and sent for him; I first took him to a house in King-street, Drury-lane, she was not there; I then went with him to a house in Cross-lane, she lived in the first-floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you aware this was the woman before you carried him there? - A. Yes; the second house we went into we found her; there were three of them sitting at breakfast; the soldier went in and pointed her out as the person; I searched her, there was no duplicate, or any thing, found upon her; she said, how do you think I could rob you? I might as well have taken your guinea and half as the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. She said he had a guinea and half in his pocket? - A. Yes; she said, it was some other girl that robbed him, it was not her; she said he was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Birch.) What money had you in your pocket when you were with this woman? - A. A guinea and a half, and five shillings in silver, and five pennyworth of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the know you had the money? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in liquor, or sober? - A. I was sober enough; I had only had two pots of beer with them.</p>
               <p>Q. You had some gin? - A. Yes; the sixpenny-worth she went for.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Why did not you lay hold of the woman when she robbed you? - A. I got hold of the watch, she got off; I went back to the table for the candle, not knowing the room, and fell down stairs.</p>
               <p> - MUMFORD sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable: I was with Treadway when he took the prisoner; she said, she might as well have taken the guinea and a half as the watch; that he had no business with a watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As I was going down Drury-lane, with another young woman, this man stood at the White Horse; he asked us to go in and drink; we had several pots of beer, and rum and gin; I told the young woman, I must go; she said, she could get him a lodging, and I went away, I was afterwards coming back, and saw the prisoner lying in the street, and a crowd about him; he said, he had lost his watch; there was a soldier with him; they took a guinea and a half out of his pocket, and took him to the watch-house; I know nothing of his watch; he he came to me several times, and said, he would give me a guinea and a half if I would find his watch.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) Were you lying in the street? - A. Yes; it was with falling down stairs; I did not lay above a minute; the watchman took me to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Why were you carried to the watch-house? - A. To take care of me; the watchman said, I might as well go there, and pay a shilling for my bed, as lay any where else; I went and lay there, and paid a shilling for a bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an attorney and solicitor, carrying on business at 3, Finsbury-chambers, Bloomfield-street, London, and reside at 36, Newton-street, Hoxton—the prisoner is my wife—I married her on the 24th December, 1850, in New York City—I was introduced to her at No. 1A, Douane-street—she was not living at that time with her parents, they resided in the country—I afterwards came to England with her, in February, 1851, and continued to live in England with her till 1856—we lived at several different places in London and the country—in 1856 we were living at 39, Grafton-terrace, Kentish-town, that is where this matter occurred—I was absent from my residence, generally speaking, from nine till late in the evening—on the morning this matter happened, I had left rather earlier than usual, about half-past eight, and I did not return at night till about eleven o'clock, that was on the eleventh of July, 1856—when I returned I found no one in the house but a child I had by the prisoner; she was two years and four months old—I lighted a candle, and went out to get some beer for supper, from an adjacent public-house, as I had had no dinner—when I came in I found the prisoner and a person who passes as Mr. Moore, just returned from the street, evidently out of breath, as if they had been running, with neither hats, caps, bonnets, or shawls on—I remonstrated with the prisoner upon her conduct—she became very violent as usual—I</p>

               <p>told her I hoped that now she was a married woman, she would not repeat the conduct she was guilty of before she was married—she then deliberately unbolted the two bolts of the door which communicates with the kitchen, and leads into the wash-house, where there was no light, and returned from the dark into the light room, with something in her hand—I was eating some bread and cheese at the time, and noticed that she had something concealed in the folds of her dress, and from my former experience I imagined that she had a knife—I said to her, "You have got a knife"—I got up with the intention of closing with her to prevent her using it, when she immediately threw something, what it was at the time I did not know, which completely blinded me and caused me much agony—it came from her right hand—it was some burning fluid, which went into my eyes and all over my face and clothes, and burnt my neck and face dreadfully, I could not see anything—I put my head into cold water immediately afterwards—when I recovered, I went in search of a police constable, and brought him in—I saw him take a bottle out of the grate—it was summer time, and then was no fire in the kitchen—Alice Young, who calls herself Mr. Moore, pointed out where the bottle was—Mr. Bailey, the surgeon, came to me—I believe Mr. Moore fetched him—he attended to me—I was confined to my bed for about six weeks—I then used to go down stairs on to the sofa in the middle of the day—I have never been able thoroughly to attend to my business since—it has very much affected my sight—I cannot see at all by sunlight, or any strong light, or by gas—the sight of the right eye it nearly gone—I have never been able to see thoroughly with it since—if I close my left eye I can hardly see distinctly—it was not at all affected before that—my left eye was also affected very much for some time—the liquid went into the side of the left eye, but it went all over the right—I think I was attended by Mr. Bailey for about six weeks, and then, at the recommendation of a friend, I went to the Ophthalmic Hospital, in Gray's Inn-road, and became a subscriber—I am still attending there, and am under the same medical care—I did not go to the police court after I recovered myself, in consideration of the child—I said I would forgive her—the matter was taken before the police court while I was confined to my bed, but I said if she would behave herself better, and let that be a warning to her, I would not press the matter—she came back to the house—I may be allowed to say that we never had any sulphuric acid or other burning material in the house, because we had no saucepans, or coppers, or anything of that kind to clean—I never had bought any, before or since—I believe this indictment was preferred in August—between the time this happened, and the preferring of the indictment, something else happened; she found I was not quite blind with the left eye, and she said, "I have put one eye out, and now I will put out the other," and she called me a d----English son of a b----which was a term she frequently used—that was while I was lying on the sofa—I consulted with Mr. Jones, he is my brother, but I have changed my name, by the Queen's license, on coming into some property—this indictment was preferred, but even after that I said, if she would leave the child with me and go away I would not follow it up—she did go away, and left the child with me—that was in September, 1856—I saw her next on the evening of 7th February, 1857—she came and opened the door to me on my return home, about half past seven or eight in the evening, she then had the child in her arms—my mother was at that time keeping house for me—the prisoner asked me whether I would forgive her altogether, and allow her to return to live with me as my wife—after some demur and long conversation she</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186012170005"></xptr>
               <p>promised to pledge her oath upon the Bible—I told her I could not adminis<lb></lb>ter an oath to her—she said she would be a dutiful wife, and made every promise a woman could make, and then I consented that she should stop—she remained exactly thirteen days—my mother, I ought to say immediately took her departure, because she was frightened at her—at the end of the thirteen days she took herself off, having received some telegraphic despatch from some man or other, and took away with her everything she could lay her hands on, she also took the child—that was not while I was absent—she had packed up everything during my absence—she said she must go to America, and she would take the child to show to her parents, and her brothers, and sisters, and return immediately—I objected and protested against her going and taking the child, but she went—I next saw her on Sunday, 22d August, 1858, and again on the Monday following—I don't know of my own knowledge, whether she remained in England any time then—I next saw her on Sunday evening, 4th November last, under the following circum<lb></lb>stances—a knock came to the door, the servant opened it, and the prisoner flung the door wide open and came into my parlour, accompanied by the same Alice Young—they both conducted themselves in a very improper manner, sitting on the table and using most insulting and degrading remarks to me; she called me every sort of name she could possibly think of—horrible expressions, the usual expressions—she called me a d----English son of b----, half-a-dozen times, and such expressions as that—I requested them to leave quietly, they would not—I then went for a police constable, but he said he could not remove them unless there was some breach of the peace—in the presence of the police constable, I first turned out Alice Young and then my wife—there was a great deal of resistance, but no force was used more than was necessary—she threatened to pay me another visit, and I then gave her notice of this prosecution, I did that on the 7th December.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The last matter you have been detailing was in 1860, was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, last month—I did not say that my wife came back to England on 22d August, 1858—I said I saw her then—I have heard that she subsequently went to America and returned this year, but I do not know it of my own knowledge—when I married her she was eighteen years of age, less twelve days, she did not behave in every respect as a kind wife to me during the early part of her married life; quite the reverse—she did not do all the menial work when we were living in Grafton-terrace in 1852—we were in furnished apartments there, with attendance—it is not true that in consequence of my misfortunes she did the menial work, and even washed her own clothes while we were living there—I have a cousin named Jones of Stonehouse—I struck my wife on one occasion—that was while we were living in Grafton-terrace—I think the blow blacked her eye—I did not make her promise, as my cousin was expected that evening, to say that she had slipped on some orange-peel—I told him all about it, and he said she richly deserved it, and that if I had killed her it would have served her right—that was in 1852, I think; about March—she did not, in consequence of that, go before a magistrate and have me summoned—I mean to say most distinctly that she did no such thing—I can't recollect what she threatened to do, at this distance of time—to the best of my belief she did not threaten to do any thing of the kind—I did not beg her to forgive me that time, and say I would never do so again—you are mixing up another transaction altogether—I never struck her but once—she assaulted me on another occasion very severely indeed, and to protect myself from her violence I laid hold of her to keep her down, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186012170008"></xptr>
               <p>on that occasion she threatened to take out a summons, but I do not know whether she did so—I am not sure whether I was served with a summons or not—I do not recollect being served, but I know I did not appear—to the best of my belief the matter was only talked about—to the best of my belief I will swear that I was not served with a summons—I think I dared her to take out a summons—to the best of my belief she did not take it out, but it is more than four years ago, and I will not say postively—there was something at the beginning of 1856—in 1857 I was living at Kingsland—I was arrested for debt then, and confined in the Queen's Bench prison—I was there from September, 1853, to the beginning of February, 1854—during that time she certainly behaved very well, and that was the only time—she behaved remarkably well, and acted as wife ought to do—after leaving the Queen's prison we went somewhere in Southwark, I forget the name of the street; we then removed to 76, Amwell-street—we were living at 39, Grafton-road at the time that a girl named Isabella Stevens was living with us—she was not a servant—she was the daughter of a former landlady, and came more as a companion than anything else—I think she was about ten years of age at that time—my wife never charged me with indecent conduct towards that girl—there is not a word of truth in it; nor was she sent out of the house by my wife upon that; nothing of the kind—my wife was always discharging servants—she never could keep the servants—no servant would stay with her—Mr. and Mr. Moore are not here to-day—I have used every exertion to bring them tare—it was I who introduced Mr. and Mr. Moore to my wife—Mr. Moore was a client of mine—he told me he was thinking of taking a house in our neighbourhood, and would I allow him and his wife to come and reside with us for a few weeks until he could find a suitable house—at that time I believed them to be man and wife—I don't know how many months they lived with us—it was until I found out that Alice Young was not Mr. Moore, and then I gave them notice to quit—they left, I think, the day after the assault I have spoken of—I did not, one night, while they were with me, beat and ill-treat my wife so as to cause her to scream out, and make Mr. and Mr. Moore interfere—she beat me with a bludgeon, and I closed with her to take it away, and then she hallooed out—she went to the window and called out for the police—that was a very common thing for her to do—she would attack me, and then directly she thought I was going to strike her in return, she would call for the police—on the night of this alleged assault, Mr. Moore came home with me—Mr. and Mr. Moore were both present when it took place—they never gave evidence before the Magistrate upon it—I believe they were not called upon—they were there, but Mr. Long was quite satisfied—I was examined upon this charge—I preferred the charge against her in order to get her bound over to keep the peace—that was a month afterwards—she was present when I made the complaint before the Magistrate, and she was bound over to keep the peace—I did not say that I would abandon the charge because I did not believe she knew what was in the bottle, and that she had no intent to hurt me; nothing of the kind—I saw Alice Young on 4th November—I have seen both Mr. and Mr. Moore since—I knew where they were residing, and both myself and clerk and another person also have been there—I saw them both in the early part of this present month—I have not seen them within the last week—I think the 7th was the last time I saw them—my clerk went and served the prisoner with this notice, and I went to find out where Moore was living, as I heard he had faied and was moving—I went to serve him with a notice to appear, and on that night</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186012170009"></xptr>
               <p>I saw them both—I found he was keeping out of the way, and Alice Young has gone away into the country—I have made every possible exertion to subpœna them; three of us have been trying, even as late as this morning—it was a kind of washhouse into which the prisoner went to get the bottle—I believe Mr. and Mr. Moore had a charwoman about once a week—I don't know what her duties were, or what she made use of for the purpose of cleaning things—I understand that it was Mr. Moore who brought the surgeon to me after this occurred, but I could not say—I can't say whether my wife went to get the leeches—Alice Young put them on, and behaved very humanely and kindly—the child was taken to America against my will—I had no control over so young a child—she went away on the evening of 20th February, 1857—she took the child contrary to my wishes—I went with her down to the railway-station at Euston-square, and all the way I was riding in the cab with her I was requesting her to return, and I wrote to her after that, a letter dated 6th March, requesting her to return; I got an answer back on 7th May, refusing to return (<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—this has the prisoner's signature; the other part is in my writing (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 17th February, 1857, and was an undertaking by the prisoner upon being permitted to take the child to the United States, that it should be returned on attaining the age of seven years, and in the meantime she should be brought up in a manner befitting her station and expectations</hi>)—I repented of having consented to that document, and urged her to put an end to the transaction, and let me take care of the child—I did not mind about her going away, but I wanted possession of the child—this letter is in my hand writing (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 6th March, addressed to the prisoner in the United States, expressing the writer's distress of mind at her having left him, and imploring her return</hi>). I still say the child was taken away contrary to my wishes—I could not control her—I regretted her going—she wrote an answer to that letter, refusing to live with me any longer—in 1857 she did return, and appealed to me to forgive her—this letter dated, 8th February, 1857, was addressed by me to Captain Waite, of the ship Enterprise—that was the day she came to my house; and this other letter dated, 14th February, 1857, addressed to Captain Waite, is also in my handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">These letters, being read, contained expressions of thanks to the captain for his care of the prosecutor's wife on the voyage</hi>)—while I was in the Queen's prison I did not deny to the governor that the prisoner was my wife—the deputy-governor ordered her out of the prison, and also a girl who was waiting on me there—that person passed as my wife—this was in August, 1858, when I was there for contempt of court—previous to her return in 1860, I had written to her brother, begging her to return, and I will explain why I did so—I had heard about 4th October, from a brother freemason, that she was dead—I made every possible inquiry, and could not ascertain anything about her, except things which were not pleasant to my ears, and knowing that no straightforward letter would receive an answer from her brother, I wrote a letter for the purpose of eliciting an answer, and I got one both from the brother's wife, and from the prisoner herself—it was such a letter as would elicit a reply—letters had been sent before which were not answered—I did not ask Mr. Miller to write, and try to get my wife to return after I had written that letter—that was in July I believe—there was another letter sent—when she came back to my house I was living in Newton-street—she found me living there with another woman, and with two or three children—the woman was passing as my wife—I turned the prisoner out into the street on that occasion myself.</p>

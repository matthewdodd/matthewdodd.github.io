               <p>o'clock in the morning, I received four packages of meat from Wimborne—I opened one of them and found it in a very bad state—it was not fit for human food—I immediately called in the inspectors of the market, Messrs. Newman and Fisher, to see it—on opening one of the packages I found this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is in the defendant's writing—I have had letters from him—<hi rend="italic">The letter contained the following</hi>, "I do intend to sell some more beef this week, but you must not let the old man see this, for it is a bad job for me"—Mr. Pocklington, the former inspector, is dead—he was an old gentleman, and an old man is referred to in this letter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the inspectors of meat at Newgate Market—on 20th February I was called to inspect this meat—it is totally unfit for human food—Mr. Newman also inspected it—all four packs were taken before the Alderman, and ordered to be destroyed—it is all one animal—it is the carcase of a cow, which is a very poor one, and diseased.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could it have become unfit for food in the course of it's journey from Wimborne? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was a diseased animal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. Gentlemen of the jury,—This bullock was my own, and I gave 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it; it was healthy, and as sound as any animal in the world. I put it out to feed, and it jumped a ditch and broke its knees. I dressed it as quickly as possible, took it next day to the station, sent it to London at 10 o'clock in the morning, and it arrived at London at 7 o'clock the following evening; whether being twenty hours on the journey made any difference, I cannot say. Mr. Newman has been down twice and inquired into the circumstances. The bullock was four years of age.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). It was a cow—all four quarters were in a diseased state—the hind quarters were as bad as the fore—it died chiefly from lung disease—it was in a very poor state and wet—if the animal had not been diseased it would not have been wet—I have had twelve years' experience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">NEWMAN</hi>. I have been inspector of meat six years—I saw this heifer—it was very badly diseased—it had been dead, I believe, about two days—it looked much worse than it would if it had been skinned at the time the accident happened—it was wet—it would not be so wet from having died as from disease—I would not allow meat to be exposed at the market if I had known that it died by accident, or naturally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Not if it died from an accident? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not unless it had been bled and properly dressed by a butcher before it got cold; but it was not found for some hours after death—where the blood has set into the meat we should not allow it to be sold—this had never bled at all—the state of the animal was both from its not having been bled and from disease combined—it was most decidedly diseased.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The blood being kept in it would, of course, give it a very different appearance; we seldom see meat with the blood in it: which might lead us to believe that it was diseased. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would not lead the in<lb></lb>spectors of meat to think so.</p>

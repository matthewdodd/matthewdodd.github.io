                  </hi>. I live in Lawrence-street, St. Giles's. Mr. Thomas Peckham Grout lives there—I had the care of that house for him—it is a lodging-house—the prisoner lodged there—on the 21st of December, I made the beds and locked the doors, as usual, about four o'clock-about seven o'clock, a lodger came and asked me if I was aware that a second<lb></lb>floor room was open—I went up and found four beds stripped, and some things lying on the floor—I missed the articles stated, which are the pro<lb></lb>perty of Mr. Grout—I sat in the shop to receive the money from the lodgers—the prisoner passed and repassed me three times that evening—he said it was very cold—about seven o'clock he went out, and called his dog to follow him, but it would not go—the prisoner then went out, and I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>

About eight o'clock in the evening of the 21st of December, I saw the prisoner in Monmouth-street, with something under his arm—I asked what he was doing—he said, "Trying to buy some rags"—I took him, and in going to the station-house, he said, Would I let him go?—I said, "No"—he said I should be sorry for it, as he should be transported—I found on him these six sheets and a blanket—the name of Grout is on them,—he told me he lodged at Grout's, where the property was taken from.</p>

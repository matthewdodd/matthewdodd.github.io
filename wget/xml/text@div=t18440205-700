                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and lodge in Tite's-alley, Narrow-street, Limehouse. On Saturday night, the 3rd of February, I was in several public-houses—I am not aware that I fell asleep in any of them—the first thing I recollect, was being confined in the Thames police-station, where I awoke of my own accord some time in the morning—the last thing I recollect before that was being at Seeley's tavern in Whitechapel-road—I cannot say what time it was—I know I had some money, because I put four half-crowns into my watch-pocket—I had them safe.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Gloucester-terrace, New-road. I saw a crowd that night in Turner-street—I went to look, and saw the prosecutor lying in the snow, drunk—a woman was standing over him, and said he was her husband—the prisoner came forward, and another man with him, and two or three women—the other man said to the woman, "Do you belong to the sailor?"—she said she did not—the man then said, they bad as much right to the sailor as she had, and they began to rub his ears to revive him, and to lift him from the ground, but it was perfectly useless, he could not stand—I saw the prisoner put his hand into the sailor's pocket, and I heard money rattle, but I did not see him take anything out—I went for a policeman—I was gone about two minutes, and when I came back I found the prisoner in the same place where he had been—he was charged with rob<lb></lb>bing the sailor—he said he had not.</p>

I went with Mr. Daniels—I saw the prisoner and the sailor—he said, he had not robbed the sailor—I took him to the station—he attempted to escape, and said he would go no further—he bad said previously that all he had about him was 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—in going along, he said he might have 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 5 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but he was sure it was not more than 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I found a half-crown, a sixpence, and six pence on him—the prosecutor's right hand pocket was turned inside out.</p>

On the 3d of May, in consequence of suspicion, I examined my cellar, and found three paper bags of flour concealed in a rat-trap - the prisoner had just gone out with bread, and I had seen him come from the cellar - he came in, and went into the cellar, came up, and went out. I went down, and found one of the bags gone. I followed him into the street, took his hat off, and found it there. He fell on his knees, and begged forgiveness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. When did you miss any flour - A. I did not miss it; the three bags weighed 11 lbs.; it was all in one trap. I did not give him in charge until next day, as I could not spare him; it had no business in his hat - if it was for a customer, it should be in his basket - he confessed that he had put the bags into the trap. I thought well of him before.</p>

               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character.</p>

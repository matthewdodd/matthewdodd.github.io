I am a Custom House officer—on 1st January the vessel Poonah was unloading in the Victoria Docks—the prisoner was helping—I saw a case landed in a slip, and noticed that it had been broken—on examination a box of cigars was missing—I went on board and into the hold, where I saw the prisoner—I asked him if he had sent a case ashore in a broken state, he said "If you want the cases you will have to go to the other side of the ship;" pointing where other men were at work—I said that I wanted one that was in a broken state, and seeing His coat, I said "Does this coat belong to you?"—he said, that it did—I searched, and found 65 cigars similar to these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had previously told the foreman to make each man produce his coat, the prisoner did not do so, and the foreman said <hi rend="italic">"Bill</hi>, it is your coat, you may as well own to it"—he made no reply to that—I took him ashore, and before my superior officer the prisoner said that someone must have put the cigars into his pocket while he was at dinner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I have been working on the Peninsular and Oriental Company's boats for some time. I went on board the Poonah on 1st January. We are only allowed twenty minutes to dinner, and never think of putting on our clothes, as it takes five minutes to get out of the hold. One of the boxes happened to be broken. The Custom House officer asked me if I had seen the packages; I said there were some amidships. He then asked me for my coat—I pulled it down, and the cigars rolled out. I was then taken in custody and charged. If I had wanted the 'cigars I could have taken them away at breakfast or dinner time.</p>

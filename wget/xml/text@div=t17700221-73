               <p>Q. What time of the evening?</p>
               <p>Waters. It was about half an hour after seven. I put my hand on my horse, which was at the door; I missed my saddle. I saw nobody there. The boy said. There has nobody gone along the street; whoever took it must be gone over the bank. We went over the bank; there the prisoner was lying. We took him before Justice Girdler, and he was committed.</p>

            . On the 12th of this instant I had a basket of oysters on my head. Going by I saw a man take the saddle from the horse, and fling it over the bank, and jump over after it. I will not undertake to say the prisoner is the man; he is much like him. It was dark. I observed he had a handkerchief on his neck, and his knee-strings untyed, and his hat stapped.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in High-street, Shadwell. The prisoner and another man came into my shop on the 29th of October—he asked me if I would cash an advance note for him—it was a note for a month's advance wages—the other man gave me the note—I did not know him—they looked out clothing to the amount of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave them 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. cash—the note was for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is the note.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I ask you to cash the note? did not you ask me if I would have it cashed? and did not I tell you that I was going to a woman who always cashed my notes? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. He and the other together asked me to cash the note, and afterwards the prisoner said an old woman would cash it, and give him all the money for it—both of them came in together, and the other one asked me to cash the note—the prisoner said he had a note also, but he would get an old woman to cash his note—he did not show me any note—he helped to look out the things and bargained for them—when I asked the price, he said it was too much, and beat me down for most of my clothes—I was to take the clothes on board the ship next morning, but I could not find such a ship; and have got them now—the clothes were to fit the other man; and the other man had the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave me the cheque.</p>

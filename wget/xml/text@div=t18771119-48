                  </persName>—on the evening of the 13th October I went out in the garden and found my cashmere jacket, and I came back and told my servant about it—I went upstairs and then I missed my sealskin jacket, my best black silk skirt, and crape jacket—I rang the bell for the prisoner—I told her what I had lost, and she said she didn't know I kept my things there—she told me that when she came in she found the gate open, and also the back door—that was about 8.45—I went out in the garden again and found my waterproof cloak—on Sunday, the 14th, I communicated with the police, and on the morning of Monday, the 15th, the prisoner went out, and told me she was going to meet her uncle, and about dinner time she returned and asked to speak to me—I went upstairs after I had had my dinner, and she told me she had seen her uncle, and wished to have a policeman to search her boxes, but she did not care to have a policeman if I would look into her boxes—I said I didn't wish to do so, but as her uncle wished it, and she was so pressing, if she liked to turn out her boxes she could—she did, and I did not see anything belonging to me—I had not said anything to her that I know of, to intimate that I suspected her—her uncle used to come and see her nearly every day, and used to write to her nearly every day—she left on the Monday, and on the Tuesday week I went down to 3, Ravensbourne Street, Deptford, and in my presence and in the presence of the prisoner her room was searched, when my black silk skirt, picked to pieces, my cashmere dress, cut up shamefully, and also my cashmere jacket were found. (<hi rend="italic">William Barry, Detective, produced the articles</hi>.) This is the black silk skirt—I have the body on—these are all my trimmings, every one of them—I have no doubt about the articles—the black silk jacket was deeply trimmed with crape—in the first place it was deeply trimmed with silk—this sealskin jacket is mine—the sleeves" are just as I turned them up, because they were too long for me—when I took her to the pawnbroker's to identify some of the articles, she told me that she did not take them, but she knew who had—she told me she would give me the clothes, but they were all destroyed.</p>

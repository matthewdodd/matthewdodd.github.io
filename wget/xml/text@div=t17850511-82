               <p>What did the prisoner say about the contents of that note? - Nothing further respecting the the note, than the requesting the money.</p>

               <p>When he gave you the note, what did he say it was? - He said it was a note for a case of glass.</p>
               <p>Did he say whether that note contained an account of what the case contained? - He told me it did, when he brought the case again, he said that was the case.</p>
               <p>Did he say where he brought it from? - He did not, I looked at the direction, and paid him the money directly, I believe he was not in the house a minute, he went away; on the Monday following, the 28th I was sent for to the Saracen's Head, he was there, and afterwards he was taken to the King's Arms, and a case was opened, and there was rubbish and dirt in it, he said he knew nothing about it, I asked him why the glass was not in, he said, he could not tell, he went to the Saracen's Head with the constable, and two other boxes were opened there, and they contained nothing but rubbish and dirt, and he was taken to the Compter.</p>

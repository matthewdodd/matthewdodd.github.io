                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Painter, a soldier, of No. 12; Grey coat-street, Westminster On 21st Nov., about half past 8 o'clock, I and Catherine Clarkson were going down Victoria-street, Westminster, and I observed the prisoners behind us—I am sure of them—my friend said that she had no money—I said that I had half a sovereign, which I would change and lend her some—I put it into my mouth from my hand as I was putting my gloves on, and I heard one of the prisoners, the little one, say, "Give her the foot," and directly the big one ran his head into her breast, and she fell—I do not know whether he did anything with his foot—he knocked me on the side of the head and knocked me down, and the little one kicked me on the hip when I was down—I screamed "Police!" and "Murder!"—they felt my pockets, but I had nothing there but a key, and 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I have been lame ever since, but cannot tell whether from the fell or the blow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Clarkson, of No. 10, Co burg-road, Westminster. I was with Mrs. Painter, going along Victoria-street—she asked me if I had any money—I said, "No"—she said that she would let me have what I required, as far as a shilling or two, and said, as loud as the rest, that she had a half sovereign in her mouth—J thanked her, but did not take the money—I said, "Do not change it, because when I get home I shall get some"—I observed some people behind us, and the big man bent his head, hit me on the breast, and knocked me down—I could not get any breath for several minutes, and then saw Mrs. Painter lying in the road, screaming "Police!" and "Murder!"—I was knocked down first, I saw the men run away—the prisoners are the men—I had not seen them before, but am sure of them both.</p>

Q.</hi> Where did you come from, just before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From my home, straight along Strut ton-ground and the Broadway, then into Victoria-street, and towards the Abbey—I met Mrs. Painter in the street, just by the brewery, before we got into the road—I had been washing, and Lad nothing but tea to keep up my spirits, I cannot afford anything else—I was knocked down by his making a rush at me with bias head, he was not trying to kiss me, they never spoke to us—neither of us tried to slap the face of either of the prisoners.</p>

I heard a female scream "Murder!" and "Police!" and within twenty yards of the place saw Chapman running five or six yards in front of Thompson—Thompson said, "Run, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>"—I was in plain clothes, but was well known to Thompson for years—I laid hold of Chapman by the collar, but through the force of his running he broke away from me and went down Pie-street where I took him, and Thompson tried to rescue him—assistance came up, and they were both secured—I got assaulted and kicked about the legs—after I had taken the charge at the station I saw Mrs. Painter take half a sovereign from her mouth, which she showed to me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector, B</hi>). In consequence of information, I went to 60, Upper Seymour-street, on 28th May, last—Mr. Mirehouse lives there—I found the prisoner living there as cook and housekeeper—I asked her if her name was Sarah Gough—she replied, "Yes"—I then said that I had received information that she had been recently delivered of a child, which child had been found at Clewer, in Berks—she hesitated for some little time and then said, "This is most extraordinary"; you are quite right; I hope you are not going to take me away to night"—I then suggested that some of the other servants who had cleaned the room should be called up—she said, "You need not do anything of the kind; there is no one knows anything of it but myself"—I then asked to see her boxes—she said they were up stairs in her bedroom—I then accompanied her to the bedroom, with the Inspector of the Berks police and the butler—when I got into the room I asked her if any one else slept there or occupied the room but herself—she said, "No,"—I saw several boxes in the room—I asked her if they were her's—she said they were—I then searched them—I found in a cupboard a cotton dress partly saturated with blood; I also found several napkins with blood on them—she then said that she wished to speak with me alone—I asked the others to withdraw; after they left the room she said, "I wish to tell you all about it: the poor little dear was bom alive about twenty minutes to 6 on Wednesday last; I saw it move after I came back into the room; I was absent from the room about twenty minutes; I tell you candidly it just moved, and I wrapped it up in a cloth, and not one soul but myself knew anything about it: I was taken suddenly ill, and in about twenty minutes the poor little dear was born; it was born on the 23d; I had a cab the following day, and took it to the Gloucester coffee-house, Oxford<lb></lb>Street, and booked it to the place"—the place, I suppose, where it was found—I took down this statement of her's to refresh my memory, and I asked her if she had any objection to sign it—she did so—it was voluntary on her part.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Thomas Pickford and another. On the 5th of May, I was at the Camden Town station, and assisted in putting three trusses from Leicester into the wagon, of which Daniel Stokeley was guard—I had this invoice, (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>,) and found it correct—one of the two trusses in this lower entry was afterwards missed—this pencil mark on the invoice signifies that they were all safe—I gave this to Stokeley—he left the station at quarter-past one o'clock on Thursday morning.</p>

Morly, Wood-street"—I weighed the one I did receive of these two, and it was two quarters and some pounds short—the wagon got to the basin between two and three o'clock—Nelson-place is about a quarter of a mile from the basin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the 54th regiment of foot. On the morning of the 6th of May I was in company with Adams, another private—he had a girl with him—he was before me with her—I was going along Sudley-street, that leads to Nelson-place, and from there to the City-road—as I was going along I saw a woman, and the prisoner in her rear, coming from the City-road—the prisoner had two small parcels under his arm, and one in his hand—when I came up the woman said, "Here is some person coming"—there was a small lane at his right hand—he wheeled down this lane, but before he wheeled he dropped these packages—he dropped two first, and then dropped one—I picked up one, to see what it was—he went on a little further, and it appeared to me that he went into a house—that lane is the first turning on the right-hand in going down Nelson-place from the City-road—I went on after Adams, called him back, and told him what was going on—he went on with his woman—I went on, and applied to the policeman—I gave him a description of the person who dropped the packages—I after that found a truss in Nelson-place—the prisoner must have passed near that package in coming along —saw the truss about half-an-hour after—I saw the prisoner when he was taken by the policeman—I am sure he is the man that dropped them—it was as bright as day—I have no doubt about him—I saw him again in half-an-hour.</p>

               <p>on the night of the 16th of November, there was a fire next door—I had a basket, containing the articles stated, in a drawer in a desk in the first floor sitting-room—shortly after the alarm of fire, I was taken to my fa<lb></lb>ther's, and do not know what happened after—several neighbours and friends came to the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and am the prisoner's brother. I was with him at this fire, on the 16th of November—before we went there, we had been to the Three Doves, in Berwick-street, to a meeting for the benefit of infirm members of our trade, and my brother were in the chair—we left there about ten minutes to twelve o'clock, and were going home to our father's—as we got to the corner of Argyle-street, he said he should like some a-la-mode beef—we went and had some—as we were just finishing our supper, a policeman came to the door, and said there was a fire in Glasshouse-street—my brother said we might be of some as<lb></lb>sistance,</p>

               <p>and we went down with the policeman on duty, and got then just as the persons were running out in their night-clothes—the fire had no assumed a very serious appearance, and there was an engine directly opposite the house—we both stationed ourselves at the engine, but there was no water to be got—the fire at last burst out, and it being an oil and colour shop, the inflammable materials burst from the window—I saw a soldier go into the prosecutor's house, which was the adjoining house—the doors of the prosecutor's shop were thrown open, and I saw a soldier rush into the house—my brother went from my side, and went in after him—I followed, and there was not two paces between us—no question were asked, on my oath—when they got in, they began pulling down all the property there—he did the best he could to save the property—the first thing he took out was a piece of bacon—I heard him say in the shop, "Are there any lives in danger up stairs?"—I afterwards heard a cry up stairs—I stood up on the counter, and began taking things off, and the policeman and others took the property out, and ran with it to the other side of the street, the flames rendering it necessary to go that way—the policeman said to me, "Keep throwing the property into the hall of the house"—I turned, and saw my brother in custody—I heard him say, "I will give it to the master"—he had the ladle in his right hand—he was right opposite the prosecutor's house—I saw a gentleman in a M'Intosh coat expostulate with the policeman for taking him—he was going to where the rest of the property was placed—I know he was about to go to France—he has been talking of it these two years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a publican, and lived on Ludgate-hill at the time, but have sold my business since. I saw the prisoner and two police<lb></lb>men holding his collar—he was close to the spot where the property which had been saved was deposited—close to the curb.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received an excellent character.)</p>

               <p>observe on—this coat which I have on now I had on at the time—it is a small dress coat—one pocket is outside, and that was the pocket I put the spoons into—the other pocket is inside, in which I might have carefully concealed the property, but I did not want to conceal it—I took the larger plate in my hand with the other property—my Lord, the inward monitor I bear brings me through this dreadful calamity, and an honest heart, which you find since my childhood I have borne—if I am convicted, I trust my God, and the inward monitor I carry, will bear me through it; and if not, I go forth into the world again an honest man and free, free as the dew that touches the mountain top—I am innocent, thank God, I am innocent, and I leave the fate of an innocent man in your hands.</p>

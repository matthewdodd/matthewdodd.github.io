            . I am the wife of John Reed. On the 10th of October I saw the prisoner in a blacksmith's shop, where our poney was being shoed; I sent my daughter there; she had the shawl on, and I saw the prisoner with it in his hand in the shop - my daughter came home without it; she and my husband went afterwards for it.</p>

On the 10th of October, I saw Mary Reed about half-past eight o'clock, and about half-past nine I saw the prisoner at the corner of Warwick-place, and asked what he had done with she with the woman's shawl? he said "I sold it for 2s., on Saffron-hill;" and next morning he told me he had bought a cup with one shilling of the money; he sometimes blows the bellows at the smiths'.</p>

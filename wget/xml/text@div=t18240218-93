On the 13th of December the prisoner called on horseback, and hired a chaise for two days, to fetch his wife from Brentford; he was to send a horse for it next morning, between nine and ten o'clock; he went away, and next morning a man came with a horse, at the time appointed, and took the gig and harness.

            . I am servant to Mr. Young. The prisoner is the man who came and hired the chaise for two days, to take his wife to Brentford, and said he would send for it next morning; and next morning a man brought a small sorrel horse for the gig - I believe it to be the same the prisoner rode when he called. The harness and gig were delivered to the person who came - he gave the name of Turner, not Young.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How was the Gentleman dressed - A. In a drab great coat; he said his name was Turner, and he would send his man for it.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 12th of February I apprehended the prisoner; he denied knowing anything about it.</p>
               <p>MR. YOUNG. When the prisoner was taken, he said he knew nothing of me; but when I persisted in the charge, he called me aside, and said he had a horse which he would sell, and make it all right with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not tell him it was of no use to deny it, for you should charge him before the Justice - A. Yes; I said nothing to induce him to say what he did.</p>
               <p>Defence Defence. I never saw the prosecutor till he was at the office, and never was in his shop.</p>

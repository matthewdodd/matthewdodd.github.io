                  </hi>. I live in Davies-street, Berkeley-square. The prisoner was employed by me on the 22nd of May to repair a pair of trowsers—I am a tailor—while he was there I gave my daughter a bag, containing four sovereigns, six shillings, and a sixpence, to take care of it till I came up stairs—she is fourteen years old—I told her what the bag contained—I was down about live or six minutes, and when I came up the prisoner was gone—he had finished his job, but I had not paid him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I have not seen the bag or money since.</p>

He gave me a bag to take care of—it contained four sovereigns, six shillings, and sixpence—I put it on the table, where I was washing the breakfast things—the prisoner was in the room—he called another young man, and made use of a bad expression, because the young man wanted to wash himself before he went—the other young man was in the room when the prisoner was there—when the prisoner left I looked round and missed the bag.</p>

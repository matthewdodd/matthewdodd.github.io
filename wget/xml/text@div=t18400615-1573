                  </hi>I am the master of Lee, and live at Manor Cot<lb></lb>tage, Harrow-road. I kept the Tavistock Hotel, Covent Garden, for thirty years, and was formerly waiter there—the prisoner was my cook at Manor Cottage—Ward was my groom—on Monday morning the 27th of May, the constable came to my house and gave me information, in consequence of which I asked Lee if she had seen any body—I did not speak to her before the officer came—I will not swear I did not tell her she had better tell the truth—I might have said, "Tell the truth, did you give the man the bread and meat? "—I have examined some bottles of wine and brandy,</p>

"—she said, "Yes, I have"—I said to her, "What time did you see him? "—she said, "About three o'clock this morn<lb></lb>ing"—she said she had given him the things—she denied having given him the eggs, the wine, or the brandy—here is a whole loaf that she said she had given him, and the other things.</p>

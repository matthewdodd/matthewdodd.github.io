                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate girl. On the 26th of No<lb></lb>vember I met the prisoner—he asked me to go to a house, and we went to King David Fort, which is a receiving house—we were shown to a room—I put my shawl and collar on the back of a chair, and my bonnet I had in my hand—he offered me sixpence, I would not let him stay with me for that—I was putting on my bonnet at the looking-glass, and he walked out with my shawl and collar—I ran after him, but did not see him—this is my shawl (<hi rend="italic">looking at one.</hi>)</p>

At half-past one o'clock that night, I saw the prisoner running down High-street, Shadwell, with this shawl under his frock—I ran after him, stopped him, and asked him what he had got—he said, what he had got was his own—I insisted on seeing it—and he then said he had got a shawl—that he had been home with a girl who had robbed him of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he took her shawl—I found the pro<lb></lb>secutrix—she did not admit that she had taken 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of him—the prisoner admitted at the station that he had taken the shawl and run away with it—he was perfectly sober.</p>

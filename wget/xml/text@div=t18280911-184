I went to the warehouse to carry home my work on Tuesday, the 22d of July - I went out between three and four o'clock; I locked my door, and had the key: I returned between six and seven in the afternoon - the prisoner lived in the kitchen of the house I live in; I went up stairs when I came home, went to unlock my door and almost fell in, because the door was open; I am sure I had locked it when I went out - it appeared to me to have been broken open; I saw my things scattered about - I went to my box and found it had been broken open, and every thing gone out of it; I missed my gowns and my cloak - I went down to the prisoner and said "Mr. Rowley! Mr. Rowley! what shall I do, the door is broken open and I am robbed?" he said "Don't be frightened, and make a piece of work, and perhaps I can tell you where your things are;" he said this in the passage: I then went into his room, and his little girl said "Father, Hannah has brought down a pretty red cloak;" I said "There were some gowns, do you know where they are?" the prisoner then desired her to give them to me, and she gave them to me from under the bed in the room: I said "Mr. Rowley,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110109"></xptr>there was a trifle of money in a Christmas box;" he said"Don't make yourself uneasy about the money, I will make good every farthing that has been taken from you" - I had lost about eight half-crowns; I told him to be sure, that if he would give me the things, I would forgive him - that was after I had got the things, and when I was talking about the money - he did not offer to give me the money, but said he would make it good to me; I then went up to my own place.</p>

            . I am a licensed victualler, and live in Shoreditch. I have known the prisoner from five to six months, by his coming to my house - he is a labourer and a watchman at the Excise-office. Between nine and ten o'clock one evening, he came to me, and brought twelve half-crowns, and said "Mr. Grove, I wish you would take care of these for me;" "Very well (said I) do you know how many there are?" he said "Never mind, I will be back in ten minutes:" when he came back I said "Do you know how many there are?" "Not exactly" said he; said I there is 30s.: I cannot form any judgment when this was- I think I heard of this woman being robbed the next morning, but there was no inquiry about the half-crowns for several days; I had never received any money from him before - the prosecutrix lives about half a mile from me; I do not know what the prisoner's wages are - I have heard from him that he is paid every half quarter, but I do not know.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable of Bow-street. I have two gowns, a petticoat, and a cloak, which I got from the prosecutrix; I believe on the 22d of July, at her house - I was sent down there, with Brown from Worship-street, in consequence of the robbery; I broke into a room, which was said to be the prisoner's, and there I saw two little children, seven or eight years old; one of them began to cry, and the other said something, but the prisoner was not present - I then went up to the prosecutrix's room, and got these clothes; I saw some marks on her door and on the door-post, but did not look at her box- this was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer of Worship-street. I went to the house, with Rierdon, on the night of the 22d of July; we broke open the lower room door - there was nothing found there: Rierdon went up stairs, but I staid about the door, in case the prisoner should be concealed there - I went again the next day, and found this screw-driver in the prisoner's room, and this old trowel; the prosecutrix's son was with me at that time - I have tried this trowel and screw-driver with the impression on the door and door-post of the prosecutrix's room, and they correspond exactly; I found a small trunk in the room, and this trowel exactly corresponded with the impression on the front of it - the prisoner was taken on the night of the 22d, and delivered to me on the 23d; I believe he was taken about ten o'clock that night, but I was not present - I did not see these things in the room the first night, but the room was in a shocking state with filth and rubbish.</p>
               <p>FRANCES CUSHION re-examined. These things are all mine; these are my gowns and cleak - I gave them to the officer; he asked me for them - he asked if these were the things that were taken; I said they were - I am sure they were in my room when I went out to carry my work home- they were in the box, and the box was locked; I saw them in the box when I went to put on my things to go to the warehouse - I went to the Police-office the next day; I could not just then tell how much money I lost, but I look upon it I had about 2l. very near, but in my fright I could not tell exactly what I had - I had at the rate of 2l., but I am no scholar and cannot reckon.</p>

             re-examined. Q. How soon after did you hear of the prisoner's being in custody? A. I have a letter which I received from him, (I believe about a week after I received the money,) saying that he had been taken up, and desired me to send him 10s. by his friend Broadhurst, which I did, and here are the other half-crowns - I believe he has two children.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at work at the Londondocks on the 22d of July - about half-past six o'clock I came home; I had not been in the house a minute when the prosecutrix came down, and said "I have been robbed" I said "God bless me, who could rob you:" "O dear," said she, "I am robbed" - "Let us go up stairs and see," said I; we went up, and I said "God bless me, you have been robbed," but I did not notice the door - we came down to the middle room, where there are two old women- I asked them if they saw any man go up stairs, they said No - I said "It is very odd you sit here, close to the door, and not hear anybody go up stairs:" my little girl looked out at my room door and said "Father, there has been three men up stairs," and I said to the old ladies, in the middle room, "There, don't you hear what Hannah says, that there has been three men here" - she said she did not hear it; I came down, and said to my girl "Go and fetch West, the officer, and I will have my room searched"- as soon as she was gone, my youngest daughter, who is six years old, said to me "Father, Hannah has brought down a red cloak, and it is under the bed;" I said "Get it out," she brought out the cloak and the gowns from under the bed, and gave them to Mrs. Cushion; and then she said she wanted some money; I asked what money - she said she had some money in a leather bag in a box, but that I never saw; I said "Don't make yourself uneasy, my pay-day is coming, and I will pay you every farthing she has taken from you."</p>
               <p>COURT to FRANCES CUSHION. Q. Did you point out the prisoner's room to the officer? A. Yes - that was the room he lived in; the little girl did not bring in any cloak while I was there - she took it from under the bed.</p>

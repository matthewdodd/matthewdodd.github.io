                  </hi>. I live at 15, Pembroke-place, Vauxhall-road, and am the accountant and manager of the Pembroke Loan Society, which is held at the Forester's Arms, Vauxhall-bridge-road. On 2nd April I received this application (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for a loan of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for twelve months, by John Pennington—he offered as security Mr. Fearns, of 3, Grey Coat-street, Horseferry-road—I made inquiry about Mr. Fearns, and was satis<lb></lb>fied with his security—I called on him, but did not see him—I called three times, the two first by myself, and the third with a policeman out of uniform—after I had made the inquiry, the prisoner called, and asked if I was satisfied with Mr. Fearns' respectability—I told him yes, but I had not seen him; that if I could get an appointment with Mr. Fearns, and see him sign the promissory-note, he should have the money—I had then called twice on him—two or three days after that the prisoner called at my house, and asked if Fearns had been—I said he had not—he said he expected he would have called as he was going out of town that evening, and had promised to call on me on the way to the railway, he would go and endeavour to meet him, and send him as quickly as possible—he then left, and in about three minutes a person called, said he was Mr. Fearns, and signed the note, "James Fearns," in my presence—this is the note—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I wrote it out, and he signed it—two or three minutes after that, Pennington came and asked me if Mr. Fearns had been—I told him he had—he asked if he had signed the note; 1 said, "Yes," and he said he supposed he could have the money—I said I should have to go to the treasurer for the money, I was in a hurry then, and I should be ready for him on the following morning—he said he could not come the following morning, and pressed me to let him have it that night—I said if he could not come the following morning, he must say the morning after that—he came that morning—I had made inquiry in the interim, and told him as I had not seen Mr. Fearns at his house, it was considered necessary I should call and see him there, and ask him if he had signed the note, and he had better accompany me—he said "Very well," or something to that effect, and I went there with him—we saw Mrs. Clarke, the servant, and I asked if Mr. Fearns was there—she said, "Yes"—I asked if I could see him; she asked us into the parlour, where we both went and sat down, and she went up to Mr. Fearns with my message, that I wished to see him—I sent my name up—Mr. Fearns sent down word that he would be much obliged if I would send up my business—I then took the note from my pocket and sent it up to Mr. Fearns; I requested the servant to show it, and ask him to send word down whether it was his signature—I think I sent the form up also—she brought word back that it was not his signature; upon which the prisoner said, "If it is not Mr. Fearn's signature, he must have authorised some person to write it"—I sent another message up</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185011250081"></xptr>
               <p>to know whether he had authorised any one, and desired the servant to say what she had heard Pennington say—she brought back word that Mr. Fearns had not authorised any one to call on me, or write his name; it was not his signature, and that Mr. Pennington knew he had refused to become his security—I had the note in my hand then, and I think Pen<lb></lb>nington looked at it—I told him he could not have the money, and he asked me for the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he had paid in the first instance as inquiry money—I told him he could not have it, and we separated.</p>

O'BRIEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see him between April and the time this charge was made? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I met him in the street, but did not speak to him—I appeared against him on this change at the Mansion-house last week—I am the manager, accountant, and secretary of the Society—there are six directors, and James Henry Green, who keeps the Forester's Arms, is the treasurer—the interest on a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. loan for a year is five per cent., with 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. discount from the amount—it is repaid by 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. weekly instalments—there is also 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to be paid for the book and register, the cost of the stamp, and the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for inquiry in the first instance—Mr. Green supplies a portion of the funds; I supply a portion, and other parties sup<lb></lb>ply other portions—the whole of the body of this note is my writing—I was present when the man signed "James Fearns, 3, Grey Coat-street"—the note was ready written by me before he came I cannot say whether I took it from a number I had ready written, or whether I wrote it expecting him—the Society is not registered; It has been fourteen or fifteen months in existence—it was 8th✗ April that the note was signed, and it was the 10th when Pennington called, at about nine in the morning—my house is three-quarters of a mile from Mr. Fearns'—after the note was signed, and before the day Pennington called, I went with a policeman to Mr. Fearns—I saw Mr. Fearns—I did not tell Pen<lb></lb>nington on the 10th that I had done so—I did not ask Pennington to sign the note—I think he asked me for it, as I would not give him the money—I gave the money for the stamp, as I am in the habit of doing, and charging it afterwards—the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for inquiry was never returned.</p>

I am a bricklayer and builder, at 3, Grey Coat street, Rochester-row, Westminster, and not Horseferry-road, that is on the other side of the water—I have a little knowledge of the prisoner; he was intro<lb></lb>duced to me in March or April by a person named Franklin—two or three weeks after that, he wished me to become security for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. loan for him, it would do him good—at first I agreed to do so—he afterwards called at my place, but I did not see him; I had left a message for him—I never saw him about it again—I never communicated to him that I had changed my mind—I did not write this "James Fearns, 3, Grey Coat-street," to this note or any part of it, nor did I authorize any one to write it for me—it is not my Christian name—I did not know it was in existence till I saw it—I remember one day when I was up-stairs, a gentleman named Fisher sending his name up—I sent word I could not see him—Mrs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mr. Fearns' servant.

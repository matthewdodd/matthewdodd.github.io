The prisoner came and wanted a lodging; I asked her two-pence, the usual price; she had but five farthings; I agreed to let her lie in the room with me in another bed; I went to bed first, about two in the morning; I waked about seven, and missed my breeches, and the other things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them). When I missed them the prisoner was in bed. I never found any of the things again, only I heard that the prisoner had lodged three guineas in the hands of a publican the next morning.</p>

               <p>I am a publican. The prisoner drank some gin at my bar in the morning; she pulled a black silk handkerchief out of her bosom, and put it in again; presently after she pulled the handkerchief out again loose and cried out, murther, I am robbed! I asked her what she had been robbed of; she said three guineas which she had in her bosom; my maid put her hand down her bosom and found the three guineas, and gave it me to keep for her, as the woman was very drunk; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040048"></xptr> next day she came for half a guinea, and gave the maid five shillings and sixpence, and five shillings to a man who she said stood by or she should have lost it all; that morning the prisoner came in, and said he had lost some money, but did not know who to suspect, as it was in a lodging house; I told him of the money the prisoner had.</p>

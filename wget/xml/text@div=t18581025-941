                  </hi>. I live at 16 1/2, Emmett-street, Poplar—I am a clothier—I don't particularly deal in old coins, but we take more foreign money than we do English. On the morning of 20th August I came down about a quarter before 7 o'clock—I had gone to bed about a quarter or twenty minutes before 12 the night before—I sleep on the premises—I came down to turn off the gas—I locked the front entrance to my warehouse securely myself—the back door was locked by a young woman. On coming down in the morning, I found my counting-house all in disorder—my desk was removed; one of the sea-chests was opened, and all the foreign coin was gone—it consisted of coins of different nations; there was a coin of Henry</p>

               <p>the Fifth, six Mexican sun dollars; there were Russian, Norwegian, Swedish, Prussian, and other coins—I lost about 200 as near as I can tell—I have since seen about thirty of them; they were placed in a sea-chest and locked in—I had always been in the habit of keeping these coins in that chest—there were sixteen other sea-chests beside that one—Thomas Lovesay was in my service from ten to twelve months, but not at the time of the burglary—he had an opportunity of knowing where these moneys were kept, because he was employed by me to take out English money—he always saw me take it from the sea-chest—I think he left me early in June this year—I also lost some India silk handkerchiefs, and a red check Baltic shirt, and about fourteen spun silk handkerchiefs, that is a mixture of silk and cotton, and a silk lawn cap—I did not miss the cap till afterwards; when it was shown to me I immediately recognised it—there was an umbrella found; it was my property, but that I did not miss at the time; it was safe the night before—I found in my counting-house an iron crowbar or jemmy, and a south-wester; they do not belong to me—on discovering my loss, I went to the police-station, and had some bills printed—after the prisoner Dunn was taken, we went to Henry Lovesay's house, and searched a box belonging to him, and in it was a pair of doe-skin trousers belonging to me, and a few foreign coins—I had similar ones in my possession, but I had no marks on them—up-stairs we found five cotton handkerchiefs belonging to me, and we also found a book belonging to me—they all belong to me, but they must have been taken some time before; they were not there the night before—Thomas Lovesay was not at his brother's, but I saw him afterwards, and he acknowledged having taken the handkerchiefs before—the back door of my house was broken open—I have a private entrance at 8, Rodney-place; that had been forced by the means of this iron jemmy—there were five marks on the door, which correspond with this jemmy—that door led first into a lodge, and there was another door which led to the kitchen—there was no door to the counting-house; one room leads to another—the door to the kitchen was not locked, only latched—the exterior door was securely locked the night before, and when a person forced that door, they were into my house and premises.</p>

My neighbour's shop was broken open about a month after that—these handkerchiefs are of an ordinary description, I am quite certain they are my handkerchiefs—I don't think Thomas Lovesay ever bought anything of me but a monkey-patterns; jacket; I don't recollect anything else—these handkerchiefs are all common I had a great number of them—there is a particularity in</p>

               <p>one silk handkerchief, but the others are the same as other patterns I have got; but I am sure they are mine, they were in the shop window, and laid at the bottom of the window, and were frequently trodden on in putting other things in the window—I have not examined the goods since I was before the magistrate—this is the first time I have said anything about their being in the window—they were the cotton handkerchiefs which were found at Lovesay's—I have no mark to tell me these have not been sold, but my belief—I will swear we never sold those handkerchiefs we found at Lovesay's—when we found them they were all hemmed, but when taken from me they were not; they were all in one piece when taken from me. We found the trousers in Henry Lovesay's box—the five handkerchiefs and book and doeskin trousers do not belong to the first indictment—we have another indictment, which charges Thomas Lovesay with stealing the handkerchiefs, the book, and the doeskin trousers. When I was before the magistrate I did not identify these handkerchiefs and trousers as part of the property I had lost at the burglary—I did not miss those goods then; they were the last things we found—these five handker<lb></lb>chiefs were mine—I suppose these trousers were taken from No. 20 shop, but not on the night of the burglary—I should say I had seen them within two or three months of the burglary—Thomas Lovesay pointed out these handkerchiefs, and owned he took them while in my employ—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week; he did not often pay me something out of that for anything but the jacket; he paid me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for that—I dare say when he bought it it was last winter—he was generally under my eye.</p>

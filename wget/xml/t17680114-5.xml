            . On the third of this instant, about nine o'clock at night, I was walking in Bishopsgate-street, on the right hand side from where the gate stood, towards Shoreditch; I came as far as the corner of <placeName id="t17680114-5-crimeloc40">Artillery-lane</placeName>

During that time I had him in my sight, till I came pretty near the place where he was taken; I then saw two or three more people moving: I cannot say I did distinguish him clearly from them, but presently I lost sight of them all; I continued my run, till I came to the corner of the first turning on the right hand side of Artillery-lane, that is called Petticoat-lane; I said to myself, but I suppose a little loud, I believe I have lost him; there was a young man a little way off said there he is, I believe they have stopt him; then I turned my head towards the other side of the way, on the left hand side, there I saw four, five, or six persons together standing; I went towards them and looked at the prisoner, who was one of them, and knew him to be the man; I said, you are the man that have taken my hat from my head; he said he knew nothing of it; I charged him with it again, he still denied it; I then said, I was sure he was the man, and would charge an officer with him; he said he had no hat besides that on his head about him, and unbuttoned his coat in order to be searched; he had none; I said no matter for that, he was the man, and desired the people to get an officer; there was none to be got; they hustled him back into Artillery-lane, the croud still increasing; during this time the prisoner intreated very earnestly that I would let him go, saying, I beg you would let me go, kneeling on the ground; by the assistance of those about him he was taken to Bishopsgate watch-house, to the care of the officer of the night, in order to appear before my Lord-Mayor the next day; while this was carrying on, I was told by some of the croud that my hat had been picked up by some person in Artillery-lane, and taken into a house; as I was returning home I called at the house (as directed,) of one Mrs. Smith, and asked her if she had taken up a hat; she said she had, and produced it; it was my hat; (produced in court and deposed to.)</p>

            . I live in Artillery-lane; as I was sitting by my own fire-side, I heard a gentleman say he had lost his hat; this was the Sunday before last, about eight or nine o'clock; I did not go to the door at that time; after that I heard a combustion of a great many people talking; I opened my door, there was a coach man said to me, Mrs Smith, there is a hat lying just by that post facing me; I went out and took it up; said he this is the hat that a gentleman says he has lost; I said I will carry it in, and if you see the gentleman send him to me; I delivered it to the prosecutor when he came.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your house from the corner of the lane?</p>
               <p>A. Smith. My house is six doors from the corner.</p>

               <p>Hyams Lazarus. The prisoner is a very regular young man; he makes a point of it never to go out of his father's house without his leave; that evening I went to his father, to ask him leave to let him go out to drink with me; we went to the Admiral Vernon's Head in Bishopsgate-street; going home a gentleman, I suppose it to be the prosecutor, pushed against us; soon after he charged us with pushing off his hat; I said it was but an accident; the gentleman continued scolding and making a noise; I desired the prisoner to go home; then presently stop thief was called, and at length the prisoner was taken to the watch-house; I saw a woman take up a hat as it was lying in the street.</p>
               <p>Lazarus Levi. The prisoner works for my uncle, who is a diamond polisher; I have his indentures here, he has three years to serve; my uncle trusts him with thousands of pounds worth of diamonds to carry out.</p>

            . When I brought the prisoner before my Lord-Mayor this last witness was there, and used Mr. Russel very grossly; I was going to take him into custody; said he if you will say nothing of the matter, I will give you half a crown; he came to me last week, and told me the prisoner came of a very good family, and desired me to let him know where Mr. Russel lived, and said they had money enough, and they would make it up; I thought it not prudent to inform him.</p>

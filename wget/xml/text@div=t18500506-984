                  </hi>. I am thirteen years old, and live with my father, in Bean-street, Leicester-square. On the Wednesday before 15th April I went to Mr. Baldwin's shop to buy some boots—I saw a pair of gaiters lying on the counter, and stole them—I then went to the prisoner's shop, which is a broker's, in Lombard-court, and asked him whether he would buy them—he asked what price they were—I said, "3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he said 2 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was quite enough, and I sold them to him for that—they were <hi rend="italic">bran</hi> new—I was taken into custody on the Sunday.</p>

               <p>Ryder was in the habit of coming to my shop—these gaiters are my property—they were made for a gentleman on the Monday, who paid 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, for them—I afterwards found them at the prisoner's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see the prisoner's wife? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; at first she said she did not know where they were, but she found them hanging up—they were not outside the shop—it was Sunday—I cut them out myself, and the man that made them has worked for me nine years—I am satisfied the prisoner did not know the value of the gaiters—there are many made so as no one can tell their value.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. You are a waterman to a stand of coaches? - I was at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you been before? - A coachman many years, I lived at the Golden Cross before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live before that? - At Mr. Dimsdale's, in Aldersgate-street, before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever live at the Bull and Mouth? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave the Golden Cross? - Because the horses dropped short.</p>
               <p>Q. And what are you a waterman now? - I am discharged from that place because of this business, and another man is put on, because I am obliged to be out of my business.</p>
               <p>Q. You see a man throw this out; did you call out to any body? - The coach<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140007"></xptr>was going on at the rate of eight miles an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out to the coachman? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You made no attempt to catch the man that was in the rumble tumble, but went after the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that in St. James's-square the prisoner offered you a guinea each; now on your oath did not Day and you tell him that if he would give you two guineas each you would let him go, and he offered you one guinea each, and you would not, except he would give you two each? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You chose to go after the man that had the box, in preference to the one that was in the rumble tumble? - I could not see the other man, nor could not have made the coachman hear if I had called.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. In the morning that this happened, I was going as far a Hammersmith, about a house that I was going to take in St. George's-fields, Blackfriars-road; in the Strand as I was going there, I had occasion to cross, and I saw something lay in the middle of the road; I immediately ran towards it, and found it was the box in question; I picked it up, there were four or five people present, one or two will come forward; after I picked it up I returned towards the Strand, to a part where I saw some light, to read the direction, and before I got to the light I was taken in custody by these two men; they asked how I came by that box? and I told them I had picked it up, and they insisted on taking it from me; I said it was not theirs, they did not seem to claim any right that it was theirs, but they insisted on my coming to the coach, and when we came to St. James's-street, there they both stopped with me, and said, if I would give them two guineas, they would let me go about my business; but before that, going along, Hicks said, he would swear it come out of the rumble tumble; when we came to St. James's-square they said if I would give them two guineas a piece I might go, and I offered them a guinea a piece, and they would not without the two guineas, and I said I would not give two guineas; and they took me directly up to the White Horse cellar, and there was the coach that it came from.</p>
               <p>Court to Record. Do you remember how you packed it in this basket? was there a possibility of its tumbling out? - It was impossible for it to tumble out, it was behind another box, stuck in edgeways.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. It must have shook a good deal coming along that way? - It could not have shaked out of its place, it was packed close, there was another box, a light box which was on it, that box was not taken, but there was a trunk taken at the same time, which we never found any thing of.</p>

               <p>in my service—I left home on that day about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and returned about 10 o'clock in the evening—I know the prisoner; he was in my employ about ten months ago for a year and a half, and again last Christmas—he left my service about ten months ago—after leaving my em<lb></lb>ployment he returned at Christmas time for three weeks—Mary Ann Red<lb></lb>kisson was in my employ when the prisoner was there at Christmas time—she came about a month before Christmas—I know a man named Liney—he was in my employ and left in October last; he had been in my employ about sixteen or eighteen months—he and the prisoner were in my employ at the same time—they lived and slept together—I know a man named George Quilteri; I have often seen him at my shop—he came to buy meat, and to deal—he had a butcher's shop of his own—he bought whole carcasses, sheep, he bought wholesale of me—Quilter used to come to my shop while liney and Strugnell were in my employ—I used to keep my money in my bedroom, in an iron box, about two feet six inches long, and about a foot high, and about the same in width—it had two handles, one at each end; it had been painted—I believe it had been in a fire and was scorched a kind of a dark brown—I had that box about a fortnight or three weeks before Christmas, and, if I recollect right, Strugnell assisted in taking it up stairs into my room—I had it while he was with me—it was then my habit to keep my money as I did on 21st April—the kitchen is behind the shop, away from the parlour, on the same floor—the parlour is behind the shop, and behind that the kitchen; it is level, there are no steps—my bed-room is over the shop in front, on the first-floor—when I returned at 10 o'clock on 21st April, I found a large number of persons assembled round my house—when I got indoors I observed a pool of blood in the shop—Mary Ann Redkisson had gone to the hospital, her sister and mother were in the shop—I asked who it was had been injured, and they told me—I did not go upstairs then—I immediately went to the hospital to see the girl; when 1 returned I searched the house, and found that my box, some rings, and jewellery of other descriptions and papers were missing—I found that all my drawers had been broken open, and my desk, and I missed some studs and a number of articles beside the box—there was about 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in the box I should suppose.</p>

                  </hi>. I am about twenty years old—I was in the ser<lb></lb>vice of Mr. Higgins, and had been there for a year or more at the time this matter took place—I was there at the same time when Strugnell was, just before Christmas—on the afternoon of Sunday, 21st April, my master went out about three o'clock, leaving me alone—about 8 o'clock in the evening the prisoner called—I opened the door when I heard the knock—I could see no one; I looked up first one way and then the other, up the street, and I saw Strugnell coming across the road—he shook hands with me, and I said, "La, Fred, who would have thought of seeing you," and he asked me if I was alone—I said I was, but that I expected my master's mother home from chapel every minute—he said, "Can I come in?"—I said I expected her home; and then he said he would not stop long, and I said he must not stop long, and then I shut the door and put the chopper to it as I always did—that is not the chopper I put to the door (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was my habit to fasten the latch with a chopper—it was one with a wooden handle to it, not quite so large as this one—we then went into the kitchen to sit down, and he said he was thirsty—the kitchen is even with the door, out in the yard—I got up and gave him a beer jug—he said he did not want any beer, he wanted gin, so I gave him a white jug, and he went out and shut</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186107080050"></xptr>
               <p>the door after him, and went back into the kitchen again—I thought he was gone some time, and I went to see, if he was coming again, and as soon as I opened the door I saw him coming round the corner—he said, "You need not come to shut the door"—when he came in with the gin I fastened the door again with the chopper, and he and I went into the kitchen where we had been before—he began to mix the gin and water; after that he stayed in the room about five or ten minutes talking to me, I cannot say the time exactly—he then said he should go and see what time it was, because he did not want to stop long—there was a clock in the parlour behind the shop—the parlour, shop, and kitchen, are all on a level, only the kitchen lies in the yard—there is no passage, but the shop door opens into the street—I dare say the prisoner was gone two or three minutes; he was gone quite long enough to open the door—when he came back he brought with him Cassell's Pictorial Bible, which he put on the table, and I looked over the pictures with him; while doing so I heard some boys calling out in the street, which caused me to think the street door was open—I said to the prisoner, "The street door is open, some one has got in; I shall go and see"—he did not make any answer—I took the candle off the kitchen table, and as I was passing I saw the shop door half open; that was the door into the street—at the time I arrived near enough to see that the shop door was open, the prisoner was coming out of the kitchen—I did not hear him—I got out of the room first—when I saw the door open and turned round I did not see him; but I went half way upstairs, and he came behind me and said, "I have got a knife and I will do for you"—I did not look back, because I thought he meant anybody he met with upstairs—the candle was still in my hand, lighted—when he said this it sounded as if he was down at the bottom of the stairs—I did not hear any footseps—I went straight upstairs into my master's bedroom and looked and missed the iron chest, and saw the room all upset—I saw the boxes had all been opened—I did not see the prisoner then—I went downstairs again—while I was on the stairs or upstairs in the room the prisoner did not follow me, and was not with me there—when I got downstairs I saw him by the shop door—when I was half way across the shop, I said, "The place is robbed, I am going to call a policeman"—he then shut the door with one hand, and pointed a knife at me with the other—I saw it in his hand—it was one of these kind of knives (<hi rend="italic">two knives were produced</hi>)—it was a knife like one of these—as soon as he had shut the door he attacked me there (<hi rend="italic">pointing to her arm</hi>), and then I remember no more after that—on receiving the wound I said, "Oh, Fred, don't hurt me, it is Mary; Mary is not going to do, anything to you"—he wounded me there by the wrist (<hi rend="italic">showing it</hi>)—I lost all consciousness after that—when I came to myself I found myself in the hospital—I don't remember anything about what took place afterwards—I have been in the hospital under treatment for some weeks.</p>

I am house-surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital, Gray's Inn-road—Mary Ann Redkisson was brought there on the night of 21st April, about 9 o'clock—she has remained in the hospital from that time to the present—she had a very extensive wound on the nose; it was a lacerated wound, cutting through all the structures of the nose—there was a wound on the right side of the temple, cutting through the bone in an oblique direction, and penetrating the skull—there was another wound on the back of the head, cutting through what we call the outer table of the skull—that only cut through the outer surface of the skull—the other two wounds cut through the bone itself—the one on the side of the temple cut through the whole structure of the bone—there was also a wound on the left wrist and another on the fore-finger of the right hand—the wound on the skull exposed the membranes of the Drain—the wounds on the nose and head I should say would be likely to be produced by a chopper; and those on the finger and wrist by a knife—her life was in danger, and continued so for some time—I am afraid the use of the fore-finger is permanently impaired.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a miller, at Crawley, in Sussex—I was served with a subpoena in the reference, somewhere in the autumn, by Mr. Coutts; he paid me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I attended the reference—he did not pay me anything more before 11th November—I received this post office order for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I presume in this envelope, it is dated 13th November, I don't recollect the date—I don't know when the reference was—I was not before the taxing master—I received this letter at the same time (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the post-mark is dated the 12th, I presume I received it that day—the writing is precisely similar to other letters I have received from Mr. Coutts.</p>

               <p>all the time I was about there—I have no recollection of seeing him—he might have been there—I have no recollection one way or the other; it is a thing I took no notice of.—(<hi rend="italic">Letter read:</hi> "11th November, 1868.

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>).

I had received before—I was not before the taxing master at all—I sent no answer to this letter—when I found these letters, I gave them to Mr. Allsop—I believe they were in the envelopes when I gave them to him—I believe they were in the envelopes when I found them—I don't remember—I have no doubt they were—I did not send a receipt for the post-office order.</p>

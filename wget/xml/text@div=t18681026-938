                  </hi>. On the morning of 3rd October, between 1 and 2 o'clock, I was in bed asleep—I saw my daughter bolt the doors before going to bed—I cannot say whether she fastened the windows—I was awoke between 1 and 2, and I saw Dundron in my room—I had known him by sight before—this knife was in my pocket—it dropped and awoke me—he ran down stairs, and I ran after him—when I got to the door I looked up the court, and I saw both the prisoners—I did not see them both in my house; but I expect they came out of it, for there is no thoroughfare by it—my door is not in the street, but in the court—when I went back to my room I examined my trousers, and I missed a sovereign, two shillings, and sixpence in coppers, and down stairs I missed a jacket.</p>

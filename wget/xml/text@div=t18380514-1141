I am a labourer, and live in Elizabeth-court, Dock-head; On Tuesday morning, the 1st of May, about half-past seven o'clock, I was going down Leadenhall-street, and saw the prisoner lift up the flap of the prosecutor's pocket, take out his handkerchief, and place it under the tail of his own coat—I siezed him, took the handkerchief from him, and took him towards Aldgate watch-house—he made a desperate resistance, and so did several who were in company with him, by biting my hands, and so on, but I succeeded in lodging him in Aldgate watch-house—the prisoner said, "He is taking me for doing nothing," and tried to excite the by-standers against me, and he was kicking me and trying to throw me down.</p>

I saw him lift the flap of the prosecutor's coat, and take it out—I laid hold of the prosecutor and the prisoner at the same time.</p>

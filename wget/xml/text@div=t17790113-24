               <p>I live at Staines. I lost three sacks of pulse, that is beans and peas together, on the 4th of January, Monday was a week, out of a wharf; they were on a waggon; we missed them in the morning, and made enquiry, and heard that some sacks had been carried to a Mr. Ford's. I met Mr. Ford, and asked him if two men had not brought some peas and beans to his house; he said they had. I went to his house and found them; there were some of them shot. I knew them to be mine.</p>

               <p>On Monday evening, the 4th of January, the prisoner Harper came to me and asked me if I wanted any horse beans; the other prisoner was not with him then. I said if he had any he might let me have a sack; he said he would let me have it presently. He did not come again till about ten o'clock at night; then they both came; Mays brought the sack and shot it in the bin. I looked at it, it was a very bad sort. Harper said he had two sacks more that I might have; I said I did not choose to have them; he said if I would have them we should not differ about the price, and he would bring them; accordingly they brought the other two sacks and pitched them in my granary; I said I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130025"></xptr> did not know the value of them, I did not know how the markets went, I would enquire and give him accordingly. In the morning I met Mr. Rolfe, he asked me how I did, and told me I was the man he wanted; and then asked me if I had bought some beans and peas the night before. I said I had; he said he had lost three sacks out of his waggon.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with Mays about it? - No; not a word; Mays brought all the three sacks.</p>

               <p>cottage, of which Henry Perfect was keeping possession for the landlord—I put in a large quantity of my property about a week before Michaelmas—Henry Perfect was then in the house, and a person whom I believed to be his wife—the articles stated in the indictment were among the things I put in—I have lost a great many things, and have only found a few of them—I have not had anything to do with them since I put them in—I have been in the country—I know nothing of John Perfect, more than his coming two or three times with some potatoes to his brother—he came with a horse and cart—Henry said he hoped I should excuse his taking the liberty of putting his brother's horse and cart in the place—on the 1st of Nov. the things were gone from the house—those that are here, and a number of others.</p>

The prisoner was servant in the shop and waited at table. On the 1st of October, in consequence of information, I missed a silver sugar-bason, worth rather less than 2 l., and other articles as stated in the indictment - he had been about three months in my service. Mrs. Sutherland had been visiting at Brompton for four or five months, but had not deserted the house; she had the key of the cupboard in which the plate was kept; only the spoons were in use.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mrs. Rochford, Jermyn-street, St. James's. I have known the prisoner about two years. On the 14th of July, he pawned a mourning ring, in the name of Doherty, for 12 s. - he had often pawned for that person. On the 3d of August, he pawned another mourning ring, for 12 s. On the 15th of September, he pawned another, for 5 s.; on the 2d of September, a sugar-bason; on the 27th, a table-spoon for 8 s., and a milk-pot for 1 l. 13 s., and on the 9th, another spoon, all in one name. Mr. Annadale attended my family, and on the 27th, I went to his house, and thought I saw the prisoner there. On the 29th he came again; I asked if I had not seen him in a doctor's shop in Westminster; he said, No. On the following Wednesday, I gave information to the prosecutor. He came on the 30th to pawn four rings, and I detained him, and asked where he brought them from; he said from Mr. Doherty. I said they were stolen from Mr. Annadale, whom he denied knowing. I took him there in a coach, and in the coach he threw away the duplicates I had given him for the goods, and two keys, which I have since delivered to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>MR. ANNADALE. One of these keys opens my sideboard drawer. I have been in the habit of seeing the property for years past, and know it to be Mrs. Sutherland's. The prisoner came to my service from Mr. Doberty.</p>

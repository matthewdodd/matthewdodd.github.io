On the 25th of October, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day, I sent my son up into a room which I rented, in Moore-lane. He came running down, and said the door was broken open, and a man was in the room. I ran into Moore-lane, and saw the prisoner a few yards off. He turned into an alley. I only lost sight of him when he turned the corner. I stopped him, took him up to the room, found the door broken open, and all my books pulled out of my box, and put in the bed. I found one, "The Book of Knowledge," in his pocket. He was very resolute, and wanted a knife to stab himself, and kicked about. Three of us were obliged to hold him while he was searched. He had broken the padlock off the door with an instrument that was found on him.</p>

            . I slept in this room. I got up at seven o'clock; the books were then in the trunk. My father sent me there between eleven and twelve o'clock. I saw the staple drawn, and the hasp hanging to the padlock. The door was fastened inside. I pushed it open, came down, turned my head, and saw the prisoner following me, and told a person down stairs to follow him, but he got out. He was secured. He resisted being searched.</p>

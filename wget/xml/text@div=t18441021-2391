The prisoner was employed by me occasionally as a tailor—on the 16th of Sept., on going to my shop in Little Pulteney-street, I missed several articles, tea-pots and frying-pans, which I had left safe on Saturday night—I spoke to him about them on Monday morning—he said he did not know anything of them—in consequence of further information I received, I gave him into custody—the tea-pots, frying-pans, and other articles, now produced, are part of the articles I lost—I know them by private marks, and I lost other articles, worth about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 15th of Sept., I bought of the prisoner two tea-pots, two tea-trays, a frying-pan, tea-kettle, and saucepan—he had told me he would fetch them in the course of the week, and brought them, the tea-pot on Sunday morning, and the rest on Sunday night—he said he did not exactly know the value of them—I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he was to call on Mon<lb></lb>day for the remainder of the money, and change any article I did not like—he told me he and his brother kept a shop, that the things were rather damaged—they were going to remove to another shop, and he would sell them to me cheaper than I could buy them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you look to see that the buckles were missing? - I did not. I went down to the pawnbroker's, near St Martin's Church, and there I found a pair of buckles which I believe to be mine; the boy was apprehended, and carried to the watch-house, and I went to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass to promise him or threaten him? - There was no promise made, but I desired him to confess, and told him it would be better for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the knee buckles? - No further than I believe they are mine.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker; I think he pawned these knee buckles the 12th of July, it it was Thursday, I am sure it was the prisoner, he had on a white jacket then.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him? - I see him the next day when he was committed. He offered to pawn them; he asked me four shillings for them, I saw he was a poor like boy, and I asked him who they belonged to? he said he had them of his father; I asked him where his father was? he said his father worked for Mr. Collins, the dustman, at Westminster; that gave me rather a suspicion, and I looked over the counter, and I saw these shoe buckles were in his pocket; I then put him in St. Martin's watch-house, and after eleven o'clock I got him to Bow street, and I cannot remember whether he confessed going along or at Bow-street. There were two boys together, but the other boy had only a pair of shirt buttons.</p>
               <p>Burrows. There was another boy at work with him in the house, and which boy stole the shoe buckles I don't know. (The buckles produced.)</p>
               <p>Burrows. I do not venture to swear to them; I believe they are mine.</p>

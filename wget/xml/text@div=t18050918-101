               <p>Q. In consequence of any information, did you go to the house of Mrs. Martin? - A. I did; her house is in Princes-court, Drury-lane; she was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any lead which corresponded in appearance with the lead that you had in this place? - A. Yes, it appeared by the smell to come from a place of that description; Mr. Lane asked Mrs. Martin how she came by it; she said, that Mr. Edwards's men had left it there to exchange for patent pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you authorised your men to leave it there? - A. No such thing; she was taken up, and the lead was taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it correspond so as to make you partly sure that it was part of that lead? - A. It did; the two angles at the bottom corresponded where it had been cut off, the solder of the lead in one had been cut from the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understood you, that, in Mrs. Martin's place, you found the lead - she is a plumber? - A. Her husband was.</p>
               <p>Q. When you have done your work, you take what old materials there are, and allow for them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This has never been delivered to you, nor has ever been in your possession, of course you would never allow for that which you never received? - A. No, I would not allow for what I never had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You watched the men the whole time they were at work? - A. The principal time, not all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give your son instructions to attend the cart? - A. He was instructed; I was not there then.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 2d of August, between twelve and one o'clock, were you in Lincoln's Inn? - A. I was in the Inn; I saw the cart, and saw the lead taken from the privy loaded in the cart by the three men at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the cart drive away? - A. I did not, but I saw the cart after I had got out of the Inn in Lincoln's-Inn-fields; I knew it, because it was the same cart, and the three prisoners at the bar were with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the cart nearly facing the bottom of Portugal-street? - A. Yes, between that and Bear-yard, and there were two pieces of lead stood against the post out of the cart; I knew them by the make up, and by the soil on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the cart? - A. The cart was standing a few yards from the post where the lead was, the cart did not stop long; as soon as they went away with the pieces of lead, the cart went on; Jackson and Suddery took each of them a piece of the lead on their shoulder that had stood against the post, the carman drove the cart up Little Queen-street; I followed them some way, but I could not walk fast enough to keep up with them; they went along Duke-street, which leads to Drury-lane from Lincoln's-Inn-fields.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You say you saw two of the prisoners stand near a post where some lead was? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to say that you saw the lead in a cart, it was near a cart - it was in Lincoln's-Inn-fields you saw the cart, you were a good way from the cart? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your eye-sight very good? - A. Rather-bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if you were a considerable distance from the cart, how do you know it was the same cart? - A. I knew it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I recollect he said he knew it, because it was the same cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you also see the prosecutor's son with the cart in Lincoln's-Inn-fields? - A. Yes, I know his person, but I do not recollect seeing him when the lead stood against the post.</p>

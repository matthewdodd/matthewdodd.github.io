                  </hi>. I am servant to the captain of the ship <hi rend="italic">Madagascar</hi> from Calcutta. On the 5th of May the ship was in the East India Docks—I removed my chest, hammock, and other things to No. 3, Crisp<lb></lb>bird East India-road—I covered my jacket over a bird-cage to keep the warm—there were two silk handkerchiefs in the pocket—I stopped the cart at the dock gates to take in another chest—the prisoner was about the cart then—I went on to my lodgings—the cart came shortly afterwards—another man was driving it—I then missed my jacket and two silk hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs, which are here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I received information from Duncan, and from the man who drove the cart—in consequence of which I went to the Red Lion, High-street, Poplar, and saw the prisoner—I asked him what he had done with that jacket—he said, "I pledged it at Mr. Holly's, High-street"—I took him to the station, and found 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—I asked him where the duplicate of the jacket was—he said he gave it to the person who sent him to pledge them—I asked if he knew the person—he said he did not, they called him <hi rend="italic">pussey</hi>—next morning he told me the person's name was Hughes.</p>

This jacket and two handkerchiefs were pawned by the prisoner, about three o'clock in the afternoon, in the name of John Smith—I asked him whose property it was—he said it was his own—he said nothing about <hi rend="italic">pussey</hi> or Hughes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was sitting in a public-house; two sailors came in, and one of them had a jacket, the other had none; he asked me to go and pawn his jacket; I went, and brought him the duplicate, and money, and he gave me a drop of beer.</p>

            . On the 22d Day of September last, I went on Board the Russel Man of War, at Spithead . When I went out, I put Padlocks on my Doors, and left them fast; and on the 2d of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174010150011"></xptr> October I had Word sent me, that I was robbed. I came to Town directly, and found that I had lost the Goods mentioned in the Indictment; and the Kitchen Window, which looks into a Back-Yard, was taken down.</p>

            . I went down to the House, and found the Bar of the Window down, and that the Window had been open'd. It is in a little Frame, and was put up only to give Light to the Kitchen. The Yard of the House, where the Prisoner lives, is next but one to this Woman's House; so I went to ask him about it, and he hid himself; but we took him before the Justices at White-Chapel, where he own'd he took the Pot, and said, that a flung a String round it, and haul'd it out.</p>

            . I happen'd to be standing in Mr. Harris's Shop, between 6 and 7 in the Morning, and saw the Prisoner tying a Pot up in a Sack, I asked him what he was going to do with it? he said, he was going with it to Moorfields. Mr. Harris stepp'd up to him, and said, he believed it was stole. He brought the Pot over to Mr. Watts's; but the Prisoner ran away. He was taken again, and before the Justice he owned, that he took it out of the House,</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 9th of May, His Majesty was going to <placeName id="t18210606-190-crimeloc1093">Drury-lane</placeName>

I saw them try several people's pockets, but the crowd was so great, I coud not tell whether they succeeded - I watched them till half-past ten o'clock. Ward had gone away for half an hour, and returned about half-past ten o'clock; a gentleman in black, stood opposite the box door; they went behind him, Smith put his hand in the gentleman's pocket - Ward was covering him. I saw his hand go down into the pocket, and come up with something, which he immediately shoved into his shirt - they both ran away on seeing me. I told the gentleman he was robbed, he missed his handkerchief, and followed me. I took them in Drury-lane - the gentleman was then gone. I found the handkerchief in Smith's bosom.</p>

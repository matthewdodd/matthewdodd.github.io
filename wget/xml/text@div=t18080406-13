            . I am a constable belonging to the City of London. On the 30th of March, about half after seven in the evening, I saw the prisoner and four other persons.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060010"></xptr>Q. Who was with you. - A. Pim my brother officer; they were looking at the shoemaker's shop at the corner of Foster lane. They went from there and we followed them up Newgate street; they turned down St. Martin's Le-grand, we saw them go into Mr. Hall's public house the corner of Round court; I and Pim stopped at the corner of St. Martin's Le-grand, they staid in about four or five minutes to the best of my recollection; we saw them come out; they all went down a court that goes into the King's arms tavern facing of Mr. Hall's house; they stood all five of them in this court facing of Mr. Hall's house. I and Pim walked down to see what they were after: we saw the prisoner at the bar run across the road with that cask across his shoulder, he ran across into New rents.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he that cask on his shoulder when he went into Mr. Hall's. - A. That I did not see.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any cask when he was looking into the shoemaker's shop. - A. No, he ran up New rents. I stopped him in the court that leads into Mouldmaker's row; when he saw I followed him he instantly threw it down and with a great struggle we secured him; we took him to the counter; I had the cask, it was full of liquor containing peppermint; while I went in with the prisoner to Newgate some person unknown opened the off door of the coach and threw the cask down and broke in one of the staves of the head, and spilled about five gallons of the liquor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. You say while you were handing the prisoner out of the coach into Newgate, some person threw the cask of peppermint out. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot accuse him of that. - A. I said some person unknown</p>

            . Q. Did you watch the prisoner and his companions from Foster lane to Mr. Hall's. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went into Mr. Hall's had he any cask. - A. None at all, when he went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him come out. - A. Yes, they staid in a few minutes, how long I cannot say; they came out together and went across the way.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were you to them. - A. About thirty or forty yards; when they crossed the way we went down, knowing them to be people of bad character; when we went down we saw the prisoner run across the way with a cask upon his shoulder; we followed him took him, and the cask to the counter; the cask was full.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. How do you know it was full. - A. Because it was so heavy, and by its sound it appeared to be quite full, and I know a great deal ran out by Newgate door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. That might be and yet the cask not full.</p>
               <p>Court. Now I will ask you whether you do not know the sound of an empty cask. - A. Yes, there was no sound in it all, it was like a lump of lead.</p>

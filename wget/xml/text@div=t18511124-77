I was on duty on London bridge, at 5 minutes before six o'clock in the morning—I saw a butcher's cart pass me—the prisoner and the deceased were in it—the pri<lb></lb>soner was driving it with reins—he was going twelve or fourteen miles an hour, as near as I can say—they were trotting—there were other carts on the bridge—the prisoner was going towards the Borough—I watched the cart, because it was driving so fast—it ran against the right side of a four-wheeled wagon, which turned the cart over, and both the men were thrown out—the wagon stood close against the kerb-stone on the left hand side, coming into the City—there was another wagon with three horses in the centre of the road; and instead of his passing it on the right side, he went on the driver's side—I went up, and found the deceased lying on his belly on the road bleeding from the left ear—he was not sensible—I got a board and took him to the hospital—it was just beginning to be daybreak—it was dark.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, and live at Stoke Newington. On Tuesday morning, 11th Nov., I was coming over London-bridge towards the City, driving a light four-wheeled van with a horse in a rein—I was on the near-side, about a foot and a half, or it might be two feet, from the kerb—when I got just over the top of the bridge, I saw the butcher's cart coming over the bridge towards the Borough, meeting me—it was driving at a very fast rate indeed, at the rate of twelve or fourteen miles an hour; a very fast trot—there were two men in it—it was on the wrong side, and on the off-side of my van—there was another wagon before me—he passed on the near-side of that—I cannot say whether there was room for him to pass on his proper side of that—it was rather dark—after he had passed that wagon, I think if he had been going at a steady rate he would have cleared my van; but his horse was going at such a rate he could not stop it—his wheel ran over my fore-wheel, and caught my hind-wheel, and that turned him over—both the men in the cart were thrown out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How near were you to the cart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Within, about two feet—I moved my van on after the accident, to let others pass me, but as to going any nearer the kerb, I do not think I was an inch nearer—you were going at such a rate that I do not think your horse was within your power, but if you had been going a steady rate you might have cleared me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the horse running loose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but he was coming at such a rate that the horse had got the power of him just for a moment—the prisoner was taken to the hospital—I did not see whether the wagon that was before me had struck him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of St. Thomas's Hospital—William Stopford was brought there—I saw him first on 11th Nov., about six in the morning—I examined him and saw it was necessay for him to come</p>

               <p>into the hospital at once—he was bleeding from the ear, and he had a scalp wound just over the left ear—he was sensible at the time, but I knew be would shortly become insensible, and he was taken into the hospital—he had a fractured collar-bone, and complained of great pain in his chest, that would proceed from the fracture of the collar-bone, and of the ribs which we discovered at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—he became insensible very shortly after he was taken in, and died on the following Sunday—he recovered his senses, but very imperfectly—he knew his wife—that was the only person he did know—he saw her shortly after he came in, just before he became insensible—I examined his body after death—it was generally healthy—I discovered fracture at the base of the skull, broken ribs, and broken collar-bone—the fracture at the base of the skull was the principal, and there was a great quantity of blood effused in the chest—the fracture was deep in the skull, and was not visible outwardly—it was within the ear as it were, and that would account for the bleeding of the ear—there was blood effused on the brain—in my judgment the cause of his death was that blood on the brain, and the effusion of blood in the chest, which com<lb></lb>pressed the lungs—those injuries were such as might be occasioned by a fall from a cart—I saw the prisoner, he was shaken and slightly bruised—nothing more—I sent him out immediately.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Rainbow public-house in the Liverpool-road, in the parish of St. Mary, Islington. On the night of the 10th of January, I was the last person up in the house—I went to bed about twenty minutes after eleven o'clock—I am sure I fastened the doors and windows all secure—the prisoner was at my house that night—he came between eight and nine o'clock—I did not know him before that—he came to the parlour where I was sitting, and had some refreshment, and sat up till about eleven o'clock, when he was shown to his bed by my servant—he had asked bribed previously—she left the room with him for the purpose of showing him to bed about eleven o'clock—she is not here—I fastened the front door by a lock and two bolts, and hung the key on a nail in an obscure place—the back door was only fastened by a bolt and a bar—it opens into my yard—I generally take my money to my bed-room, but that night I left it in the till in the bar, which forms a room of itself when the doors are closed—it a separated by two doors and a shutter, which is put up and fastened by bolts—a door opens to the front of the bar, and two half doors, which it the entrance into the bar—that separates it from the passage and the tap-room—I had fastened those bolts and shutters inside, and the bottom part of the door was fastened by a bolt inside—the upper part was locked out<lb></lb>side I locked it the night before, and took that key to my bed-room with me—I left two or three fourpenny pieces, one sixpence, and a quantity of copper in the till—I had seen it there the last thing before I went from the bar—I took other money from it—I do not know what quantity of copper I had—I was called up between one and two o'clock by a policeman, and went down stairs—I found the policeman knocking at the door I found the front door had been unlocked, and left fastened only by the upper bolt—I had locked it, and bolted both bolts—I then opened the door and let the policeman in—I turned round, and found my bar door broken open, it is close to the outer door—I had no light at that time the bar door had been forced open, and the bolt nearly torn off—it hung by; gone screw—it was not standing wide open—it was put to—I could get in by opening that door, without unlocking the upper door,</p>

               <p>which remained locked, as I had left it—I went into the bar with the policeman, and unlocked the upper door—I opened my till, and missed the fourpenny pieces, and a sixpence, which I had left there—the copper still remained—I did not miss any of that—we then went and found the back door standing wide open—the prisoner at that time was in the bar with the policeman—he was outside the door with the policeman when I came down—I said to him, "How came you to go out at this time of night? it is you, is it, who has come here under the pretence of getting a bed, and getting into the bar?"—I certainly did not promise him and thing or threaten him—he said he had not been to the bar—I asked him how he came to be up at that hour, and attempt to escape the is back way—he said he thought it was five o'clock in the morning—he was then taken into the bar and searched by the constable in my pre<lb></lb>sence, and between three and four pounds worth of silver, and some copper, was found in his pocket—he had various coins, half-crowns, shil<lb></lb>lings, sixpences, and three fourpenny pieces—he was taken to the station-house—the lock of the front door had been broken off—it was not unlocked with a key, but I did not discover that till after I had been to the station-house—there was no particular mark on the silver I left in the till.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty in the Liverpool-road on the night of the 10th, and about two o'clock in the morning I observed a light moving about in the bar of the Rainbow pub<lb></lb>lic-house—part of the bar window is towards the street—I likewise heard a noise similar to something being wrenched off a door—I think that noise was at the street door, but I cannot be certain—I then crossed over the road, and as soon as I stepped up to the door, on the pavement, the light dis<lb></lb>appeared—I then went round to the back part of the house to see if any body was going up stairs with a light—I could see no light at all—I then came round quickly to the front of the house, and the light was again in the bar—I made a noise with my feet, and the light again disappeared—I waited a short time and it appeared again, and shortly afterwards my brother officer came up—I spoke to him—he went to the back, and I gave an alarm at the front of the house—I knocked at the door—the light was burning when I knocked, but disappeared immediately—I waited a few minutes, but finding nobody came, I went round to the side wall—the prisoner was in the prosecutor's yard—he immediately jumped over at the bottom, and crossed a piece of waste ground to the outer wall—he got on the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's wall, and I kept him in sight till he was taken on the outer wall—I got into the prosecutor's yard, but could see nobody else, and we took him to the front of the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 24th of September I was at the Vine tavern, in plain clothes—the prisoner called for porter—she offered a counter<lb></lb>feit sixpence—Mrs. Dyke refused it—the prisoner took it up, offered a good shilling, and received a sixpence and fourpenny-piece—it was a good one I think and firmly believe—I saw her take the change up in her left hand, and her half-pint of beer at the same time—she dropped a fourpenny-piece from her hand, and said, "Give me halfpence instead of that"—Mrs. Dyke then said, "It is a bad one, and not what I gave you, you have <hi rend="italic">rung the changes"</hi>—the prisoner at that moment put the beer up to her mouth—I heard something jink in her mouth—she put the beer down again, and Mrs. Dyke attempted to remove it, to see if the good fourpenny-piece was there, and was going to empty it out—the prisoner took hold of it, and said, "For God's sake don't take my beer away," and put it up to her mouth—she appeared to be swallowing something with difficulty—I took the bad sixpence out of her hand, and made her open her mouth—I said "You have something in your mouth"—she did not answer, but kept her mouth closed for several seconds—I insisted on her opening her mouth, which she did—there was nothing in it then—at that moment I noticed in her throat a motion as if she was swallowing something with difficulty—I received a fourpenny-piece from Mrs. Dyke which I produce—the prisoner was searched at the station, and a good shilling found on her—she gave her name "Ellen Lyon, No. 7, Bull's Head-court, Snowhill"—I went and found no such person lived there.</p>

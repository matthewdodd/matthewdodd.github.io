               <p>Q. You lost some of your property last month, did not you - A. Yes, out of my house On Thursday, the 9th of August, between nine and ten o'clock, I went to bed. I left my wife by the fire; in a short time, she began to cry and make a noise and said, that somebody had stolen the box out of the place.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your property kept - A. In a box.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160027"></xptr> The box was locked; the box was kept in the back kitchen. I rose up in the bed, and there I sat, amazed, that any body could take the box while I was in bed. My wife ran into the street, and said she was robbed and ruined. Directly

               <p>Q.Did you see him - A. Yes, he talked to me; pitied my case; he said he was very sorry to think that any body should do that to me, a hard working man with a family. I said, I think so; it will be the ruin of me. Straitway my wife came in with the box, it was broken open and empty. All the property had been taken out. She went into the street again, to see if she could find the property. I jumped out of bed, and

             left me, and went up stairs, I went into the passage, and there I stood facing of the street. My wife was inquiring for the rest of the property. In the mean time the watchman came, and my wife, to search in my own rooms.</p>
               <p>Q. Why should he search the rooms - A. There was a suspicion, that some in my house had done the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lived in your rooms - 
               <persName id="t18120916-46-person423">A. John Roberts</persName>
            , Perkins, and Mary Lipscomb, they all lodged with us in different rooms. They went up to search the room, and when they went into the second floor the patrol called me; he asked me if I knew that pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the patrol's name - A. Oram. He called me up, and produced a pocket-book to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that pocket-book your property - A. Yes, I lost it from the bottom of the box; it contained two one pound notes and some silver, for the rent that my wife had put in it. I saw my wife put it in two one pound notes, and four pounds worth of silver. I asked Mary Lipscomb, what made her and her men do such things to me. She denied it. I went up into the three pair.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lodged there - A. Roberts. I charged them all to the watch-house. Me and my wife and the patrol took them to the watch-house; and then I and my wife went to bed. The patrol came the next morning at four o'clock; me and my wife jumped out of bed; he asked me to go and look into the yard. I went and looked into another person's yard through the boards; I saw a boot-top lay, and a great bundle besides. The patrol and me fetched the bundle, and examined it.</p>
               <p>Q.What was in it - A. My property and my wife's, both. I found in it a pair of boot tops, a waistcoat, a hat, and a handkerchief; the other things belonged to my wife.</p>
               <p>Q.Could any person take it out of your room, and put it into the yard - A. From the top window of the house from Roberts's window.</p>
               <p>MRS. Q. Are you the wife of the last witness - A. Yes. I was in the back kitchen; my husband was in bed I was sitting by the fire about ten o'clock I heard the watchman go past ten. I went and shut the outer door, and locked it with a spring-lock. I went to the back kitchen, shut the door, but did not lock it, and I saw a candle, burning, upon the box, go to bed directly, and before I happened to go to bed, I fell asleep and when I awoke, the place was in darkness. The candle was out. I put my hand out. I could not feel the box or the candlestick. I alarmed my husband. The kitchen door was wide open, and the street-door wide open. I ran out, and found the patrol; he was enquiring for the owner of the box. I told him I had lost a box; the box was mine. Oram and me and another watchman made a search in several rooms of lodgers in neighbours houses; we found nothing there. We came to our own rooms next. I was present when the patrol found the pocket-book in the second pair, Perkins's lodging. He had lodged in the house eight months. I went immediately up into Roberts's room, at the top of the house; when I came there, the window was wide open, and Perkins was sitting by Roberts's fire. Seeing the window open, I went up to it.

             seemed to be fast asleep when I went into the room; he jumped up, and put the table by the window. When Roberts came in, we searched round the room; we could not find any thing. When Roberts was out of the window, I saw him put his arm out. I saw nothing in his hand. I saw him put his arm out towards where the bundle was found the next morning. The patrol took Roberts, Perkins, and Lipscomb, to the watch-house; and on the next morning the patrol came and knocked at the door. He said get up, here is something in the yard. I saw the things in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. What property did you observe of yours - A. One gown, three pair of mitts, a spencer, a child's frock, and a habit shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put any money in this box - A. I put the money into the pocket-book in the box, four pounds in silver, and two one pound Bank notes.</p>
               <p>- ORAM. On the 31st of August, I was going through Charles-street, patroling I saw a large deal box standing in a coach-yard. The box appeared to have been broken open; it was empty. I made inquiry about the box. The prosecutrix came and said she had lost her box. She owned the box immediately. I then searched the lodgers apartments. In the second floor was a pocket-book laying by the bed side of Perkins and Lipscomb. The watchman attempted to pick it up. I said, it should not be picked up until Bates came there and owned it. I went upstairs into Robert's room Perkins and Roberts seemed to be in a great confusion; the window appeared just shut to, and by Perkins pushing the table, they seemed to be in confusion about it. On the next morning, I saw something in Mr. Glover's yard, the next yard. I gave notice to Bates. I went up stairs and got out of the window. Bates owned the bundle.</p>
               <p>JOHN BAXTER. I was constable of the night at the watch-house; that night Oram brought this pocketbook to the watch house. It is the same; I have kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q.to Prosecutrix. Do you know that pocket book - A. Yes, and this is all my property; but it is not all that was lost. The pocket book was found in Perkins's room. He and

               <p>Perkins's Defence. I know nothing about it, nor how it came there.</p>
               <p>Roberts's Defence. On Monday night, about half after ten, Mrs. Bates came into my apartment; she said Roberts, for God's sake, come down, I am robbed I said, is it true. I went to her apartment, where her husband was in bed. I staid there until her husband dressed himself. She went out in the street, and when I heard the box was found, I went up to my apartment and smoked a pipe. The watchman came in, he said he would insist upon taking me and Perkins to the watch-house. They searched all the apartments in the house, and found nothing. This good lady's door, a child of three years old can open her lock any hour of the day or night; it pulls open with a string.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. When I locked the door, I pulled the string in.</p>

            . I am a tea warehouse keeper belonging to the East-India company, On the 18th of November last, upon opening an outware-house, there were about 700 lb. weight of tea missing, supposed to be stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Halbrook. He had been a <rs id="t17690222-54-deflabel325" type="occupation">watchman</rs>

We had occasion to open that warehouse, and then we found a chest that had been broke open, that caused us to search further; when we found several chests that appeared to have been opened. I acquainted the directors of it, and we went to Sir

            , and had a search-warrant. The prisoner lived somewhere by White-Chapel bars.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other suspicion of the prisoner but by his being a watchman?</p>
               <p>Holbrook. We had not. On the search-warrant we found a bag in the prisoner's house that had had tea in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all you found?</p>
               <p>Holbrook. That was all; he did not come to work again, which looked rather suspicions. The 18th was a Friday, and he did not come the next day to take his wages. I believe he called on me on the Sunday at my house, but I was not at home; and on the Monday morning I was informed he came to the warehouses, but did not stay to be taken on, and from that time he absconded. There were three locks to that warehouse door, but we found the door might be lifted off the hinge at the bottom.</p>

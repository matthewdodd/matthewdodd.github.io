In consequence of suspicion I marked the halfpence and penny pieces that were left in the till on the over night.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was there left in the till - A. Thirteen shillings and sixpence in penny pieces and half pence; about eight o'clock I went to the till and counted the money; there was a deficiency of about four shillings and sixpence in copper coin; I asked him what money he had in his pockets, he said he had three pence halfpenny; I desired him to produce it; he did so; I examined and found it was not mine; I asked him if he had no more about him, he said no; I asked him if he was sure he had no more about him, he said no, he had not. On asking him a third time, he said he had more, but it did not belong to him, it was given to him by his mother; he pulled out about sixpenny worth; I saw by the marks they were mine; I desired him to put them in his pocket again; he was searched; there was four shillings and three halfpence found upon him, all marked money; I told him they were mine, he denied it and said it was his mother's; I told him it had my mark upon it, he seemed confused; I told him to take them in his hand, he would see a small cross upon them; then he said he took them from the till.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On the 15th of this instant I was at work in the bake-house, I heard a great noise upon the leads about eleven at night; I went out, but saw nobody; I said aloud, if they did not desist I should soon make them; I went to my business, and about a quarter past twelve I went out and called the watchman; he and I went into the building, I could not find any body in the bottom part; we struck the ladder, then if any body was above they were very secure; then we went up on the inside of my master's house, and got out upon a two story scaffold, there we took the prisoner at the bar; I asked him what he did there; he said he got up there to sleep; after that he said he was in liquor, and came into the building with a woman, and she had left him, so he got up the ladder; he had only a bit of a file upon him; the next morning we missed 13 or 14 feet of lead from the back part of my master's house.</p>

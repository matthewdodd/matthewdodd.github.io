               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I did not know my time was out till the day before I was taken, which was the 27th January; I call on Mr. Garforth's clerk.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>All I know is, that Mr. Scudmore was tricked out of four notes, for two hundred and fifty pounds each, to the amount of one thousand pounds; an action was brought against Mr. Scudmore for one of the bills; Mr. Garforth defended the action for Mr. Scudmore; and pending the suit, two of the parties became bankrupts: a bill was filed in the court of Exchequer, for an injunction to stop the proceedings; Aikles was subpoened while in Newgate, when he said he could make a discovery of the whole fraud; he then wanted his time to be enlarged; application was made, and I believe his time was enlarged; Mr. Garforth understood his time was enlarged.</p>
               <p>Court. When was this, you do not mention any time? - I do not recollect the time, it was the last time he was discharged out of Newgate. My Lord, I have one thing more to say the prisoner applied several times to Mr. Garforth to have a hearing, and to know whether his time was enlarged, but Mr. Garforth was very busy at the House of Common upon a petition.</p>

               <p>About December, we had a warrant at the prisoner's suit for two thousand pounds, against one Knight: It was to get up some bills that a gentleman was swindled out of, and we understood the prisoner's time was enlarged; Aikles took every pains to apprehend Knight, but we could not find him, therefore the warrant was never executed; I understood the prisoner's time was enlarged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Garforth assured me he had wrote to Lord Sydney, but had received no answer, nor did not expect any, and doubted not but the business was done, and that he thought I was very safe.</p>

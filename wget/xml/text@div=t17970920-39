Yes, very well; I went, according to Mr. Newman's orders at the Mansion-house, between nine and ten o'clock, to his house, the Half-moon public-house, Duke-street, Smithfield; I asked him if one Kilby was there; he told me, no; says he, I know what you want; says I, how do you know what I want; says he, what do you want then; I said to him, I want a guineas worth of dollars; I said, how many are there for a guinea; he told me there should not be but seven, but he would let me have eight; accordingly I had eight, I paid him a one pound note, and one shilling, for them; after I had paid him for them, he asked me if I wanted any yellows; I asked him, what yellows were; he told me they were half-guineas; I asked him what they were a piece; he told me three shillings and sixpence; I asked him if he could not take three shillings; he said, no, he would not abate a farthing; I gave him a one pound note, and he gave me half-a-crown out of it, and five half-guineas; then he says to me, d-n you, Jack, if I had known your temper I would have put three hundred pounds in your pocket in less than three months; says I, how would you do it; says he, I will fetch you something, and shew you; he fetched me down a five pound note of the Bristol Bank; says he, here is something worth two of the other; says I, I do not want any thing of that kind at present, but if I do, I will call upon you, (produces the half-guinea); I immediately went to Mr. Newman at the Mansion-house; we were going that night, but Mr. Newman sent word not to go till I got the note; next day I went with Mr. Hollier to the prisoner's house, and found five dollars in a pint pot, in his bar.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any counterfeit money about the premises? - A.

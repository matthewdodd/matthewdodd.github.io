                  </hi>. I live in Bridport-street, Marylebone. About a quarter past ten o'clock on the night of the 5th of Oct., I went to a public-house near Paddington-chapel, and called for a pint of beer—Lee came and asked how I did—I said, "Very well"—I asked her to drink, wnich she did, and we went out—she asked me to go home with her—I said I would, and then we went to another house, and had a quartern of gin, then I went to her house—she took me to an upper room, and bolted the door—then she asked me for money, and I gave ner half-a-crown—we then went to bed—I went to sleep—Collins, who was the landlady, came and awoke me, and told me to turn out—I missed three sovereigns, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from my clothes—when I was jangling with Collins, I was sitting on the bed-side—her daughter, the prisoner Josephine Collins, came and took the boots and trowsers—I fol<lb></lb>lowed her to the next room, and took possession of them there—I had not paid for the room—I was not asked anything about money—I had paid Lee—Collins took the boots and trowsers before my face—I do not know whe<lb></lb>ther it was to keep until I had paid for the room—she did not speak a word to me—it was Collins's mother that spoke about my staying in the room.</p>

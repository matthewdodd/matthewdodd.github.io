                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Charles Lloyd of 21, Coventry-street, tobacconist—this that I am looking at is in my own writing; made at the time—the prisoner Shine called at my shop, with another person who is not here, and asked to see some of the finest cigars that we had—I took them upstairs and showed them some—the other one said he hoped I would show him something very fine and very choice, for he would be a very large customer—I then showed him some cigars—Shine looked at them and selected three boxes—he gave me his card—it has been destroyed; I can't remember who destroyed it—it was lying about for some time in the shop—I have made search for it; I have not been able to find it—on the card was, "J. Stanley and Co., Commission Agents, 9, Duke-street, Westminster"—Shine told me that if I would send them about 6 o'clock he would be there to receive them and pay for them—I afterwards gave them to Pullen, who did not bring them back—next morning I went at 10 o'clock to 9, Duke-street, Westminster, to receive the money—I knocked at the door, tried the handle, and found it was locked—the place is let out in offices—I knew the place before—I have known the neighbour<lb></lb>hood some time—I never was in that place before—I knocked at the door on this occasion—Keeling opened it; I had never seen him before—I presented the bill and asked him if Mr. Stanley was there—he told me that he had not arrived—I then told him that that was an untruth, because I had seen him pass from the front office into some room at the back—he said that it was a friend of Mr. Stanley's—I told him that unless he went into the room and fetched him out I should go in myself and see—Keeling then went to the door and Shine came out—it was Shine whom I had seen go into the other room—he gave the name of Stanley—when he came out he made no end of promises—there were so many that I can't remember the whole of them—Keeling and Shine and the person who was with Shine at the shop when they ordered the cigars, and who also came out, all three told me that if I would call in an hour and a half I should have the money—they did not all use exactly the same words—as near as I can remember, it was that if I would go away and call again in an hour's time I should have the money—they each came out, one at a time, and said, "If you call is an hour," and the others said very nearly the same, and afterwards Keeling said, "If you will go away and come in three minutes you shall be paid"—I asked them why they wished me to go away; Shine said because they expected some one to call there to pay some money, and they did not want them to see any one waiting in the passage—I was sitting on one of the chairs in the, passage—Keeling at first asked me to stop there—some one came into the front office, and he asked me to step into the passage—the front office was furnished with about a couple of chairs, a table, and one or two bottles; it did not appear to me to be at all a place of business—I said I could not go away without the goods or the money—Shine said if I would go with him to the City, he would call on his bankers and pay me—that was after they had asked me to go away for five minutes—I went with Shine to the City by the steamboat—none of the others accompanied me—he took me to Thames-street, St. Dunstan's-hill, he did not take me to any banker's—he went into this place in Thames-street, and said he should most likely get the money, and that if he got it he would pay me—I stopped in</p>

               <p>the passages—the place was let out in offices—there was some name up—he was in there about ten or twelve minutes—when he came out he said he had not got the money, and then he told me that if I followed him any farther he would give me in custody—I told him that he could not possibly do that, as he had invited me to go with him—he told me that he had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if I would go with him to the Dublin Steam Wharf, Smithfield, I think it was, he had a consignment of goods there, that he would have to pay a small sum of money, and that he would give me the difference; if not he would give me the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and call and see my employer, and try to make some arrangement with him—on our way to Tower Hill he showed me the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. they were sovereigns and some silver—he got into a Hansom cab—I told him I would take that if he would call and see Mr. Lloyd with me—I got into the cab with him—he told the cabman to drive as fast as he could to East Smithfield—we went there, to the Dublin Steam Wharf, and. made some inquiries about goods consigned to him, which they knew nothing at all about—I heard them say so in his presence—I applied for the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. immediately we came out, and he promised that he Would come with me to Mr. Lloyd and pay the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we got into a boat to come back—he promised to come out at one or two piers, and at last he said he could not come, and would not come—I asked him to get out at Blackfriara, and Waterloo, and also Hungerford, being the nearest piers—he said he should not do apy such thing; he should not go; he should go home—he and I got out at Westminster-bridge—he went home and I went with him, to Duke-street again—Keeling came out and told me that unless I went home he should go down to Mr. Lloyd and make some complaint; with that he went in again, came out again, and started off by himself—I stayed there a few minutes after he had left; I knocked at the door and found that it was not answered, and then I went home to Mr. Lloyd's—Keeling came there afterwards—he went into the counting-house; Mr. Lloyd was there—Keeling told him that he was a friend of Mr. Stanley's, and that the debt should be paid in the course of the day—Mr. Lloyd told him that unless it was, he should enter proceedings against him—those were the words as near as I can recollect—this was all on the morning of 26th May—on the night of 30th August I was sent for, and went to Mr. Bartram's, the pawnbroker's—I there saw the prisoners—I did not see the cigars.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Lloyd, tobacconist, of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Coventry-street—on 25th May Mr. Johnson gave me a parcel of cigars to take to 9, Duke-street, Westminster—I took them there and asked for Mr. Stanley—I saw Keeling—I gave him the cigars with the bill, and he said Mr. Stanley had just gone away with his lady in the carriage into the country to a dinner, and that if I did not leave the cigars he would be very much offended, and very likely would not have them at all—I told him, when I gave them to him, that I could not leave them without the money—I was in the office—there was a rail between us, and he put the cigars over the rails to me into my hands at first—I put them under my arm then, and Shine came rushing out from a back room and told me that Mr. Stanley had told him that there were some cigars coming, that it was all right; that he had nothing to do with them; he was superintendent of the police, and that he was to forward them at once, and that if I did not leave them he would be very much offended—as I had them under my arm he took hold of them and gradually took them from me—he took me regularly off my guard; he said two or three other little things that I can't recollect exactly—he over<lb></lb>came my scruples, and I left them there—I was not in the shop when they were ordered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Bartram, pawnbroker, at 51, Princes-street, Leicester-square—on the evening ef 25th May, 3lbs. of cigars were pledged there between 7 and 8 in the evening by Shine—they were in three boxes, tied up in three bundles—I advanced 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them—the prisoner gave me the name of Lee—Keeling came in and recognised him as a friend—they spoke together—Keeling went out of the shop first; Shine went out after he was served—I had seen Shine before—I had never know him by the name of Stanley, I knew bin by the name of Shine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

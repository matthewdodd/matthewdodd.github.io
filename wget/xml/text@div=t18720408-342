                  </hi>. I live at the White Swan, Keat Court, with my daughter—I do not keep the house—on 19th March the deceased Ann Cooney was in one compartment; while she was there the prisoner came in and ordered a pint of half-and-half—I did not hear her say anything to him—she left the compartment she was in and went into the compartment where the prisoner was drinking, and they went out of the house, but I did not see them go—she was alone—I afterwards heard a scrimmage out<lb></lb>side on the step, and saw the prisoner push the deceased down—she fell on her back—he did not strike her—she got up directly, and he pushed her down again, she fell on her back—I did not see whether her head struck—she came into the house half an hour afterwards, and I persuaded her to go home—she had been drinking—I saw nothing wrong with her—she came in again about 11 o'clock, with four more females, and had a share of a half-pint of rum, and sat down on a form—she then laid down on the floor, and I did not know she was there till a female came and drew my attention to her, and I went to her and told her to get up—she answered me very crossly—two females took her outside and sat her on the step of the door, and I heard no more till a female came and asked me for some water, as she had fainted away, and in about half an hour they came and told me she was dead.</p>

I am a physician, of 32, Brick Lane—I was called to the deceased about 12 o'clock at night—I found her lying on her back outside the White Swan, quite dead—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—there were no external marks of injury on the head, but on removing the scalp there were two slight bruises under the surface, and corresponding marks of extravasated blood on the skull—I have heard the evidence—I believe death to have been caused by concussion of the brain from the fall—I found no sign of any other disease.</p>

I live at 7, Haverstock Street, City Road—on Saturday afternoon, about 3.30, on the 21st October, I believe, I was; walking with the prosecutor near Golden Lane, when the prisoner snatched his chain from him and ran up a court with it—the watch remained in his pocket, the chain having broken from it—I was about to go up the! court when I was stopped by three persons, who said to me "For God's sake don't go up there; you will be killed"—the prosecutor lost the chain, locket, and seal—those persons ran up the court in the direction the prisoner went when I called "Police"—54 G came, and we followed! him up the court—we did not catch the prisoner then, but we gave a</p>

I saw some one chasing three or four men in Golden Lane at the time in question, and soon afterwards I heard from the prosecutor that he had been robbed—he gave me a full description, which answers the prisoner's description, from which I took the prisoner into custody—I saw the prosecutor pick him out of about a dozen without the slightest hesitation—the chain was never found.</p>

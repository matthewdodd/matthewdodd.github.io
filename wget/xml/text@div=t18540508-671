                  </hi>. I am steward of a merchant vessel. On 17th April, I was crossing a dummy, at a pier at Woolwich, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the afternoon—there was a great crowd going out of the steam boat—I felt he guard of my watch tight to my neck, I looked round and saw the prisoner with my watch in his hand, and his coat on his arm—I <hi rend="italic">collared</hi> him, and gave him in charge—the chain of the watch was not hurt, but the force he held it with, caused the pin which fastened it to the watch to bend.</p>

                  </hi>. I am parish constable of Woolwich. I was on the top of the Pier that day, looking over—I saw Mr. Innis take hold of the prisoner, and at that time I saw his watch hanging down in front of him—I went down the steps as soon as possible, and he gave me the prisoner in custody—I told him what he was charged with, he said he was not near the man—I inquired his address, he said he was a commercial traveller, and lived at No. 2, Norton Folgate, and travelled for a haberdasher, or a hosier.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you a little jolly on that occasion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; nor yet melancholy—I had taken that refreshment that did me good—I had been on business—I had just come out of the boat—the prosecutor was not drunk with the quantity of tea he had taken—he was quite sober—I did not see the prisoner take the watch from his person; I could not, for the prisoner had got a coat over his arm—there were a good many people—they were not pressing closely, because they were waiting till all the people</p>

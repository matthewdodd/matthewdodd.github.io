               <p>Q. Does that make it better or worse? - A. Worse, threepence or a groat a foot; I asked them what they cut it asunder for, and they both said, for the ease of carriage; I said it was very extraordinary they should lessen the value of it so; they said, every person had a right to do as they liked with their own; I asked them how they came by it; they said, they bought it in the log; I then asked them where they worked, and for their address, and Ennis told me where he lived; I told him I would make enquiry, and if I found all things right, I would give them a fair price; they went away, and I sent my foreman to enquire;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180010290005"></xptr>they came again, and I told them if they would bring me a bill of parcels, I would be satisfied; but, till then, I should hold it, and I stopped it; they went away; I did not see either of them again, till the prisoner was apprehended; the next morning, in consequence of information, I sent for Mr. Hale, and young Mr. Hale and the foreman came and saw the mahogany; the prisoner was taken up on Wednesday, and then produced the receipt.</p>



               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The prisoner gave you his correct address? - A. Yes.</p>

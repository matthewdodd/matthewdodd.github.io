Often they do, but in the Venereal Ward they are less likely to have patients to go out than in others, the surgeons are particularly strict upon them patients, because it would be injurious to their health. If a patient in that Ward went out the sister or the nurse would feel it their duty to apply to me, and they would be discharged.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, in the employ of Messrs. Ponsford &amp; Co., 8, Watling Street, woollen merchants—on the 27th February, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I saw a bale of goods in the passage of the ware-house—about five minutes after, I came into the passage and saw some persons rolling the bale along the passage—these prisoners are two of the men—the bale contained silk rep chene: we call them Bradford goods—I raised an alarm—I saw a cart and horse at the door, and a man behind with the bale—I saw the two prisoners roll the bale out of the passage on to the pavement—they were in the act of lifting it into the cart—they heard the noise that I made, and walked away—I took hold of Clark and took him into the warehouse, and then I went out and looked for the other, but he had disappeared—I gave Clark into custody—he said he knew nothing about it, it was a mistake.</p>

I am a carman and contractor, at York Road, Lambeth—I know the prisoners—about a fortnight before this, Clark came and said he wanted to hire a horse and cart to take some goods home, of his own manufacture—he said he was a portmanteau maker—I lent him the horse and cart for the purposes of his trade—he said he was going to take port-manteaus home, which were ordered—he had the cart two or three times a week—he had it on the day of the robbery.</p>

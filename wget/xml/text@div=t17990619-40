             sworn. - I was sent to watch the prisoner; between the Old City-road till he got to Islington, he took salt out of full sacks and put it into an empty one; I was in the road a little distance from him, I don't know whether he saw me or not, I was behind him; I went home and told my master of it; that is all that I know.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Bowley.) What did you do upon the information you received? - A. As soon as Salkeld returned, I went out to meet the cart as it came home, and I met it just by Hermes-street, Pentonville, it there stopped, and the carman got out and went up Hermes-street; while he was there I ran by, and went down to the turnpike to hide myself; I staid there five or six minutes, when he returned with the little youth at the bar, he got into the cart, and laid this bag and salt on the boy's back, then he went his way; I followed the bag of salt up Hermes-street; and the little boy, when he got to his father's door, threw down the bag, and afterwards pulled it in, and I followed him; there was no one in the shop but his mother, and two or three children. I took them up, and carried them to Hatton-garden; I have nothing to say against Robinson the elder, any further than that it was in his house where the salt was carried.</p>
               <p>Tuck's defence. I had lost my direction, and this was the first little boy I saw, and I asked him if he would take the salt home till it was called for; the salt, nor sack neither, was never Mr. Bowley's, it was laid upon my cart by a man who was to have met me there for it.</p>
               <p>Robinson's (the younger) defence. I was at play, and he gave me the salt to take in doors.</p>
               <p>Robinson, the elder, called several witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Mr. Bowley.) Q. Do you know whether there was any deficiency of falt delivered to the customers? - A. In one of the sacks there were twenty-four pounds deficient; the man sent word of it to our house before I got home; it is impossible for me to swear to the sack, because there is no mark no it.</p>

The prisoner is not the man who took my watch, but I am positively certain that he was one of the gang who hustled me - I looked at him particularly, he was at my right hand; it was a very dull evening, but there was sufficient light in the street to distinguish countenances - the lamps and shops were lit up. I was hustled down from the main street into the gateway, and several blows were struck at me - this was after the watch was gone. I had an umbrella, with which I warded off several of the blows, I believe they only used their fists. They drove me up against the left side of the gateway, and there was still three or four about me; they detained me there several seconds, I concieved myself in danger, which prevented my crying out at first. I called out Stop thief! while the person who took my watch was in my sight; he went down Halfmoon-street, the prisoner was one of the three who remained with me while I was being struck - as soon as I could I got from them, and ran after the man, who had got my watch, calling Stop thief! I had not entirely lost sight of him - he got away with it - he was in a light dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, and say conscientiously whether you are positive he is one of the men, who hustled you - A. I have not the least doubt. I ran after the man who stole the watch, as far as the Halfmoon, in Halfmoon-street, and just as I got there several people came out of the public-house, who had heard the alarm - they said there was no chance of taking the man. Harding was one of them. On turning round as soon as I had spoke to them, I said,</p>
               <p>"Here is one of them," seeing the prisoner. Harding immediately took him; he made no resistance; he was taken into the public-house, and cried and said, he was innocent. This was hardly five minutes after the watch was taken</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How do you swear to me - A. I looked particularly at him, and know him from the notice I took.</p>

I looked in his face, knew him, and secured him.</p>

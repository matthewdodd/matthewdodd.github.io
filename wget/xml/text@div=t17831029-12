               <p>Court. Was you by when he was taken up? - No, Sir, I was in hold, and I sent for him to know how he came by that money and clothes.</p>
               <p>Did you hear, or did the officers tell you what he said? - No, Sir, I heard him confess after we were all taken up together, he said, he took the things out his own self, and no person was with him, but a man that he hired and paid porterage to; it was one Mr. Hopkins that asked him, and one Mr. Bishop was there, who lives at St. Catherine's.</p>

               <p>But you must say one way or the other? - I heard Mr. Hopkins say, if he would tell where the things were, and that he could get his property again, he should not be hurt.</p>
               <p>Court. Then I cannot take what he said after that promise; who was there besides? - Nobody else, that I know of.</p>
               <p>Who was Mr. Hopkins? - He keeps a public house at Bristol.</p>
               <p>How came he there? - He is the father-in-law of the lady that was robbed.</p>
               <p>When did you see the things there last? - I had been very lame and my child very ill, and I had not been there for three weeks or a month; and I sent another person in my stead that saw the goods.</p>
               <p>Who went in consequence of this confession to see for the goods? - Mr. Hopkins went himself, but who went with him I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I will acquaint your Lordship with the truth of what she lays against me; the 22d of August, I came to her house to lodge, and having lodged there some time, I went up with her son one morning, sitting at breakfast, she asked me to go up and bring down a pot of white paint or yellow paint, accordingly to oblige her, being my landlady, I did; and she gave me the key to go up; and some time after that, I was up at my mother-in-law's at breakfast, and she was with me, I was then in a little trouble, and says she, I have have had the selling of part of these goods myself, for Captain Smith brought a woman in the house, and she has robbed Mrs. Smith of part of her clothes, and I am to dispose of them, and some time after this, says she, as you have sold your property, and are acquainted with gentlemen, you may as well sell part of this gentleman's goods; so I took out the goods by her desire, and I sold several things, but not so many as are laid to my charge, I sold them at different times; and I hired a man, for I am a cripple, to go in open day-light, if I had known they were stolen goods I should not have gone in open day-light: I sold them to a gentleman who has known me many years.</p>
               <p>Court. So that all that was done, was by her desire?</p>

               <p>I bought two glasses and a warming pan, I went to the house of the last witness to see them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The night after I was in Bridewell, Mr. Hopkins and another gentleman came there, it was just at locking up time, and this woman was there, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290051"></xptr> another woman, who that lady has said carried out bundles; he asked me where the best feather bed was; I said, I sold them, but I sold them by orders; he said before the Keeper of Bridewell, if you will confess where they are, I will not ask you another question, he said, I have Mrs. Smith's orders not to hurt you, upon which I told him where the goods were, and when I was brought down the second time, the two women were cleared; then this woman who stands here now, turned round and said, thank God, I am cleared; forty pounds for you is as good as for another; every thing was found out as I had confessed.</p>

               <p>I was before the Justice, the looking glasses and the warming-pan were produced to me, I heard the prisoner say that he was in fault, and he would bring others as deep in the mine as himself, and the innocent he would clear; he confessed he was the person who took the looking glasses.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing to the beds? - I did not hear him say any thing of the beds; he has said now that I promised to forgive him, I was not in London at that time, I only heard him confess to the looking glasses, I never promised him any thing, but what the laws of his country would admit of, nor I heard nobody else.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. They came to you about the beds while you was in custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. And it was about the beds that they promised you?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes, he only asked where the best bed was, I have no witnesses, I have not a friend in the world, but your Lordship.</p>

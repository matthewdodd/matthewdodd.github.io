On or about the 1st of January, I was in Hammersmith church-yard, going home, and got into conversation with a woman, and walked with her. I had seen her before. The prisoner came up, and stopped me. I am sure of his person. I knew him well before, by seeing him in a boat. He was employed about the barges. He came up, and said something which I did not hear. I asked him if he meant to rob me of my watch. He said nothing to me, but got hold of it, and I got hold of it. We were both tussling for it together. He got it away, and 10 s. out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the woman - A. I do not know what became of her. We were walking together when he came up. They went off together, after robbing me. I did not know where she lived. I gave an alarm, but did not see him again till the 24th of July. I gave information as soon as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not cry out, Stop thief! - A. There was nobody there. I met a person, and told him of it. They went towards the water-side, and I followed them.</p>
               <p>Q. There are a good many houses about - A. Yes; I told several people of it two or three minutes after; as Walker, who is here came up, who had met the prisoner, and accosted him by his name. That was in my presence. I told the man the prisoner had robbed me of my watch and money. He said he knew him. He said,</p>
               <p>"Hallet, is that you?" and he answered Yes; and the woman was close by at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you immediately lay hold of him - A. No; they went off. I was four or five yards from them when the man spoke to him. I pursued as far as I could, and lost him. I had the woman taken up a few days after, and she was discharged. She lives somewhere in Hammersmith, but I do not know where. I was quite sober. I asked Walker where the prisoner lived, and understood it was on board a barge called the Good Intent. Walker did not run after them, but said he knew them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was not the woman you met a common prostitute - A. I did not know it then. I did not go with her for that purpose. I met her as I was going to the church-yard, between the Broadway and the church. She came up to me. I did not tell her to leave. I never charged her with the robbery. nor ever preferred a bill against her. I had her taken up for being in company with him. A bill went before the Grand Jury, and was thrown out.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, had not you the man taken up before Mr. Hanson, the Magistrate - A. Yes; I preferred the bill against the woman some time in April.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell his Lordship she was taken up four or five days after - A. It was in April, not before. I rather think it was in April. I quit forget when it was.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this man first taken up - A. On the 24th of July. He was never discharged. He was never taken up before by me or my directions. I knew he belonged to a barge.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not give information to the officer, and have him taken up - A. I did not; he was gone. I told the officer next morning that he belonged to the Good Intent. I knew that before the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you Mr. Walker taken up on this charge - A. Yes; at the time the girl was taken. I cannot say exactly when it was.</p>
               <p>Q. COURT. You have been in company with Walker; have you not learned from him when he was taken up - A. It was in April Sessions. I cannot say when it was, or in what month; Walker went as a witness against the woman. I did not charge him with the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, do not you know the man at the bar has been constantly in his employment, from January till he was apprehended, and be very cautious how you give your answer - A. The officers were after him every day. I do not know what he was about. I had been to the George, public-house, but was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, was not Walker locked up on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100075"></xptr>this charge all night with the woman - A. I believe he was a little while.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you not say you asked the prisoner whether he was going to take your watch - A. Yes; he had hold of it then.</p>

            . I am a smith, and live at Hammersmith. On the 1st of January, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I was going through the church-yard, and saw the prosecutor with a girl of the town. The prisoner was behind them, going the same way, towards the turnstile, to go into the town. As soon as they got out of the church-yard I lost sight of them. They went towards the town. There are houses all the way to the town. I passed the prisoner, and followed them through. I asked the prisoner if he knew who they were. The woman went by the name of

I had not heard of it till then. While the prisoner was behind them, the prosecutor said he had lost his watch. He did not say the prisoner had done it, or I could have taken him.</p>

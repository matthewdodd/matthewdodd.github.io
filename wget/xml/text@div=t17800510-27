               <p>I live close by the field. I keep a public-house; Mr. Waters puts up with me. Mr. Waters went out of town on Saturday, and left this cow, with three more in the field under my care. The three fat ones were to go to market on Monday morning; the other was to be taken care of till he came to town again. The salesman was to send for them. I saw the cow in the field on Sunday night at seven or eight o'clock; I missed her on the Monday. I enquired of every body whom I thought likely to give any information of her; but I did not hear of her till just as Mr. Waters came to town again, which was on the Wednesday following; then I found her in Mr. Martin's cow-house.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Martin. The prisoner came to my master's house on Sunday and told him, he had a cow in calf to sell, and he would make a rap between my master's fat cow and that if he thought proper. He asked my master to go up and look at this same cow; my master was very poorly, and he could not go on account of his milk; this was in the morning. He came down again in the afternoon to our house; then I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100036"></xptr>down with him; it was in the field along with the other three.</p>
               <p>You liked the cow did you? - Yes, she was likely to give some milk when she calved; I liked the looks of the cow well enough. I told my master the cow would suit him very well if they could agree.</p>
               <p>This is the cow which was found at your master's? - Yes the same cow.</p>
               <p>Did you go to drink at Mr. Hayes's? - Yes, we had a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Was that after you had seen the cow or before? - After. I paid for the beer myself, he was at the door with me, and drank part of the beer with me.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing about the cows to Mr. Hayes? - No.</p>
               <p>To Waters. Do you know the prisoner? - Yes; I have known him some years.</p>
               <p>Has he ever jobbed for you? - He lived with me about fifteen years ago.</p>
               <p>Did he ever use to drive your cattle for you? - He does as many at Islington do; when people buy cattle; they take them home. He has been a drover twenty years I suppose or better.</p>
               <p>You had not ordered him to sell this cow for you, had you? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Is he a married man? - Yes, we have two of his children in our workhouse; his wife has run away.</p>
               <p>PRISONER'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I lived in the prisoner's family five years; I lived with his brother from the beginning of his business to his ending; I have sold him a good many beasts in my life on time or other; he asked me to take the three beasts to market; he must have somebody and I might as well take them. I said that cow would not stay by herself; he said if I could find any body who would give a tolerable good price for her, I might sell her; I went down to Scotch Johnny; I have trusted him twenty pounds at a time. He has always behaved very civil; I had no thoughts of any thing of this. Somebody robbed me of two or three guineas of the money I sold the cow for, and I was ashamed to go to Mr. Waters, or this would not have happened.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. Did you tell him he might sell them? - I would not have put him in trust to sell a cow for me. He asked to drive the three fat beasts to market for me? I said he might take them down; I would give him sixpence to take them down. Mr. Hayes had particular charge to take care of this cow, and to give her hay.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I drove the three fat cows down to market on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He delivered these three cows very safe to Mr. Bransworth; the cow he had of this man he put to one Lost to sell; he took the money she sold for and ran away.</p>
               <p>To Hayes. When you missed the cow on the Monday morning were the three fat cows remaining there? - No; they were all gone; then I enquired of the salesman at night; he told me this man had brought the three fat cows down to him. I thought then that the other cow had gone out of the field after them.</p>

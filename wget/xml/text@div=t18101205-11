            . On Thursday, the 22d of November, I, in company with Bishop, met the prisoner with a man named Bennett, near the barquin Broker-row, Moorfields: he had the piece of black cambric in a handkerchief under his arm; he said, the cambric was his own, and if we would go to Mr. Snow, his master, he would satisfy us. We all went to Mr. Snow, and shewed him this piece of black cambric. We went with the prisoner to his apartment, No. 2, Rope-maker-street; I found a woman there, with three children, she knew Mr. Snow; I found in a drawer, in the room, four remnants of brown Irish, and several pieces of black cambric, all remnants.</p>

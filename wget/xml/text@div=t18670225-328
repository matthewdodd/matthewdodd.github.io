                  </hi>. I am foreman of the C jetty, Victoria Docks—the <hi rend="italic">Thomas Snowdon</hi> was discharging her cargo there on 5th February—I engaged Biley and Fitch about 9 a.m., and White about 12.30—I saw them up to 5.30, they were then sober—I went into the hold soon after seven, and found White lying quite insensible on some loose grain—I turned him over, but could make nothing of him, I sent for a constable, and on further search found Biley forward, standing on some cases of brandy, and near him were two cases which had been broken open—he was drunk, but not insensible, we had to lead him up the ladder—Fitch was also drunk, but not so bad as Biley—three cases were broken, but the third not enough to extract the bottles—I missed ten bottles of brandy from one of the cases—I saw a broken bottle of brandy near where White was lying, the neck was off and could not be found—we were at work till eight, the regular hours are nine to four—the men leave for dinner at twelve o'clock, and return at twenty minutes past—no beer or spirits is allowed in the docks after two in the day—I produce another broken bottle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">White. Q.</hi> Did you find it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, the boatswain gave it to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Fitch. Q.</hi> Where did you see me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the beam, where you had no business to be—you were drunk, and close to you were some broken bot<lb></lb>tles—I assisted you out of the hold, aud saw you come ashore.</p>

                  </hi>. I am head constable of Victoria Docks—on 5th Febru<lb></lb>ary, about 7.30 p.m., I was in the station when the prisoners were brought there—White was so senselessly drunk that we were obliged to send for a</p>

               <p>doctor—the others were not so bad—when I went to the vessel it was closed, but next morning I went into the hold as soon as the hatches were off, and found two cases broken open, and nine bottles missing from one, and one from the other—I found several bottles broken to pieces, and three others with the necks off, and a portion of brandy in each of them; also the neck of a bottle with the capsule on and the cork in it near the broken bite.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">White. Q.</hi> Did not I walk very well to the station? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We kept you about two hours, because you could not walk at all, and then you were assisted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Biley. Q.</hi> Did not you say, "I do not know what to do about locking Biley up, he is not drunk," and did not Cowcutt say, "Lock him up, we shall get some information out of him?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect speaking to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">White's Defence.</hi> I went outside the dock with a mate, and had a glass of rum and a drop of ale, and I had nothing to eat, as I had pawned my bedding during the hard weather. I went to the ship, felt giddy, and sat down. I never had a drop of drink in the ship. If there were ten bot<lb></lb>tles of brandy missing, there were forty or fifty men there, and some of them were drunk. I have worked in the docks since 1854, and should not be likely to take brandy and get my living taken away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Fitch's Defence.</hi> I was no more drunk than I am now. I got up the stancheons of the boat, because there was no ladder, and when I got ashore they took me in custody. This capsule may have been thrown on my coat; ray pockets are very large.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Biley's Defence.</hi> My jacket was thrown up to me, and I caught it, put it on, got over the ship's side, and, stepped ashore, the ship being two or three feet from the side. I said to one of the officers, "Can you call me drunk? I can walk as well as ever I could, being lame." At the station I heard Mr. Grigg say, "I do not know what to do about locking Biley up." Cowcutt said, "Lock him up, now we have got him here; we may learn some information from him."</p>

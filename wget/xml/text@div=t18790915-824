I saw the prisoners with another lad in Nichol Street, on 28th August, about 6.10 a.m.—Riley was carrying this sack on his back—Dalton had a coat under his arm, and the third boy was carrying another coat—I stopped Riley, and asked what he had in the sack—he said boots that were made by his father, and he was going to take them to Islington for him—he was wearing this waistcoat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I examined Mrs. Roach's house about 10 o'clock, and found a shutter pulled down, and a pane in the back window had been taken out large enough to admit an ordinary man.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 79, Church Street, Bethnal Green—on 27th August I fastened the premises, and put up the shutters—the door was bolted at 8 p.m.—Riley came into my shop at about 11.30, and looked all round the place, and I was afraid to serve him—I said, "It is rather late"—he said, "Yes. I leave off work late"—he tried on a pair of boots, and said one was narrow and the other too long, and I said, "We can get you a pair"—next morning I found the back door had been opened, and a pane of glass cut clean out of the window, and the shutter wrenched out—I missed seven pairs of boots from the window, and a coat and waistcoat belonging to my husband.</p>

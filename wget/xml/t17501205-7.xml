I am apprentice to Mr. Sample; I was at this time coming out of a house two doors from my master's; I went to knock at my master's door, a man call'd to me from over the way, and said, he'd give me sixpence to go of an errand for him; I said, I would not go; he said I should, and put his hand to my shoulder, and forc'd me away; I went to an alehouse, and said, I thought there were thieves in our house.</p>

               <p>Bonwick. I cannot say it was he; then I heard

I saw the prisoner facing the door run up the street; I follow'd him, and did not lose fight of him till he was taken: as he ran he threw away a dark lanthorn, and a hanger; they were produc'd in court. I cry'd, stop thief, and three men laid hold of him; then I saw him sling away the tankard. I am sure this was the man. On his cross examination, he said, the prisoner turn'd to the right hand, into Chandos-street; that he threw the tankard down with his right hand, towards the houses.</p>

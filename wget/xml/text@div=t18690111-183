               <p>packed up by the last witness, and I took it to 18, Gresham Street—it Was an office, with the name of "J.

Venables and pay for it altogether if I would accompany him he had a pattern of cloth in his hand—as we were going along, he said he wanted to call at a warehouse in Queen Street—he went into Messrs. Bevington's leather ware house, in Budge Row—that warehouse has two entrances, one in Cannon Street and the other in Budge Row—he told me to wait outside—he went in and Dame out again shortly, and said he was sorry to keep me so long, but he should not be many minutes now—he went into the warehouse again, and came out a second time, and asked me if I would have some cooper he said he wanted a receipt stamp, to receipt a bill—I happened to have one in my pocket, and I gave it to him—he went back into the warehouse spin, and did not return—I waited for some time, and then went inside—he was not there—they said he had gone out the other way next morning, I went with Monger, the police officer, to the prisoner's residence in Wen<lb></lb>lock Street, City Road, and gave him into custody—he said if we would let him off he would tell where the cloth was—he said the other man had part of it.</p>

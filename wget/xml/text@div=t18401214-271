                  </hi>. I am servant to Joseph Baxendale and others. On the 30th of November, about five o'clock in the evening, I was driving a cart of theirs which had an empty box in it—in Fleet-lane, Farringdon-street, I heard a noise behind, and on looking round I saw the prisoner with the box out of the cart—I cannot say that he had it on his head, but he had it up—I hallooed out, "Halloo"—he threw it down again—I jumped out of the cart, followed, and overtook him without losing sight of him.</p>

On Monday evening, the 5th of March, about eight o'clock, I was down in the kitchen, my mistress was sitting in the parlour, my fellow-servant was in the kitchen with me; there was a fire in the neighbourhood, and my mistress ran up stairs to see it; she called me, and I ran up to the two pair of stairs, I perceived the trap-door thrown down, which led to my room - we go up a step-ladder to it, there was a tiling over the trap door; I could have opened the trap-door. My mistress's is a corner house, at the end of the row, it joins the next house; a person could come from one roof to the other; the next house was uninhabited. I ran down stairs into the street, and called out there were thieves in the house. I saw Mr. Raccine, who was coming to our house, to spend the evening. I and Mr. Raccine went up stairs into the rooms, and saw the clothes laying on the top of the tiles - they were my clothes and my fellow servant's. They were in drawers under my box. The constable took them. I saw two men come out of the empty house.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this - After I came down stairs with Mr. Raccine. We went out into the street, and saw two men come out of the empty house, it was about five minutes after I heard the trap-door shut. Mr. Raccine took the first that came out, it was the prisoner. I did not know him before, the other ran away. I lost eight gowns, eight pair of stockings, three petticoats, and some caps.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. What communication was there between this and the next house - A. There are trap-doors on the roof. I was up stairs ten minutes before. The trap-door leads to our bed-room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Nobody at the top of the house could get to the trap-door without breaking in - A. They must break our bed-room window to get in. I was in the room between four and five o'clock; the window was then fastened with a bolt, as usual. I found it open after the alarm. Nobody was up stairs after I saw it bolted. They did not break the window, but forced it open.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You saw it fastened between four and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110025"></xptr>and five o'clock - A. Yes; nobody went up afterwards, except my fellow-servant. My mistress is an old lady - she never goes up there - the ladder leads to it. The bundle of clothes was given in at the window to me - I gave it to the constable, without opening it.</p>

                  </hi>I am ten years old, and live with my father, in Dyott-street, Seven Dials, in the three-pair back-room—I had the key of the room, and I opened it, and went in, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon on the 3rd of June—I was eating a bit of bread and butter, and had left the room-door open—the prisoner came in—I had not seen her before—she said she would play with me, but instead of playing with me, she tied me with a rope to the bedstead—she then broke open my father's box with the poker, and said if I made a noise she would kill me—she took may father's clothes out of the box, and went down stairs with then—she did not untie me before she went—I was tied there from half<lb></lb>past three o'clock till half-past seven, when my father came home.</p>

                  </hi>I rent the three pair back-room, in Dyott-street. On the 3rd of June, at half-past seven o'clock, when I came from work, I found my little boy tied to the bedstead—on Friday, between seven and eight o'clock, we were going to market, and he saw the prisoner going along the street—he said that was the woman that had tied him to the bedstead, and we gave her in charge—the policeman found my clothes in pawn—the prisoner is quite a stranger to me—this is my property—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—my box was locked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. There was no lock to the box these nine months; I have been living with him nine months, and the woman in the parlour told the policeman so when he went to her. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I have seen her in the street, but she never lived with me.</p>

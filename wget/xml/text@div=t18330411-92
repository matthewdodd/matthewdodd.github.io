On the 6th of March, between eight and nine in the evening, I was sent up stairs with a pint of beer, to a lodger - I saw the prisoner coming from the room where this property had been; I thought it had been Mrs. Lamb - but the person I took the beer for, opened their door and showed a light; I then saw the prisoner and stopped her - she dropped this shirt and apron, which had been on a chair by the window.</p>

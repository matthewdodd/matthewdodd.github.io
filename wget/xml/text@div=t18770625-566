I am the son of Henry Williams, who keeps a dairy, and live at 58, Swinton Street, about 1.30 a.m., on May 29th, I was awoke by hearing the cry of thieves—I pulled up the blind, lighted the gas, put my coat on and went down—I met my father on the stairs; I went into the office and found the window open and the table cover on the floor, I opened the street door and saw the prisoner, in the hands of a constable; I had seen the house all safe the night before—I noticed the mark of a knife on the sash!</p>

Street, when I heard a noise—I examined the doors and found all fastened, I stopped a few minutes and heard a whisper—I knocked, rang the bell, and called "Thieves"—I then stood back in the doorway and saw three faces at the window—the men then said "Kill him, do for him "—there was a Venetian blind to the window, I took out my truncheon and struck the first that came out, who got up and ran away as I secured the prisoner—Mr. Williams' son then came down, and I took the prisoner to the station—I found this piece of candle in the office, and the piece of wire gauze blind was laid on the floor—there was also a mark on the two sashes—next morning I found this knife stuck in the ground.</p>

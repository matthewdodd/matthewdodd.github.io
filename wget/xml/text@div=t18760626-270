                  </hi>. I am the wife of Benjamin Belhouse, a builder of 11, Queen Street, Tower Hill—on the morning of 6th June, Abrahams came in in a very excited state and said that he had been in India and had been very ill, and a Mr. Bowling had been very kind to him there, and he had brought him some horns and six parrots—he asked me where Mr. Bowling lived—I could not tell him, but said that if he waited till my husband came in, perhaps he could tell him—he asked me three times if I was a Christian lady, and got hold of my hand, and said that he would not sell his birds or give them to Jews, but he would give them to me—Lazarus afterwards came in—they went out for a few minutes and Lazarus came back with the horns and put them on the floor, Abrahams followed him and broke a square of glass—my husband came in and Abrahams asked for Mr. Bowling, and said that he had brought the birds for him—my husband said that a Mr. Beaumont, a brush maker, lived there—Abrahams said that was not the man, and then he asked for a hammer—my husband gave him one, and he said that he would smash the horns up because he could not find Mr. Bowling—my husband said that it was a pity to break them up, and offered him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—he said "Give me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more for my man," and then he asked for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more, but I would not give it to him—Abrahams told my husband that the parrots were next door, at the public-house, and went out to fetch them, he came back and said the birds had gone to King's Cross; my husband said "I must go with you to King's Cross," my husband went out and I heard no more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, of 11, Queen's Street, Tower Hill—on 6th June, at 9 a.m., Lazarus came to my shop with some horns and Arahams followed him, and asked for a man named Bowling—I said there was such a man living in the same street some time ago, and I would go and see if I could find him—I went out and returned and saw Abrahams in the next house, which is a public-house, he came in again in a hurry, and said he would not stop any longer for he had been deceived before when he came from abroad, and asked me for a hammer to smash the horns up, I said "Don't do that,"he said"Will you give me 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them altogether"—I said "Yes," for he was kicking up a row that I did not know what I was about—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he said "Give me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my man"—I then began to think I was going to be duped—I went to my next door neigh<lb></lb>bour, and before I got to the house I saw the prisoners running away—he had said that the parrots were next door and went there, and said he would bring them, and came back and said that the man had taken them to King's Cross—I ran after the prisoners, they ran through a public-house, and so did I—they ran into John Street, Minories, where they jumped into a policeman's arms.</p>

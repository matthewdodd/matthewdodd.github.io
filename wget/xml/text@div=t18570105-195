On the night of 30th Nov., at half past 10 o'clock at night, I fastened the house safe—next morning I discovered this robbery—a pane of glass had been taken out of the skylight, and some things were missing—I sent word to the station house directly—a person could not get into house, he could only get his arm in, the iron bars are only about four inches apart—my house is not more than 300 yards from the Curtain-road—when I went to the top of my house I detected the robbery—I found the wrappers in which the goods had been; they had untied the wrappers in the house, and taken the articles out separately, and the wrappers were left outside on the roof—I have looked at the property that was in the bundle—the articles were mine in trust, they were pawned with me—they were all in the warehouse—one blanket is marked, and the person to whom it belongs identifies it—I am sure the things were all safe at half past 10 o'clock at night—I know this table cloth, or d'oyley cover, that was round the prisoner's neck; it had been round one blanket—here are ten blankets, and other articles—I am certain they are all such as I missed—they must have been three or four hours in doing what they did—it would take them a long time.</p>

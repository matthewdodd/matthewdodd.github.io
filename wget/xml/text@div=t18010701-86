             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. I am a drover out of the country; on Sunday night, the 14th of June, I drove 298 sheep and lambs into <placeName id="t18010701-86-crimeloc468">Smithfield market</placeName>

            .</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of that enquiry did you see the prisoner? - A. I saw him between five and six o'clock; he is a pen-man; I asked him three times and he denied knowing any thing at all of them; Mr. Key came to the market about a quarter before eight on Monday morning, and I told him of it; then in consequence of information that I received, I went to the Golden Horse in Goswell-street, where I found them shut up in a coach-house; they were the same lambs that I had lost, with the marks altered; there was another mark down the neck of each.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there such marks remaining upon these two lambs as to enable you to swear they were the same two lambs that you lost? - A. Yes, there are marks on them that I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Then the marks are not altered, but added to? - A. Yes; I then went to the market and the prisoner was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Parker? - A. Yes; Parker was present when the prisoner was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. - Q. When you say you asked the prisoner, and he said he did not know any thing of them, did you tell him the marks as you have now? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the prisoner said he had not seen lambs with these marks? - A. He knew the lambs as well as I did.</p>
               <p>JEREMIAH PIGEON sworn. - I am a coachman, and live with Mr. Davis in Golden-Horse-yard, Aldersgate-street; my coach stands in that yard; on Monday morning, the 15th of June, about a quarter before four in the morning I saw the prisoner coming down; I am sure he is the same man; I was washing my coach; he came down and said he had got some sheep there, and he would thank me if I would give an eye to them, and he would give me sixpence; I said I will, how long will you be gone? he said about half an hour; in about half an hour Parker came, then I saw the prisoner coming down the yard; I said to Parker, this is the person that left the lambs; they were all in the yard together, all laying down but one sheep; when Parker came, nobody went near them or disturbed them from the time the man left them, till he returned back.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, were there not some lambs, in some other place? - A. There were no lambs in no other place that had been sorted from the sheep, till that man that left them came back again; he said I should like to leave two lambs here; Parker then said here are two halters, I will lend you; he said it will not do so well to have halters, it will hurt their horns, or they might get loose; Parker looked about, and saw Mr. Key's place open; I said they would do in there, there are doors to it, which shut and lock up; he put them in there, and then Parker said, I shall have a nice jaunt back to Bow with these two lambs; I went about my business, and he took them away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did he not say they were lambs that had strayed to his flock,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010077"></xptr>and therefore would not take them to market? - A. I did not hear him say so.</p>
               <p>Q. He said, tying them by the horns would do them a mischief? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you considered this as a fair transaction? - A. Yes; I did not imagine there was any thing wrong.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know what the man brought them there for? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the doors shut? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when these doors were shut, you could not see? - A. No.</p>

               <p>- PARKER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. I came down the yard, and saw the sheep in the stable; I was talking to Pigeon, and in the mean time the prisoner came; he said, I will give you a shilling if you will lock them up for me; I said, we have no room for them, but I can get a couple of halters, and you can tie them under that coach, they will be safe there; he said, no, the children might play tricks with them; then I put them into Mr. Key's place; he gave me a shilling, and said, don't you think I shall have a fine piece of work to take these two down to Bow; I said, I think so, and he went away; four or five hours afterwards I went with Mr. Key and another man to Smithfield, there I saw the prisoner, and he said, did not I give you a shilling to take care of them till I came to fetch them at twelve o'clock to have them down to Bow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The story that he told you relative to these lambs, he repeated again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he, at the time you desired him to halter them, or at any other time claim them as his own? - A.No.</p>
               <p>A.What are you? - A. A horsekeeper.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you live near Smithfield? - A. I live in Little Sutton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know, that when sheep are driving, they will sometimes stray? - A. Yes; I afterwards shewed them to Burbidge.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Burbidge). Were the lambs that this witness shewed you, the same that you had lost? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Parker). What was the conduct of the prisoner? - A. He made a great difficulty in being taken; he said he knew nothing about the lambs, he did not know whose they were; I then went home and went to work; I heard Mr. Billings say, Jack, I do think you stole these lambs, and he said he did not.</p>
               <p>NAAMAN KEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. Q. Did you see any lambs upon your premises? - A. Yes, I saw them; I then went to Smithfield, and made some enquiries, Burbidge went with me, and owned the lambs; after that two officers came to me, my man went with them, and the prisoner was apprehended.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. I am servant to Mr. Curtis; I saw the sheep and lambs at Holloway.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the two sheep that you saw at Mr. Key's, two of the sheep that you had seen at Holloway? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were sorted in Smithfield, there were two missing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN BUTTS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. I am drover to Mr. Billings; about half past eleven at night, I saw the prisoner; I did not see him again till half past four o'clock on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, which was read as follows:</p>
               <p>"My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. The drover drove the sheep and lambs, 206 in number; he told me that he believed I should find some strange sheep, and when I parted my sheep and lambs in the last lot, I found, instead of 33, there were 35, upon which I conjectured that my man had brought them from Mr. Porter's field, from which place he had brought six wrong sheep the Friday before, which I returned to Mr. Elliott; Mr. Burbidge asked me if I had seen two lambs, upon which I asked him how they were marked; he told me, one white lamb, branded on the the near side, and the other was marked loin and rump; I told him I had none of that kind, they not answering the marks which Burbidge describes, so that I left Burbidge, and went about my business.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>JOHN ADAMS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am drover to the prisoner; I drove 206 sheep and lambs from Mile-end to Smithfield; I came by Church-street and Bishopsgate-street, up Aldersgate-street, where the whole broke away, and went up Aldersgate-street; I headed them, and turned them back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it an uncustomary thing in driving all at one time, for the sheep to get into a wrong drove? - A.Very frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether that happened to your master lately, and whether any sheep were returned in consequence of it? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q.However, it is not uncommon? - A. It very frequently happens; I said to the prisoner when I got to Smithfield, that I really thought there were some strange ones among them, by their fighting and not agreeing, and that I had six from Mr. Elliott the Friday before, I thought they might belong to him, they had been returned the Friday before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q.You drove them to Smithfield-market? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the trouble of looking when you got there? - A. No; I told my master.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The first thing you do when you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010078"></xptr>get to Smithfield is to put them into the pens? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you separate them and look them over? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who generally does that? - A. I do, only I did not stop that night, because there were but few, and therefore my master did it himself.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you got to Smithfield market that night? - A.Near eleven.</p>
               <p>- SHARPE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am clerk of Smithfield-market; the prisoner has been my servant these seven years, I have always found him honest and a most upright man in whatever he has done with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you mean to say that that has been his uniform general character? - A. As far as I have had any dealings with him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is his duty? - A. I depend upon him for the account of the number of sheep in the pens; I have never found him any way deficient; if there is a shilling to be got, at all times he always brought it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You are called here to speak to his general character, do you mean, that uniformly and without exception, he has borne an honest character? - A. I cannot say so much to his general character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was recommended to his Majesty's mercy by the Jury on account of his good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the clerks at the Marlborough Street Police Court—I was there on the 19th and 26th February—Parrock and' Cook were brought there charged with stealing a portmanteau, the property of Sir George Jenkinson—the defendant, Sergeant Brannan, was the first 'witness called in support of the charge—I took down the evidence that he then gave—no professional men were engaged on either side on the first occasion—Parrock cross-examined him—after other witnesses were called there was an adjournment until the 26th February—on that occasion Brannan was examined afresh—he gave his evidence again—I took it down—to the best of my belief Mr. Knox asked him if he would like to give his evidence again, entirely from the beginning, and he did so; he began again entirely—I thought his manner was very strange on the first occasion; I thought he seemed confused—his evidence was read over to him—I am not certain whether it was read over to him on that occasion; I think it was on some other occasion, and he signed it—I have the original depositions here—the charge sheet was put before the Magistrate—ultimately Tarrock and Cook were discharged.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The deposition of the defendant on 19th February was read, in which he stated that at</hi> 12.30 <hi rend="italic">that morning he was in Talbot Road, Notting Hill, and saw Parrock and Cook standing by a green cart drawn by a grey horse; that he went up and they left; that he examined the cart and found the portmanteau; that the prisoners returned with a man not in custody, and kept going backwards and forwards near the cart, that he pursued them and lost sight of them, but afterwards took them into custody. In a further deposition on 26th February he stated that lie concealed himself in a doorway and saw Parrock come towards the cart with a man not in custody, place his foot on the step or wheel, and put his right hand into the, trap, and he and the other man then went round the corner in the direction of the Portobello Road; that Parrock returned with Cook and went of before they saw him, and he then came out and pursued them but lost sight of them; and that he then examined the cart and found the jemmy and knife; that on taking Cook into custody he told her it was for being con<lb></lb>cerned with a man in stealing a portmanteau, and that she first denied being with the man and then admitted it.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. The charge sheet was before Mr. Knox on the 19th—the magistrate never hears a charge without having the charge sheet before him; it is rather before me as the Clerk, and it is handed up to the Magistrate if he wishes to see it—it does not always contain a list of the property found—I can't say whether the knife and <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> was in it on 19th February—I did not know on the first occasion that Brannan had been thirty days on the sick list, and had only gone on duty the night before, until he stated it—I am not certain whether it was on the first or second occasion—it is, I think, correct that on the first occasion the Magis<lb></lb>trate addressed him with considerable severity—I have been there about seven years—I have seen persons confused before Mr. Knox, I don't know whether it has been when Mr. Kuox has addressed them—on the first occasion nothing was said, I think, about the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> and knife—I have heard to-day, for the first time, that it was there in Court in the helmet of a police-constable—Mr. Knox allowed Parrock to go on his own recognizance on the first occasion, and Cook also—he remanded them for a week—I believe, on the second occasion, Brannan said that he was confused on the former occasion, and he asked to be allowed to give his evidence over again, and the Magistrate allowed that to be done—on that second occasion, besides Brannan, Varnham and Young were examined—on the first occasion there was Brannan, Varnham, Young, and Hart, police-constables, Edward Lee, the footman to Sir George Jenkinson, William Bryant, of 96, Stan hope Street, cab driver, and Henry West, the owner of the horse and cart—on the second day Brannan and Henry George, 360 X, were examined—there was then a remand till the 28th, when Inspector Hole and Henry Drewitt, 37 X, the sergeant who took the charge, were examined—Varn ham was recalled, Young recalled, Hannah recalled, and John Newman, the manager of the Green Yard, who found <hi rend="italic">the jemmy wad</hi> knife; that com<lb></lb>pleted the evidence—the prisoners then made their statements, and after that Ship and Goldsworthy and Richmond were called for the defence—I think on the second occasion Mr. Knox asked Brannan why he had not produced the knife <hi rend="italic">and jemmy</hi> on the first occasion; he asked about it generally, how it was that it was not produced—he discharged the prisoners on the 28th—I fancy Mr. Knox said that he was glad he had never kept the man in custody for a moment, that he had allowed him to go out on his own recognizance, and that the non-production of the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> and knife</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187410260005"></xptr>
               <p>was conclusive to his mind—he said to Parrock that if he wished to take out a summons or to proceed against Brannan for perjury he would give him the necessary process—when the perjury summons was applied for by Parrock Mr. Knox sat and heard the case—there are two Magistrates at Marlborough Street, Mr. Knox and Mr. Newton—any of the other Stipendiary Magistrates can sit there—on the occasion of the summons against Brannan Mr. Edward Lewis, I think, was the solicitor acting for Parrock—he called the witnesses—Mr. Warner Sleigh appeared for Brannan—the two constables, Ship and Goldsworthy, had been examined for the defence of Parrock on the 28th—I don't recollect whether Mr. Knox suggested that they should be called again on behalf of Parrock—I don't remember his making use of the expression that with regard to Parrock and Brannan he must hangone or the other—I think he said something to the effect that if he discovered the charge of perjury against Brannan, he should be imputing something to Parrock; and if he committed Brannan for trial he should be lending himself to the charge of Parrock—I think Ship and Goldsworthy attended and Mr. Lewis refused to call them—I think Mr. Sleigh protested, and said that they ought to be put into the box for the prosecution—f think Parrock stated that he could not find the woman Charlwood; she was known at the time as <hi rend="italic">Carry</hi> Baxter—I believe Parrock said he had made every endeavour to find her and could not do so—I believe Inspector Eccles said he thought he could find the woman to-morrow—I do not remember whether she was there at the next examination—I remember Mr. Lewis refusing to call her—I remember Mr. Knox saying that she and Cook were not a bit alike—I now remember the two women standing there—I think Rose Parker or one of the witnesses said that looking at the women from behind she could not tell one from the other—I don't know of my own knowledge that Mr. Knox went to the place where the cart had been standing—I believe he did, I was not there—T believe that Charlwood was in Court, and that Mr. Lewis declined to call her—I think on the previous occasion there was a suggestion that Brannan was keeping her out of the way—I believe she never was called at the Police Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The examination of the witness on the first occasion took some time—Mr. Knox addressed Brannan with some severity—Parrock cross-examined him and asked him some questions which had some relation to police duties, and Brannan said "I decline to answer"—Mr. Knox desired him to answer and I think he then said "That has to do with police duty and I decline to answer"—Mr. Knox then said "Are you aware that I can commit you for contempt of Court if you do not answer the question 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>" or something to that effect—"I desire you to answer the question," and he then did so—Brannan was more confused in the examina<lb></lb>tion in chief; in the cross-examination he answered tolerably distinctly—on the second occasion he gave his evidence from the commencement; and he was then examined by both the defendants—he did not mention the knife and <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> on the first occasion.</p>

I live at 32, Addison Road North, Notting Hill—I was living there in February last—I was in the employment of John Taylor as a clicker in the boot and leather warehouse, and I am in his service still—I have been in his service since the 22nd July, 1872; pre<lb></lb>vious to that I had been a police-constable—I was in the force two years and three months—I left on the 15th July, 1872—I was in the <hi rend="italic">X</hi> Division and was stationed part of the time at Kilburn and part of the time at Notting Hill; the first part of the time at Notting Hill—I was dismissed from the force for neglect of duty—I knew the defendant Brannan; he was station serjeant at Notting Hill Station part of the time—I know a police-constable of the name of Hannah; he was in the same division, and I at one time lodged in the same house—I don't remember seeing Brannan after leaving the force until this matter occurred; on Ash-Wednesday, 18th of February, I left my home about 7.30 in the evening; I went to Bolton Road and various other places up to about 10 o'clock; I can give all the places if necessary—I met some woman; I don't know who she was at all—that was near the Admiral Blake—I walked with her through Salter's Fields, Lancaster Road; that is at Notting Hill, and we went through a farm—that was about 9.45, and while we were going through the farm we met two constables nun; d</p>

               <p>Ship and Goldsworthy—they were in plain clothes—I heard one of them say to the other "Come on Jack, we will go this way," and they went in the direction of the Earl of Percy public-house—I knew them both as constables—I did not speak to them at all—I went after that into the Lancaster Road, and ultimately to the Clarendon Road, Notting Hill, and the woman left me there—I. don't know at all who she was; she was a woman I had picked up—from the Clarendon Road I went down Blenheim Crescent to the Blenheim Arms—I should say I had been in the woman's company about an hour—before I got to the Blenheim Arms I met George Richmond, who is an old friend of mine—we both come from Yarmouth—I can't say exactly whether I met him by appointment or by accident, I think it was by accident—I went with him to the Blenheim Arms; that was about 10.30, I believe; we remained there until 12 o'clock—before we left, Richmond asked the barmaid for a stamp—he got the stamp—I don't know to whom the letter was addressed—I saw the landlord there, and the barmaid and the potman—when we left the house was being closed—I spoke to the potman and bade him "Good night"—Richmond and I then went up Kensington Park Road a little way until we came to Elgin Road, and we went to Cuff's Post Office there—Richmond was not able to post his letter there, and we then went along the Elgin Road and up the Col<lb></lb>ville Road to the pillar box, which is just opposite the church, where Richmond posted his letter—after doing that we went westwards down the Talbot Road—I saw two constables there, Young and Hannah—they were standing against a cart—I did not notice the cart, but there was a grey horse in it—I should say it was 40 or 50 yards from the Portobello Road, and on the south side of the road—they would be between the comer of Colville Square and Portobello Road—they were in uniform—I knew them, and as I passed I spoke to them—I believe Hannah spoke to me first, and said "How are you getting on how are you off for-work—I said" Don't talk about work; it is time to go to bed"—we were standing against the "cart all four of us then, either Hannah or Young said "Good night," and went in the easterly direction; that is the way we had come—we went towards the Portobello Road, about 6 or 8 yards, and then I stopped because of the abruptness of Hannah; me and him were very good friends when we were in the Police, and he seemed very abrupt that night—when I stopped I said so to Richmond, and then we went on—I did not walk back a step—we went down the Portobello Road and parted company of the corner of Lancaster Road and Portobello Road—Portobello Road is a very long road and runs right through the Talbot Road—it was about 12.15 or 12.20 when we passed the cart, and about 12.30 or 12.40 when I parted company with Richmond—after I left him I went down Lancaster Road as far as Lad broke Grove Road and saw the same two constables who I had seen in Salter's Fields, Ship and Goldsworthy, and also a constable named George—there were four constables; they were taking some horses to. The Green Yard—we had some conversation, some joking—after they had gone I went a little way up Ladbroke Grove Road and down the Cornwall Road, where I spoke to a person I have since recognised as Caroline Charlwood—I did not know her at the time—I went with her up Bolton Road to the coffee stall kept by William Edney at the corner of Norfolk Terrace and Ledbury Road—I had passed the defendant, Sergeant Brannan, right against Cuff's, the Post Office in Portobello Road—Sergeant Varnham was. with him, and Hannah was standing against the shutters within 20 yards of them—I spoke</p>

It was on Ash Wednesday night that I first spoke to Parrock—I met him close to Cuff's Post Office about 22.50 or 12.55—I had been to the Metropolitan Music Hall—I walked from there to the Edgware Road Station and got out at Notting Hill—I stood talking to a young friend of mine there and got to Cuff's Post Office about 12.50 or 12.55—I was only with Parrock three quarters of an hour—I was after wards summoned as a witness to the Police Court—I was stopped with a paper in Portabella Road—I was at the Police Court when Brannan was committed for trial; that was on the 9th of April—I had not seen Mr. Barnard the Solicitor, or Brannan, or any one connected with the case at that time—I was only at Marlborough Street Police Court on one occasion, and on that occasion Mr. Lewis declined to all me as a witness against Brannan—I had come along Blenheim Crescent into the Portobello Road when Parrock came up and said "Where are you going to?"—I said "I am hurrying home, don't you think it is high time?"and then we went across by Patch's the baker's, and it was there I saw the three constables standing at the corner—Parrock came closer to me and said "I would not have them see me for a gold watch or a pension"—I said "Why not?"and he said "Nothing much"—I went with him up the Bolton Road to the corner of the Ledbury Road, and there I said I would have a cup of coffee, and he ordered two cups and paid for them, and before I could drink it my brother-in-law came up, and not wishing that he should see me out so late at night, I turned my back and walked away, and Parrock told the coffee stall man to put the cup on one side till-1 came back, and we walked to the arch and watched for my brother-in-law to go away, and we then returned and finished the coffee; we then left and went to the corner of West bourne Grove, where there is a letter pillar box, and it was there that we had the conversation about his being a policeman on duty, and he pointed to a place there, where he said the policemen were in the habit, of</p>

               <p>going down for a couple of hours to sleep in the cab or cabs, and he asked me to wait for him while he went to speak to a policeman whom he said had gone down the mews—I saw a policeman go by, but he walked straight up, he did not go down the mews—Parrock did not speak to any policeman although he said he was going to—I said that I would not wait—he asked me to go to a room with him, and I said no, I would go home—he said he was late the evening before and could not get to the station for his money, so that he must go there then, and could not stop—he said he would send me some money to the post office; that was when he was soliciting me to go to a room—I said "If you have a wife you had better go home to her"—he said he was a single man—it was the 27th April when Brannan took me by the railway to Mr. Barnard's office—I was not quite sober when I got there—Brannan was not there—I told Mr. Barnard I was not going to false swear for any one, and he said "The best thing you can do is to speak the truth, and nothing but the truth"—I made a statement to him, and put my name to it—he read it over to me before I signed it, and I said it was quite right—Mr. Barnard, I believe, told me I should have to attend the Sessions—I had a letter afterwards and went to Mr. Wontner's office—Parrock and Richmond took me there; that was after I had been brought here as a witness by Mr. Barnard, the solicitor, to whom I made that statement—when I went to Mr. Wontner's there was nobody in the room but Mr. Wontner's clerk when I made my statement—they called me and I went in the room by myself—Parrock and, Richmond went in before I went in—I have had half-a-crown each time I have been to Mr. Wontner's office—I have not had any other allowance since I have been a witness for the prosecution—I think I have had five or six half-crowns—it was not the first time that I was at Mr. Wontner's that I said anything about gin or being under the influence of liquor—I told Mr. Barnard, and I had told Richmond before I got to Mr. Wontner's—I said I was not right, I was not square—I don't believe I said I did not recollect what passed at Mr. Barnard's—the gin was given to me at Mr. Brannan's house—I went there at 11 o'clock or a little after and we came out at 3 o'clock; I was there four hours—we were not drinking all the time, we did stop a little while I believe—Mr. Brannan and his wife were there, and the servant girl who had got Mrs. Brannan's baby—I had some tea; I drank half my tea, and my cup was filled up with gin by Mr. Brannan—I had no more gin after I left Brannan's, they wanted me to have some, and I had a bottle of lemonade, that was going to the station—I was not so sober at 3 o'clock as I was at Mr. Barnard's at 4 or 5 o'clock—after I had been to Mr. Wonter's I saw Parrock and Richmond at Notting Hill; they got out at the same same station—I was in their company—I have not been in their company since—I have never seen Parrock until to day, only the sessions' days—I did not tell Mr. Wontner that what I was asked to swear falsely was that I had seen Parrock put the portmanteau into the cart—I said that I was asked to take that Parrock got up on the wheel and touched the portmanteau—I am quite sure it was not "Look at the portmanteau"—I have known R Richmond about three or four years—I was nursemaid to his children while his wife was ill in bed—that was about three' years ago—I am 18 now—I did not hear Richmond swear at Police Court that he had never known <hi rend="italic">Carry</hi> Baxter—Edney told me I was known as <hi rend="italic">Carry</hi> Baxter, and I said I did not know of such a name; I never heard it before—he stopped</p>

               <p>me in the Portobello Road, and said he had been offered 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to find me—I did not ask Mr. Barnard whether the evidence I was expected to give would do any damage to Richmond, or say that if it would I would not give evidence, as I had lived in his service—I said I had been in his service—I did not express a hope that what I had to say would not injure Richmond in any way—I did not see Parrock running while I was with him at all—I did not see the two officers Goldsworthy or Ship at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not see any constables taking horses to the Green Yard—Parrock and Richmond went down to Mr. Wontner's and they said I should be wanted as well, and a piece of paper was given to me by Inspector Hole to go—I met Mr. Richmond and he went down with me—I went into the room and my statement was taken down—the statement produced here which I signed at Mr. Barnard's office was read over. to me—I understood that Parrock was a constable in plain clothes, and when he put his coat collar up I supposed it to be so that they should not take much notice of his face.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. This prosecution was not instituted originally by the Treasury, but after the case was committed for trial, Parrock not having the means to carry it on—I am not aware that Mr. Knox also applied to have the assistance of the Treasury—I had nothing whatever to do with the proceedings at the Police Court, nor had the Trea sury—I only know from the depositions that the committal took place early in April—at the first Session after the committal no bill was preferred, an application was made, on my instructions, to allow a Session to pass that I might prepare the indictment, as I only received instructions on the Tuesday</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman X</hi> 215). On the night of Ash Wednesday, 18th February, I went on duty at 10 o'clock—my beat was from the Elgin Road to the Cornwall Road and Talbot Road—about 12.20 I was in the Talbot Road and saw a cart standing there near the corner of Colville Square, between the corner of the square and Portobello Road—I did not see any one with it or near it—I walked up to it, just glanced inside and crossed over—I did not notice anything particular—I was joined by acting Sergeant Hannah—I spoke to him about the cart and called his attention to it—we crossed over the way to the cart, and Parrock and Richmond came along—we had then just got to the cart—they came from the direction of Westbourne Park, from the eastward, near the pillar post—Parrock said to Hannah "How are you <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>?" I did not catch Hannah's reply—I asked Parrock how he was off for work—he said "Work, what about work this time of night, bed is the best place"—we then bade them good night, and walked towards Colville Square—Parrock and Richmond appeared to be going in the direction of Notting Hill, that is towards Portobello Road—I had seen them coming along the Talbot Road 50 or 60 yards before they came up to the cart where I was standing—Hannah and I were both in uniform—I knew Parrock well; I did not know Richmond—there was no woman with them or following them—after they had passed on we examined the cart, and found in it a portmanteau covered with a rug—I found nothing else—Hannah then directed me to conceal myself in an area on the opposite side of the road—the cart was on the Colville Square 'side of the way—Hannah went away—I concealed myself in the area as directed, I should say about 13 to 16 yards from the cart—I could see the cart perfectly from there—I continued to watch the cart—after I had been there from ten to fifteen minutes, as near as I can recollect, I saw Sergeant Brannan come up, he was in uniform—he went towards the cart, and seeing the police were there I whistled and he came across to me—I said to him "You see the cart"—he said "Yes, yes, there are three men and a woman wanted for it, go up Portobello Road and detain Parrock and a female, I will bring the cart along"—I then came out of the area and went in pursuit of them; I went right up Portobello Road and looked about, I was not able to find them—I had left Brannan at the area, near the cart—after searching about for some time I came back into the Porto<lb></lb>bello Road and saw Sergeant Brannan and Sergeant Varnham—I had been away I should think three-quarters of an hour, or it might have been an hour—I and Brannan got into the cart, it was then in the Portobello Road, and we drove to Parrock's house—as near as I can remember it must have been about 12.35 when Brannan first came up—Parrock did not touch the cart at all, nor did he walk backwards and forwards in front of the cart; he simply did what I have described—there is no place of conceal<lb></lb>ment</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187410260019"></xptr>
               <p>in the Talbot Road except the areas, unless you go down a turning, but then you could not gee the cart—I should say the doorways there would not afford places of concealment—I did not see anything whatever of Cook or Charlwood—when we arrived at Parrock's house, which I think was a little after 2 o'clock, we found that he had not come home—Brannan and I went inside, and he searched the lower part of the house—Parrock came home about 3.30—I spoke to him, Brannan was not present, he was inside—I took hold of Parrock and told him that Sergeant Brannan wanted to see him, with that the sergeant came out of the gateway and, took hold of him and said "What have you been doing with that horse and cart," and I think "a portmanteau," but that I won't be quite positive of—Parrock said "What cart, I know nothing about it"—I then took <hi rend="italic">him</hi> to the station—I was not present when Cook was taken into custody, I was outside the house minding the cart; she was taken from her own house—we took Parrock to the station first and then we went to Cook's—Brannan, Varnham; and Hannah, I think, went and apprehended her, I was outside minding the cart—I did not hear anything that passed between Cook and Brannan—she was afterwards brought to the station-pearlier in the morning, about 6 o'clock I saw Brannan in the passage at the police-station—Hannah and Varnham were there—I had found out at that time that the portmanteau belonged to Sir George Jenkinson—Brannan said to me "Look here Young, this is your case, let me have the handling of it, this portmanteau belongs to a big man, a Member of Parliament, if you don't let me have the management of it an inspector will poke his nose into it and do you out of it"—I said "You appear to know all about it"—he said "Yes, yes, leave it to me," or some words to that effect, I can't exactly remember the last words; that was all that passed then—afterwards at the Police Court, before Parrock and Cook were taken before Mr. Knox I again had some conversation with Brannan in the yard attached to the Police Court; I went up to him and said "Sergeant Brannan had I not better get in the witness-box first, you can then bring in what you know about the woman Cook"—he said "Oh, be b——d, you leave it to me, I will mix it up for the <hi rend="italic">sod</hi>," both Hannah and Varnham were there—Brannan was the first witness called, then Varnham, and then me—on the day that Partook and Cook were discharged, 28th February, I was outside an omnibus with Brannan, we were going from the Court to Notting Hill—Brannan said to me "This is a bad job, will you stick to me, and will you lean to counsel if questions should be put to you, that is supposing I get one"—I said "I can't alter my deposition"—he said "I know that, do the best you can for me"—I made no further reply then—on one of the occasions when Brannan was before the Magistrate charged with perjury I had some con<lb></lb>versation with him at the back of the Court; it was Hannah who was talking to him, I did not hear the whole conversation, it was something about the small fry should be got into it and that Brannan should get out of it, that was the rumor, and Hannah asked him if it was true—Brannan denied it, he said "God forbid"—I think I first heard that the <hi rend="italic">Jemmy</hi> and knife had been found in the cart on the second hearing—I had not searched the cart sufficiently to see whether there was <hi rend="italic">a jemmy</hi> and knife there, they might have been under the straw.</p>

               <p>evidence; I believe Varnham had the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> on the first occasion; I saw it"—I said just now that I thought it was on the second occasion I saw it; I have been ill for a long time—I have been reported for willful misconduct on my beat, for neglect of duty, and being absent from my beat; also for being found asleep in an unfinished building when on duty, and on the same occasion for being Under the influence of liquor—I have been reported six times for what they term misconduct—I was fined 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for not being on my beat for an hour and twenty minutes—I was fined for being found in a fish shop, and afterwards going to a public-house and drinking when on duty—I was reported for drinking a cup of coffee in the middle of the night, not for being absent from duty in company with a man; that was not at Edney's coffee stall—I erased a name from a police book; I think it should be explained how that did occur; a constable signed in the wrong place on receiving his armlet, and I scratched it out; the inspector asked me next day if I knew anything about it, I said I did it thinking there was no harm in it, and I was reported for that—on 29th January I was drinking outside a public-house when on duty—I have been seven years in the police next January; I still remain a constable—I have never been reduced from one rank to another—on the first examination of Parrock and Cook, Brannan was the first witness, and then Varnham—I did not go in before Varnham because I was not called—Varnham is a sergeant; it is not usual for a sergeant to be called first if his name is on the charge sheet; it all depends who is called by the magistrate—I believe I stated pretty nearly what I have to-day—I have not said to-day that Parrock never passed the cart twice, what I said was that they made a move to walk away, and when we returned we saw them standing just about the same spot; I had only been gone about a quarter of a minute; they passed the cart once, they must have done, and then retraced perhaps a couple of steps—I say that they did pass twice; I swear that—after we left them we walked towards Colville Square; we returned in about a quarter of a minute, and saw they had moved further towards the cart; I can't tell how many paces we had taken; we turned and walked back again and found Parrock and Rich<lb></lb>mond just about the same place, they had moved a little nearer if anything—I saw them pass the cart twice, they passed it once, and retraced their steps two paces and then went away again; they did not absolutely pass it, but I call it passing if they came up against it; I should say they were up to the wheel—up to that time I had not seen Brannan—it is true that when we got up to them they walked away and disappeared—I think I said that Brannan moved the cart into the Portobello Road and left a constable in charge of it—I was told to watch the cart; I did so until Brannan came, and he directed me to follow Parrock and a female, which I did; the cart was then in the same spot; Brannan said he would bring it along—I said at the Police Court that he had moved it into Portobello Road and left a constable in charge of it; that was something I heard, and it was strength<lb></lb>ened by what Brannan said to me when riding towards Parrock's house, that he wished he had not moved the cart, so I naturally concluded that it was so—I may have said on the first examination that Brannan said to Parrock that he should take him for stealing a portmanteau, and I think a horse and cart; I think what I did say was for stealing a horse and cart, and I think a portmanteau, but I may have reversed it—in my cross-exami<lb></lb>nation by Parrock on 19th February I said "i saw you pass the cart twice, you passed it before Brannan came up;"That is true; I might have</p>

               <p>said "I met you against the cart about 12.30 or 12.35;" it was nearer 12.30 than 12.35 I think; at that time I did not believe that Parrock was concerned in receiving the property, or helping the man who had driven the cart up; I did not believe a word of it, I never believed from the first that there was a feather's weight of evidence against them in my opinion—I gave the evidence to the solicitor as to what Brannan said "Look here Young, this is your case, let me have the handling of it;"That conversation took place in the passage of the Police Station, Notting Hill, about 6 o'clock in the morning—Hannah and Varnham were present and heard it—I did not report that conversation to the superintendent or inspector—I did not say a word about it when I was examined against Parrock and Cook, or at the several examinations against Brannan—I was called twice I think—I think I mentioned it to Mr. Wontner about three Sessions ago; I believe it was in August; I believe it was read over to me, and I put my mark to it—I don't think it was taken down in short hand—Varnham was not present at the time I made the statement; not inside—Hannah was inside and Inspector Hole—I believe it was read over to me—I don't think I made any alteration in it—it was at the same time that I mentioned the conversation about getting first into the witness-box—I was not anxious at that time to get Parrock and Cook committed for trial, because my impression from the first was that Brannan had been the cause—the first conversation was in the passage, a little after 6 o'clock, and the second one at the yard of the Police Court, just before the case came on, about 11 o'clock—I said nothing about it till I went to Mr. Wontner—the conversation outside the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> was on the dismissal of the charge against Parrock and Cook—Hannah was present then, he was present at all the three conversations, and at Mr. Wontner's when I gave the details—after the charge of perjury was made we met Mr. Knox at the spot—Mr. Knox did not advise me to resign, if he did it was not in my hearing—I do not suffer in my sight, I am not short-sighted—they do not say so at the hospital, frat I know of, or that my sight is unequal; the sight of my eye is not defective, the. left may be a trifle defective, but nothing to speak of—I was not 39 yards off the cart when I was in the area; I should say at the utmost it was 17 or 18—there was a lamp alight very nearly oppo<lb></lb>site, some few yards away—I was not so far from the cart as the Blenheim Arms, I was nearly opposite the cart—a person might see it 80 yards off, but I should question it very much—Mr. Knox said at the Police Court that I had no more right to be in the force than Parrock had, and that I ought to resign—what you asked me just now was whether Mr. Knox did not tell me to resign, and I say no, he did not advise me to resign—I can't say the exact words Mr. Knox used, I think he said "One was reported and the other discharged, and I can't see why the other was not discharged," or words to that effect—there was no light between me and the cart, the light was to the right, close to the kerb, on the opposite side of the way to the cart—part of the pavement at the side of the cart might be in shadow, I did not notice shadows, I looked after the cart—I was down the area—the houses there have portico's—I don't think anybody could call themselves concealed there except in the area, because anybody coming by could see them—I did not see the horse driven up—I believe Hannah tied the reins to the wheel—I did not see the man get out of the cart and go into the public-house; I did not see anything about the cart's arrival—my duty was in Talbot-road—I did not see the charge-sheet—I don't remember</p>

                  </hi>. I am now in the service of the Great Western Railway Company—I was formerly in the Metropolitan Police Force—resigned; my time expired on the 30th June—I left of my own accord—I had been in the Force four years and a month—on the night of the 18th February I was acting sergeant—I left the Notting Hill Station to visit the men about 9.45, after I had posted them—I went to the Talbot Road, and got there about 12.15 on the morning of the 19th—I was in uniform—I saw Young,. No. 215, standing near the Colville Hotel, near the Portobello Road, and he called my attention to a horse and cart there—we waited a minute or two and crossed from the Colville Hotel to the horse and cart—Parrock and Richmond came down from the direction of Westbourne Park—I noticed them a few yards before they got up to us—they stood a second, Parrock said "<hi rend="italic">Halloa</hi> 2? show are you going on?"or "Good night"—I forget the expression but something to that effect—I answered him in an offhand way—we left them and walked in the same direction, they had come, towards Westbourne Park; they made a stand at the corner of the square; I looked round and I saw Parrock going towards the cart—I am not positive whether Richmond turned or not—I suppose that Parrock was up as far as the horse; we stood there and they walked away towards Portobello Road—I saw no more of them then—we went back and thoroughly examined the cart, and found the portmanteau—Parrock did not touch the cart at all while he was there—he did not put his foot on the wheel or step or touch it in any way, or walk backwards and forwards</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187410260023"></xptr>
               <p>there was no woman with Parrock and Richmond—I saw no woman whatever about there—I knew Parrock; I had done duty with him—I knew he had been discharged from the Force—I had lodged in the same house with him. I saw the portmanteau in the cart partially covered with a rug—I did not get into the cart—I said to Young "I don't exactly understand this, I believe there is something wrong, you go in that area opposite," pointing to one of the private areas there—we secured the wheel first "of all by means of the reins—Young went down one of the areas—I think it was the first; that would be, I should say, 32 yards from the cart, on the opposite side of the road—I should say it was about 12.25 when I left him there—I went away and remained in Portobello Road between Cornwall Road and Elgin Road, near the post-office—I saw Parrock there with a woman; they passed me—I was standing on the kerb next door to the post-office—I took the woman to be the woman Cook who was charged—they went in the direction of Archer Street—I saw Brannan about seven or ten minutes after Parrock and the woman had passed—I had left there and gone down the Portobello Road again, and when I came back I saw Brannan near the post-office—I first reported "All right sergeant," and then I asked him whether he had received any information—he said "Why?" I then reported the circumstance of the cart and posting Young—he said "All right, I know all about it, you go after Parrock and the woman and stop them"—I told him I had' seen Parrock and another man pass the cart—I detailed the whole of it—all I said about the woman was that I had seen Parrock and the woman pass—I might have said I believed it to be Cook, or that it was Cook—after I had reported the whole of it to him he told, me to go after Parrock and the woman—I told Brannan that Parrook had merely turned towards the cart, that is all I said—I went after Parrock and the woman, but I was not able to find them, and I returned to Portobello Road in about, fifteen or twenty minutes—it was about 12.50 as near as I can guess when I first saw Braanan—when I came back I saw Brannan near the cart in Porto bellow Road, and I told him I could not find them—he said "Perhaps they are in the Mews in Buckingham Terrace," and I went back again—I saw Sergeant Varnham and asked him if he had seen them, he said he had in Portobello Road—I told him Sergeant Brannan wanted them, and we went together—we returned and I met Young in Archer Street, and we walked own together—I was not present when Parrock was taken in custody; I was when Cook was taken—she said, "I know nothing whatever about it, you must have made a mistake in the party"—she said that once or twice—Brannan was there—I first heard of the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> and knife about 9.30 in the morning—I saw the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> on the reserve room table and said "Halloa, what is that," and then I heard it had been found in the cart—I was present at the police-station about 6 o'clock in the morning when Brannan had some conversation with Young—we were in the passage—I think there was Young, Varnham and myself—Brannan came and said "Look here Young, this is a good job, belonging to a big man or a great man, an M.P., you had better let me have the handling of this, otherwise we shall have the Inspector shoving his nose into it," Young said. "Very well you can have it as you appear to know so much about it"—I won't be positive of the expression, but it was something to that effect—in the yard at the Police Court, I heard Young say to Brannan, "I think I had better get in the box first sergeant, had not I?"Brannan said "No I will get in the box"—that was before there was any conversation, and shortly Braanan</p>

               <p>came back and said "I am going in to the box first of all"—we had a little talk over it, and we all thought it was Young's place to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> in the box first of all, and Brannan fired up and said, "Let it alone to me, I will mix it up for myself"—he went and got in the box first—after the charge was dismissed, I went away on an omnibus with Young and Brannan—Brannan sat in the middle I think—I heard a conversation he had with Young on that occa<lb></lb>sion—I think Young told him first of all that Parrock had taken out a summons against him for perjury—Brannan said "I don't care much if they have, but if they do, and questions are put by counsel will you lean to it," or "Will you lean to me"—I told him it was no use to talk like that we had given our evidence which was correct—he said "I don't mean that, but if questions are put to you, will you lean to counsel"—I told him we we would not—I thought that the woman I saw with Parrock was Cook—I could not say that I ever noticed Charlwood before—I should not like to swear that Cook is the woman now, although I firmly believed at the time she was.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. W. SLEIGH</hi>. I knew the woman Cook before, but not to say well—I said at the Police Court "I swear positively that Cook was a woman I had seen about as a prostitute. I believe her name was Cook. I was perfectly familiar with her appearance"—I gave evidence to that effect—before she was discharged I was perfectly certain that she was the woman—I was examined against Sergeant Brannan at the Police Court—I believe it was three times in all—I did not mention on either of those three occasions a single word in examination in chief or cross-examination about the conversation which I have stated to-day—I don't-remember when I mentioned that conversation to Mr. Wontner—I have not the date with me—it was the second day I went to Mr. Wontner's office, 3, Cloak Lane—I think it was later than April; it was 8th May—Young was with me—he heard the statement I made to Mr. Wontner, and I heard him make his statement—Young made his first, and then I made mine—they were written down at the time—I had been the day before to Mr. Wontner's, but I had not made any statement—Young spoke to me first about making that statement to Mr. Wontner a week or a fortnight before, and I said I should, state the facts and the truth—after Parrock spoke to me, he turned away, and went some yards; he then turned round and walked towards the cart—I had gone on to the corner of Colville Square—we turned and walked towards it, and then they went—when we turned he was about as far as the horse's head—I was next door to Cuff's post office, standing on the pavement, when I saw Brannan—I am not positive that I mentioned Cook's name to him—I may have said Parrock and the woman—I may have sworn at the Police Court that I mentioned Cook's name—I went to Bosworth Road with Sergeant Varnham—I did not tell Varnham to go to the station and tell the Inspector I had found Cook's whereabouts; nothing of the sort—I did not send Varnham to the station; Varnham left me and said he would go to the station—it was about 12.50 that I saw Brannan near Cuff's post office—I saw Parrock and the woman walking arm-in-arm in the Portobello Road—that was seven or ten minutes before I met Brannan—I said at the Police Court, before Mr. Knox, the same as I say here, that I may have mentioned Cook's name—I was present at the arrest of Cook—I went into the house—it is not a fact that all the constables were in the room while she was dressing—it is not a fact that Sergeant Brannan told us to keep out of the room—we did stay outside—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187410260025"></xptr>
               <p>Brannan was in the room—he said something to the effect that he was a married man and would not look while she was dressing, and he turned his back to the bed and searched the drawers until the woman had dressed herself—the door was partly open and I could see Brannan at the drawers—I did not see the woman herself until she came to the door and said "You had better look in that side drawer, here are the keys if you want them"—I did not see any indelicacy or rudeness, and there was nothing more done than was necessary to prevent her escape—I should say from his manner that Brannan wished to save her from any unpleasantness—I did not make any report of the conversation, which I have sworn to-day, I heard to the inspector or superintendent—I wont say I did not mention it to any superior because Varnham knew about it—he was my superior—I may have mentioned it to Young a week or nine days before I went to Mr. Wontner's—I say to-day it was 12.15 when I saw Young first—I said at the Police Court on the first examination it was 12.5 but on the second or third examination I said it must be later than that—it must have been after Young had given his evidence that I altered it—Young may have said it was 12.20, but I was not there when he was examined and he did not tell me—I think it was the latter end of April that Young and I talked about that conversation, he recounted it to me—I can't say how long that was after Brannan's committal; it must have been before the committal—I know. a Police-constable of the name of Frost—it is very likely that I made a statement to Frost about my resigning; we lived together—I swear I did not tell Frost I should send in my resignation on account of Brannan's job, and that—I was afraid I should be dismissed from the Force because of my different statements—nothing of the sort—he is 20 <hi rend="italic">X Reserve</hi>—I might have told" him I had sent in my resignation—I 'thought of doing it a long while before I did—I don't think I told him I would put in my resignation because of Brannan's case—I could not swear I did not—I don't remember saying anything about Brannan's case—I won't undertake to swear I did not tell him so—I did not speak to Frost about my statements differing on the different examinations—I was receiving 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week when I was in the Police—my wages now are 21s—may I state my reason for accepting that; my intention was to go home and work at my trade, and this-trial being postponed I got this situation at the Great Western Railway.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The conversation I had with Young about the conversa<lb></lb>tion with Brannan before we went to Mr. Wontner's office was this: Young said "You remember the morning he was charged don't you, well I shall out with that when I go up there"—I don't think there was anything further—Mr. Lewis examined me when I gave evidence at the Police Court on this charge of perjury—when Cook's room was searched she brought the keys and paid "Here are the keys if you want to look"—that was after she was dressed.</p>

I live at 3, Basing Road, Notting Hill—at midnight, on 18th February, I left the Duke of Wellington Hotel in company with two gentlemen named Francis Payne and Richard Randall Mr. Payne is not here to-day; I believe he has met with an accident; he was here yesterday; he has been here with me every Session that this case has been on—from the Duke of Wellington we had occasion to pass through the Talbot Road—I know the Colville Hotel; opposite that there is a blank wall; in passing that I saw a horse and cart standing there—I made some communication to the gentlemen who were with me—the horse appeared as if it had been driven very fast; the reins were down round its heels—I thought it very strange to see a horse and cart there at that time, and I walked round to the further side of the cart, put my foot on the wheel, and looked up into the cart—I pulled some matches out of my pocket, and stepped down off the wheel to see who the cart belonged to—I lighted three matches for the purpose of seeing the name—I did not at that moment see any person except my friends about the Talbot Road—we remained there some short time looking for a policeman—I saw something in a doorway on the opposite of the road, and I went across to look and a policeman came out dressed in uniform, it was the prisoner—I spoke to him—I should say then from twenty to twenty-five minutes after we had left the Duke of Wellington—we came out from there just after 12 o'clock, and there we stood talking some time, and smoking a cigar a few minutes—I asked Brannan if he knew anything about the cart—he told me to mind my own affairs, to go home, he knew all about it—we then proceeded along the Talbot Road as far as All Saints' Church, where I had to turn to go home—there is a pillar box opposite the church—I stood there talking to my friends for some time—at that time I saw two men in the doorway of the porch of the church; it is not much of a porch; they were exactly in the doorway—they came across and looked at us three, after we had observed them for about a minute, I should think—I was speaking to the gentlemen about those men; they did not speak to us—I think I said "Good night" To them, just merely to see if I could recognise who they were—they made no reply—they went towards where the cart was standing when we left it"; it was only about 50 yards distant—I was standing at the corner of the Colville Road, the next corner to where the cart was standing, on the east side—I saw them go round the corner into Colville Square, and then I saw them return towards the cart; they went out of sight for about a minute or a quarter of a minute, and then they came in sight again, and went towards the cart; they appeared hanging about—I saw no more of them after that—I should think I saw them altogether for about a quarter of an hour—they were shifting about the road quite as much as that—I made a communication to my two friends about them, in consequence of the character of their movements—I watched them, I thought it very strange, and the cart being there.</p>

I am a superintendent of the Metropolitan Police—I have been in the force twenty-three years—I have known Brannan ten years, since 1864, when he joined the service—he has borne an irreproachable character up to this time as a truthful, zealous, well behaved officer—his language was always considered good—I had recommended him to the Commissioners as an inspector—that requires a Civil Service examination—I countersign every charge sheet in the division after the case has been disposed of to see if there is any remark upon them—Brannan had been on the sick list up to a day or two days before this occurrence took place—I understood that was in consequence of worry and grief for the loss of his father—he was allowed to be on sick leave for a month—I think it was the day previous to this occurring that he returned to his duty.</p>

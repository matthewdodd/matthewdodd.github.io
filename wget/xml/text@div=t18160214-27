            . I am servant to Mr. Levi. I was ordered to go with the prisoner to receive the money for the two coats, which was three pounds fifteen shillings. When he came to Fleet-street, the prisoner took a coach, and drove to <placeName id="t18160214-27-crimeloc161">Bishopsgate-street</placeName>

I waited not hardly a minute, and I did not see him again. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. The coats were not sold by my master to him. I was carrying them for my master, and when the prisoner gave me the money, I was to give him the coats. The prisoner spoke bad English. I don't understand Dutch. We stopped at the Bull-inn, and not at the Green Dragon.</p>

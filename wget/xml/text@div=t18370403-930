                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H 53</hi>). On Sunday morning, the 26th of February, I was on duty in Weatherhead-gardens, Virginia<lb></lb>row, Bethnal-green, about half-past three o'clock, and saw the two prisoners carrying lead—they were walking, and on seeing me they ran as hard as the lead would let them—I heard one say to the other, "The privy"—they ran into a privy, and I caught Blackett as he came out, and asked what he had got there—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "You must have something, or you would not be in such a hurry"—I took him to the privy-door, and the other came out—they both asked me to let them go, as it would ruin them—I refused, and sprang my rattle—Cook ran away—I brought Blackett into the privy, and found the two pieces of lead on the scat, which I had seen them carry—two officers came to my assistance,</p>

               <p>and we took Blocked to the station-bouse with the lead—he gave his address, "No. 16, Virginia-row, "but we found nobody lived there—we made inquiry, and found he lived at No. 6—we went there, and at the back of the house four more pieces of lead were found, and I found Cook in bed in the same house—he said he hoped I would not appear against him—I found on him a clasp knife, a knife blade, and a pair of ear-rings—I after<lb></lb>wards found two other pieces of lead near a chapel in Virginia-row; I found the tiles taken off the adjoining house, which was the empty house; a passage was made to the leads on the chapel roof; and on the roof of the chapel, in the gutters, I found lead taken off—I compared it with the roof, and am satisfied it came off that chapel—it fitted even to the marks where it was cut—I am certain Cook is the one who ran away—I had my light, and it was moonlight—I swear positively he is the man.</p>

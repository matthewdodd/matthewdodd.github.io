                  </hi>. I am a brushmaker, of 42, Stepney Green—in February, 1877, I had apartments in the prisoners' house, Stewardstone Road, Bethnal Green—their baby was then about six weeks old, and was healthy, as far as I could judge—early in June our attention was attracted by a noise as of an altercation in the prisoners' room, and we heard our name called—my wife and I went down, and the male prisoner was striking his</p>

               <p>wife, who had the child covered up in her arms—I induced her to give it up, in case it should get a blow—my wife took it upstairs, and a horrible smell came from it—I cannot recollect what Frederick said to his wife, hut there was a quick succession of blows—I went upstairs and examined the child, and from the lower part of the lower jaw up to the hair was not one sore but a numerous quantity of sores—I examined its body, it was raw all round the crutch—its mouth was going—my wife dipped her finger in some butter, and it took it very ravenously—I called the male prisoner, and he came up—I was very much excited, and said "Good God, Wise, look at that poor child, it is absolutely starving; look at the state its face is in, you must know it, sleeping in the same bed"—he said "Yes, it has been ill"—I said "You must see a doctor at once"—he said "It's too late to-night, I will call on Dr. Berdoe in the morning"—that was on Thursday, but the child was not seen by a medical man till the following Tuesday—I went downstairs to see if there was any provision for feeding the child during the night, and after searching they produced a feeding bottle, which looked as if it had not been used for some time, as there was curdled, putrid milk in it—after a time a tube was found, and afterwards a teat, which ways so broken and bent about that I considered it useless—the father and mother tied it together with a piece of string—after the child was seen by a doctor, woman was appointed to sit up with it, and take care of it during the night—I asked Frederick whether he had provided the child with sufficient clothing, as my wife had to lend it clothes—a portion of the clothes it had on when it was taken to the workhouse were mine—about a fortnight after the doctor was called in my wife applied to the police, as the inattention was occurring again, and the child was removed to the workhouse—Frederick Wise worked in High Street, Borough—I worked beyond him, and used to pass his place of business, and have seen him there—he left about 7 a.m., and had about three miles to go to his work—he returned about half-past 7 or 8, sometimes later, but sometimes he was at home all day on Saturday, and sometimes half a day, and all day on Sunday—he was moderately sober—I have seen him in liquor, but it was not his constant practice—I have seen the woman drunk in the day time as well as at night—I have seen her lying on the kitchen floor—the child was generally lying in a box in the kitchen—when my wife com<lb></lb>municated with the police the male prisoner abused me very strongly, and called my wife a filthy name.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I occupied these rooms about 18 months—the prisoners occupied a sitting-room, bedroom, and kitchen—I have heard the male prisoner say that his wages were 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I should call him sober in the general acceptation of the term, but his wife is a confirmed drunkard—Dr. Berdoe has attended her for <hi rend="italic">delirium-tremens</hi>—the male prisoner was com<lb></lb>plaining of her being drunk and lying about the place on the evening when I saw him beating her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—we lived in the prisoner's house for some months—the child was about four months old when I first saw it; it was then very thin—I overheard a conversation about its being very bad and not likely to live—I knew there had been no doctor and that it was dying—when I first saw it it was in a little boy's arms in the passage—I examined it; it seemed to be very ill, and there were sores on its face—I got the mother to come up with it into my room; she was moderately sober—I tried to induce her to have a doctor; she said she dare</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187808060024"></xptr>
               <p>not do so—I have often seen her drunk during the day—the child was sometimes in bed in a little box in the kitchen—I never saw her feed it in a proper manner; a bottle was put for it, but it was quite useless—I drew her attention to it many times—the father was away during the day—early in June my husband and I heard him swearing at her—we went down and I took the child upstairs; its face was sore, and the lower part of its body was very bad indeed: it was sinking for want of nourishment—I gave it a bit of butter, as I was afraid life was leaving it—I went to the mother next morning and tried to impress upon her to get food for it and to have it washed—I washed it myself in the evening—I expected then it would die in my arms—I had told her many times to get a doctor; she assured me that she dare not do so, as her husband would not allow her—I said that I should do so—on the day I took the child upstairs I went down to look for its bottle, and found it clogged up and of no use at all, and bad food in it—I had often remonstrated with her about the state the child was in, and spoke to her about bandaging it—it was laid on the bed about ten in the evening covered with the sheet, and the woman had gone out with her husband—they returned in about half an hour, and I told her that I found the child crying, and that it was too tightly bandaged and could not grow like that; she would kill it—he thanked me, and said that she was a silly bitch and did not know better—I frequently said to both of them that the child was being murdered—I once found it in the passage, and accused her of its being badly treated—I did not know till June that the lower part of its body was covered with sores—I spoke to them both one Sunday morning about six weeks ago, and gave them some linen rag to put to its wounds, and told them to be sure and attend to it—she said that she would do so—I once found the child in bed with a pillow over its head, suffocating; that was on the Friday that I went to the police, and previous to that I found it on the bed nearly suffocated; that was about six in the evening—I removed the pillow, and went up and found the mother in a lodger's room intoxicated—I told her of her cruelty to her child, and said that she ought not to have a baby so young—she said that she could not attend to it—her husband had not then come home; but I told him in the evening that I found the baby suffocated with a pillow over its head, and a blanket, and that if he did not prevent it, I must do so—he said that he meant to leave her—I begged him to think of his children—he said that he should not think of the children.</p>

I am not extremely friendly with Mrs. Wise, owing to her drunken habits—this is the first time I have mentioned that she said that he would not let her have a doctor—when I spoke to Wise, he said "She is silly; she does not know what she is doing;" and once when I spoke to her, she said "No, I am not fit to have a young baby: I do not know what I am doing"—she was then drunk—I did not know that the child was taken three times to the vaccination officer, but was too ill to be vaccinated—I did not know that the husband brought home biscuits and Swiss milk for the child—I found some beef-tea on the hob one day; it was there because Mrs. Hall said that it was the proper thing to get—I have heard that the child had brandy and egg—the female prisoner was his third wife.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 56, Victoria Park Road, and have been in the habit of attending the prisoners—I delivered the woman of this child on 20th January last—it was perfectly healthy—I attended her for a few days and saw nothing more of her till on Saturday evening, 8th June, the male prisoner called and said, "Doctor, our baby does not seem to thrive"—I asked him in what way, and gathered that it was gripes or disturbed bowels—I gave him a bottle of medicine, but did not see the child—on 11th June the child was brought by a woman, who said that it was Mrs. Wise's child, who was unable to bring it herself—it was horribly emaciated, weighing apparently 4lb. or 5lb.; it was a mere mass of skin and bone, with sores on its face and body—experts give the weight of a new-born child at about 7lb., and in a respectable class of persons it is more; it weighed less than when it was born—I was very angry at the condition it was in, and gave it some strengthen<lb></lb>ing medicine—the male prisoner called the same evening in a considerable state of alarm at the remark I had made—he said that I had been saying that the child had been improperly treated, and if that was the case, it must have been by his wife during his absence, as he wished it should have proper care and attention; that I knew the drinking habits of his wife, and she most have kept the child without food while he was away, and that on one occasion it had been left without food about 12 hours when she was in a drunken stupor, and he had kicked her to arouse her—he begged me to do all I could to pull the child round, but I said it would certainly die, nothing could be done for it—I called two days afterwards, and saw the female prisoner; she was very rapidly feeding the child with a spoon—I asked her what she was giving it—she said egg and brandy, which some neighbour had recommended—I scolded her and said that when the child died I should order an inquest—she said "The child shan't die, I will bring it round"—I ordered it cod-liver oil, and saw it on June 14th, 17th, and 21st between 12 and 4 o'clock—the man was not there then, but he called on me in the evening of each of these days—he showed me some biscuits he had purchased, and asked my opinion of them—he said that sometimes he would bring beef, and asked if it were advisable—he expressed every anxiety that the child should be saved—on, I believe, 21st June, he said that the relieving officer had called, saying that he had been informed that the child was being starved, and he would take it away unless the father could bring a certificate from me that the child was not in danger, and might be safely left—I refused to give any such certificate—he urged me very much to do so, and I wrote one to say that the child had been grievously neglected, and was suffering from improper food, this is it—in consequence of that, the relieving officer called on me—I advised him to remove the child to the workhouse, and he took it there on the following Monday—I know that the mother is addicted to habits of intemperance—I have attended her for <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—the husband has expressed great concern about his wife's drunken habits—the child died on 6th July from gross neglect and improper feeding; from star<lb></lb>vation, in fact—I was not present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>.</p>

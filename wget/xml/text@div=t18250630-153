He was apprehended on the evening of the 31st of May, and produced the duplicates himself.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Elms, the pawnbroker, Museum-street. I have two sheets which were pawned on the 7th of May, and a napkin, which was pawned on the 12th of May, by the prisoner.</p>

               <p>MRS. MAYNARD. I am a widow, and live at No. 11, Hunter-street, Bloomsbury-square. The prisoner married my daughter seven years ago; he was then worth fifty thousand pounds: he was a Spanish merchant, but through the misfortunes in Spain, he has brought me and my family to the greatest distress: he has tried to get an academy, and tried to get a place as a servant, but could not succeed: I think he has been out of his mind through misfortunes - he kept his carriage and four servants when he married my daughter.</p>

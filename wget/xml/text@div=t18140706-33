On Saturday, the 4th of June, in the afternoon, between five and six, I went out; I locked the door, and left no one in the house. I returned between eight and nine, I found the door open, I called out hoy, halloo; I saw a light in the back room. The prisoner came forward; he immediately came up the area; as soon as he came out, I laid hold of him, and put my finger into the button-hole of his coat; I said to him, what have you robbed me of. He struck me; I fell back at my full length; he ran off. I raised my head up, and called out stop thief. I saw my child pursue him. I met Mrs. Maddox, a neighbour, I told her my house had been broken open, and I had been knocked down. I went into my house to see what I had lost; I found a lamp that I had set upon a table with a tinder-box, set upon a stool. I missed three silver tea-spoons; they were in the house when I went out. I had them in my hand just before I came out; they are worth six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at the prisoner; are you sure, or have you any doubt whether he is the person who was in the passage - A. I have no doubt at all. I know it is the man I had hold of.</p>
               <p>NIMROD BINNS. I live at No. 4, High-street Stepney; I am a cabinet-maker. On Saturday, the 4th of June, near dark, I heard the cry of stop thief. I saw a woman lying down, it afterwards proved to be Mrs. Donaldson. I saw a man walking by me; when he came to the rails, I attempted to collar him. He stooped under the rails, which made me suspect he was the thief. I pursued him with the cry of stop thief; he ran away, and just as Mr. Palmer came up, he dropped three silver tea-spoons; I picked them up. I saw the spoons fall to the ground: they must have fallen from the prisoner. When I came up to the prisoner, he was taken in custody, by Fettis and Palmer. The spoons were delivered into the custody of the constable, and the prisoner was taken to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>MR. PALMER. I live at No. 1, Abel's-buildings, Goodman's-fields. On Saturday, the 4th of June, about half after eight, I had occasion to go to Stepney. I saw the prisoner, and the last witness pursuing him. I heard the cry of stop thief. I crossed the way to look at the prisoner; he made a run against me, in order to baffle me from catching him; I followed him as far Cottage Grove; Mr. Fettis came across the road, and catched him. I heard the spoons drop, but I did not know what they were. I and the other witness took the prisoner back to Mrs. Donaldson.</p>
               <p>MR. FETTIS. I saw the prisoner running; I stopped him; he cried stop thief. I took him as he was running. That is all I know.</p>

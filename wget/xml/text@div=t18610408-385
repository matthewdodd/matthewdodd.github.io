                  </hi>. I am a pianoforte manufacturer, and live in New Cross-road, Deptford—the prisoner has been in my employ as a tuner, somewhere about the last two years—I have two classes of customers in the tuning way; annual and casual—it was usual for me to give the prisoner a list of the annual customers, and for him to go and tune those pianos for which I gave him the list, and report, on coming home, what he had done—I then booked them, and he signed it—I have the book here—I know a person named Maria Wharton—she is a casual customer—his duty with respect to casual tuning was to hand over to me the money when he returned home—I saw him on 16th March last—on that occasion I sent him to Mrs. Wharton's with a bill, to receive the money—the tuning had been done some six weeks previously—he stopped away some two hours—I sent another after him—they missed each other—when he came in I asked him if he had seen Mrs. Wharton—he said no; that Mrs. Wharton was in London on the three, and there was no one there to pay the money—I then asked him to return me the bill if he had not got the money—he told me he would see me d--d first—I have not received any money whatever from him on account of Mrs. Wharton—he has never told me that he has received it—he always said he bad not—I know a person of the name of Griselda Archer—he was in the habit of tuning pianos for her—on 19th October last I sent Mm there to tune a piano, as a casual customer—I sent him with my regular list to Sydenham—on his return he entered it as being the first time as an annual—I have sent him there four times since, considering it as an annual—I have now found that it was not an annual—I did not receive from him at that time the sum of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., because I believed it to bean annual—I paid him by piece-work—as an annual I should not expect him to pay me anything for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he have some cards printed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; as a teacher of music—I said unless he destroyed them I should discharge him—he pro<lb></lb>fessed to destroy them; I have never seen any since—he was not allowed to tune on his own account at all while in my service, or to retain the money paid to him for tuning, that he might deduct what was due to him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

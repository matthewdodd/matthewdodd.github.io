            . I live in Holles-street, Clare-market. On the 17th of July, Midland came to me; I had known him eighteen years; he asked if I bought feathers, and said a friend of his had some to sell. I asked if they were new or old? he said,</p>
               <p>"New." I asked what they wanted a pound - he said he did not know, but he dare say we should not disagree about the price, but a person would bring a sample. Banner afterwards came, and said he came from Midland, and brought the sample, and asked 16 d. a pound, and said it was a fair sample; thinking them worth more, I suspected them - he said he would bring them to me. I said, I could go and see them; he said he would bring them about eight o'clock; and almost immediately, Williams, a porter, brought them in a large bag. Banner came immediately; I examined them, they felt damp and warm. I said I could not buy them, unless I was more satisfied about their quality; and they said they would come and empty them out, when my shop was better cleared; they wanted a sovereign in advance. I gave them 5 s.: I weighed them, they were 47 lbs.; they were to return in half an hour; Midland and Banner came; I put them off in order to enquire about them. They asked for more money; and I advanced 5 s. more, they were to come next day at twelve o'clock; and next day I saw Murrell opposite the shop - I think it was after the others came. Midland and Brown came in, and I put them off till eight o'clock, at which time they came; and I saw Murrell on the opposite side. I had an officer ready to take them. I asked Midland repeatedly, if the feathers were Banner's property - he said they were, and that he knew him very well</p>

            . I am foreman at the prosecutors' warehouse in Wild-court; all the prisoners were in their service. Murrell and Banner were employed on the feathers, and Midland was a carpenter in constant employ. Banner always locked up the warehouse at night, and came to me for the key of the feather room. I found the bag and feathers at Webster's. I know it, as I had once, lessened it, and afterward enlarged it again, and the feathers are similar to ours. Midland lived at No. 2, Clement's lane. I went to Webster's on this night, and saw Murrell opposite the house at the time the others were in the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Midland had no access to the inner warehouse - A. No, except the others let him in.</p>
               <p>MR. GARNER. The lowest wholesale price of the feathers would be 3 s. a-pound.</p>
               <p>MIDLAND'S Defence. Banner informed me he had feathers to sell. I took them to a friend, who I thought would buy them - he sent me to Mrs. Webster. I am entirely innocent of knowing them to be stolen.</p>
               <p>BANNER'S Defence. I have been in the trade for years; the feathers are my own. I wanted to pay a bill, and was obliged to sell them.</p>
               <p>MURRELL'S Defence. I was in Clare-market that night, and met the prisoners; they asked me to drink with them.</p>

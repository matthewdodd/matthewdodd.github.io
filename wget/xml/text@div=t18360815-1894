                  </hi>. I live at No. 34, Cum<lb></lb>berland-street, Bryanston-square. The prisoner came into my employ as footman on the 16th of May—on the morning of the 17th I put my place in his care, and gave him a list of it, which I have here—it consisted of the property stated in the indictment—in consequence of something which oc<lb></lb>curred he gave me warning on the 9th of July to leave me in a month—on the morning of the 14th I came down to breakfast, with my watch in my hand, at a quarter before eleven o'clock—there were no breakfast things set, only table-cloth was on the table, and on inquiry I found he had left—I went down to his pantry with my landlord, who happened to be in the house—I found the door locked, and the window fast—I caused the door to be opened, and every thing was gone except the plated articles.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was told by my fellow-servants I should be discharged as soon as she came down to breakfast—I wish to know whether she had not a key of the pantry as well as myself? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I had not a key of the pantry—my landlord tried the key of the housekeeper's room, and that opened it, but I did not know it would do so before—I did not see the prisoner again till he was in custody—I found his list on the dresser when he was gone, and he has indorsed on the back of it the date on which he gave me warning.</p>

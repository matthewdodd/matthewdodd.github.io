                  </hi>. I am a waterman, and live in Ann's-row, Bromley; the deceased Thomas Boulter was my brother. On the 26th of March, in consequence of what I heard, I went down to the Marshes, and saw a boat come down—my brother, Blaker, Curtis, and Thomas Sullins, who is</p>

               <p>not in custody, got out—they walked up into the Marsh, pulled off all their clothes except their trowsers, shook hands, then fell back, and Blaker and my brother began to fight—Curtis picked Blaker up for the three first rounds, and put him on another person's knee, who I do not know—Mason then came running across the Marshes, and shook hands with Blaker—Curtis every now and then gave Blaker something out of a bottle—Mason acted as Blaker's second after Curtis ceased to pick him up—Curtis remained till the fight was over, and so did Mason—Sullins and Tantony seconded my brother—they fought about thirty-five minutes, as near as I can guess—I saw Blaker then strike my brother with his right hand under the left ear, and he fell down—it was a violent blow—he fell right down, and never rose any more till he was picked up—he was alive, but not sensible—he did not speak at all—I did not see him move—I saw Blaker get up and put on his clothes—I saw Mason take him a few yards, and tell him to lie down—he felt in his pocket for a knife to cat his, eye, to let the blood out, as his face was swollen—my brother was put into a boat—I saw him again about twenty minutes after twelve o'clock, at his lodging—he was lying there—the doctor had just bled him—he was not sensible—he died about ten minutes after two o'clock—it was a fair fight, at well as I could see.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Blackwall.

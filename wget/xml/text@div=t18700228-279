                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi>) On 31st December Roberts was brought to Bishopsgate Station, in custody—I afterwards went with Welch to Deacon's Reading Rooms, and there saw Batchelor—I said, "Mr. Batchelor, I am a police-officer, there is a person named Roberts got in a little trouble; he is at Bishopsgate Station for obtaining some leather by fraud, and he says if you will come there you can clear him directly"—he went with me—I had not taken him in custody—he was shown some papers relating to Isenberg's transaction, and said that they were in Mr. Foun<lb></lb>tain's writing, and that he was only a servant, a clerk—I asked where we could see Mr. Fountain—he said that he was in Belgium, and that he was his managing man—he was then placed in the dock with Roberts—Roberts had told me previously that the papers were in Batchelor's writing, but they spoke together, and then said that they were Fountain's writing—Batchelor was asked his address—he said, "I live in Arlington Street"—he was asked which Arlington Street, and he would not tell—I went to 129, Arlington Street, and found the documents produced—I afterwards went to 139, Leadenhall Street, and found about thirteen dozen new paper boxes, all empty, placed round the room, also a little book, a stock-book, and a purchase-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the stock-book gave no dates, but I believe the last entry is 13th January, 1865; the last entry in the purchase-book is in 1866, but there is no name or heading, and nothing showing whose books they are—the last entry in the letter-book is 24th October, 1865—the books were laid out on the table very nicely—I also found several invoices which tradesmen had sent in, and these two town Direc<lb></lb>tories and two country Directories—at Batchelor's house I found a great many slips of paper, with merchants' names on them, ticked with little marks; also this paper, and a great many more, and a bundle of letters from different merchants.</p>

Q.</hi> When I refused my address, did I state any reason? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yea, you told me your wife was just confined; these lists appear to be in the same writing as some of the letters, but I found some of your letters in different hands—I know your writing by seeing letters you have sent to people, who have had houses of you.</p>

                  </hi>.

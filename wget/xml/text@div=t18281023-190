            . I am the wife of George George; we occupy a room there. On the 3d of October my husband's watch was in the room; the prisoner was there - he had left his hat in my care and came to get it; I was in the next room and saw him pass to take his hat - I saw him stand with his hands in his pockets; he asked for his hat, which I gave him - he went away; I then missed the watch and alarmed my husband - he had been working there as a carpenter.</p>

               <p>On the 26th of December, in the evening, I cannot say what time, it might be between six and seven o'clock, I pulled the window down; I cannot be certain it was close, it was not fast.</p>

               <p>Q. Was nobody in that room afterwards? - A. I cannot say; I was backwards and forwards in the course of the evening, after that.</p>

               <p>Q. It might be thrown open on account of a noise in the street? - A. It does not look into the street.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. You don't know whether it was then pulled down or not, or whether anybody had been in the room or not, or what time it was? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Locker). Q. You did not fasten it when you pulled it down? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any fastenings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I passed it at half past eleven in the gallery, on the outside, I think it was shut then, I cannot positively say; I think I must have seen it if it had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the first person up in the morning that discovered it? - A. The carman.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from the street? - A. One hundred and fifty yards, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner? - A. He had lived servant with me as ostler; he had left me three months; after I had been into the ostler's room, I saw the gates fast; I chained the dog to the post in the yard, and no stranger dare have passed him; in the morning the dog was loose; I had a suspicion of the prisoner. On Monday morning, the 28th, I went and examined his lodgings, in Fox-and-Knot-court, in the house of one Bates; I enquired for the prisoner,

            ; Mrs. Bates said, she did not know any such person; I found the prisoner there, and called him down, and the officer took charge of him; this was at Bates's door. I returned, and desired Mrs. Bates to let me go up stairs; this she objected to, without the prisoner went up with me; I went up with the prisoner and the officer, and we found two bundles, containing the things mentioned in the indictment, except the hat, (enumerasing them). I asked the prisoner where my hat was; he said, if he had it, it was in the room; we did not find it; it was afterwards produced by Bates's wife, it was below stairs; we took the prisoner to the Compter at half past ten o'clock; we went down to the prisoner's lodging again, and I found a pair of shoes, and about thirty pounds of bacon, which is not in the indictment; the things have been in the custody of the officer ever since. (The things were produced in Court, and deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Whereabouts is the value of the things?</p>
               <p>Court. They are under the mark altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the prisoner at home? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the very place it was to be expected to find him-was he drunk or sober? - A. It is impossible for me to say; I believe he was sober. I asked the prisoner, as he was going to the Compter, how he could go into my house, who had been such a friend to him; he said, he was intoxicated; that it was as light as noon-day.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were all these things in your dining-room on the Saturday night? - A. They were; I did not see them on the Saturday night, I saw them on the Friday night.</p>

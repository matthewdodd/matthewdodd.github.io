                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Scollar, and live at 15, Frederick-street, Hampstead-road. On 7th Oct. we removed from Charles-street, Goswell-road—previous to doing so I borrowed a carpet bag of the prisoner's wife—the prisoner was present when I borrowed it—I put into it a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, fifteen sovereigns, a half-sovereign, some halfpence, five silver spoons, a brush and comb, and several other articles—the prisoner was present, and saw me put the things in—about six o'clock in the evening, after waiting some time, I proceeded to Frederick-street, in company with my husband—the prisoner and his wife had gone on with the van—I had the carpet bag, and I followed—when we got to Frederick-street the prisoner's wife took the carpet bag from my arm, and</p>

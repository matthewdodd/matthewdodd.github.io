I was robbed on the 31st of October, between eleven and twelve at night, as I was coming along the Strand. The two prisoners came to me, and asked me to give them something to drink. I told them I could not; I could not get change for a ten pound note. They followed me into Buckingham-street; we all three went into a public house; I stood with my note in my hand; I offered it to the landlady; she said she could not give me change; they followed me from there into the <placeName id="t18141130-6-crimeloc34">Strand</placeName>

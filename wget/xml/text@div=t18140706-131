I saw the prisoner; I purchased four oranges of him for four-pence; I gave him a good shilling; he said, he had no sixpence; he then said, he had no copper. He looked at the shilling before he said he had no copper. He gave me the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060063"></xptr>shilling as I supposed back again. He then said, have you got an eighteen-penny piece, or a three-shilling piece; I gave him an eighteen-penny piece. He gave me another shilling, and the rest in copper. I am sure the prisoner is the lad. I gave the shillings to Shuter, the constable.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not the last witness give you two shillings - A. Yes; before the Lord Mayor. I have had them ever since. I apprehended the prisoner in Leadenhall-street; he ran up a gateway. I saw him slip something out of his breeches pocket, and put it into his mouth. These are the two shillings I took out of his mouth.</p>

            , I have it in my hand; I told him I had not so much in my pocket, only a 5l. note, which I sent by the waiter, and desired him to say, he might have the remainder to-morrow, or any other time; he had been several times at my house, when he was officiating at the church of the parish of St. Martin; he dined one Sunday in his black gown, and went away in the evening; it was on the Wednesday morning I received the draft for change, and on Saturday I took it to Smith, Payne, and Smith's, to get cash for it, when they told me it was a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner again, after you had been informed it was a forgery, before he was taken up? - A. Yes, I saw him that evening, and informed him of it; he told me he had it from his father, inclosed in a letter from Weymouth; I asked him for his father's address, which he said was Robert Smith, Esq. Terrace, Weymouth, Dorset, and that his own address was Thomas-Scott Smith, No. 25, Frederick-place, Hampstead-road; he said, if I would go with him to his lodgings, he would convince me that he came honestly by the bill, by shewing me the letter he had from his father; I went with him, and he shewed me a letter, of which he read part; I was not satisfied with it, because he would not let me see that part of the letter that related to the draft; for, he said, there were family affairs in it, and he would not let me see it.</p>
               <p>Q. What steps did you take? - A. He said, if I would let it remain till Monday, he would then call upon me, and go with me to the bankers to convince me it was all right; on Monday, he sent for me to the sexton's room in St. Martin's Church-yard; I went, and he told me he had been disap<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180110280015"></xptr>pointed in hearing from his father, but if I would let it remain till Wednesday, he would give me satisfaction, and I should lose nothing by it; I wrote to his father by Monday night's post, as I supposed, at Weymouth, but received no answer whatever; on the Friday, I went to Bow-street to ask Mr. Bond what I had best do about it, and then he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. This transaction first took place on a Wednesday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When the waiter brought you the bill, you gave him five pounds? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday was the first application you made to the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you his father's address, and his own? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you went to his own lodgings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went again on the Monday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You met him again on the Wednesday? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you saw him on the Friday? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. That was Friday week after the transaction first took place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He might have gone away in that time? - A. No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You always found him agreeable to where you expected? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p> - sworn. - I am clerk in the house of Wilkinson, Bloxham, and Co. bankers; I have known the prisoner some years before this transaction; he was in the house of his father, who is in the leather line in Crooked-lane, in the city of London; the business was carried on there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of his father ever living at Weymouth? - A. I do not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever know he was at the University, or acted as a clergyman? - A. No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the father's hand-writing? - A. I do; I have seen him write, (the draft shewn the witness); I do not believe this to be his handwriting.</p>

             sworn. - On the 11th of September, I apprehended the prisoner in his room, No. 25, Frederick-place, Hampstead-road; he seemed very much alarmed; I found two letters there. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Capper). Should you know the letter that was read to you? - A. No; as he was reading it, and refused to shew it, I said, good God, is there any similarity between the hand-writing of the draft, and that letter.</p>
               <p>Q.(Shewing him a letter). Can you say whether that was the letter? - A. I did not see the inside of the letter he read from.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. May it please your Lordships, Gentlemen of the Jury, I only have to say, that I received the note in question from my father; and as for any intention to defraud Mr. Capper, I am sure I had none; there was not a meeting that he fat, at which I was not regular to the time, and I leave it to your Lordship's consideration, and that of the Gentlemen of the Jury, whether it would not have been in my power to have got out of the way, if I knew I was in danger, after he gave me a week or ten days; instead of that, I kept in the way, and told him, I should be able to settle it with him, but he took me up without giving me the least notice; indeed, when I gave the draft in question, Mr. Capper was very much intoxicated, and did not know what he was about, and if I had asked the witnesses, they would have said the same.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Capper.) Q. Were you in liquor, or not? - A. I was not so bad but I recollect every thing that passed; I remember receiving the draft, putting it in the till, and locking it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I believe you will recollect, that before the Magistrate, you said, the first waiter that came, gave you the draft? - A. I don't recollect which waiter I fixed on at that time, but one of them brought it, and I asked him who the change was for; he said, for Mr. Smith, the clergyman; then I called the other waiter, and gave him the 5l. note to take to him.</p>

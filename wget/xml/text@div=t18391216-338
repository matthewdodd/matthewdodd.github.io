                  </hi>. I am a cane merchant, and live in Sun-street, Bi<lb></lb>shopsgate. I may have seen the prisoner before this happened, but not to know him—a person called at my house, and gave me information, which led me to go down to the witness Smith, who, my informant told me, was buying property which was stolen—Smith was not at home—I left my card, and he came to me the same evening—I had some conversation with him about this cane—after going to two or three places, he took me to a cellar, where the prisoner (who is a basket-maker) was at work—this was last Friday week—the prisoner was called up—I said, "I have come to you about this cane you have been selling to Smith, I want to know where you got if"—he said he could not tell the man he got it of, that it was brought to his house, and that the man was a stranger to him—I said, "You must know who the man is"—he said he could not tell me, he did not know him, but if I would let it stand over, the next time the man brought any he would stop him—I said, "That will not do for me, I must know; will you go with me, and see if you know any of my men?"—he said he would rather not, he was busy—I said, "I shall insist on your going"—he said, if that was the case he would go—he came down to my house, and I had all my men called up—he said, it was none of them that he received it from—I sent for a policeman, and gave him into custody—after taking him before the Lord Mayor, he discharged him, on condition that he should go back with me to my house and see the men again, but I found</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cane-merchant, and live in Gloucester-terrace, Mile-end. I have known the prisoner five or six years as a basket-maker—he came to me on the evening of the 29th of November with about 20lbs. weight of cane to sell me—I asked him bow much it was—he said 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound, and I bought it of him—I also bought 28lbs. weight of him next morning—I asked him how he came by it—he said he had it from a fisherman—I afterwards delivered the cane to Mr. Crowder—I said to the prisoner after I bought it, that the cane looked like Crowder's—I can<lb></lb>not recollect what he said—I might have said he would be found out at Christmas, when they took stock—I said, "If Mr. Crowder takes stock, you will get into an awkward predicament, and take care of Christmas"—he said he should go on till Christmas, and then leave off.</p>

                  </hi>. I work for the last witness. I remember the prisoner coming on the evening of the 29th—he called in the morning first and brought a bundle of cane, and said he was going mending—he called at eight o'clock in the evening, and master bought what he had left, which was about 20lbs. weight for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I believe—I was not present next morning when he called—on the 3rd of December I was present when he called, and master said he would rather have no more, he did not think it was all right (he had come to ask when he should bring another bundle)—he said he bought it at a fair price, it was brought to him in broad day<lb></lb>light, and he did not care for any one—Smith said wherever it came from they would miss it when they took stock at Christmas—he said he should leave off buying at Christmas—I told him, myself, I thought it was Crow<lb></lb>der's stock.</p>

            . I keep a public house in Grafton-street. Betwixt 9 and 10 at night, on the 24th of last month, I heard there were three or four men in the street, and it was imagined they were upon no good design. I went to the door, and saw the prisoner go to the prosecutor's shop door; he stooped down almost upon his knees, and then ran into the shop; after he was in, the person along with him walked by the door, to see, as I suspected, how he came on. I went up to the door, the prisoner came out with the ham in his hand, I laid hold of him, and called to Mr. Sumerville, and said he was robbed: he came out, the prisoner dropped the ham; we took him to the Round-house, and the next morning before Justice Welch, where he owned he took it.</p>

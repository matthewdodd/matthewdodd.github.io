                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the employment of Messrs. Hodgkinson, who carry on business as wholesale druggists, at No. 213, Upper Thamesstreet—many of the articles in which they deal are of a valuable kind—the prisoner Charles Witham Harridge was an assistant in the employment—he was in the dry department—that is the department in which drugs of a valuable kind are kept—we keep salacine and quinine there—I remember the policeman Evans calling upon me—it was on Wednesday, 1st Dec—in consequence of what he said to me, I went to Mr. Slipper's, a retail druggist in Leather-lane—I there saw certain drugs which Mr. Slipper said he had purchased—they were shown to me in the presence of the officer Who accompanied me—I returned immediately and communicated to the firm what I had learnt; and one of the firm, Mr. Tonge, fetched a bottle of salacine from the warehouse, and in my presence he scratched the label on the bottle, and requested me, being resident on the premises, when all the other servants were gone, to mark others—I did so on the same day, the 1st Dec.—the labels on the bottles are blue, and printed in gold; it is a French preparation—I marked other bottles in the same way—the salacine was marked the same evening, and the quinine I marked on Sunday, Dec. 5th, nothing was said about quinine on the 1st—I marked the quinine with invisible ink—I marked it in consequence of some further information which I got from Mr. Slipper—I had been to Mr. Slipper's, and desired him to ask for more quinine—after marking the salacine and quinine, I replaced them in their several places whence they were taken—that was a place to which Charles Harridge had access; it was in the dry department—these were not wet goods, they are powders—I afterwards called on Mr. Slipper, on 9th Dec, in consequence of a communication from him, and he showed me some salacine and quinine; there was eight ounces of quinine, and four ounces of salacine; they were parts of the quinine and salacine that I had marked—they were in one ounce bottles.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been in the service of Messrs. Hodgkinson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between eleven and twelve years; I think the prisoner Charles has been there between two and three years—it may be possibly more, but I think not three years—I should imagine that he must have come with a high character, he came from a respectable customer—the firm usually take great care of that circumstance—the firm consists of five partners; they are all in the business—there are between thirty and forty servants—there are several persons who have access to the dry department, no strangers are ever there—persons coming there to deal would not have access there; they could not—the quinine was kept in a chest locked—that is in the department of Charles Harridge—there is a key which is kept on a post before the warehouseman, for the use of the others—anybody could have access to it whose business it was to procure goods for the wrappers—there are only three in that department—either of those three would have an opportunity of taking it; that would not apply to a porter—when a person had an order, he would go and take the key and go to the chest, and take any quantity he wanted for his order—he would not ask the warehouseman for permission, if the warehouseman was there he would see him—he is not always there, he is mostly—Charles Harridge was in that department—I am sure of that—he was a weigher, it was his business to procure these things—he was in the room where the quinine was kept—the other weighers were also there—the prisoner would not have to weigh quinine,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185301030019"></xptr>
               <p>it is kept already weighed in one ounce bottles; a weigher would have to procure goods from different parts of the warehouse, and take them to the wrappers—he would not have to apply to the warehouseman for an order to take quinine if he wanted it, he would take the key and proceed to the chest—there is no permission required from the warehouseman, I presume it is merely a safeguard against the porters—I cannot say whether the prisoner ever got any quinine in his life, he may have done so, I cannot say that her has, I was a clerk in the counting-house—he was not a wrapper—I believe it was not the practice for the wrappers to get the quinine, but being a clerk in the warehouse I do not know the exact minutiæ of the thing—I know the practice of the warehouse—it is the duty of the weigher to proceed to any part of the warehouse to procure such articles as the wrapper may require—I presume quinine is no exception to any other article—a weigher is a man who weighs—the quinine is not weighed at the time, it is in bottles kept ready for delivery—the weigher would have no occasion to go to the quinine for the purpose of weighing it, he would have to procure it for his wrapper; the wrapper always stands at the counter—I believe the prisoner Charles is between twenty-two and twenty-three years of age.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a retail druggist, of Leather-lane. I know the prisoner, Henry Harridge; I have always known him by the name of Humphreys—I think I first became acquainted with him in June last—I have made purchases of drugs of him on several occasions—in consequence of what transpired on the matter, I communicated with our wholesale druggist, and they sent the police to me—Evans was the man that I saw—it was principally quinine that I purchased of Henry Harridge, nitrate of silver, and iodine—it was in June that I made the first purchase—I should think I made purchases of Henry Harridge about twelve or fourteen times—upon Mr. Joseph calling upon me, after seeing the police, I made a communication to him, and showed him some drugs—in consequence of directions from Mr. Joseph I sent to No. 418, Strand, to Humphreys, for 8 ozs. of quinine and 4 ozs. of salacine—I received them on 9th Dec, I think—Henry Harridge brought them to me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—each bottle of quinine contains an ounce—one of the bottles was tested by acid before the Magistrate—this is it—I have eight of these bottles—I have a mark of my own on them; these are the bottles I purchased of Henry Harridge—I paid 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an oz. for the quinine, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for the salacine—at that time I was in communication with the police—after I had made this purchase, I sent for Mr. Joseph and showed him these articles.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185301030020"></xptr>
               <p>brought it—I have seen that person once since, but I do not know him—I saw him last on the 7th or 8th Dec., I did not order anything of him then; the only order I gave him was in June—he called on me to solicit orders—he did not mention quinine, or anything specially, but simply to solicit orders—Henry Harridge had then received my order for these things—drugs are purchased at sales to a very considerable extent—I purchased the first lot without any hesitation—this quinine was manufactured in France; the salacine I should imagine is either German or Italian, by the appearance of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the discount allowed to the trade on these articles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe quinine is a net article generally, or there may be 2 1/2 per cent. discount.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Hodgkinson, but to another wholesale house that I do business with, Davey, Macmurdo, and Co.—I mentioned it to their traveller at the latter end of July—I had not bought anything from June to July; I have not sold the goods that I bought, I have kept them—I first gave 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., an oz. for the quinine; in July I gave 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., it was that transaction that I first mentioned—the memorandum I am referring to is taken from my book, my cash book is not here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Let us understand—you say you made a purchase in June, and afterwards communicated to your wholesale druggist—how soon after that did you come into communication with the police? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think about the middle of Oct.—the purchases which I made from the middle of Oct. down to the present time were known to the police—these things that have been produced are a portion of what I purchased on 9th Dec.—this is the mark which I made myself, it is merely the price and date—I also marked the salacine—I made a mark on all the bottles.</p>

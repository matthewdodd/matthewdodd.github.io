                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Thomas Steel in High Holborn. Between eight and nine o'clock on Friday evening the 4th of June, the prisoner came to my master's shop with a pattern shoe, and wished a pair of prunella shoes of the same size—I attended to her at first—after some time I had occasion to leave her to attend to a gentleman— there was another shopman present—the prisoner tried on some show herself, but not the prunella ones—the prunella pair were sold by the pattern shoe—I told her they were 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said she did not care about the price—after I had attended to the gentleman I came back to her—there were some morocco shoes on the back of a chair—the prisoner did not try on any of them—while she was in the shop, I missed one pair of these morocco shoes—she did not purchase any shoes for herself—she was to pay Mrs. Steel for the prunella shoes she purchased—I put them, and the odd shoe which she brought for a pattern, in a piece of paper—I did not put a pair of morocco shoes in the paper, or any others, I am quite sure—I observed the prisoner leave the shop—I followed her, and saw her two doors off—I overtook her about half-a dozen doors down Chancery-lane, going towards Fleet-street—I took her by the hand and asked her to come back to the shop—I do not recollect her saying any thing—she had a paper parcel in her hand—I took it out of her hand—there were in it one pair of prunella shoes, one pair of morocco shoes, and the odd shoe—the pair of morocco was one of the pairs that had been on the chair—I met a policeman and gave her in charge—I had then taken the shoes out of the paper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Steel. I saw the prisoner in the shop between eight and nine o'clock—I attended to her while Hedges went to a gentleman—I showed her some shoes—I saw Hedges fold up one pair of prunella shoes, and an odd one—I saw two pairs of morocco shoes on a chair-back—I missed one pair while Mr. Hedges was wrapping the shoes up in the paper—my mistress was at the desk to I receive the money—the prisoner went up to my mistress and gave her some money, which I suppose was to pay for the prunella shoes, and while my mistress was getting the change, the prisoner went very fast out of the shop, almost ran—my mistress called after her with the change—she made no answer, but went out.</p>

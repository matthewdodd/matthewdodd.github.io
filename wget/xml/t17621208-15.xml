I lost a watch last June; I cannot tell the particular time; I had lent it to Mr. Norris, a fellow-scholar, to seal a letter with the seal in the dormitory. The prisoner at the bar was taken up on suspicion of stealing a coat, about the beginning of this month; the Justice before whom he was carried, was Mr. Pearson, a pawnbroker; his servant-maid hearing the name Cannon, said, she remembered a watch was pawned there in that name; I hearing of this, I went and described my watch, it appeared to be mine that was lost in the dormitory. The prisoner was there at the time I heard him own he pawned it. (Produced in the court, and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>I was going through the Mews, I passed by a Jew with a green bag on his arm, with a pair of leather breeches. I asked him the price of them, he said 12 s. I wanted to go to some house to try them on; going a little farther there was a coach house door open, I went in and tryed them on there. I bought them for 10 s. Then he asked me if I would buy a watch; he shewed me this, and asked 50 l. for it, I bid him 7 guineas. I bought it for 45 s. I being a little sort of a judge of these things. I believe this is about 6 months ago.</p>

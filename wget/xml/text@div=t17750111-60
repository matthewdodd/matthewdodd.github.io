            . I received a letter from the prisoner desiring me to come to him at the Poultry-Compter, I went there to him, he gave me the key of a small table drawer, i n which he said the key of his trunk was deposited, and desired I would bring him some memorandum books out of his trunk, in which were some receipts, I carried them to the Poultry Compter, and delivered them to him, he looked at the receipts and memorandums books, and gave them to me again</p>
               <p>(Three receipts shewn the witness.)</p>
               <p>Kendall. These are the three receipts I had from him, I staid about an hour with him, he expected he was going before my Lord Mayor, but I found they were taking him to Litchfield-street, I went with him there, they kept him there all day, I asked him why he had not a hearing, he told me he believed they were about making it up; in the evening they sent over to the public house we were at, (that was on Monday the 2d of this month to the best of my knowledge) they desired he</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177501110031"></xptr>would send some friend over with the receipts.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the justices know any thing about the receipts?</p>
               <p>Kendall. I can't tell, I was along with Elcan there, and several of the parties, I believe, though I did not know any of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. 
               <persName id="t17750111-60-person511">

             the clerk of the office of the receipts?</p>
               <p>Kendal. I believe not, I applied to Mr. Carlton, to know why he had not a hearing of the justices, he said he thought he had better make it up.</p>
               <p>Q. The charge then was for a fraud?</p>
               <p>Kendall. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know what receipts you were to carry?</p>
               <p>Kendall. I suppose Mr. Elcan had mentioned that he had some receipts, I went over with these three receipts at Mr. Elcan's request, and delivered them to one of the clerks in the office, and he went into the office and delivered them to Mr. Welch, Mr. Carlton his clerk, and myself, looked them over; when the receipts were looked over, I believe Mr. Hart was called in, and shewn them by Mr. Welch; he looked them over, Mr. Welch asked him if they were his receipts, he said the receipt for an hundred pounds, and that for fifty pounds, were his receipts, but that the other was not his receipt, Justice Welch replied, if those two are your receipts, the third is yours, he declared it was not his receipt, and upon examining that for the 160 the name William was at length; he said he always signed his name Wm. and his partner declared he always saw him write his name in that manner, and never William at length. Elcan was sent for, he insisted upon it they were Hart's receipts, and desired liberty to write his name upon the back of all the three receipts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say upon what occasion that receipt for 160 was given?</p>
               <p>Kendall. I dont recollect that he did, any more than that he had taken those receipts for the value he had paid for them. He said they were Mr. Hart's receipts.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the charge then?</p>
               <p>Kendall. On suspicion of obtaining a note or notes by false pretences.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it with a view of exculpating him self from that charge, these receipts were produced.</p>
               <p>Kendall. I believe so, when he wrote to me to come to him, he said he had the proper receipts for the money he had paid.</p>
               <p>The Letter from the prisoner to the witness was read, the purport of it was desiring the witness of come to him at the Poultry Compter. As he had no other friend that he could trust his receipts and valuable papers with.</p>
               <p>Q. The body of this letter is not the prisoner's hand writing?</p>
               <p>Kendall. I believe he cannot write or read English. The first time I over saw him, was on the 17th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what he is?</p>
               <p>Kendall. No.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the receipts were sent in to the justices, was it before the prisoner was brought over.</p>
               <p>Kendall. I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, Hart said before the justice that he always signed his name William.</p>
               <p>Kendall. Yes, he and his partner both said so.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he sign the information he gave there.</p>
               <p>Kendall. In full length, Mr. Welch got up and seemed angry, and asked why he did not write his name there, as he always did.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. When did you become acquainted with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Kendall. The first time I ever saw him to my knowledge was on the 17th of December,</p>
               <p>Q. Because in this letter, he says, I have no friend but you that I can trust; that looks as if you was an old acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Kendall. It does; I rather was surprized at that letter, it was wrote upon New Year's Day. I thought it a little particular that a person should forge a receipt and not be more particular in copying it from others, but write it at full length, when the others were only Wm.</p>

When Elcan was in custody on Monday the second Mr. Kendall desired to know what the charge was, I told him it was for a fraud. Mr. Kendall told me that the prisoner said he had a receipt to produce; I acquainted the sitting magistrates with that, they told me to desire Mr. Kendall to bid Elcan produce them, Mr. Kendall took them into my room; we went with them into the room to Mr. Welch, before the prisoner was called in, Mr. Hart and Mr. Kendall were called in. Mr. Welch looking at the receipts, he thought they were all the same signing; but upon Mr. Hart and Mr. Fikes being both examined, they declared that the receipt for one hundred pounds and the other for fifty pounds, were the receipts signed by Hart for himself and co. but they both declared, the receipt for one hundred and sixty pounds was not the signing of

               <p>Cooper. Several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you look upon yourself to have sufficient knowledge to judge of his character and manner of writing?</p>

               <p>Cooper. I am of opinion that is not his writing, the others I think are; I don't remember that I hardly ever saw him write his christian name at full length.</p>

The next day or the day after, Mr. Elcan called again and shewed me this receipt for one hundred and sixty pounds; I suppose in order to convince me that value had been given for the bill. Mr. Hart called that day or the day after, he said he was satisfied, and had received value for it, and if I chose I might do the bill. I did not discount the bill, I told Mr. Hart, that I had seen a receipt for one hundred and sixty pounds to the best of my recollection, he said, he had given a receipt, but did not I believe say what for.

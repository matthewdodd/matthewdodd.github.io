            . I am a Policeman. On the 2nd of August I was in a pawnbroker's-shop in Sloane-street, and while I was there Gazey came in, and brought these two pieces of a broken spoon to pawn - they refused to take it, and then she wanted it mended; when she went out I followed her - she crossed, and joined three or four girls of the town; after some conversation with them she went on, and I followed her - I asked what she had got; she said Nothing - I said I had my doubts about that - she then said, "I have a spoon, which is my own property;" I said I should take her to the watch-house - she said she would not go, but she would take me to the house- she took me to the prosecutor's; she called Cresswell to the door, and told her the Policeman was after her - she slipped the spoon into her hand; I took it from her, and found there had been a crest on it, which was nearly erased - Cresswell said it was her own, that her mother had had it left to her before she was born; I said I was not satisfied, I should take her to the watch-house - she said I should not, for it was all right, her son had given it to her, who was now in the West Indies - on our way to the watch-house she said she had found it in a piece of rag, but she could not say when, nor where.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Were you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080096"></xptr>dressed in your uniform? A. Yes; she was in the shop rom three to five minutes - I do not know any thing of either of the prisoners - Gazey took me to the house where Cresswell was.</p>

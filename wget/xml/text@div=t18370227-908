                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable L</hi> 118.) On the 28th of january, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the Westminster-road, near the Har<lb></lb>mon eating-house—I saw the prisoner there with another person—the other went into the eating-house, but before that I saw the prisoner give him something, that induced me make inquiries there—I then followed them as far as the Marsh-gate, and saw the prisoner's companion in the pastry—cook's shop, and the prisioner the prisoner waiting outside—the companion ran out of the shop, and ran down the New-cut—the prisoner followed him—I called caldwell—we pursued and took the prisoner—he made great resistance—I have got two shillings and five sixpences which I got from Caldwell—I saw him take them from the prisoner's waistcoat pocket—at the police-office the prisoner said a boy gave them to him.</p>

I found in his left-hand waistcoat pocket a paper folded up, which I gave to Brook—I put my hand in again and found another paper, that contained two bad shillings, and three sixpences—these are them, and I found a good sixpence afterwards, and another bad one.</p>

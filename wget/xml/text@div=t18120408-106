               <p>Q. Were your store robbed of any coals on the 31st of January. - A. It was between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner that I convicted last sessions was a man employed in a stable that we have separted by a boarded partition, and the prisoner was in the stable, and in the act of throwing out the coals. This man was in the stable, and was the man that opened the door to me, and afterwards absconded. It was the stable adjoining the warehouse belonging to me and my partner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any communication between the stable and the coal-warehouse. - A. None whatever, the boards were removed so as to enable a person to have access to my coals in my warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you found out the parties, did you discover that your coals were diminished close to that stable - A. We searched in the morning, and found that a large quantity of coals were gone, and these boards, leaving a passage to the stable where the late prisoner was employed, they could not have been removed from my premises at that spot. In consequence of the coals being removed, I lay in wait. Soon after six o'clock I heard a shovel going in the warehouse, and in the act of throwing out coals, I went to the stable door where the late prisoner was employed, whom I had seen go in with a light, I knocked at the stable door, and in a faint voice, asked the prisoner to open the door and let me in, he opened the door, and as soon as he saw me, he set off and ran away, and we were not able to see or hear any thing of him for a great length of time, I then went to the far end of the warehouse, and detected the other man throwing the coals out, to the amount of eight or nine bushels thrown out; the other man I secured, this man absconded till last Friday week he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the worth of these coals - A. Twelve shillings.</p>

I told the inspector of the police I was the freeholder, but I am nothing but an agent to him"—I kept the warrant from him—he knocked me down and ransacked my pocket; and my wife went for the policemen, but they would not ender into it—I went to Union Hall—they said I must go to a higher court—I was robbed twice by him, and my goods sold—here is the warrant—he did not say any thing about the money I had in my pocket—he said he wanted the warrant back—he collared me, he and Clare, and knocked me down to take it out of my breeches' pocket, but I kept it—he took nothing out—he put his hand to the pocket the note was in.</p>

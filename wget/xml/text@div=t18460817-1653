                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Barrett, of Chancery-place, Shadwell. On the 14th of Aug. I saw the prisoner gathering dust with a cart—he was scolding a woman who lives in the same house as I do—I interfered—I struck him the first blow—he struck me again, and knocked me down, and cut the right side of my head with his fist—I fell with the blow he gave me—he ran away—I saw my husband coming, and told him—: he went after him, and struck him several times—my husband was taken up for it—I came home and laid down on the bed—in a short time afterwards I could not stand, and found I had been stabbed in the lower part of the belly—my clothes were cut right through—no one had been near me bat the prisoner—I never saw a knife or any other instrument in his hand—none of the women could have cut me.</p>

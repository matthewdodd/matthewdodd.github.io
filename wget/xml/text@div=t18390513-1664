                  </hi>. I am employed at Mr. John Hendry's, a shoe ware-house, in High-street, St. Giles. The prisoner came there about three o'clock, last Wednesday, and wanted a pair of shoes—my master showed her a pair at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she refused them, and looked at two other pairs—she still kept the three pairs in her hands—my master then looked for another pair, and they fitted her—while he was doing that, she put two pairs under her shawl—the prisoner then asked the price of the pair she had on—he said 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner said it was too much—he said he could not take any less—he then missed a pair of shoes from the counter, and asked her if she had seen them—she said, "No"—he asked her if she had put them under her arm in mistake—she said, "No, how can you think such a re<lb></lb>spectable woman as I am would do that?"—he said, "You must have them"—the prisoner then sat down in the chair, and began to try on the pair she had in the paper, and in so doing she dropped two pairs from under her arm, at the back of the chair—I saw her do so.</p>

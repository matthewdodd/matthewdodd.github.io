                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman V</hi> 151). On the 16th August, 1870, about 6.30 I met the prisoner and another man named William Turner, on the Small wood Road, Tooting—they were each carrying a bag—I asked them what they had got in the bags, they made no answer at first and I asked them again, and they said they had some <hi rend="italic">grub</hi>—I told them I wanted to see what it was, and they refused to let me see, and said if I wanted to see I should have to take them to the station—they went on</p>

               <p>about 150 yards down the main road, and the prisoner took hold of me ground the throat, and Turner, who is convicted, took my truncheon—I felt for it and found it was gone—I looked and saw it in Turner's hands after it came crack on my head—the prisoner was holding me, and Turner kept striking me with the truncheon till it broke—the prisoner kicked me the whole of the time and struck me with his fist and, cut my lip—I fell down after the fourth blow came on my head—when I was down they both got on the top of me—the prisoner kicked me and the other one beat me with the fragments of the truncheon—the prisoner said "<hi rend="italic">Will</hi>, murder him; don't let him get up again"—Tisdale came to my assistance—he said "you call that fair play, knocking that poor fellow about"—immediately they heard his voice they jumped up and ran off—I saw Turner go to the hedge and I caught hold of his leg and pulled him back into the road, but this prisoner got away—I fainted afterwards—there were a lot of wounds on my head—I bled very much and soaked everything I had on—I was under the doctor's hands from 16th August till 27th November—the prisoner hit me with his clenched first and cut my lip—I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

I am a gardener—on 16th August, 1870, I was going to my garden, about 6.30 in the morning—I heard a cry for help, and I ran up—I saw two men beating the policeman—one was beating him with a staff and the other was kicking him—I can't swear that the prisoner was one of them—I called out "Is it fair to kick a man when he is on the ground?"—the man who has been convicted, ran to the left, and the other to the right—a young man who was behind me ran after one, and I ran to help Nettlingham, who had got the other by the leg as he was getting over the hedge—I laid him on his back and throttled him, and knelt on him—Nettlingham fell on the ground, and laid there twenty minutes—I got some men to help him up—he was in a very bad state—it took two men to take him to the station—I took the other prisoner to the station myself—the policeman was smothered with blood.</p>

I live at the New Merton Road, where it happened—I am a nurseryman—on 16th August, last year, about 6.30 in the morning, I saw the two men and the policeman coming across the field—they got into the main road, and the prisoner here caught the policeman round the shoulders and got him on the ground; the other one took his truncheon and struck him on the head several hard blows—Hr. Tisdale came up and assisted the policeman, and the other prisoner was taken—I did not see anything of this prisoner afterwards—the constable was covered with blood and dust—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man who was there—I had seen him before.</p>

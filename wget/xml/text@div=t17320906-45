They chose one; we agreed upon the Price, and White gave me a Guinea to change. There not being Silver enough in the Till, I went to the Counting house, and pull'd out a Drawer, in which were 3 Bags of Money, and White followed me. I took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173209060040"></xptr> out some Silver, and laid it on the Table; but before I had told out 15 s. I mist one of the Bags. I call'd to the 'Prentice in the Shop, and said, was not here three Bags? He answer'd, Yes. Upon which White in a Harry cry'd, Give me Change give me my Change Candy, who stood at the Door, calld out White, and said, Come along, what do you stay for ? And presently White, before I could stop him, hurried to Candy, and they both run out of the Shop together, without taking either the Cheese, or the Change, or the Guinea. I pursued them, and in the middle of Martin's Lane I stopp'd Candy. He struck me 2 or 3 times, and swore, if I did not let him go, he would knock m e down, but I brought him back to the Shop.</p>

            . Between 5 and 6 on Friday Night, as I was going down Martin's Lane, I found a Bag. And seeing a Crowd in Thames-street at the bottom of the Lane, I went to see what was the matter, and they told me, that 2 Men were going before the Justice for stealing a Bag of Money. I'll be bang'd, says I, if it is not the Bag that I found. So I gave it to my Master Mitchell, and he opened it, and I saw some broad Pieces, and Moidores, and Silver in it.</p>

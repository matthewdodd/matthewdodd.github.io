                  </hi>. I am a miller, and live at Heston. The prisoner was in my service from three to four months—it was his duty to take a cart to town on the 28th of May—I went into my stable at half-past eleven o'clock the night before—I saw about five pecks and a half of corn in a bag, with some straw over it, under the harness—(the prisoner ought to have had about half a peck of corn)—he called me at half-past two, and he was to go soon after—I got up, and followed him a quarter of a mile—I then searched the cart he was driving, and found the five pecks of oats that I had seen in the stable over-night—the proper allowance for the horses was on their heads—I asked how he came to do so—he said his father was coming the next day, and he wanted a little money to spend with him; he would leave all his wages to make up for it.</p>

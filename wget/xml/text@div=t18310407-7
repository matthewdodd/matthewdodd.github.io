               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to him before he made use of that observation? A. No - I went into the auction-room with him, and saw some wearing-apparel strewed on the floor; among other things I saw a pair of old boots, which I have here - I found them opposite Flannagan's bed; I saw him get out of that bed - I asked Flannagan if those boots were his: he said not - I am sure of that.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe, after taking the prisoner up. you had some conversation with him? A. I had - I neither threatened him nor made him any promise - when I took him I told him he was charged with robbing Machin and Debenham, of Covent-garden; he was perfectly sober - I questioned him as to how he got possession of that watch, chain, and seals (this conversation was in the coach) - he told me be had bought it, and given 2l.10s. for it; I took the boots from his feet, and asked how he came by them - he said he bought them also, he did not say when or where - this was on Saturday, and on the Monday I took the coat and trousers from him - he said they were his own; I then took him before the Magistrate, and after he had been examined he sent for me, and told me he wished to see the Mogistrate - I took him into a private room before Mr. Roe, the Magistrate, who told him he had been given to understand by me that he wished to say something to him; he said Yes, he did - he stated that the robbery had been planned nearly two months previously, that Flannagan had let him and Casley in, while White stood at the door watching.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.Was this confession made under an idea that he should be admitted as an evidence? A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Examination continued. He said they were let in about twelve o'clock on Saturday night, the 12th, and that he had been led completely into it - that Flannagan lighted the candle, while he himself forced open the desk (where some of the property was) with a screw-driver; he also said that the property which I had taken from him was property taken from the prosecutors' - that the sixteen sovereigns I had got were part of the produce of the property.</p>
               <p>Q.Then this was after you had been to the woman, and got the money? A. Yes - he said he had been given to understand the property had been sold for 62l., but he was not present at the sale of it; he said the boots I had got were what he had brought away, and that he had left the old ones behind; here are those I took off his feet.</p>

            . I am a general-dealer. and live at No.16, Devonshire-street, Bishopsgate. (Looking at the boots taken from Spragg's feet) I know these boots - I had sent them on the 11th of February to Machin and Debenham's for sale; there has been a mark on them, where I mark all my boots, but it has been scraped out - I know them from their particular shape and make: here is where the mark appears to have been erased - I mark all my boots in that place.</p>

            . I am porter to the prosecutors. I do not know this coat, which was taken from Spraggs - it is a brown body coat: I have the catnlogue of the sale which was to take place, and can tell by it that a coat of that description was there - here is "lot 53 a brown coat," "lot 200 a fine gold chain," "lot 250 a silver hunter. capped and jewelled," which the watch produced is - "lot 331 a pair of trousers," "lot 444 a pair of boots and shoes;" I can state that lots corresponding with those numbers were there about half-past eight o'clock that night, when I left, and they were missing on Monday - I do not identify the property.</p>

               <p>Flannagan delivered in a written defence, of which the following is a literal copy:- Gentlemen of the Jury - I announce, with deep regret, my deplorable situation cannot meet with defence equal, I trust, and well know, to what I deserve. for want of pecuniary means. which alone disables me of benefit of Counsel; consequently, I hope to rely on confidential hopes of justice and ultimate mercy being administered to me, by the hands of a humane and impartial Jury - and I beg briefly to state true facts which flow alone from my own distracted breas. Gentlemen, I am truly innocent - I am not guilty of the crime imputed to my charge, and which is particularly enlarged by the press; nor was it ever my intention to rob or defraud although my situation, subject to my juvenile years, has exposed me to many temptations beyond expectations, which up to the present hour I have peremptorily rebutted, but must confess my aged employers were not altogether justified in placing so large and valuable a stock to the safety of only a boy; it likewise afforded a wide opening for attempts by duplicious associates; nor did I ever think that ever any of my connection would rob, until I was threatened with instant death, which took place after the door was opened. I certainly did open the door, but thought at the time that it was either my employer or alarm of fire, or some casual event or other; at this moment the parties rushed in, and put me into bodity fear - I did not participate nor share in the robbery; and true it is, I did not expose after the fact, being at all times in jeopardy and bodily fear by

            , whose desperate threats to blow my brains out if I divulged, was one cause that prevented me, and another, the fear of losing my situation; had the perpretrators of this dreadful deed not been discovered, I should have continued my situation - I considered I could not afford by confession my employers any benefit, as I never knew where any of the property was conveyed; as such, my intentions I considered could not be unjust nor fraudulent; I consider not to be fairly dealt with by the officers when taken, as undue insinnations and alarming threats were placed to me, containing many falsehoods, by way of forcing confession, and in my agitated moments - I could not now rehearse what I then said, although I own my situation at that time might cause them strongly to imagine that I was a guilty party. I have a list of my former employers. who have kindly volunteered to certify my honest conduct, as well as my prosecutors (Messrs. Debenham, Machin and Co.) the latter with whom I faithfully served as an assistant youth for three years, and I feel entitled to call my masters to my character for that time, and have been en<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070013"></xptr>trusted by them and hundreds of gentlemen in and about town, with various articles, and with considerable sums of money in their absence, and with extensive conveyance of property to very large amounts, of valuable descriptions, such as plate, jewellery and so forth, to some thousands of pounds - which, if I had been dishonest, afforded every opportunity, and this to all parts of town occasionally. And if it pleased God I am once returned again for the benefit of society, and my poor mother and her small family, whom I have much assisted at times, I am stedfast and firm I never will commit crime, or place myself under so great a charge of importance as my worthy employers eatrusted to my care.

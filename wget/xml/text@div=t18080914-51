               <p>Q. Do you know who the persons were that hustled you - A. Humphrey was one; and I saw Hankey put a screw thing in my pocket and turn it inside out; I saw in his hand when he was going away; I had two half guineas, a guinea, sixteen one pound notes, and a two pound note; they were bank of England notes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Mr. Woodward, you went to see the rowing match - I suppose you meaned to bet, or else you would not have took twenty pounds in your pocket - A. No; I took it with intention of paying some of it away as I returned. There was a great crowd in Mill bank road; it was a pretended fight and I went to see what it was; I was shoved into the crowd; Humphrey was one, and Hankey was another, and one I never could find, behind Humphrey, and there was of the name of Tallboys; I could have taken Hankey the same night if I had help; I saw him and four more in less than an hour after; I knew he was the man that robbed me</p>
               <p>Q. You know that if you can convict Hankey and Humphreys you will have eighty pounds reward - A. I do not want any reward.</p>
               <p>Q. I am not asking you that - I am asking you whether you do not know that you should have so much - A. I never knew any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you - A. I am fifty two.</p>
               <p>Q. And you mean to say that you never heard of a forty pounds reward - A. There is a reward, but I do not know the meaning of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what you told me two minutes ago is not true - you have heard it - A. I might have done.</p>
               <p>Q. I am not asking you what you might have done, have you not heard there is a forty pounds reward - A. I cannot say, but that I have heard such things; I do not know whether they are true or not.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you do not believe it is true, that there is a reward of eighty pounds if you convict the two prisoners - A. It may be so, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you believe - A. I dare say it is so, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not charged any other person but the prisoners and Tallboys - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you charge another man with being the man that hustled you - A. I did not charge him; he was the outside; I thought he was one of my friends; he was not.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon going up to him did not you take hold of his collar - A. I did not so help me God.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you charged Tallboys with being one of the men - A. I am sure he was one of the hustlers.</p>
               <p>Q. Tallboys was taken before the magistrate, the magistrate did not believe he was one of the men, he was discharged - A. He was discharged with bail.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you, upon Tallboys' brother coming forwards as bail for him, say he was one that hustled you - A. I did not; I thought he was my nephew, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon Hankey's father coming forward for his own son, you said you were in the hustle - A. He was in the hustle, he got hoisting up a stick, he did not hustle me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not imagine that I said he did hustle you - did not you say before the magistrate that he was in the hustle - A. I did say so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. How many people did hustle you - were there ten - A. I cannot say how many.</p>

            . I am one of the officer of Queen square office. I was upon the bank at the time this man complained of being robbed, I was very near being robbed of my watch myself; I went to the public house and left my watch. When I came back, I saw the man, he said he was robbed; I stopped upon the bank about half an hour, I took Humphries in custody, he was in company with a young woman. On Thursday my brother officer Raney and I went to a public house in Windmill street, St. James's; the prosecutor pointed out Hankey, he also pointed out Tallboys: they were taken in custody, Tallboys was discharged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. How many persons did the prosecutor point out - A. Tallboys and Hankey; he said Hankey was in the crowd, he did not say much of the person of Hankey, that I thought I was not authorised to take him in custody. He said he saw him upon the bank.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not he charge him of robbing him - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prosecutor after he had been robbed in Mill bank - A. Yes, in less than five minutes after the bustle I heard him say to a person that asked him whether he was the gentleman that lost the property, he said yes he was; he was then asked if he could recognize any of the parties; yes, he said, a man in a butcher's frock, and that was the only man he should know.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gillmore. When you apprehended the prisoners had either of them a butcher's dress on - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. How far was your boat from the Roebuck - A. Not above two minutes walk. When I went to the Roebuck Hankey was coming out of the door. I went backwards in the ground, I saw him return in about four or five minutes, with bread and cheese in his hand into the skittle ground; there was no playing at skittles as I observed, they were sitting smoking and drinking porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hankey continue there for any length of time - A. About an hour, or three quarters of an hour, then he turned into a room where there was dancing; he continued there longer than me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. When you came into the Roebuck did you see Humphries there - A. Yes, he was in company with a young woman, she was sitting by his side; he staid about three quarters of an hour, he went away with the young woman, he told me he was going to take tea.</p>
               <p>- BICKNELL. Q. What are you - A. I am a silversmith, I live in Compton street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the Roebuck, Mill bank, on the afternoon of the rowing match - A. Yes, I went there about five o'clock in the afternoon; Hankey was there. I came away about eight o'clock, and left him there.</p>

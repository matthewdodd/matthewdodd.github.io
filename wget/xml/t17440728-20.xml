            . I work for Mr. Willoughby a Press maker in Fore-street, the 11th of June Mr. Cater came to ask for Mr. Willoughby , and he said he had got an account of the persons who robbed him, and he said he heard they lived in Swan-alley, by the three Jolly Butchers. I told him I would go along with him and endeavour to take them, for they were generally out in the skittle ground. I knew it was a dangerous attempt, but I said I would be brought home myself if I did not take hold of them. I heard that

I went to the house of one Tidsell (who I sent for to come hither) I asked him whether Cox's credit was good enough to borrow 20 s. and pay it at a shilling a week. I did this that they might not suspect what I came about. I did tell him there was an old woman that lent out money at a shilling a week that desired me to enquire, and the landlord went and fetched him; he came and sat down, I said how do you do Cox? I think there is too little for you, I had the pot in my hand and drank to him, (some people said he looked a little white) and desired the landlord to bring another. I catched him by the collar, and I had a little Joiner's hatchet by my side, and I said if he stirred a step I would lay his head upon his shoulder; Tidsell said, If I had known this, I would not have called him; then Tidsell said to him, I told you what these whores would bring you to, but I did not think you had been so great a rogue as this; Cox said he did not do it; but he believed he knew who did, he said it was our Tom's wife and some other persons. Then said Tidsell send and have them taken up, but he wanted to go and fetch them himself: I said, it is the custom in our country always to keep an egg in the nest till the hen has laid again, so Sarah Cox was sent for and brought in, when she came in shed - d his eyes and limbs if she would not hang him and all the gang of them; after that she sell a swearing at me, she said she was present at the time of committing the robbery, and saw it done, but that it was

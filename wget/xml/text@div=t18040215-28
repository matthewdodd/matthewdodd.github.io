I looked out of the window, and saw Mr. Fairbox run down the street: I jumped over the counter, bolted the door, and ran after Mr. Fairbox, and when I got to Bishopsgate church, I saw the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150022"></xptr>stand with that pot in his hand, amidst a number of people; I went to him, and asked him whose pot he had in his hand; he answered, it was the pot he had picked up; he said, they were calling stop thief! after the man had dropped it; they cried, stop thief! after he had picked it up; I told him if he would come along with me, I would shew him where the pot belonged to; he came with me; after we had taken him into the house we searched him; there were five pots found upon him, and one he had in his breeches.</p>

                  </hi>. I work at the waterside, as a labourer—I work for any one. I was standing in Shoreditch, and I saw the prisoners make an attempt at picking pockets—I followed them—I saw Brackell attempt to pick Mr. Lewis's pocket—he pulled his handkerchief out a little way, and let it go—they still followed him, and just before they came to the corner of Houndsditch I lost sight of them for a moment—a cart passed, and I was on the other side of the way—as they came to the corner of Houndsditch I saw Brackell take the handkerchief from Mr. Lewis's pocket—King was close to him—I crossed, and asked Mr. Lewis if he had not lost a white handkerchief out of his pocket—the prisoners turned down Houndsditch, and I lost them as they turned a turning—I was speaking to the prosecutor—I looked towards Shoreditch way, and I said, "There they go"—we went and took Brackell—King ran off—I gave an alarm, and the beadle of the East India Company's warehouse took him—he said, "I have not got it"—he took off his hat—I took the handker<lb></lb>chief out of his hat, and put it into my own hat—a constable came up, and I gave it to him—since I have been bound over to prosecute I have been put to the greatest annoyance by the friends of King, and am almost afraid to go in and out of my own place.</p>

In consequence of suspicion I went to Norden's shop, in Longacre, on the 9th of May - I found a great number of books there; he was not at home; I desired that he might be sent to me when he came home, and in about an hour and a half or two hours he came - I told him I had seen a number of books on his shelves which belonged to me; he said he knew the man very well whom he bought them of; that he was a very respectable man, and he could produce him at any time; he said he had seen him within an hour - I had some conversation with him, and pointed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290078"></xptr>out Holmes to him, and asked if that was the person who sold them to him; he said No, he was not - he knew the person he bought them of, that he bought them for a fair price, and had given money for them; I asked, "How many sets of the Miseries of Human Life do you calculate you have had?" - he said he supposed about eighteen copies; I said, "Are you sure you have not had twenty? because in my warehouse they are all tied up in ten, twenty, or thirty" - he said, "I might have had twenty;" I asked what he gave, but he would not tell me - he said he gave a fair price, and bought them of a man whom he undertook to produce; he then went home, and in about two hours a person came and asked for a book, which I thought I could lay my hand on in a moment; I went and could not find it; I then called Holmes, and said,"Jem, where are the Conversations on Chemistry?" he said he had seen them very lately in that place - I said,"I am very sorry to accuse you, but I think you have been robbing me;" I continued to press him on his being so cruel - "Me, Sir, (said he) I have too good a place to rob you;" I spoke to him some time, and told him it would be better to confess.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the book been found before? A. Yes; he said he had employed another person to go with them; and he stood at Mr. Norden's door, while the other went in and sold them - I saw Norden the same evening in custody; I told him what the boy had stated; he said he had bought twenty copies of the Miseries, and said he would bring the person he had bought them of, but he has not brought him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long have you known Holmes? A. Two years, and placed unbounded confidence in him; I have trusted him with 100l. and found him just and true - I went to Norden again in the evening, and took him in his own shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is Norden's an open shop? A. Yes; the books lie in front for sale; it is common for people to send books round for sale when they are overstocked; I believe every bookseller has done it; we change them for books or money; the Miseries of Human Life was published twenty years ago; my son has no interest in the books - when I first went to Norden's I saw his wife; I told her the books were mine; I went again in the evening; he and the books still remained there - I think he said the man he bought them of kept a shop in Long-acre; books are often bought at sales and distributed through the trade; he did not mention the man's name; I offered a reward for the apprehension of a man in consequence of what Holmes told me; there were marks in the books, but they are rubbed off; the Miseries of Human Life were in quires at my house, but are now in boards; he was offering them at 6s.; I never sold them under 9s. 6d.; they were published at 14s.; here are several which I can swear to.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You are Mr. Wright's son-in-law? A.

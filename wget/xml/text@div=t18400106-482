                  </hi>I am an upholsterer, and live in my father's house, No. 20, Old-street-road, Shoreditch. On the 26th of December I missed a coat, which I bad seen safe the evening before when I undressed my<lb></lb>self, I took it off, and placed it on a chair—there was a silk handkerchief in the pocket—I missed it at ten o'clock next morning—I saw the coat the same morning on the prisoner's back, in Church-street, Shoreditch—I first saw him coming towards Shoreditch—he turned off, to go to a public<lb></lb>house—I was about fourteen doors from him, then only just across the road—I did not know him before—I saw another person, whom I was watch<lb></lb>ing, run against him, and make a slight halt, and then the prisoner turned off to go into the public-house—I immediately stepped off the curb to follow him into the public-house—the person who made the halt then gave a whistle, on hearing which the prisoner immediately left the public<lb></lb>house—he had only just stepped in—he came out and walked fast to the corner of the first turning—I was immediately opposite him—he went from me—he walked eight or nine yards—I immediately followed him, and when he came to the corner of the street he began to run—he ran about three paces, when I caught him by the collar, and took him to the opposite corner of the street—he then turned round and looked me in the face, and I told him he bad my coat on—he said he had not, for he had just bought it—I told him if he had bought it, to come with me to Shoreditch to a policeman, and we would see about it—he then scuffled and tried to get away, and caught hold of the post—I pulled him away—he then caught hold of the railing of a window—then two or three young persons came up, and one of them told the prisoner to <hi rend="italic">dowse</hi>me; on which he tried to put his leg between mine, and throw me down, but did not succeed—during the scuffle there was a whistle, and imme<lb></lb>diately about twenty persons came to his assistance from a public-house and a coffee-shop close by—on seeing them I became alarmed, and tried to pull him into Mr. Golding's shop, one door of which was open and the other closed—we both fell into the shop together, and I, falling on the pri<lb></lb>soner, made his nose bleed—I immediately got up with him under me, endeavouring to pull him into the shop, his legs being outside, and the persons outside pulled him by the legs, and pulled him outside, me and all—when we got outside he said he would go with me to the person he bought the coat of—I said be should not go any farther till I had the coat off his back—he tried to take it off, but one or two round him persuaded him not—I said I would go no farther till he took it off—he then took it off, and I took it from him—he then said he would go with me to the person he bought it of—on getting possession of the coat, I was in the act of putting it across my arm, when he ran away—a path was imme<lb></lb>diately cleared by those around him for him to effect his escape—I was immediately knocked down, that I should not run after him—while down</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184001060072"></xptr>
               <p>I felt somebody pulling at the coat—I got up and endeavoured to run after him again—I did not run far before I was tripped up—I got up again, and ran a little way—my hat was knocked off, und a silk handker<lb></lb>chief and gloves in it—I took up my hat and handkerchief, but not my gloves—I was completely hemmed in by a round ring, and could not get out—I darted at last through their legs—I was again tripped up, and by that time I lost sight of the prisoner—I ran in the direction he went, and saw him running up what, I believe, was Nichol-street—I ran after him, and heard footsteps behind me again—I turned round, and saw a young man in a smock-frock, and a person behind him told him to trip me up—I kept before him, and overtook the prisoner turning into a court—in the middle of the court a gentleman, coming in the opposite direction, caught him by the collar—I came up and told the gentleman to hold him fast—he said he would—that it was all right, he was a headborough—the prisoner said he was not the person that was wanted—I am sure he is the person I took the coat from—his nose was bleeding at the time—the headborough tried to get him into Shoreditch, but he laid down and would not come—one young man in the court told me I had got my coat, what did I want more—I told the headborough to hold him while I ran for a policeman—when I returned within a hundred yards of where I left him, I saw him running again, having got away from the headborough—I, the policeman, and others pursued him—he turned up a street, and was ultimately secured by the policeman—we had lost sight of him in the pursuit—I saw him next at the station-house in about half-an-hour—I am sure he is the person from whom I took the coat—the policeman has the coat.</p>

In the front shop, where I sleep—I did not notice it the next morning—I missed it at ten o'clock, when I was dressing myself to go out—it was the coat I usually wore when out, but not at home—I got up about a quarter to eight o'clock—I went to the shop door, and saw a person named Rush—it was ten o'clock when I went to the door—I heard the church bells going, and went to get my coat at half-past ten o'clock, and it was gone—I had been out of the shop two or three times—two boys assist me to mind the shop—I left them in charge of it when I went out—I had left the shop between a quarter to ten and ten o'clock—immedi<lb></lb>ately on my return from cleaning my father's horse, I missed the coat on going to dress myself—it must have been taken that morning—I saw Rush at the door soon after eight o'clock—after missing the coat I went to make inquiry at the pawnbroker's, and saw Rush in Shoreditch in com<lb></lb>pany—I suspected him, and followed him and his companion—after fol<lb></lb>lowing them some time, I saw the prisoner for the first time that day—Rush is the person that halted and spoke to the prisoner—it was Rush who attempted to rescue the prisoner—Rush tripped me up, and be was taken and committed for trial, but the bill was thrown out—when I saw him near my door, I do not know that any other persons were near, as ours is a corner house—I did not go round the corner to see.</p>

I believe I knew him from the first of the North Britons being published there. I bought of him every week since they were published there. I bought this there (holding one in his hand) the 21st of January, 1769. It is The Extraordinary North Briton, the date of it is January 21. I never bought any but of him. I have seen a person with him at the first beginning, he was called More. (The paper delivered in.) This is my hand-writing, being the time I bought it. The prisoner lived about two doors lower than Hatton Garden. (Part of it read in court.)</p>

               <p>William Bibins. I bought an Extraordinary North Briton of the prisoner at No. 55. in Holborn. There was no person in the shop besides him when I bought it. It was the day it was published, the 21st of Jan. last. (Produced in court.) It was No. 37. &amp;c. (Read in court, the same as the former.)</p>

            . I let part of a shop in Holborn to Mr. More.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any doubt in your mind that Mr. More was not free of the city?</p>
               <p>Sharp. I once asked Mr. Brayne if he thought Mr. More was free. He said he believed not, but he said, he himself was free, and as a servant he could sell. When Mr. More took the shop of me, he told me he should put in this person as a servant: he did it. I believe he ignorantly sold them all along. Mr. More is not a man of good character, he used to come sometimes in the evening. I believe he will never come any more.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Do you know the reason of Mr. More's keeping out of the way?</p>
               <p>Sharp. He was fearful of being arrested by Mr. Curtis. As for the prisoner, I think he knew nothing of the matter, he was hired by Mr. More at 14 s. a week. I do not think he was any ways concerned.</p>

               <p>Q. Whether you yourself have not heard him speak of this particular North Briton?</p>
               <p>Sharp. Yes, I believe I have. He said, I believe the day of publication of it, he did not see that it was a dangerous one; he hoped there was no danger in doing it. He did it ignorantly, I am very sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Can he write or read?</p>
               <p>Sharp. I believe he can.</p>

            . I am a mercer in New Bond-street; I have known the prisoner near twenty years; he is a very harmless quiet man. I do not think he would be guilty of publishing a libel against Lord Mansfield, if he knew it. When he engaged himself to Mr. More, he was in great distress; he must have starved, if I and a relation had not relieved him. He has been guilty of some little indiscretions in relation to women, and his friends have turned their backs upon him. He engaged in this to keep himself from starving.</p>

Mr. More told me the prisoner's wages were 14 s a week. Mr. More came to me and asked me if I was free of the city. I said I was not. He said he wished I was, for his man (that was the prisoner) and he had quarrelled. The North Briton is published still very constantly. I have seen Mr. More write them. I have fetched them from the press for him, and have fetched paper for the printing them from the stationers.</p>

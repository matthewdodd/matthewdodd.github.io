             and John Rawlinson, Jun. instructions to deliver the property on board that ship- they accounted to me for having delivered it. There was a trunk from Payne's among it. I gave them directions to make great haste, and forward the property to the ship. They left London about one o'clock on the day of the 5th of December. I furnished them with a sail. They ought to have arrived at Gravesend before day-light the next morning. I expected them to return about nine o'clock on Sunday morning - They did not return till Sunday night. When property is delivered to a vessel going abroad, a receipt is given by the master of the ship - They returned me the receipt. In consequence of what was then written I asked them how the goods happened to get wet? (having heard they were wet)- they said it was with rain and the sprey of the water.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I succeded their father in the basiness. I sent them to Galley Quay, which is in the city-from there they get into the middle of the shipping in the lower parts of the Pool, which is very public.</p>
               <p>Q. Very soon after that they get into the counties of Essex and Kent - A. Yes, at Limehouse-hole.</p>
               <p>Q. If they had made haste, would they not have got to Gravesend at night - A. It was not probable that they would have reached there till night, or early in the morning. If they were delayed by rain, I should not think much of their being two or three hours later. I heard it was a windy and rainy night- I do not know it myself. They would have no occasion to leave the boat. They have a very good character. The other prisoner is their first-cousin. They have been a year and a half in my empty.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far is it from Galley Quay to the Pool - A.About a mile and a half. When they passed the Pool it must have been day-light.</p>

It appeared to have been unpacked and emptied-the paper that it appears to have been wrapped in laid by it. This was on Sunday, the 7th of December, about two o'clock. There was a vacancy in the trunk, beside where the box was, as if other goods had been taken out-the handkerchiefs lost might safely be packed in that place. The box was carefully repacked, and given to Mr. Pope.</p>

            , at Limehouse. I was standing on the wharf, they came ashore to me - I do not know what boat they came from. We went into the Horns and Chequers, public-house, kept by Mr. Backway, and drank together. They said they were going to Blackwall, and expected to have something for me when they came back - They went away immediately- they both drank with me. About nine o'clock the same night they came to my house, which is in Middlesex, and went up to my bed-room- my wife was at home. They said they had some silk handkerchiefs and some lace; they took them out, and laid them on the bed- they had them about their persons, under their great-coats. I asked them what they wanted for them? they said they were worth a great deal of money- there were about forty pieces of handkerchiefs, each containing three. There might be nine in a piece for what I know - I never counted them-some looked larger than others; they refused to settle about them till they saw something else. On Sunday, about one o'clock, the three male prisoners came while I was at dinner - They dined with me. My wife and son, who is about fifteen years old, were at home. I sent my son for a pot of beer, and then sent him to church. After dinner, we all four went up stairs, and agreed about them. They said they were worth 100l. - I said I would give no such money for them, as they were all very common. I at last offered 45l. for them, which they agreed to take. I said I would give them some money as soon as I could. They staid about an hour with me. They said they came from Gravesend. After they went away, I went to Backway's public-house to see the newspaper, and saw them there. I had half a pint of beer before I saw them - I put it into the pot out of which they were drinking. Mrs. Backway served us.</p>
               <p>Q. Before they left you was any appointment made - A. Yes, at the house I told them I would meet them in the Borough on Monday, about two o'clock. I did not meet them, because the eldest came to me on the Monday morning, and told me there was something the matter, and not to meet them, and that if I had any thing in the house, I had better put it away- I put the things that I had bought of them out of the house. I took a piece of silk handkerchiefs to the prisoner, Griffiths, she lives at Limehouse. I told her I had some, that I wished to turn them into money, and that she should have them at 2s. 6d. a piece. I gave the prisoner, Cox, two cards of lace. I told her on the Sunday night I had some lace and handkerchiefs, and she might have some, if she could do anything with them. On the Monday, at tea-time, she came, had two cards, and a few yards of another piece, for which she paid me 9s. - my wife cut it off. I do not think any price was settled for the two cards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I am now come from prison. I was examined three times before. I said nothing about these men. I never was in this Court before, nor was I apprehended for felony before.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the prisoners come to you on the Friday - A. Between two and three o'clock- I believe it was after two. They said they were going to Blackwall. When they came at nine o'clock it was dark, and they brought the property- I am no judge of it. This was on Friday night. My wife might have been in the bed-room part of the time with us- nothing was pulled out down stairs. On Sunday all three dined with me - I dine at one o'clock. I saw them at the public-house at three.</p>

On the Sunday his father sent him to church; he came in again, and went out; it was then about half-past two.

               <p>Q. How were you able to see the length of the lace - A.

             at Barclare's-buildings, near the East India Docks-it was a butcher's-shop, and her husband is a butcher. There was a parcel of silk handkerchiefs lying on the counter, in her bonnet, and in a work-bag which hung by the fire-place I found two lengths of lace. She said she would tell from whom she got them when she got to the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I took M'Gillivray on the 10th of December, at Mr. White's, in Lisle-street, Little Newport-street - I had been looking for him for two days. I found him out by information which the prisoner, Griffiths, gave me. Part of Bow Creek is in Middlesex, and part in Essex. It is above two miles from Limehouse.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH POWIS. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner, Cox, at her house, on the 9th of December. When we went in she was placing a small paper parcel in the crown of her bonnet, containing three silk handkerchiefs. I asked her where she got them? she said she would tell the magistrate. She told the magistrate she had them from M'Gillivray. She said she knew they were British.</p>
               <p>JOHN GATTY. I am a Thames Police officer. I assisted in apprehending Griffiths. When she got to the office I told her I must search her - She said I should, after she had taken her money out. She was fumbling a long while. I heard paper rustle, and put my hand to her pocket, but found nothing. I desired her to get up off the chest on which she sat- I found three silk handkerchiefs in a paper. She at first said they were not her's, and afterwards that she had received them from M'Gillivray. I received some lace from James Hoggart. The whole of Limehouse is in Middlesex.</p>
               <p>JAMES HOGGART. I keep a public-house at Limehouse. M'Gillivray gave me the lace, which I gave to Gatty.</p>

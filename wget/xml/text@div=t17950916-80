On the 27th of July, near twelve o'clock, the prisoner at the bar came to my shop, she brought the gown to pledge, I stopped her with the gown, and I took from her the things that are produced; she told me she came out of the country, and had no friends; I took her to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver there the things that you took on her? - Yes; she had a box with her, and a great many things in it; I stopped her and the box, and sent for an officer, I found that the gown was not her size; I told her she had better go to her friends in the country, and I should stop her till I found who they were.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Prussian, and have been in England between six and seven weeks; I have been living at Southampton. I came in the Origa steamer from New York—on 29th April, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, I was on London Bridge, and saw a Scotchman with a cap on, who asked me the way to a street—I told him I was quite a stranger, and that I had my things at the Nine Elms railway station, and wanted to go there—he said, "My road is the same"—I crossed the road to go, and he went with me—he talked Scotch—when we were near a beer house, he said, "We will go in here"—I had no change, and therefore said, "I am a tee<lb></lb>totaler"—he said, "Never mind, we will drink sober stuff"—we went in, and I stood at the bar, and called for a bottle of lemonade—he called for a glass of porter—the prisoner was in the bar, and he said to the Scotch<lb></lb>man, "Walk in, Mr. Murray"—the Scotchman said, "We will go and sit at the table in the small room," the door of which was open—the prisoner served us—I and the Scotchman were alone in the room, but before I began to drink, two men, one with a big red face, and a little one, came in—the first one sat beside me, and the little one in front—the prisoner brought them in two glasses of porter—I had my small change in this bag (<hi rend="italic">round his wait, inside his trowsers</hi>)—I opened it to take out a half sovereign, and when I pot my finger in the landlord left the room, and shut the door after him, and in a moment the big Scotchman had me by the throat—I began to halloo, he pulled my <hi rend="italic">suspenders</hi> all down—they could not get the bag away, but there was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it, which they shook out—the others ran, and the Scotchman kept me while they ran, and when he let me loose he ran out, and I after him—I called "Murder!" pretty loud, as loud as I could, so that anybody could hear in another room, but nobody came—I was hallooing when they got the money—I hallooed three times—that was all I could do—I did my best to halloo while the man was holding me by the throat, but I kept finding myself still less able to do so—when I ran out after the Scotch<lb></lb>man, the prisoner came and catched me by the threat, and I gave him one here (<hi rend="italic">striking his face</hi>), and said, "You d—rascal you keep a house like this"—my trowsers were down and open, but I could not help it—I said, "What do you want with me?"—he said, "Look, look, button your trow<lb></lb>sers"—he kept me a little, but I was only from five to eight minutes in his house altogether—I said, "You have robbers in your house; I have been robbed of my money"—I then ran after the Scotchman, and caught him by the neck, about three houses off; but he turned me back—there were then 100 people by—I ran after him, but he escaped—I did not notice whether the prisoner remained in the house when he let go of me—I went to the police station, and asked for a few policemen—I have not seen my 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. since.</p>

               <p>said, "You are one of the robbers"—I caught the Scotchman, and tried to hold him, but he got off—I did not know any of the parties—I never was in London before—I had a few dry goods on sale at Southampton—I was two weeks selling them—my family are in America, and I want to see what I can make here—I have brought some of the goods from Southampton here—I brought the money from America—the beer was not ordered of a female, the prisoner's wife—I only saw him; I did not see a lady with a child in the bar—the prisoner shut the door when he came into the room, and it was shut when I wanted to pay, and then he went out and shut the door after him.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, L</hi> 108). On 29th April, I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's house, in the Waterloo Road—it is opposite Whitecross Street, near the Elephant and Castle—I asked the prisoner if he knew what had occurred; he said that he had heard a scuffling while he was in the cellar, and that he saw the two scuffling together; that he caught hold of Mr. Nelson, and the Scotchman escaped; and that he said, "Mr. Nelson, do up your trowsers, or you will lose them"—I asked him if he knew the persons; he said, "No," at first, and then he said he thought he had seen one of them before—he said that he would give me a description of them, but he has never done so—he said that his wife could give a de<lb></lb>scription of them—I went to her, but she could not—I found five sovereigns and some silver on him—when the prosecutor came to the station his trowsers were not quite done up.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, L</hi> 23). I was present at the station when the charge was entered against the prisoner—I heard him say that if the constable went to his wife she would be able to give him some description, and I went with the constable—about a quarter of an hour after that he said, "Cannot I have bail?"—I said, "No"—he said, "If I could get out I would give him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and that if he saw his wife, she would go to the brewer's and get 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him if he could give any information—he said, "No," but that if he was out he thought he could find one of them.</p>

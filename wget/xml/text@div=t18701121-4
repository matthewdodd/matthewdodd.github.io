                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live at Torquay—on 3rd November I was staying at the Waverley Hotel—about 4 o'clock, on the afternoon of the 3rd I was standing near the Mansion House, in the crowd, and just as Prince Alfred was going to enter his carriage, I looked down and saw the ring of my watch hanging to the guard, and my watch in the pri<lb></lb>soner's hand—he was in the act of passing it back in this way, and I seized his hand; but the watch was taken by someone—I called a constable, and gave the prisoner in charge—on the way to the station he asked me not to prosecute, on account of his wife and children, and he said he would give me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., all the money he had in his pocket, if I did not prosecute.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was looking after Prince Alfred—I had never seen him before—there was not a very large crowd there, for London—I caught the hand that was nearest to me, and then I caught the man; the same man that had ray watch—I had been out since 8 o'clock—it was a foggy day; it was not dusky.</p>

I was on duty at the Mansion House on 3rd November—I saw the prosecutor in the crowd—he called out suddenly that he had lost his watch, and he had hold of the pri<lb></lb>soner—I took the prisoner into custody—the prosecutor said he had seen the prisoner pass the watch to another man—I conveyed the prisoner down Walbrook, and he begged the prosecutor to let him go, and said be would give him all the money he had—at the corner of College Hill he commenced an attack on me, placed his legs between mine, and endeavoured to trip me up; failing in that, he endeavoured to force me backwards, and clutched me by the hair—I called to the crowd to assist me, and two or three did assist me—I forced the prisoner into a shop at the corner of College Hill, and took him to the station, after the arrival of another constable.</p>

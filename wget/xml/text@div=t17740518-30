            . On the 16th of March I met the prisoner at large in Wapping; he spoke to me first, I said, What, is it Thompson! he said yes; upon which I having an intimation that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177405180018"></xptr> had been seen at large and people being on the look out for him, I charged him with having returned from transportation, and had him secured.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Your Lordship will be pleased to understand I was bred to the sea from my infancy; I have no other dependence for my livelihood, but by going to sea; as to what the keeper of the Borough Compter has said I will in no wife deny that in one respect, but on the other hand when your Lordship considers how the case has turned out with me since that time, I hope you will be pleased to see it in a favourable light. On the 22d of July last I went out of London on board the transport ship; I was next morning before sunrise turned out of my consinement and ordered to do my duty on deck as the rest of the ship's company; I did so till I got to Virginia, there I shipped myself on board a vessel which belonged to that part of the world going to Piscataqua in New England; I shipped myself as a man on board that ship. When we got to Piscataqua we took a cargo of fish on board, and went from there to Lisbon in Portugal, and according to our articles of agreement with the captain, we should have returned back to Piscataqua without touching at any other port; but about a fortnight after our arrival in Lisbon, a schooner arrived which belonged to our owners in New England, with letters to countermand the voyage, directing the captain that he should proceed and take in freight for London; when I came to understand that the brig was bound to London I objected against proceeding on the voyage, not thinking it proper to let them know the real reason why I objected to it, because I was a native of the place where the captain and all the people lived, and it would have deprived me of my livelihood if it had been known that I had been transported from this country; I demanded my discharge from time to time of the captain; he said he could not do it seeing it would wholly distress the vessel if he discharged me there, he must get a man in my room, that he was not willing to discharge me. Knowing that the English Consul then residing in Portugal would have insisted upon my discharge, I went on shore and applied to him; he told me I must go on board the vessel, for he could not pretend to discharge me, or else I must go to gaol; I thought it hard to go to gaol in a foreign country, having no friends there; I thought I would go on board the vessel and endeavour to get my things out of her and go on shore; the captain came on shore towards evening; he said if you will do your duty as usual on board the vessel, and stick by her till we are ready to fail, I will discharge you; this encouraged me a great deal, and I willingly staid in the vessel. I had been to work upon the sails and mended them; I overhauled the rigging, and helped to take in the cargo; the vessel was by and by loaded, and I repeated again the demand of my discharge to the captain according to his promise; he told me to get my things on deck: there was a shore boat along side; he said I should go on shore in it if I would help him to get down the fails; I staid on board, not thinking proper to disoblige the captain, for fear he should not be willing to give me my wages; I had twice as much wages as I could get out of any port in Great Britain; I had three pounds sterling per month; I could not get so much by coming here, nor had I any one friend here to induce me to come; I staid on board, helped to unmoor the ship, and get her under sail, and went down along with him till we got below Bellisle Castle; when I got there, I said to Capt. Brown my things are on deck, I beg you will be as good as your word and pay me, and let me go on shore, seeing it is so disagreeble to me to go London; he said you attempted to distress me before, now I have put it out of your power, you must go to London: this was the reason why I came to London. I could have no inducement in life to come to London, seeing I am an entire stranger to it, my wife and family being in America, and seeing I could have twice as much money in America for my labour as in London; I could have no reason to induce me to come to it; I hope your Lordship and the jury will take these my unhappy circumstances into consideration, and as to this gentleman of the Borough Compter, who has sworn against me, I believe for the time I was in his custody last year I dare say he can give me no other than the character of a well behaved man.</p>
               <p>Court. Where is the ship now you came home in?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was taken on Thursday; I lost my chest, my clothes, my wages, and every thing. She sailed the Saturday following; I could get no person to go from Clerkenwell Bridewell, where I was committed, to go on board; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177405180019"></xptr> had no money in my pocket, and could get nobody to go of an errand for me. Seeing I was in such danger of my life and liberty, I thought it most prudent in me to keep still on board the vessel, and have as little acquaintance on shore as needs must; I knew my life and liberty were in danger; I thought no harm in speaking to that man; as for what he has said, I wish for his own sake it was the truth. I had no acquaintance with any people in London; had I known my case would have turned out so dangerous, I would have got acquaintance with people that should have appeared for me; I thought there would be no danger as I kept myself on board the vessel; I committed no error to any man.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hale. How got you the first intelligence of this man?</p>
               <p>Hale. A person came to the office, and informed us there that he was returned from transportation; he had been on shore a good while; I believe I saw him two months before that, but did not know then that he was returned from transportation.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him then?</p>
               <p>Hale. At the sign of the ship in Cable-street I believe, by Salt Petre Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what ship he belonged to?</p>
               <p>Hale. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was carried before Justice Sherwood, did he give any account of what ship he belonged to?</p>
               <p>Hale. He told the Justice he need not swear that gentleman for he was returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Justice ask him no questions?</p>
               <p>Hale. The Justice asked him how he came to return; he said he got ten guineas, and ten gallons for the run home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what ship he came home in?</p>
               <p>Hale. He did not mention any ship as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell the same story he has done now?</p>
               <p>Hale. Not a word of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he complain then of having endeavoured to get on shore at Lisbon, and that the captain brought him here against his will?</p>
               <p>Hale. He did not say a word at all of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was hurried away.</p>
               <p>Hale. No, he was there the whole day; here is a man in Court that told me he had drank with him several times in the two months.</p>
               <p>Court. Call that man.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Have you seen him since he came home?</p>
               <p>Chater. Yes; I have drank with him at the Poultry, in Grocer's alley.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Chater. About February: I met him once afterwards in Smithfield about a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any account of himself?</p>
               <p>Chater. He said thank God I have got over my misfortunes very well, and I have had a good voyage; he said he was going to look for another captain to go another voyage as soon as possibly he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know at the time he had been ordered to be transported?</p>
               <p>Chater. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not tell you particularly how he came home, or in what ship?</p>
               <p>Chater. No; he only said he had had a good voyage; I said I was glad to hear it.</p>
               <p>Beavis. He behaved exceeding well when he was in my custody.</p>

On the 31st of May, about a quarter-past seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner opposite Rose-street, Newgate-market—he was going along with the carcasses of two lambs on his back—I am positive it was him—he went towards the Post-office—I made some inquiries, and directed an officer to follow him—I afterwards went myself after him, and found him standing opposite a public-house in Whitechapel—I saw on him the marks of white grease, having the appearance of the white dressings of lamb or veal—I inquired where he had been the whole morning—he said he had been about there—I said, "How is it I saw you in Newgate-street with two lambs on your back?"—he said, "I have not been there a length of time"—I took him into custody.</p>

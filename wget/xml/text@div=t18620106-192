                  </hi>. I am a builder, carrying on business at 34, Wind-mill-street, Tottenham Court-road—on 16th December I was in High-street, St. Giles', a little after 2 in the afternoon—I had just passed St. Giles' church to go to Long-acre—when I had passed the extreme boundary of the church ground, twenty or thirty yards, I heard a great noise, which I thought was a fire-engine—I looked up and I saw the prisoner and a lad in front of a wood cart—the horse was galloping at a faster rate than I ever saw in London streets in my life—they were in the cart—the boy was driving, and the prisoner was whipping the horse as fast and as hard as he could do it, from the time I first saw him till the accident occurred—I turned round when the horse and cart passed me, for I thought there would be an accident—looking ahead, I saw an elderly woman on the other side of the way, on the edge of the kerb-stone—she seemed to look to see if the coast was clear; but in a moment I saw her crossing, and I saw her knocked down; but whether by the shaft or the horse I cannot say; and I saw the near side wheel go over the body—I ran back to see that the driver did not escape; and when I got up by the church-gates, the horse and cart was stopped, and the driver was among the people—a lot of people were round</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman in the service of Mr. Jenkins, of St. George's-row, Walworth—I was driving in my master's cart when this accident occurred—I did not see anything of it, but I saw the wood-cart just before it occurred—in my judgment, the speed at which it was going would not exceed six miles an hour—I saw the cart stop—I do not know who stopped it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see the driver? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; not till I saw him at Bow-street—there was no one on the cart when it passed me—I was in a covered van.</p>

ROSEWELL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say the prisoner was beating the horse very much, what with? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> An ordinary carman's whip; he had the whip and the boy the reins—that was all the time he was coming from the turning of Broad-street—he was whipping even after he passed me, until the woman was knocked down—after she was knocked down he had got so far on that I could not see whether he was whipping or not—he and the boy were both on the cart—I saw them both in the front—the boy was holding the reins and the prisoner the whip—he was not on the top of the load of wood; the wood was high up—he was in front, not on the shaft—I thought there might be a fender, or something, in front—perhaps he might have been on the shaft.</p>

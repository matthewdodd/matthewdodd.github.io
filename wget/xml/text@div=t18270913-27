            . I am in the employ of Mr. Lowther, pawnbroker, of Tottenham-court-road. On the 6th of September, between eleven and one o'clock in the morning, the witness Stephens brought this watch to pawn; I detained her; she produced the prisoner as the person of whom she received it - I shewed him the watch, and he said, it was his own, and he had sent her to pawn it for him; I sent for an officer and gave him in charge, haring received information of the robbery.</p>

I was fetched to Lowther's, and took the prisoner in charge - I asked how he came by the watch, which was without a case - I did not hold out either threat or promise to him; he said it was his own that he bought it at Birmingham when he was on the tramp - I took him to the office; I have had it ever since - the prosecutor had the case of it, and described it before he saw it, as having a scratch on the face.

            . This is my watch; I know it by a scratch on the face: it is a Liverpool watch; the ribbon was sewn up as it is now, and the same key - I had the case in pawn at the time, but I have it here now - I am sure it was safe when I was knocked down.</p>

            . It is false.</p>

               <p>- RAMSDALL. I am the prisoner's brother. I can prove Stephens' name is not Stephens - she cohabits with a person of that name, but was married to one Lowton, ten or twelve years ago, and if she takes a false oath in that, she will swear false in any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she not gone by the name of Stephens as long as you knew her? A. Yes - I have been from home for a year or two, till within the last two months, but my brother bore a good character while I knew him.</p>

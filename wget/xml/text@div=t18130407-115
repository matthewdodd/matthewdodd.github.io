About nine o'clock at night I went with my mistress to a party in Brunswick-square. I was ordered to fetch her at four o'clock in the morning, and to take two coaches with me. I came back before ten o'clock, and just before eleven I went out. I thought if I went to bed I should not get up at the time. I went to the public-house the corner of <placeName id="t18130407-115-crimeloc601">Bennet-street</placeName>

             took the pot and drank out of it. After that, another young man paid for another pint. In about a quarter of an hour the lamp was put out, and then the candle on the other side of the room. They were the only lights in the room. I then felt four or six hands about my mouth and my pocket, as if to keep me from making a noise, and in an instant I felt the watch go from my fob. I called out to the landlord, whose name is Lancaster, not to let them out. The door was open, and they all went out, as far as I know. The landlord was at the door. I went out, and my hat was left in the room by some means of other. I called for my hat. The landlord went into the taproom; he throwed my hat out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your watch again - A. I did. I went as far as the corner of Goudge-street, there a person of genteel appearance asked me what was the matter. He asked me if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070075"></xptr>would come to Marlborough-street in the morning, and get a warrant, and he would put the warrant into execution. I went further; I met another man; he said, have you lost a watch. I said I had. He said, if I would meet him at the corner of Blenheim-street by seven o'clock in the morning, and a little further on I met Jones. He said, if I would come at seven o'clock in the morning I should have the watch. In the morning I went and met the man at the corner of Blenheim-street; he asked me for a guinea; I gave him a pound note and a shilling. He gave me the watch, but not the seal. He said somebody else was concerned in it; he had the seal. This is the watch; it is my master's watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see George, Jones, or Weaver, have your watch - A. No; they were in the room at the time I lost the watch, and Jones put out the lights.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were there in the room - A. Fourteen or sixteen persons.</p>

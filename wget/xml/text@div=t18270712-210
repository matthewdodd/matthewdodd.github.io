            . I am the daughter of the Rev. Thomas Newcome, who lives in Hertfordshire. The prisoner came into his service in December; she was going to leave on the 5th of July - I missed property, and on examining her box, I found a piece of lace and a shawl of mine; she said she had bought them in the neighbourhood; she left, and I missed the articles stated in the indictment.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner last Thursday at her lodging, at No. 17, Market-street, Shadwell - I was told she was not within; it was her who answered me - I called in Miss Newcome, who knew her, and I took her; she was washing, and had this net wet in her hands; I found all this property there, except the box.</p>
               <p>MISS NEWCOME. None of the property in the indictment is found, except the net; these other things are of no value - we give them away to poor people.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I once found Mr. Newcome's purse, with eighty or a hundred sovereigns in it, and took it to him - these things are of no value - they were in my box when I left her house.</p>
               <p>THE REV. THOMAS NEWCOME. I have no recollection of her bringing me a purse with any money in, but it is not impossible; but I think there could not be so much in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Laidley, of Windmill-street. The prisoner was in my service for three weeks—she came to me at the bar on Good Friday morning, and said she was going to leave—I said she had better do so if she could not conduct herself in a proper manner—I went up stairs soon after, and in passing her bed-room door I saw a bag of mine on her table—I brought it down, and she came and asked me for it—I said it was mine—she said I had given it to her—she was very abusive, and my husband called a policeman—I went up with him, and found a variety of things of mine in her box—this is my bag—some of these arti<lb></lb>cles were in it, and some in her box—they are all mine—since she has left I have found things concealed almost every day.</p>

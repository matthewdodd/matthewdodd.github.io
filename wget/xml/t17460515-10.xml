               <p>Burgess. I was sent for by Mrs. Barrs; I am Beadle; she said there was a Difference between a Maid Servant and her over Night, and that in the mean time she miss'd a Pair of Diamond Ear-Rings; but she would not charge her 'till she had made a diligent Search for them. I said to the Maid, if you know any thing of them tell your Mistress, to put her out of her Fears; but there was a Gentleman in the House, one Mr. Russel, who insisted to know were she lodg'd that Night; so she said she was to pay Three-pence and sit up all Night: Her Mistress ask'd her how she came by that Three-pence, as she had no Money when she went away; she then said she had pawn'd her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174605150016"></xptr> checqu'd Apron for 18 d. at such a Pawmbroker's; then we went to enquire where she said she had been over Night; and by what I heard of her Character I thought it was sufficient to go back again and make an Enquiry: At first she stifly deny'd it, but afterwards came to a Confession; she confess'd she had them, and deliver'd them to me, and I deliver'd them to Sir

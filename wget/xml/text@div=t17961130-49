             sworn. - On Friday evening, the 28th of October, the prisoner stole a side of bacon from my door, I saw him pass the window; I was behind the counter, I saw him carry the bacon by; I desired the man to go out, that there was a side of bacon gone from the door, he pursued him about six doors, I followed; he laid hold of the bacon, and I pursued the man through several courts into Cursitor-street, I cried "stop thief," and Walker, the witness, secured him before I came up to him; he was sent to the watch-house, and then conveyed to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. You never lost light of him? - A. I did, once, about a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the man you saw with the bacon, was the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p> - WALKER sworn. - On Friday, the 28th of October, I was coming up Cursitor-street, about five o'clock in the evening, the prisoner rushed out of the court by the stone-mason's; as soon as I saw the prisoner come out of the court, I saw the prosecutor crying stop thief; I pursued the prisoner, he took Craven-head-court and got into White's-alley; when he got to the top of the alley, he turned round and struck me a blow under the right-ear; I then knocked him down, and kneeled on him till the prosecutor came up; he said, he had stole a stitch of bacon; he made a strong resistance, we could hardly take him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going up Fetter-lane, there was a cry of stop thief, I ran as well as other people, and when I came near Chancery-lane, they stopped me.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had he been your journeyman - A. He came in my employ in November last, and worked with me until this affair happened.</p>
               <p>Q. When you retired from your room from work, you lived in Water-lane - A. Yes, at No. 2.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your habit and your directions to him always to lock the door of the room - A. It was the general order.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you considerable property there, diamonds and other things to a great value - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the day on which you missed this property - A. On Saturday the 1st of June.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did you retire from your room to go to dinner - A. A little after one; I left Hodgetts and the apprentice in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you pretty busy at that time - A. I was very busy, and chiefly in diamond work I was absent from my shop about fifteen minutes, when I returned I found my apprentice in the shop, I said, where is Hodgetts.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Hodgetts usual time to go to dinner - A. No particular time; Hodgetts was gone at that time, I sat down to work, I wanted a small file out of my bottom drawer, and I missed my diamond box out of that drawer. It was a small round box.</p>
               <p>Q. What diamonds were they of any value - A. The box was nearly of the size of a box for the impression of a seal, it contained about two carats.</p>
               <p>COURT. Small diamonds chiefly - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr Knapp. You do not know how many stones there were do you - A. No, I cannot say. I looked on the board for it, thinking it might lay on the work-board, it was not on the work-board, and I opened a larger box, in which there had been diamonds on the wax arranged for the setting of it; that was my work, the diamonds had been picked off.</p>
               <p>Q. How many carats do you think the diamonds removed from the wax might be - A. About one carat. These drawers were left open to me and my journeyman. The carat in the wax box cost eight pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the other - A. About fifteen pounds. I am quite sure that both were in the house when I left it. There were two other wax boxes from whence the diamonds were picked off; I had seen the diamonds in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what value were they - A. In one there were seven guineas worth, in the other about twelve pounds. There were a pair of transparent diamond drops set for the ears, in the two centers were two large stones, they were set ready for the wear; they were worth fifty pounds, they weighed five carats and a half, all fine brilliants; they were all safe in the morning, I saw them. There were two separate papers of diamond stones, unset for work, one paper contained two carats, they were on my board when I left the shop, one paper value eighteen pound, another paper worth eight pounds. On looking farther I missed three pearl rings, these I had seen in the morning, and a brilliant ring square; the pear rings are worth about four pounds, the brilliant ring worth about ten pound, the making and all. I believe that is the whole.</p>

               <p>COURT. All these had been safe before you went to dinner - A. Yes. Upon missing this I went to Hatton Garden, and left my apprentice in charge of the shop; I got a warrant to search the prisoner Hodgetts place; this was near two o'clock, he had told me that he lived over the water; I found out he lived in Fetter-lane, I went to Fetter-lane and did not find him, he had not been home all day. A Mr. Cooper and Wilkinson waited for him until he did come home, and they took him and brought him to the Royal Oak, Hatton Garden the same evening, between ten and eleven at night. I saw the prisoner the same night about eleven o'clock, at the Royal Oak, the officer sent for me. The officer searched him, but not in my presence, a gold chain was produced before me, two gold seals, thirty-seven pounds, and a sixteenth share of a lottery ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him at that time - A None at all. On the Monday afternoon following I had conversation with him, I was sent for by the prisoner, I went to the lock-up-place, Hatton Garden office; when I went in he cried bitterly; there was a long pause for about five minutes; I asked him what I had done that he should injure me in this manner; he said I had injured him; I said, in what manner? he replied I was too good to him; he then said, would I forgive him; I told him he was in the hands of justice, and not in my hands. He begged of me to go the magistrate to ask forgiveness, and he would let me know where my diamonds were, or who he had sold them to. The magistrate was sitting, I went to him and related what had past. The magistrate ordered him to be brought up, and told him he must make a voluntary confession without any expectation of advantage or disadvantage from it. He then said nothing, but was sent back. He sent for me again, I went back to him, he then said he would let me know where the diamonds were if I would not see him totally destitute in a prison.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose these notes and gold seal and chain had been taken from him - A. Yes. I told him he must trust to providence, I would do what I could.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100038"></xptr>Hutt was on one side, and brought in pen and ink. The prisoner Hodgetts wrote it down himself what he had sold, and told me that he had sold them to the prisoner Lawrence. I asked the prisoner Hodgetts what he had sold them for, he said fifty-four pounds; fifty pounds he had received, and four pounds he was to receive on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say on what day he had sold them - A. On the Saturday, between three and four o'clock, on the same day they were taken away.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he give you any note to shew you that they had been sold there - A. No, I took all this from his verbal declaration, he had written only the number of diamonds, and the direction of Lawrence, I think No. 16, Duke-street, Aldgate. When he said he was to have the four pounds, on the Monday following, the Saturday he said he was to have called on Monday, the 3d of June, to look at some watches, at Lawrence's. It was on the Monday evening he gave me this account. On the Monday morning I went with the officer to see where he bought these two gold seals, it was wrapped up with the name of the person that he bought it of. At Mr. Aughtie's in Cheapside, I went there; with respect to the pearl rings; we found out where Mrs. Stracey lived, I went with Hancock and found her at home; she took us to the pawnbrokers shops; Mr. Nicholls in the City-road, I found two pearl rings there, and at Mr. Crouch's in Fore-street, I found the third by her direction; I am quite sure they are my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Mrs. Stracey at your shop - 
               <persName id="t18110710-63-person620">A. </persName>
            She had called once at the street door, to go the play with the prisoner. On Tuesday morning the 4th, we went to Mr. Lawrence's, Hutt, the officer went in first. I went in and saw Mr. Lawrence in his shirt, it was about seven o'clock in the morning, in Duke-street, Aldgate.</p>
               <p>Q. What business was Mr. Lawrence carrying on - A. I could not see any business, there was a shop; I saw no business carried on in it, he was just out of bed, speaking to Hutt, Hutt told me to go about my business, he did not want me yet. Hancock came in and shut the street door, and locked it. Lawrence dressed himself and went up stairs with Hutt; I remained down stairs; I went up in a quarter of an hour afterwards. Hutt said to Lawrence, this is the person that lost the diamonds; Lawrence said he knew nothing about the young man; I told Mr. Lawrence where they young man had lived, where he became acquainted with him; Lawrence said he did not know him; he seemed very much agitated, and said he did not know what we where talking about, we communicated to Lawrence that I had lost diamonds; I went in the passage again, and left Lawrence with Hancock and Hutt; we took Lawrence to the office in the City.</p>
               <p>COURT. At this time had any property been produced or found in Lawrence's house - A. No, Lawrence was taken to the Poultry Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Then down to this time he persisted in not knowing any thing of Hodgetts, or any thing of the transaction of the diamonds - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Challener. Q. I believe you have a partner - A. I have none.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Mr. Cooper always reside in Gough-square - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say to Hodgetts it would be better for him to confess did you - A. No, I said I would leave it to the justice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Your shop is in the front garret - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is what is called the sky parlour; with respect to the prisoner Lawrence at the time that you and the officers went to his habitation, it was seven o'clock in the morning, you expressed a surprise at seeing no customers.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you customers calling upon you at seven o'clock in the morning - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. When you said there was no appearance of business, did you mean that were no appearance of customers, or that there were no appearance of goods - A. I saw no appearance of shop goods.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley A great quantity of jewellery goods might go into a snuff box - A. Yes</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you that you told

               <p>HUTT. He said he did not know whether I was his brother or not, he should not pay me any money, I said why not Mr. Lawrence, you have only given him fifty pounds why not pay him the four; he said no, he should not, he wanted to see my brother particularly. I said sir you may as well pay me, I will give you a receipt for the money. When I found he would not pay me the money, I said my brother was to have a watch of you I believe. He said directly, is there any thing the matter; he was standing in his shirt, he told me to come in the room; just at that moment Mr. Romer came into the passage from the door. Mr. Lawrence said to me, who is that; I said it is another of my brothers. The moment I said that he dropped all conversation, he denied any knowledge of buying any diamonds.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing about diamonds - 
               <persName id="t18110710-63-person633">A. </persName>
            I said you had a good bargain of the diamonds, you only gave him fifty pounds, why not pay the four pounds; he said he would not pay it; I told him my brother wanted the money, he was gone to Margate. When Mr. Romer made his appearance, he said he knew nothing of man or the diamonds. I told him then he was my prisoner. Then he asked me if I had got a search warrant; I told him I had traced a fifty pound note to a very near neighbour of his, that was passed for the diamonds. We took him then to the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. At the first examination he was permitted to go at large - A. I believe he was, some body passed their word for him. On the second examination he appeared pursuant and was afterward committed to take his trial.</p>

            Where there any expressions of threats used by you or your brother officer - A. I made use of none; I was a used by his friends they threatened to knock my head about, and said I would swear any man's life away for sixpence, here is one gentleman sitting here that said it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first day that he threatened to bring an action against you for coming into his house without a warrant - A Mr. Lawrence said he was an officer himself, that I had no business in his house at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you understand that he threatened to bring an action - A. It might be something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you make use of this expression, that you would serve him out - A. I never did to him, the man that they call the infant, he threatened me, I meaned an action.</p>
               <p>COURT. At the time you saw Lawrence, you told him he had purchased diamonds, he had made a good purchase, you only gave my brother fifty pounds, why do not you give me the other four pounds - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say that to him from any communication you had from the prisoner Hodgetts - A. Yes, this is what Hodgetts gave me; this paper is, and that is what I wrote down from Hodgetts description; forty-four double cut stones, one hundred and seventy-five various, some cut and some not, fifty-four pounds. Here is a discription of Lawrence's person. Long faced pock-marked, on the first floor; and the part that is written by Hodgetts, is Lawrence, 16, Duke's Place, Aldgate; all the rest is my writing from Hodgetts dictation.</p>

            . I am one of the officers of Hatton Garden office. Hodgetts was brought to me at the Royal Oak I searched, him I found thirty-seven pound in bank notes, one ten, one five, two two's, eighteen one's, two pound one shilling in silver, copper three shillings and five-pence, two gold seals, a gold chain and a sixteenth share of a lottery ticket bought at Mr. Bish's, Cornhill. He denied having robbed his master, he said that the money I found upon him was his own. I was with Hutt, on the apprehension of Lawrence. After that I went in search of a woman of the name of Stracey; I found her in Myrtle-street, Kingsland-road. I afterwards found three pearl rings, two in the City-road, and one at Mr. Crouch's, in Ford-street.</p>
               <p>MRS. STRACY. I live in Myrtle-street, Hoxton.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Hodgetts - A. I do, Mr. Hancock and Romer came to my house, I told them where to find the three pearl rings that Hodgetts gave me for a debt of two pounds that he owed me, Hodgetts desired me not to sell them, but to pawn them for two pounds. He came to me on the Saturday preceding that they came to me on the Monday. At Mr. Nicholson's, near Finsbury-square. I pledged two of them for one pound one shilling; I pledged the other at Mr. Crouch's for eight shillings. Hodgetts said that they were rings that he had done on his own account.</p>

             was called, and not appearing in court, his recognizance was ordered to be estreated.</p>
               <p>Hodgett's Defence. Mr. Romer said that I was in his employ at the time that the property was missed, that I deny; since last Christmas I have worked for him two or three times a week, and a week previous to the transaction he told me that I was very inconstant to my business, that I must look out for another situation; I told him my situation, that I was frequently with Mrs. Stracey, that she and I were upon taking a shop and I could not determine to say whether I could keep in his employ or not. I called on the Thursday, he told me his work was in an hurry. I set myself down, I did a trifle of work; I was not above one hour in the shop, he said, Hodgetts, I have removed my apartments to No. 2. Water-lane, Fleet-street, if you go out to dinner lock the door, and bring me the key; I left the shop and took the key. On the Saturday I went and had no intention to work; he asked me as a favour to sit down and mount a pair of small top ear-rings, he said he should have no money except they were done. I sat down and nearly completed them for him to take them in his hand, he left the shop, and a little while after he was absent from the shop I went down and never said a word to any person. The door of the house is continually open, and the stairs of the house are continually subject to persons going up and down. With respect to Mrs. Stracey's evidence, she said I, in consequence of owing her two pounds, I had given her these pearl rings to pledge for the money; that part of it I deny of owing her two pounds; I gave her a four pound note to buy me linen for shirts, she returned me one pound, she said she had bought the linen, and gave it to a person to make at Stepney Green; I went frequently for the shirts, she put me off, and with respect to Mr. Romer he has frequently given me orders to go out with diamond articles: I do not say that he gave me orders to take these diamonds out on commission, and I deny that ever I told him that I had taken these diamonds or that I ever said I had sold them to Mr. Lawrence.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. He said he had disposed of them to Mr. Lawrence.</p>
               <p>Lawrence left his defence to his counsel.</p>
               <p>Hodgetts called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Lawrence called eleven witnesses, who gave him a good character</p>

            . I am a watchman of Limehouse. I was crying twelve o'clock, and saw a crowd round the door - the boy was crying in the crowd; he said he had been robbed by Clark - I said, "Where is he?" he said,"He's in the house;" I called him out and said, "Are you playing your lark with this boy or not?" he made no answer, and I took him - neither of them were tipsy.</p>

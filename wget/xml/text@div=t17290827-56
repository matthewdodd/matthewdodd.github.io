             depos'd that he was a Felt-maker, having serv'd 7 Years to it; that he had wrought as a Journeyman to the Defendant from the 3d of September to the Beginning of January last, who mix'd and weigh'd him out the Wool; gave him Directions for making the Hats, and Sizes, &amp;c.

VI. and 16th of Hen. VII. and also in the 1st of Hen.

After a full Hearing of the Matter, the Jury found the Defendant <rs id="t17290827-56-verdict269" type="verdictDescription">

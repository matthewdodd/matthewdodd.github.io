             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a city Constable. On Friday the 12th of July last I was in Smithfield, between six and seven in the evening, I saw a horse get his leg entangled with a hackney coach, there were several boxes in the coach; I ordered the coach door to be shut, and the boxes were secured; after that was done I saw the prisoner at the bar pick this here young man's pocket of a silk handkerchief; I immediately seized the prisoner and tapped the young man on the shoulder; I am positive I saw it taken out of his pocket. The prosecutor did not pretend there was a hole in his pocket then. He swore to it by several marks. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is hard to swear to an handkerchief after it has been out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any handkerchief in your pocket besides your own? - It was not my own handkerchief; I had an handkerchief of this kind in my pocket of one William Sibley's; he is not here.</p>
               <p>Newman. That is the handkerchief the prisoner took from him, and he swore to it at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going from Clerkenwell-green to Newgate street; I stopped to see this horse in Smithfield, and this gentleman laid hold of me, and said that I picked that young man's pocket of an handkerchief, and I never touched the handkerchief in my whole life; I have got people to my character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses to his character.</p>

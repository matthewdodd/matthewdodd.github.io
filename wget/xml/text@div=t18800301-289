                  </hi>. I live at 45, Devonshire Road, Greenwich, and am a slate merchant at Ravenshorne Wharf, Greenwich—the name of our firm is Trenchard and Smith—the prisoner called on me about the 8th November and brought a specification of slates which he said he had to sell—I agreed to give him an order—he asked me to give him an advance of 25(5. oraccount of the cargo—I did not agree to that—I next received this letter—there is no date—it is addressed from Euston at 7.30, and states that the vessel will leave to<lb></lb>morrow—I next received this letter of 17th November with the invoice and the bill of lading—the letter states, "Enclosed I beg to hand you invoice, and enclose bill of lading of cargo of slates shipped for you. The 14in. by 12in. and the 14in. by 10in. could not be discharged, too many slates being on them"—this is the bill of lading, which was also enclosed; it is dated November 17th, and is signed by the master—there is also a specimen of the size and quality of the slates—the latter portion of the letter says that Mr. Anderson will call, and "Please hand bearer cheque; his receipt will be a sufficient discharge"—Mr. Anderson called on the 18th—as Mr. Trenchard, who signs the cheques, was not in, it was arranged that he should call the following day—he did call, and received this cheque for 396<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he brought this letter of 12th November stating, "Please pay bearer the value of the slates; his receipt will be a sufficient discharge to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188003010123"></xptr>
               <p>you"—it was in consequence of the bill of lading and those letters that I paid the cheque—I subsequently received these letters of the 21st, stating that the cargo was insured, and the 25th of November, stating that the vessel would start the next day—receiving no further intelligence, I wrote on 30th December—not receiving any reply, I went to Carnarvon and made inquiries—I found the ship was only partially loaded—I then took out a warrant and had the prisoner arrested.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did so without seeing the prisoner or making inquiries of him—I did not see any letter from him explaining that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of slates were actually on board—we have not yet received them—we have directed them to come to London, and expect to receive them.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Victoria Terrace, Criccieth, North Wales—I am master of the schooner Snowdon—on 17th November the prisoner agreed to take a cargo of slates to London—I signed an agreement—he said, "I want to have a copy of this, captain, signed by you"—I then signed what I believed to be a copy of the agreement, but which was really the bill of lading produced—no slates were then on board—the loading began on the 24th—the letter of 25th November stating the vessel would sail on the morrow is not true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I expected the slates to be loaded earlier—I have been captain six years in the Snowdon and 20 years at sea—I have not seen many charter-parties—I have never had more than three or four cargoes a year—I know that the bill of lading and the charter-party are different documents, but I did not know that I signed a different document—I did not see Mr. Owen Jones present when I signed it—some trucks were there ready to be loaded; I cannot say how many—I was told we must have a quick dispatch—I believed the ship would be loaded in a short time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I signed the document I did not know whether the slates came from the Coedmadog Quarry or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Worseley House, Liverpool—in July or August last I became acquainted with the prisoner—the result was that I purchased the Coedmadog Quarry from him; the prisoner was to be my manager, and he was to have half an interest—no salary was mentioned—I left the management of the quarry entirely to him-early in November last I was staying at Wood's Somerset Hotel, Drummond Street—I saw the prisoner there—he said he was loading up a vessel to Trenchard and Smith with slates, and he expected to complete the loading shortly—he appeared to be very anxious, and told me he had telegraphed to know if the loading was completed—he gave me this introduction to Trenchard and Smith (<hi rend="italic">The letter of</hi> 12<hi rend="italic">th November</hi>)—these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are signed by the prisoner—the one marked L states that the vessel was waiting the shipment of a few tons to complete invoice and bill of lading, and would be certain to be going off to<lb></lb>morrow, and in the one marked M the prisoner states "I am forwarding invoice and bill of lading to Messrs. Trenchard and Smith, of Greenwich; go there first thing in the morning"—in consequence of that I went on the 18th—I saw Mr. Smith—he told me he could not give me a cheque then—we arranged that I should call next day, and I called about 12 and received a cheque—I cashed it at the Deptford branch of the London and County Bank—I remitted 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the National Provincial Bank to the credit of the clerk of the Coedmadog Slate Quarries—I also paid 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for another cheque of the prisoner's, the money for which I received from my solicitor—the rest I retained,</p>

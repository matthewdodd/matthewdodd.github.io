On the 3d of June I received information, and found the lead was gone from the front of both houses - it had been fixed; I went round the brick-field with a person, and met Haggart, who gave me information; I found part of the lead in a ditch at the bottom of a garden. I received information, sent for an officer, and went in pursuit of five men; when I got to Bow common Lee, who lives on the common, sent for me into his house - he gave me information. I went over the bridge to Mile-end-road, and when I came within a hundred yards of Twig-folly-bridge I found two pieces of the lead, tied in a handkerchief, laying in a field, and one piece in a kind of apron; I gave it to Haggart, and went to Twig-folly-bridge, where some more lead was taken out of the water - I compared it with my house, and it fitted - it is worth 3l.; there was 184lbs. taken from one house, and 150lbs. from the other. I found the prisoner in custody the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MITCHELL. Q. Had you any mark on the lead? A. No, but it had been screwed to the house, and the screws soldered over; the holes corresponded.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. On Sunday morning, the 3d of June, I went with Grundy to Bow-common, to Mile-end, and then to Twig-folly-bridge - I saw the prisoner standing there, with a bundle on his shoulder - I knew him before; another man was with him, whom I do not know; the prisoner threw his bundle down between Mile-end and Twig-folly-bridge; he had a waistcoat on, with sleeves; they both ran away - I left Grundy and pursued; I lost sight of the bundle in following another man, but I left Grundy standing by it - when it was opened it contained lead, which I saw applied to the building, and it exactly fitted - I did not take the prisoner myself. The lead in that bundle weighed about 40lbs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was water near the place? A. Yes; he could have thrown it into the water if he had carried it further. I heard a fortnight after he was taken, that the parish had offered a reward; and I said "If so, I had as much right to part of it as any body." I cannot say that the bundle is the same that the prisoner threw away.</p>

            . I am a labourer to Mr. Grundy. I was with him and Cole, and saw the prisoner throw the bundle off his shoulder - I ran after him; another man in a fustian coat was with him; I saw a man throw another bundle into the water - he was running before the prisoner; the bundle contained 40lbs. or 50lbs. of lead. I saw it fitted to Grundy's house, it matched exactly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see it thrown away? A. Yes; but I could not identify it - the lead was fixed in front of the house; I have heard nothing about a reward.</p>

On the 16th of this month I lost two wooden bird cages, and five canary birds; it was on a Tuesday; I was moving my goods out of <placeName id="t17900224-25-crimeloc152">St. Giles's</placeName>

               <p>Did you find them by his directions? - No, not exactly; I found them at Mr. Sampson's, in a different street.</p>
               <p>How do you know these to be your cages? - In one of the cages I made an alteration myself; and they are very remarkable.</p>
               <p>Was there the same number of birds, at the time you found them, as when you lost them? - No, there is one not found yet.</p>
               <p>Do you believe those to be your canary birds? - I do.</p>
               <p>Now what are these cages? - One is a wainscot, the other is a mahogany, or rattan; both wooden.</p>
               <p>Did not you give him these cages to carry? - Yes, I did with the rest of the goods.</p>
               <p>- SAMPSON sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner came to me with a pair of birds, in a cage, and asked me seven shillings and sixpence for them; I told him I would give you six shillings, at a word; they are here; I would not pay him till I knew who he was; and he said if I would go over with him to a publick-house, he would shew me another cage, and a pair of birds, and so I gave him twelve shillings for the two cages, and two pair of birds; I am sure to the prisoner and that they are the same I bought of him.</p>

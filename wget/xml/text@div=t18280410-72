               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You deliver the materials to him to be made up? A. Yes, to be made into tuggs; he then brings them to my servant at my warehouse, to be marked, and then they are returned to him to finish.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from first to last it is always in a process of manufacture? A. It is; I myself do not know of the delivery of these particular pieces of leather - he is paid by the piece; by the set.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The leather and buckles are yours? A. Yes; nobody has a right to make use of them but me - they are delivered him to make up.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ; I saw these tuggs at the office, they had been made by Hart, he had either brought them home to me to mark, or I had fetched them; I marked them and returned them to him to have the belly-bands put on, and for no other purpose; after the bands were put on, it was his duty to bring them back to master.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you mark them? A. I marked those the pawnbroker had, the week before they were found, I returned them to him to put the bands on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is his job complete until the belly-bands and all are put on? A. No - they are always in the course of manufacture till the bands are put on; he could be paid for making the tuggs, and another man could put the bands on.</p>


               <p>Q. Would his work he finished till he had done it all? A. No, if he takes one part he must do it all; he sometimes brought things home, and sometimes I fetched them - the two in question were brought home by his wife, and I sent them back; I might be two hours marking them - the band could be put on before they are marked, but I always mark them first.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is always in his hands for the purpose of being worked? A. Certainly.</p>

               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Have not tuggs been often made without the belly-bands? A. Yes - if we had not wanted bands I should not return them; if master had desired me not to return them, I should not - they are sometimes kept without the bands.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the man paid at the end of the week before the work is finished? A. If he had work not finished, he would be paid, but he must finish it before he has more.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did your master give any particular orders about these? A. No - I marked them, and sent them back.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the tuggs are made they are brought to your master, or to you to be marked? A. Yes; that is one prosess - they are always sent back for belly-bands, unless I receive orders not to send them.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's brother, and am his foreman; when tuggs are brought home we sometimes keep them without belly-bands being put on them; when they do go back it is to have the bands put on; and it is his duty to bring them home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When they are left without the bands the work is imperfect? A. Yes; the understanding is, that the workman is to have it, and finish it when wanted - he is paid for it; these particular bands were expected to be made perfect, bands and all before they were brought home, to remain there; his duty was to complete them.</p>
               <p>Mr. ALLEY. Q. Does it at times happen that other workmen put the bands on, and not the one who made the tuggs? A. Sometimes.</p>

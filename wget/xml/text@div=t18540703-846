                  </hi>. I am an engineer, and live in Chancery-lane. On 13th May I was chief engineer on board the steamer <hi rend="italic">Karl Johann</hi>—we went down to see the launch of the <hi rend="italic">Royal Albert</hi>, at Woolwich—about 3 o'clock that afternoon there was a barge along side of us—the <hi rend="italic">Royal Albert</hi> had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185407030069"></xptr>
               <p>been launched—the barge had been about a minute alongside of us when an escape of steam took place from the engine—I was at that time very near the steam chest—that escape of steam was accidental—the steam was then just rising—I think there were persons standing close to the valve, but I cannot say—I was very near the valve; so near as to be wetted by the escape—all the people who were near got wetted—I got to the valve, knowing it was likely to stick—we had not put the complement of weights on it—I stopped it, and I had not been away half a minute when it rose again; I went and put a weight on it—the defendant was in the barge alongside of us, seven or eight yards from us, and I had just left the valve when I saw the defendant distinctly level a bottle at me, and I received a violent blow on my head—I have not the least doubt it was him that threw it—the top of my ear was cut and hung right over, and my head has a severe cut in it—I am suffering from it to the present day—I have been obliged to place myself under medical treatment—I could not attend to business for a fortnight—I did not cause the escape of this steam—is was from natural causes—when a steamer stands by long, there is an accumu<lb></lb>lation of water at the top of the valve, and when the steam rises it comes out.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this what is commonly called a safety valve? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; a safety valve passes to the escape pipe—there is nothing to cover the top of the escape pipe—I went to put down the valve with my hand—on raising the valve the steam would get into the escape pipe—there is a handle, and a piece of iron projects to close the pipe—it should have had weights on it, but it had but one—when I went to it the second time I hung on another weight—that was just prior to my receiving the blow—when I went to it the first time, I merely put my hand to it to put the valve down—there is a handle and a lever beside, which I should call a fixed lever—I touched the lever—I did not touch the other—the one that I did not touch is far raising the valve or pressing it down—I pressed it down, which would close it—it is a usual thing for the steam to escape when the steam is rising—there was only one weight on the valve instead of three—if we were moving or going to move, there ought to have been three weights—I had given instruction to get the steam up; it would have taken about a quarter of an hour to get it up—the weights would not have been put on till we were going to move—when I received the blow, I had just left the lever—the barge was near our stern, I do not think she touched the stem—she was near us—it was on the same side that the chest was that I was standing near—I was on the port side—the right—the other is the starboard side—I was on the right hand side of the steam chest, which extends to the stern of the vessel—it is round the funnel, but it is more toward the stern than the front—while I was touching the fixed lever, my back was partly towards the barge—I was struck on the right ear as I was leaving the lever—the people on the barge complained of being wetted—there were some ladies on board—I suppose there was a refreshment there—the steam, however, it escaped, wetted the people on board the barge, and us too—there must have been water collected in the escape pipe, and the steam rushing out would be turned into water, so that altogether there would be a considerable quan<lb></lb>tity of water thrown on the people—when the first escape took place, I went to the valve—the second escape was after I touched it—but it stopped immediately after I touched it—on the second escape little came out—I touched it twice, only to put it down—on its rising the second time, I touched it again, and put a weight on it, and then I was struck—I saw the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185407030070"></xptr>
               <p>defendant with a bottle in his hand, I think it was—it appeared to be a ginger beer bottle—I saw him raise his hand and throw it at me—I was struck immediately on leaving the valve—I think there were many persons near the defendant—I noticed him—I did not notice any one else—I did not hear the defendant say anything before I was struck.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whatever you did, was it for the purpose of stopping the escape of the steam? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was, and it was after my touching the valve the second time, after the second escape, that I was struck—I was at that time just leaving the valve—my back was not to the barge when I was struck—to open the valve, and allow an escape of the steam, it would have been necessary to get on the steam chest, and raise the valve up with my hands.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, and reside at Islington. I was on board the steamboat—I did not see the first escape of steam; I saw the second—I saw the effect of the first escape on the persons in the other boat—there were very few wetted on board our boat, because there were very few persons on board—the persons who were there were wetted, and it wetted the decks—I did not see Mr. Grafton go to the valve to stop it—I saw him at it, and he appeared to me to be endeavouring to close the valve—just as he left the valve, the bottle struck him, and cut the top of his ear, and he stooped and picked the bottle up—I did not see the bottle thrown; I saw the direction in which it came; it came from the direction of the barge—I saw the defendant on board the barge immediately after Mr. Grafton was struck, and the defendant instantly addressed me, and said he would give me another, or he would give me one too, holding another bottle of this descrip<lb></lb>tion in his hand—I had not the misfortune to receive another—an escape of steam is a matter which may accidentally take place—it always takes place when the steam rises to a certain pitch—this was quite an accidental escape—nothing took place to indicate that the escape was caused by premedi<lb></lb>tation of anybody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I knew the prisoner Pullen for three or four weeks previous to the 24th of December; he represented himself as a solicitor, and used my house at times, On the 24th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw him in my parlour, in company with the other two prisoners - I had not seen them come in; I was called into the parlour, and Pullen said in a friendly manner that he wanted a favour, that he had two gentlemen with him, who were clients of his, that he had just recovered them a large sum of money, and had that evening received a cheque in part payment, and I should do him a most essential favour to cash it for him, as it was then too late to go to the banking-house - I asked the amount; he showed me this cheque (looking at it) it is for 42l. 10s. - I said No, I never kept so much money in the house; he then asked if I could not accommodate him with part - this was in the hearing of the other two; he said for this reason, that those two gentlemen were his clients, and the one a country gentleman was going out of town next morning - the country gentleman was next to him, and within hearing; he said if I could accommodate him with part of it, it would be the means of serving him most essentially - I returned the cheque, and told him I could do no such thing; he introduced the others to me - he said Taylor had been a most extensive skin-merchant in the City, and Sharp was a highly respectable country gentleman; I left the parlour - Pullen followed me to the bar door; the others were not then within hearing - he requested me as a friend knowing his (Pullen's) family to be highly respectable, to let him have as much as I possibly could afford, as it would make him look respectable in the eyes of his clients; I told him I had no money in the house, except what I had taken that afternoon, and should consult my wife, which I did, and agreed to let him have 3l. - he said it would make him look rather mean and low, as he was just commencing for himself, if he had not a little money about him, after recovering so large an amount; I went to him at the bar door, and told him I would bring him what I could afford; I asked him to endorse the cheque there, which he did - I went to the parlour with him; the two others were sitting there - I counted 3l. in silver into his hands, principally in half-crowns; they all three sat in an angle, and all leaned their heads over the table - Sharp sat in the corner; they had a conversation in a low tone among themselves - I then noticed Pullen's hands under the table, and heard silver money rattling; he remained there better than two hours; they came to the bar between nine and ten o'clock, and had a bottle of wine there, and afterwards another - Sharp then praised the quality of the wine, and asked if I had a stock, as it was in his power to recommend me several good customers - I proposed to show him the stock; he accompanied me into the cellar with one of the others, and seemed quite astonished at the stock - he said he would certainly recommend me some friends, who would perhaps take twenty or thirty dozen: we returned up stairs - I then stood a bottle of wine; after that was drank they each had a glass of brandy, and so much approved of the quality, they said they would have some to take home with them; Pullen had a pint of brandy, and he had pint of whiskey to treat the country gentleman before he went out of town in the morning - Taylor had a quart of rum, a quart of brandy, and I think, a quart of whiskey - I then asked who was to pay for what Taylor had, he being a stranger to me; I considered Pullen responsible for Sharp - Taylor seemed indignant, and said,"You have got plenty in your power to pay yourself," and referred to Pullen, who said when I received the cash for the cheque, I was to pay myself for whatever they had, and return him the balance; Pullen said his money was gone, for he could not pay for the bottle of wine - Sharp paid for his bottle of wine; they were then about to part - Sharp carried Pullen's bottles for him, as he had a top coat, and large pockets - Pullen told me to let the country gentleman and the skin-merchant (as he called them, he never mentioned their names,) have whatever they pleased; I was to be paid out of the cheque - they left about one o'clock at night; Christmas-day was on Friday - I saw Pullen at my house about two in the afternoon; another person was with him, but neither of the prisoners - Pullen said his money was gone, and I must oblige him with more; I let him have 2l. more - he left, and I received this written order; in consequence of which I sent my son with half a dozen of wine to Compton-street, Goswell-street, to see if it was correct, as I did not know the man who brought it - I made that man sign the order, and had a conversation with him respecting Taylor; Pullen was in the parlour at eight o'clock when my son returned, and while I was chiding my son for stopping so long, Taylor and his man came - Taylor was angry at my doubting his respectability, and asked why I should take his man to task in the manner I did, and if I had any doubt about him, to send my bill next morning and it should be discharged; that he had come on purpose to give me another order, but now he should decline it - I (in dread of losing a good customer,) appeased him as well as I could, and told him Pullen was in the parlour; I called him out - Taylor told him what happened about his man and the wine; the order was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270052"></xptr>then on the counter - I showed it to them; Pullen said,"That is all right, let him have as much as he wants, and pay yourself" - Taylor then ordered another half dozen of wine, half a gallon of rum, half a gallon of brandy, and a quart of whiskey; he and his man took them away - Pullen staid at the bar at the time; Pullen had himself that morning half a gallon of brandy, half a gallon of rum, and a bottle of whiskey, but that I recovered - I sent it to No. 8, Winchester-street, which address he gave me on the cheque; on the following morning, (Saturday.) before ten o'clock, I presented the cheque at Messrs. Glyn's, in Lombard-street - it was refused as forged, not being

            Smith's hand-writing; I went to No. 8, Winchester-street, but saw nobody there - I found pullen lived there, but he was not at home; I saw a woman and a little girl there - I returned, and asked the bankers for the real Mr. Smith's address, which they would not tell me: on the following Monday I went with Birch, the officer, to a house in Fan-street, which my son pointed out, in search of Taylor; we got in after a little trouble, and I saw some bottles, which I suppose were what my wine and spirits had been in - there were no marks on them; I brought away a stone bottle, which I believe to be mine - I there learned Taylor's address to be No. 28, Compton-street, Clerkenwell; I went there, and found the house uninhabited - between five and six o'clock that evening Sharp brought me this letter - (read)</p>

               <p>28th December, 8, Great Winchester-street.</p>
               <p>DEAR SIR, - Whatever money I borrowed of you, or whatever I owe, in regard to my score, &amp;c., shall be paid in the course of this week, as I shall be in the receipt of a sum of money towards the latter end, and you may rely on my punctuality; you need not alarm yourself, for it twenty times as much it would be perfectly safe; I should have called on you yesterday, but I assure you the effects of Christmas had completely upset me - however, I will call on you no doubt this evening or to-morrow, and arrange with you to your satisfaction; I am obliged to go and attend to some business at the west-end of the town, or I should have seen you to-day. J. PULLEN.</p>
               <p>RICHARD BURKE, in continuation. I had given Pullen credit for a few shillings besides the articles alluded to; the 2l. and 3l. was advanced to him on the cheque, which he represented as good; when Sharp brought the letter, he said he was a man of great respectability himself; that every day of his life he could command 100,000l., and if not his own money his clients had the command of it; I said I did not know he was in business - he said he was an agent and surveyor, and so highly connected, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was a particular friend of his; he said Pullen would call on me - I thought him a man of such respectability. I did not like to have any thing to do with him; that was my reason for not taking any steps, thinking I might get nothing for my trouble -I told him I was perfectly satisfied the cheque was a forgery, and I really thought he was concerned, and was as bad as the rest - I told him this on the Monday; he protested his innocence, said he was above such a thing, and he was sure Pullen would not engage in such a thing; that there must be a mistake in it, it could not be forged, and that Pullen would certainly call that night or to-morrow - I saw none of the prisoners after that till Saturday, the 8th of May, when I saw Taylor by St. Luke's church, Old-street, and gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>The order being read, was for half a dozen of port wine.</p>
               <p>(Signed) W. TAYLOR.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had Pullen become pretty intimate with you? A. Yes - I have made inquiry about his friends, they are highly respectable; I have been personally known to them some years - he told me he had received the cheque from a man named Smith - that was the man he had recovered the money from; he endorsed the cheque at my request - I found the address correct.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you say you asked the bankers for the real

            ? A. Because there was an acknowledged E. Smith at the bankers' - I did not ask Pullen for the drawer's address; I have stated all he said about the cheque - the prisoners were in my bar from about ten o'clock till half-past twelve; three bottles of wine were drauk, which I partook of; I had no whiskey or brandy- I may have tasted liquor with other customers; Pullen had run a score with me before - it was under 15s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Taylor and Sharp were strangers to you? A. Quite; I did not invite them into the bar - I did not ask them to endorse the cheque; Taylor himself said he was a skin-merchant; I drank with Taylor on the 26th of December; when I went to look for his house about twelve o'clock, I met him in Fan-street - I had been to the bankers at half-past nine; we had a quartern of gin among three or four of us - I paid for it, as I wanted to find who and what they were, and what steps to take; I had no assistance to secure him - I had no assistance when I did take him, but I was then in a place where I was well known; Fan-street is not a quarter of a mile from Old-street; I had not the slightest suspicion when I heard the silver jingling, but recollected it when I came to reflect afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you sure Pullen told you he had received the cheque from Smith? A. He told me distinctly that he had received it in part payment of money he had recovered.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he say he had received it from? A. He did not tell me.</p>
               <p>Sharp. Q. Did you speak to me or I to you, after we left the bar and came into the parlour? A. No; you paid for your wine at the bar, but what was drank in the parlour was on the strength of the cheque; what was taken into the parlour was put down in my book to the credit of the cheque, but I did not serve that.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was Sharp within hearing during all the transaction, while Pullen was telling you who and what he was? A. Certainly; he must have heard all that passed - he said nothing pro. or con.; the cheque was first presented to me in the parlour.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You cannot tell whether you might not, some time before, have had another customer of that name? A. I know no other; I have been in the house ten or eleven years - I can<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270053"></xptr>swear we have not for two or three years; there is a material difference between his hand-writing and this signature -I do not think it is written at all in imitation of his signature; I could not be deceived by it - this cheque is one used by our present firm; we use several colours and forms at the present time; we have had this form three or four years I should think, but cannot be particular to a year.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. The cheque is not like the handwriting of Mr. Smith, your customer? A. Not in the least; I should not think it was done in imitation of it; we have had no customer of that name for three years, during which time I have been cashier.</p>

            . I am a Blackwellhall-factor, and live in Basinghall-street. On the 24th of December I kept cash with Messrs.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How do you generally sign your name? A. Differently to this; when I sign cheques I put "Edw." and never a d at the top, which there is here - I generally dot the i; I am very particular in my manner of signing - I should not think it possible for this to be mistaken for my signature; it is not an imitation of my signature to cheques - the prisoners have had no opportunity of knowing how I sign.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Does it bear any resemblance to your signature to other things besides cheques? A. I have signed other things in this way; it certainly bears no resemblance to my writing.</p>

            . I live in Chapel-street, Shoreditch On the 28th of December I was a constable, and accompanied Mr. Burke to Fan-street, and to Goswell-street, On the 12th of May, in consequence of information, I accompanied Robertson, an officer, to No. 8, Great Winchester-street, about eight o'clock in the morning, and found Sharp standing in the front room, in his shirt and trousers; Pullen was in bed in the adjoining room - their beds were both in one room; Sharp asked me what I took him for - I told him he stood charged with felony, a capital offence, concerning a forged cheque which was passed to Mr. Burke; he said he knew nothing of it being forged at the time, nor till Monday, the 28th of December; he considered that Mr. Burke was doing extremely wrong, for he (Sharp) ought to become a witness, and if he was a witness he could tell me the particulars of the forged cheque passed to Burke, and several other forgeries; I asked what profession he was he said a broker and collector of rents, that he had then a suit in the King's Bench, and had several estates in the contry of his own, and was not at all afraid to meet the charge - the door between the rooms was open, so that Pullen could hear all this conversation; there is painted on the door-jam, "Sharp and Co's. chambers;" Pullen's name was not written there, but it might be up stairs; a young man came in afterwards, who Sharp called his clerk - he said, "My clerk will bring me some papers out," Robertson took Pullen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You found Pullen at the direction he wrote on the cheque? A. Yes, in bed.</p>
               <p>JOHN ROBERTSON. I was with Birch, and took Pullen in the back room, on the second floor; I told him I took him for the forged cheque that was passed to Burke- he said, "Oh, very well, I will get up and dress myself - I have a very bad foot;" I told him not to hurry - when he got up he said he had sent to Burke to ask him for his bill, and he would have paid it if he had sent it; I told him whatever he said would be given in evidence, and he had better say no more - he said he should take my advice; I found on Sharp several notices of trial and other things, bearing Pullen's name, as well as his own; and some brokers' tickets with Pullen's name as well as Sharp's. (The cheque was here read.)</p>
               <p>Sharp's Defence. I went to Burke's house to get a man to paint my name on my door, as Pullen told me several painters used the house; I had a glass or two of liquor in the parlour, which I paid the servant for - I fell asleep for some time, with my head on the table, and never heard Burke speak to Pullen or Taylor - as I was coming out by the bar, Pullen said, "Stop, let us have a drop," and we had some mulled wine - another bottle was had, which I paid for; but I never said a word about a cheque; I never saw it, nor did I know it had been passed till the Monday, when Pullen asked me to take the letter; he then said the cheque he had received had become a forgery - I said I knew nothing about a cheque; he said, "Well you were here, I hope you was not concerned" - I said I did not know a word about it, but I consider Mr. Pullen must have thought it good, or he would not have given it you, and what he had on it he will pay you no doubt - I stopped about two hours with him; he said he was very glad he had not met Pullen on Saturday, when he was in a passion, or he should very likely have given him in charge, and if he would return in the course of the week and pay him, he would return the cheque to him; I paid for what I had, and if I was concerned, why did I not order liquor as well as others? and if he suspected me, why not give me into custody then?</p>
               <p>RICHARD BURKE re-examined. When Pullen first showed me the cheque he was sitting in the parlour - he afterwards brought it to the bar; the conversation about it was partly in the parlour, and partly at the bar - what he said about his clients was in the parlour, and loud enough for them to hear; they were sitting together as close as could be, by the door, when the cheque was produced - he held it in his hand then, and I did not take it.</p>

               <p>Sharp. Q. When I brought the letter, did I not tell you I was a great money lender; that I lent money for other persons on mortgage? A. I do not recollect any such thing - he said he was a land agent, and could command 100,000l. every day of his life.</p>

            . On the 24th of December I was at the White Swan, Bunhill-row - Taylor was there; Pullen came in in a quarter of an hour - Taylor asked him if he could advance him some money on a cheque which he had got; Pullen said he had got no money - they were both nearly intoxicated; it was about five o'clock -Taylor then asked if he knew where he could get a few pounds on the cheque; Pullen said he believed there was a friend or somebody down in Shoreditch, where he would endeavour to see what he could do - Pullen asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270054"></xptr>if I would go down there; I said no, that I had to go to Hackney, and the best thing he and Taylor could do would be to go to bed - after that, when I came from Hackney, I accidentally called in at the City of Carlisle, about a quarter-past ten o'clock, and saw them drinking whiskey and water - I said I was not found of whiskey; they said they were going to have some wine, but I did not stop.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you known Pullen? A. Seven or eight years, and Taylor twelve or fifteen months - I believe Pullen gets his bread by the profession of the law; I work at the straw-hat business, and live at No. 18, Coburg-street, Euston-square, in apartments - I have no shop; I do not know how Taylor lives - I have seen him perhaps twenty times; he is no skin-merchant that I know of - I know Sharp by seeing him at Pullen's place in Winchester-street, about seven months ago; it may be his place, but not that I know of- Sharp's name is on the door; I believe they lived there together - Sharp is not a country gentleman of large property that I know of; he is a broker or something in the agency way - I did not hear of their receiving a large sum about Christmas: I understand Pullen and Sharp's chambers were distict - I believe they lived in the same room; I know

            * examined. Q. Take this cheque in your hand, you need not answer my question, and the account you give may be used against you another day; it is quite at you option to answer or not, it may affect your life another day - look at that cheque (does so), whose hand-writing is that " E. Smith," signed to that cheque? A. It is mine; I passed the cheque to Taylor, the prisoner - Pullen had no knowledge whatever of any fraud as to the cheque; I never kept an account at Messrs. Glyn's.</p>
               <p>*This is not the former witness of that name.</p>

             When did you sign it? A. The cheque was in existence on the 19th - it was post dated the 24th of December; I delivered it to Taylor on the 19th - I have known him about eight years intimately; we lived together for about three years - I was living with him on the 19th of December; he got his living in the commission way in the Birmingham and Sheffield trade - he has not been either very much distressed or very flourishing for the last three years; I have not been distressed particularly - he had no office as a skin-merchant while living with me; I once kept cash at Sharp and Sons, Smithfield; that was twenty years ago -Taylor knew my business; I am chiefly in the Sheffield commission trade, not in the skin line - I had some cheese to sell about Christmas last.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose cheeses? A. Am I bound to answer? I did not know Edward Smith, of Basing hall-street, on the 24th of December; I had no idea of such a person.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe, before you came into the witness-box, you received, from Mr. Harmer's clerk, every intimation and caution, as to the situation in which you stand? A. I did; I insisted on being heard as a witness, that innocent men might not be convicted.</p>

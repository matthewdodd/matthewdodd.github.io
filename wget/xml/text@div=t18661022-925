                  </hi>. I live at 10, Conduit Street, Long Acre, and am a coster-monger—between six and seven o'clock on 28th September I was returning to my lodgings—just as I entered Conduit Street I heard a great disturb<lb></lb>ance, and when I got to No. 10 I saw the prisoner creating a great dis<lb></lb>turbance, and insulting every one who passed through the court—as I passed in the doorway she said to me, "Here's another b—gun"—I took no notice and passed into the kitchen—I sat down for a quarter of an hour—as I was coming out along the passage the prisoner was still standing at the door—she made use of some bad coarse language—I passed by out of the door—the prisoner then came up and struck me—I shoved her away—she came up again and stabbed me in the head—I bled much—I did not see what it was done with until the knife was produced after this happened—a witness found it—I had a severe wound in my head—the doctor saw it—I had never seen the prisoner before—she was drunk, but she knew what she was about.</p>

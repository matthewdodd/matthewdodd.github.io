Hale, candle manu<lb></lb>facturers, of Queen-street, Cheapside—I am employed to go out with Cox's cart when candles are delivered—Cox was a carman in their employment—I have been in their employ about two years, and have been with Cox in the cart to deliver goods several times: a week in the course of the last nine months—on Thursday, 27th Sept., I recollect the cart being loaded at the warehouse—seven boxes for the town delivery were put in—Cox was the driver of the cart, and I went with him in it as far as Topping's wharf Tooley-street—after stopping there I went on with him, and he sent me with four show cards to a shop which my master serves, in the Borough market—I went from there to our factory in Orange-street, Southwark, where I got the horses' nose bags—I was to meet him at St. George's church, in the Borough, which I did—I was not often directed to leave the cart in that way—my masters' directions were to keep in the cart, and watch to keep the things from being taken out—Cox said that he had been to Hayes's wharf, and to a shop in Tooley-street—he did not say which shop—I know where Dinning lives; it is about five minutes' walk father on from Topping's wharf—that would not be his direct road to St. George's church—on a Thursday, a fortnight before 27th Sept., when we got as far as Thomas-street, in the Borough, he sent me with some onions to his house in Snow's-fields—I met him again at the top of Snow's-fields—Thomas-street is very near Tooley-street, and is about five minutes' walk from where Dinning lives.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Hale, of Queen-street, Cheapside, candle manufacturers. On 27th Sept., in consequence of information I received, I went to a house in Tooley-street, opposite Dinning's shop—it is a small oil shop—at about five minutes past 2 o'clock, the prosecutor's cart drove up in charge of Cox—Dinning came out and assisted Cox into the shop with a twelve dozen candle box—they remained in the shop about five minutes, and then Cox brought an empty twelve dozen box out—they then took another twelve dozen box into the shop, Dinning assisting as before—that box was left there—he came out, and took into the shop a parcel containing apparently six pounds of candles—he remained rather more than five minutes, and then drove away—the boy was not there, but it was his place not to have left the cart—he was employed for that purpose—I returned, and gave information to Mr. Hale—I have looked at the books—twenty-four dozen pounds of candles in four deliveries, six dozen to each delivery, were sold to Dinning on that day—I was present when they were ordered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was ordered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first 6lbs. of Dinning was on 16th Aug.—the next order was on the 29th, and was delivered on the 31st; on 13th Sept. six dozen more, and 27th Sept. was the day he was apprehended—six dozen was all that was ordered on 27th—two boxes would be rather an extensive order for a shop of that description—they were com<lb></lb>posite candles—we were charging Dinning 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per dozen pounds, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. net—if the money is returned by the man who delivers them, we allow 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. discount, which was the case with the three previous lots.</p>

               <p>are pointed out by the packer, Buckmaster—Cox has been in the service nine years, or more—I have been there eleven years—I do not think he could get candles away without the connivance of another party—it is usual to take the goods out of the boxes, and bring the empty boxes back—an empty box sometimes remains at a customer's, for his own convenience, if he cannot put the candles away—it was perfectly dear to the passers by that the paper parcel was taken out of the cart—I saw no label on it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Warren Stormes Hale, of Queen-street, Cheapside. Dinning was a customer of ours, and Cox was our carman—on 27th Sept., Dinning called at 10 o'clock in the morning, and gave me an order for six dozen, Times composite candles, sixes—I made out the invoice, and gave it to the packer—they were packed in one box, they would not fill it, they were all twelve dozen boxes that day—they would be taken by Cox; the price was 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., less 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. discount—in conse<lb></lb>quence of something communicated to me I sent George Best to see what was delivered at Dinning's shop, and in consequence of what he told me, I went to inspector Newman, and then to Cox's in Snow's-fields, and asked him how many candles he had delivered at Dining's that day—he said, "Six dozen"—I asked him if that was all—he said, "Yes"—I said, "But they were in a box"—he said, "I know that"—I said, "But you have delivered more"—he denied it—I told him we had proof that be had deli<lb></lb>vered two boxes and a package; he said twice, if not three times, "I did not," and said that he knew he delivered a package, but that was to make up the quantity—there was no necessity to do that, if only six dozen were to be delivered—the inspector took him into custody—I afterwards went with the inspector to Dinning's house, waited till 10 o'clock till he came home, and then the inspector asked him how many candles he had received from us on that day—he said, "Six dozen"—he was asked if that was all—he said, "Yes"—the inspector told him that be had proof that he had two boxes and a package besides—he said that he had not—we said, that we must search the place—he showed us two papers of eights in the shop, one of which had had half a pound taken out; there were also some sixes in the window for sale—Dinning said that our carman had left the eights in mistake and he had told him so, and he intended to have returned them—he showed us the remainder of the eights, and we asked him if he had any more candles—he said, "Yes"—the inspector asked him where, and he said, "Down below"—we went into the cellar, and found forty-six pack<lb></lb>ages containing twenty-three dozen of sixes—all of them were Times com<lb></lb>posite, and were in papers with our marks still on them, and the words, "Times composite, sixes"—while I was counting them over, I said, "These</p>

               <p>are some you hare received to-day—he said, "Yes," and then contradicted himself, and said, "No, they were there before"—I am not sure whether he did not say the day previous—I found an empty candle box in the shop with our mark on it—the whole quantity we found was twenty-eight down eleven pounds and a half—on a bill file in the shop I found four invoice applying to the four transactions and no more.</p>

               <p>asked him if that was all that he had received—he said, "Yes"—I told him we had received information that he had two boxes brought in, and a package, which he denied—I took him into custody, and said that I must examine his place—I found in the shop a box containing a quantity of com<lb></lb>posite candles, identified by Mr. Hale; some on the counter, and some in the window exposed for sale, they were eights, and there were five dozen pounds, and eleven pounds and a half—I then accompanied Dinning into a cellar, and found forty-six packages of sixes—on being questioned about them he said that he had six dozen of them in that day (he said that the eights had been brought in by mistake, and he intended to have sent them back next day)—he afterwards said that he meant that he had six dozen of the sixes on the last occasion—I found on a bill file in the shop these four in<lb></lb>voices (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—one is of Sept. 27th, and three are of previous dates—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>:"Mr. Dinning, Sept. 27th, 1855; six dozen Times composite, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am an oilman of No. 102, Berwick-street, Soho. I deal in candles—early in Aug., Dinning came to my shop, he said that he had speculated in composites, and would I buy some of him—I said, "Yes, at a price"—I bought twelve dozen of him at 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen—he gave me this invoice and receipt (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Mr. W.

Dinning, twelve dozen composites, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.")—they were times composites, and I bought them as Mr. Hale's—I also bought a small parcel afterwards of Dinning; the last parcel I bought was on 24th Sept., twelve dozen at 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had bought some a fortnight, three weeks, or a month previously—I bought seven dozen then, and have an invoice of them—I bought six dozen shortly before that—I bought thirty-seven dozen altogether, and two other lots of about six dozen each, of which I have no invoice—Aug. was the first dealing I had with him—I bought forty-seven dozen from the commencement of Aug. to Sept.—I gave eighteen dozen up to the police in the same state as I received them—all these candles were Messrs. Hale's, they were all labelled in the same way.</p>

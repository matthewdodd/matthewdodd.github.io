               <p>I am apprentice to the prosecutor, I am fourteen years of age, I was in the shop the 25th of November, about half past six, behind the large bellows; I had a suspicion of the prisoner taking things, and I saw him take two pieces of bar iron from the door where the men always go out, I was not so far from him as I am now, there was a candle, I run after him, and stopped him; he called me a fool, and bid me not tell my master that I saw him; he had not got far from the shop, and I stopped him again the second time, he run down Whitechapel, the iron was never seen after.</p>

               <p>I was out with Mr. Ilsley's other apprentice with some work, the shop was all in darkness, the oldest apprentice ran down to see for this boy, whom we supposed was at the alehouse, and I went after him to my tipping, and the boy said, you must bring the iron back, and I had none, I shewed him my hands.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

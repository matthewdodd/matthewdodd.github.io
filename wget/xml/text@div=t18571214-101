                  </hi>., I am a City policeman. In consequence of in<lb></lb>formation, I went, on the morning of 1st Dec., to Mr. Solly, in Fitche's Court, Noble Street, with Mr. Frederick Summers—while I was there the prisoner Solomon came, and brought with him this parcel—he went in the counting house, and undid the parcel—I saw the contents of it—it was these embossed labels—I asked him if they were his property; he said "Yes"—I asked him what he wanted for them; he said, "1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I said I was a police officer, and he need not answer me any questions unless he thought proper—I asked him where he got them; he said he bought them of a young man of the name of Myers that morning in the lane, and gave 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—he said he had had a sample of them before—I said they were stolen, and were worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he did not know the value of them—I found on him a small sum of money—I found Myers in Gravel Lane—I asked him if he knew a young man of the name of Solomon, and if he had seen him that morning, and if he had sold him some embossed labels—he said he had—I told him I was a police officer, and he need not answer me any questions unless he thought proper—I asked what he sold them for—he said 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he had bought them in the lane that morning for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of a young man about twenty-five, and he had some samples of them the night before, between 6 and 7 o'clock—I said that was shortly after the robbery—I took him to the station, and found on him 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and two em<lb></lb>bossed labels—he said they formed part of the samples.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Philip Summers, a fancy stationer, in Tabernacle Walk. I do not know the prisoners—these labels are my father's—they are worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a thousand—I counted those produced, and found two less than 2, 000. On Thursday, 26th Nov., I packed up these labels, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and gave them to an errand boy—they were packed in hundreds, not in the paper they are in now—they were in a brown paper parcel—I wrote the direction, and entered it in the parcel book to Chaplin and Home's, the carrier.</p>

On Thursday, 26th Nov., I took two parcels from his shop about 5 o'clock in the afternoon—I was to take one to Pickford's, and one to Chaplin and Horne's—when I got to Pickford's, in Wood Street, I missed one parcel, which was directed to Mr. Hooper, at Manchester—the last time I had seen that was at the London Wall end of Moorgate Street—I do not know the contents of the parcel.</p>

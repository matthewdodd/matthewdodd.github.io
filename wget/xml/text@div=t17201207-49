             by Misfortune. It appeared that the Prisoner and the Deceased were intimate Friends, and had been a Fowling together that Day; that when the Prisoner came home he Shot at a Bird in a Tree, the Deceased not being then in Sight, and that another Gun went off at the same time; that when he understood the Deceased was shot, and thinking that it might be done by his shooting at the Bird, he said he was very sorry for it, and had rather it had been himself. That it was 25 Foot distance between the Place where the Prisoner stood when he Shot off his Gun and that where the Deceased fell, and that the Deceased had no scattering Shot at all about him, and his Clothes were burnt with the Flash, and another Gun being heard to go off at the same time, the Prisoner observed that it was most likely to be the Deceased's own Gun which shot him. The Jury considering the whole matter, brought him in <rs id="t17201207-49-verdict262" type="verdictDescription">

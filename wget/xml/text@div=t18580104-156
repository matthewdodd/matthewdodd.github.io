                  </hi>. I am one of the ushers, and gaoler of Marl<lb></lb>borough Street Police Court. On 14th Aug. the prisoner was in my custody in order to find sureties, and as I was removing him from the dock to one of the cells, he said, to the best of my recollection, that he would be revenged; and as he was going along the area towards the cell, near where the office keeper lives, he was going to make water—I told him that it was a very improper place to do that, and with a little coaxing I persuaded him to come on to where I showed him, and under the tank were two pails; he up with them one after another, I avoided them, and they penetrated into the bricks of the wall—I opened the cell door, and called a man named Saunders, who was there for stabbing his wife; he came to my assistance—the prisoner threw himself forward, and commenced kicking me just here, and I suffered a great deal of pain for a long time, and have been away from my duty for three months, and have great difficulty in doing my duty now—my impres<lb></lb>sion is that he had been drinking very hard—he had not been in custody above an hour.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in custody, and Welch called on me to help him—I came out of my cell, and saw the prisoner flinging a zinc bucket, and then a wooden one; I fastened him by the arms, and on pulling him into the cell he made three or four kicks at him—after he got into the cell he stripped all his clothes off, tore up everything but his boots, and then laid down and went to sleep.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Great Marlborongh Street. On 14th Aug. I was called to the prosecutor, and found him in excruciating pain, just on the region of the liver—he was not able to speak, and breathed with very great difficulty—I considered him in considerable danger; he was under my care more than two months, and is complaining of considerable pain still—I consider that the prisoner was labouring under <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> from drinking, and that he did not know what he was doing—hewas quite naked; he stripped himself from head to foot in the cell; I went to him, and he decidedly did not know what he was doing—it is impos<lb></lb>sible to say whether that was from drink or insanity, but I understand that he had been drinking to excess the night before—he has been a soldier, and he says he received a wound in his head, and when he drinks he is wan<lb></lb>dering—hewas considered as not fit to take his trial, and was sent to an asylum.</p>

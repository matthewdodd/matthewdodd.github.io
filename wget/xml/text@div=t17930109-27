Mrs. Dawson keeps a linen draper's shop, and sells ready made linen. (Produced.)</p>

               <p>I know it to be Mrs. Dawson's property, by two figures, 5 and a 1/4; I marked it about the 24th of October, when we took stock; I had seen it a day or two before, I cannot exactly say which.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming from Paddington last Tuesday week; I had been to carry some work, and coming down Edward-street, I saw a man, that this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090042"></xptr>gentlewoman spoke to, and I saw him coming from the door; as I came by I saw this parcel and kicked it before me with my foot, I picked it up and went to a light to look at it, and was walking away in a very peaceable manner, and this gentleman came and took hold of me; I told him if it was his property, I am very willing to go to his shop, when I saw what it was, I put it under my coat; please you my lord, I think a thief always runs away when he steals things, I was walking very seriously away.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>). I am a detective—on Monday afternoon, 7th January, I received directions from Messrs. Budd, and went in plain clothes to Princes Dock, Rotherhithe—I got there about twenty minutes to 5 o'clock, close by the dock, and saw Graham's wagon loading some old sheathing in front of the dock—Jelf, Percival, and some others whom I could not see, were bringing the metal from the dock to the wagon—Preece was in the wagon packing the metal—I saw a man named Sullivan there (<hi rend="italic">See last case</hi>)—I followed and apprehended him, and after taking him to the station I returned to the wagon and found it had turned down Paradise-street, and drawn up at a public-house—it had turned to the right instead of the left—Preece was the driver of it—Clark's Orchard is at the back of that public-house—as I turned the corner to meet the wagon I heard the metal rattle, and a roan who had picked some metal off the wagon ran through the narrow court at the side of the public-house into Clark's Orchard, carrying some metal under his arm—I have not ascertained who that was—as I drew nearer I saw another person, who I believe to be Jelf, take another armful of open squares of metal and leave the wagon with it—it was like this sheathing (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the man in the wagon trampled it down so as to lay close in the wagon like sheets of paper—when I first turned the corner Percival and Preece were drinking out of a pint of porter between the tail of the wagon and the cart—Percival brought it out and gave it to Preece—Jelf then came back from the court—I am positive it was Jelf—I knew him previously working at the wharf—Harris then ran through with another armful—Jelf saw me and held up his hands, giving a signal to Percival, who was shifting the metal down towards the tail-board where the others were removing it from—I ran before Percival and followed Harris across Clark's Orchard, and caught him half way through the wicket-gate of Mr. McGregor's house and half out—Clark's Orchard is a narrow court, more like a mews than a street—I caught hold of his collar, and part of the metal dropped inside McGregor's and some outside—we had a struggle—he was stronger than me—we had several ups and downs and he got away, and I have not seen him since—he ran past the wagon, and Percival and the others who were there never offered to stop him—the wagon then went on—I went hack and picked up the metal that laid outside, took it to the station, and came back with another constable to McGregor's, and rang the bell several times, as the wicket-gate was then shut: I did not see it open, it must have been shut in the scuffle, I suppose—I rang the bell three or four times, and at last Mr. McGregor came down—I said, "You have some metal in here which some men have been</p>

               <p>bringing; I want to see it"—he said, "No, I have not; there has been no metal brought in to-day"—I said, "I know better, for I have seen two lots come myself—I asked him where he kept his metal and he took us up stairs—the house is like a mews, there is a pair of folding-gates and rooms over them, but nothing like a shop—I went to the first floor, and at the top of the landing there was a little square place, where there was a little box with a quantity of this metal in it piled up—there were scales and so forth on the landing—there was none lying on the landing, it was all doubled up in this form and put in the box—these small squares are where the folds were—I said, "How do you account for the possession of this V—he said that he bought it of some one whose name I forget, and had got a receipt for it—he called his daughter to bring the receipt—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the name he mentioned is the name that appeared on the receipt—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "King and Queen Dockyard, November 14, 1860.—Received of Mr. McGregor 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in part payment of 9cwt. 2qrs. 4 lbs. old metal and nails, for Reedy and Mar-shall, Robert Strachan.")—I said, "This receipt will not do for me, fort his stuff is quite wet as if just brought in, and this receipt is 14th November, and this is 7th January"—it was wet with frost and snow on it—there was very heavy rime that morning, and there was rime on the metal—there was rime on the metal in the wagon—he said, "My man always washes the metal"—I said, "This metal has not been washed, because here is all the frost and snow on it, and if it had been washed that would not have been there"—I took the metal away which had the frost and snow on it, leaving a quantity behind which was dry—I brought away 32 lbs. all with frost and snow on it, that was stacked: the bottom part was dry—I told McGregor that he would be wanted at Greenwich police-court next morning at half-past 9, and said, "I will call for you to go there"—! called for him but he was not there—I was at the police-court all day but did not see him—after I had taken the metal away from McGregor's I went by rail to the prosecutor's premises—the wagon had not come in—I waited for it—Percival, Jelf, and Preece came with it—I told them I should take them in custody for being concerned with others in stealing this metal of their masters—they said that they knew nothing of it, and Jelf said, "When you ran by me I felt struck to the ground, you might have knocked me down as you passed me; I know nothing about it"—I said, "I know better, you were there all the time; you were the person who went with the second lot, you were sent to the end of the court when I went through, and you held up your hands and gave the <hi rend="italic">office</hi> to the others"—he persisted in his innocence—Percival said that he knew nothing about it—I said, "I know better; you were standing drinking with the carman when the other ran through"—he acknowledged drinking the beer, but said that one of them went to the water-closet and he never saw anything of it—Preece said he know nothing about it—I said, "You were standing by at the time and saw all that was going on"—I made the report to Preece's master, and he ordered him to be at the police-court on 15th January—I was there and took him in custody—that was after the first examination—the others were in custody before—I asked Preece how he accounted for going out of his road, as, instead of turning to the left, he turned down Paradise-street—he said, "Percival ordered me"—Percival was not present when he said that—the other would have been the more direct road—he persisted that he knew nothing about it and I said "You must answer that before a Magistrate."</p>

               <p>a few minutes after—it was a little after 5 o'clock when I saw these men running up the court—it was not dark, as there was a gas lamp over the door of the public-house, but it was dark in the street where I was—I saw Jelf coming down the court, and was confident of him at the time—I should not like to swear to him now, but I feel confident because I knew him long before—if he had a pipe in his hand I think I must have seen it, because I spoke to him and said, "I can take you at any time," as I ran by him—if he came out of the public-house it was before I came up—he put his h and up like this, and I considered it was a signal to the others to leave off—Preece was standing between the wagon and the public-house—I was on this side of the wagon—it did not screen them from me—Preece was drinking some beer—I know he saw what passed because his face was to me, and I saw it—I did not take him in custody till after we got to Greenwich—it was only after certain things he said that he was taken in custody—it is not customary for all the carts and wagons to go down Paradise-street to avoid the toll-bar—the bar is t' e other side of Mill-pond-bridge—Preece has been out on bail—his master seemed to think he was as bad as the others, or I do not think he would have had him taken in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. H. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many houses are there in Clark's-orchard, thirty or forty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I dare say there are—most of them are the same style of houses that McGregor lives in—there is no marine-store shop in that place—I have been up and down and have not seen one—I have not made inquiries for one—I will swear there is not a marine-store shop, but I cannot say whether there is a marine-store dealer's—McGregor may call himself a marine store dealer; I cannot say—I cannot swear that there is not a house in the court with "Marine-store dealer," written over the door, but I looked for one and could not find one—I pulled the bell four times, I think it was, before he came down—he seemed to be a long time coming—when I said that I had seen two lots of metal go in myself I meant that I saw it go through the court—I believe it did go in because I found the stuff there—I did not see it go into McGregor's gate—it is not true that I saw it go in, but it turns out that that was true—when I said I saw it go into McGregor's it was a mistake—Mr. Budd set me to watch—Harris is the man I followed and had the scuffle with—he has been out of town since, but there is a true bill found against him—I ran after him, seized him, and pulled him back as he was stooping, going in at the wicket gate—his head and shoulders were in, and his legs were out—there are two large gates, and this wicket is in one of them, and it was open—I did not see him open it, though I was very close upon him—the metal got scattered about, which he was carrying—there was not above one sheet inside, the rest tumbled outside—I had not a very long struggle with him—we had two or three ups and downs—I picked up 19 lbs. of metal which he was carrying, took it to the station, marked it, and weighed it by itself—several constables saw me do so—the copper was not all mixed up together to be taken to the station—I went down with this first, and weighed it before I took any out of McGregor's house—there was no snow that day, but there was a very heavy rime—the trees and everything were loaded with hoar frost—I mentioned snow to McGregor: there was snow on it, because there was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186101280093"></xptr>
               <p>snow on the ground, and this had been doubled upon the ground—it had not been snowing that day, but the yard was covered with snow—I have not told you that when I said snow, I meant hoar frost—there were pieces of snow doubled up with it, which it had picked up in the yard, small pieces which hung to the metal; there were no lumps—McGregor's daughter brought a file with bills on it, and this bill was near the bottom—the copper that I took away, was lying at the top of other copper—I dare say there was a hundredweight or more, doubled up in the same way—my first question to him was, "How do you account for the possession of this metal? pointing to the lot; and he produced this receipt—the question in my mind only had reference to this—I knew that all that lay there could not have been brought in—I alluded to what I saw go in, and pointed to the metal—this is my signature to this deposition—(<hi rend="italic">This being read stated</hi>, "When I asked him how he accounted for the possession of the metal, it had reference to the whole, about one hundredweight; the wet metal was on the top.")—I had not separated the two metals then, but this was lying on the top—I had never seen McGregor before—there was no sign of any business only inside—his dwelling-house is upstairs, over a place which appears to have been a coach-house, into which the gates open—there is a large place behind the gates—after you have got into that space there is a slight partition—it has been a large building, and is separated off—there is a ceiling over it—it is not a warehouse—there was a bed lying on the floor, and he said that was where his man slept—there were a lot of crucibles there to melt metal in, but I did not see any metal—there were lots of ashes and such stuff as that, as if it had come from some furnace—I did not empty the tuba of ashes—I went up stairs, but did not go into his room—I never heard the name of Ben brook mentioned, till it was mentioned at the police-court—I was then asked about Ben brook, and said that I had never heard his name mentioned—I said, "I do not think Benbrook is the name of the person he said he bought the metal of, the name of the person was on the invoice"—that is what I say now—I never heard him mention the name—Benbrook is the only name that was mentioned—when I drew McGregor's attention to some metal as well, he did not say that he bought it from Benbrook—the name of Benbrook was not mentioned—I drew his attention to it being wet, and he said that his man had washed it—with regard to his not appearing next day, I believe his solicitor, Mr. Cockle, explained before the Magistrate that he misunderstood what station to go to: and he may have said that would produce him next day if required—I do not remember the Magistrate stopping Mr. Cockle, saying he did not want to hear him, he was quite satisfied—Mr. Cockle, I believe, applied for the summons—I saw three lots of metal go down altogether—the second was, I believe, taken by Jelf—the metal taken from McGregor's was carried away by me and the other officer together—it was doubled up in three, not exactly as it is now, because we put it in a sack—it was weighed at the station—I mean to say that we took 32 lbs. of metal from McGregor's—we each took some—we went together to the station—I went with it, and gave some to another constable to carry—he accompanied me to the station, and then it was all put together—what we picked up on the road was in sheets, not doubled up; but we doubled it up to bring it here—we marked it first—the parcels have been kept serrate—the tail board of the wagon was down level with the bottom of the wagon—it was on chains—I told the Magistrate that it was all mixed together, because we put it together; but it was not mixed before it was marked—it was marked at the police-station—it was not mixed before</p>

               <p>it got there, nor did I tell the Magistrate so, nor did he say it was very wrong, that I remember—I cannot swear he did not—on my oath it was not mixed before we got to the station; it could not be—this is the lot that we found on Harris, and this is the lot that we found at the house.</p>

On Monday, 7th January, from information I received, I went to Paradise-street, Rotherhithe, at 5 or 6 o'clock, and saw a van with Jelf, Percival, and Preece in it, going on towards London—I asked Jelf what was the matter—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "I received information at the station that some men had been stealing copper out of the waggon"—he said, "No, there is no copper gone out of the waggon"—Preece came up at that time, round to the back of the wagon—he heard what passed, and said, "No, there cannot be any gone, for I was at my horses' heads all the time"—I returned to the station, and shortly afterwards Gaylor came in—he and I went together to McGregor's premises—he rang at the bell three or four times—McGregor opened the little wicket-gate—Gaylor asked him if he had any metal—he said, "No," he had had no metal in that day—Gaylor said, "I know better, for I have seen one or two lots come in," and asked him where he kept his metal—he said, "Upstairs"—he got a candle and went upstairs, and in a little room od the right, on the first-floor, we found a quantity of metal—Gaylor asked him how he came into possession of it—he told his daughter to bring the invoices, which she did, and I saw one dated November 14—Gaylor said, "That cannot be it, for this metal is all over ice and frost"—I believe this to be the invoice—Gaylor said, "I shall take charge of this metal"—McGregor said that his man had been washing the metal—Gaylor said that he must trouble him to be at the police-court—we brought away the metal, which was all over ice, and rime, and frost, from the top of some more—that which was underneath was quite dry—we could not get in at the wicket-gate with-oat ringing the bell; there is no handle to turn to open it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Messrs. Budd, copper smelters, 13,. Upper Thames-street—I know a vessel named the <hi rend="italic">Gwalior</hi>—I had provided the metal sheathing for her in 1858, at the commencement of January in that year—I arranged with the owners, Messrs. Robert Henderson and Sons, to strip her and fresh sheath her—I transacted the business with Mr. George Henderson, and I know for a fact that the ship is his—I gave orders for the old sheathing to be brought back—it is worth 7 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound in exchange, and the new sheathing is worth 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound.</p>

               <p>new and take our's back, but that very seldom happens—I should say the dock-master does something on his own account, but old metal would very seldom come into his hands; if it does, he generally sells it to the merchant—we do not sell old metal—it is sold very frequently and melted, but it ought not to be—I know Renuie and Marshall, they are respectable people; I should be surprised to hear that they buy it—Aston and Griffiths are large people like ourselves—I know that they buy it—I cannot say whether they sell it again—they are agents for smelters—Young and Dawson buy metal, I do not know whether they sell it again—Phipson and Co. are small people, I cannot say whether they buy it—old metal is never sold to us by the dock-master.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. H. GIFFARD</hi>. Do you know whether, as a matter of practice, that sometimes over the actual weight is generally taken to allow for the dirt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My instructions to the foreman who represents Vivian and Sons, are, that they Should get fair weight between man and man—sometimes the weather is very wet, and I have frequently set questions at rest for them: we do not buy dirt, we buy metal.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this copper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yellow metal; it is a compound—old yellow metal is a distinct article; you may call many things yellow metal—there are other manufacturers of this article, but we know of no dealers in it except the manufacturers—every manufacturer has a stamp; we stamp "V. and L." on every sheet that we manufacture—I find our stamp on this, and have identified it, and it is remarkable that it bears the mark of the substance which was supplied in 1858—I find our stamp on all that has been shown to me—we supply various qualities—it ranges from eighteen to thirty-two ounces the square foot, which our stamp denotes—the substance of this agrees with what was supplied to the <hi rend="italic">Gwailor</hi>, and the specimen agrees also—I have compared it carefully—this, picked up outside the house, bears the same character as that in the wagon, and is the substance of that which was supplied—the two agree, and I believe they are the same—we have not stripped a ship, in King and Queen dockyard, since September, 1859.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I am a metal dealer, and live at 1, Clark's Orchard—I go on board ships and buy metal of the captains or owners, that comes off ships' bottoms; metal sheathing like this—Muntz's patent has expired, and there are forty different makers now—I have been a metal collector shout eighteen years, and have sold a great deal of metal to Mr. McGregor—I recollect the Monday that this affair happened at his place; on the Saturday before that I sold him 28 lbs. of metal sheathing—I had had dealings with him before—I very seldom have a bill, and very seldom give one in ready-money transactions—I received 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that is 6 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound—McGregor's daughter paid me—she is a young girl somewhere about eighteen or nineteen—this is the sort of metal I sold him, it is precisely the same—he complained that it was dirty with coal dust, and 1 rinsed it in a very large tub of water, and allowed 6 oz. for the coal dust on it—Saturday was a very frosty day—I seldom or never look at the marks on metal I sell; I do not care what marks are on it—it was weighed in the scale at his place, and put on top of some more metal, in the metal room, where he keeps his metal with more of the same sort, which was dry, mine was wet—I have frequently sold him metal before.</p>

               <p>Vivian sells it—Muntz's is rather a large stamp, and put very prominently on it—it is an oval stamp, and is not confined to the corners—I have seen it in the middle of the sheet.</p>

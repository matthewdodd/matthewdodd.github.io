               <p>I went to the place to have half a pint of beer, when the prosecutor began to make fun of me on my conversing with a man that the prosecutor says I was reciting to. The prosecutor put his hand in my pocket and took my handkerchief—I said "You were not sharp enough that time," and insisted on his giving it me back. He struck me on the nose and cut it; they tried to put me out; I struggled, and we fell. I lost 155. 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was all I had. I received a violent blow on the head, and I remember no more. When I recovered my senses I was lying on the floor, and all were standing round me. I got up and walked out. One man said "It was only a lark you old fool." I went away, but was watched and given in charge. It is a public-house row. I have been twenty-eight years at sea and never had a row before in my life or a bad discharge. Whoever bit the prosecutor was of unsound mind.</p>

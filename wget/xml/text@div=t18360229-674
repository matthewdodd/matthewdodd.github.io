                  </hi>. I live at Milton, near Sittingbourne. On the 15th of January, I missed a mare from a stable in my farm-yard, about half-past four o'clock in the morning—I know the prisoner very well—I had seen him on Thursday, the 14th, and spoken to him, at one of my farm houses at Milton—his aunt is the wife of a servant of mine—I found him in the custody of Adcock, about a quarter before eleven o'clock on Sun<lb></lb>day night, the 17th, in Whitechapel, and said to him, "Thomas, this is a bad job, you did not except to see me here"—I saw him afterwards at the police-station, near Spitalfields church—the policeman asked how he came up to town—he said he did not wish to tell a story, that he had rode my horse up, and she was to be found at a stable in Harrow-lane, Lime house—I</p>

In consequence of informa<lb></lb>tion, I took the prisoner into custody, in High-street, Whitechapel, at a quarter before eleven o'clock on the evening of the 17th of January—I told him he was my prisoner, on suspicion of stealing a mare—he said he hoped not—I said, "You are, and must go to the police-station with me"—Mr. Jordan overtook us on the road, and said, "you did not expect to see me here, Thomas"—he said, "No, I did not; it is a bad job"—we went to the station-house—he was asked how he came up to London—he said, "On horseback; it is no use my telling stories, I took your mare, Mr. Jordan"—he said I should find it in Harrow-lane, Poplar—he directed me to a man there, who goes by the name of <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, the ostler—he said <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> lived in Blackboy-lane, which is nearly opposite Harrow-lane—I found <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, and he took me to Smith's, who belongs to the stable, and they both together delivered me up the mare.</p>

I was the last man at the stable—I left the mare safe, as the clock struck ten, on the 15th—I locked the stable door, and took the key in my pocket, and at a quarter past four o'clock in the morning, I found the stable door wide open, and the window also, and the mare gone—a person getting through the window could open the door inside—the win<lb></lb>dow is large enough for a person to get through—I had seen the prisoner about, on the Thursday afternoon before—he is a farmer's son in the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood—I found no paper in the stable—I heard he had said one was left there, but I could find nothing of the sort—I never searched for it myself, as I did not hear of it till the day after—I hung the key behind the door, on a nail, but saw nothing of any paper—I did not look for it, because the stable had been cleaned out two or three times before.</p>

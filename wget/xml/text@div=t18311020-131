The prisoner lived in my house for two years - on the 19th of September, I found a bobbin with some silk on it, under five or six quires of paper; I afterwards missed that bobbin, and sent for the prisoner - I spoke to him, and he produced a bobbin from his hat; he had had that to work with in my business - I sent for the officer, who found this knot of brown silk in his pocket, which he had not been employed to work on; it weighed about 1 oz. 12 drams. - I valued it at 6d.; the prisoner told me of two places where be lived - I went to one of them, and found in two drawers, which the landlady pointed out, six bobbins of silk, two knots of cord, and four pieces of worsted braid; five of the bobbins have my mark on them - this is the property.</p>

               <p>of the Hackney-road, as he had promised his account—I cannot recollect whether it was understood that our expenses should be divided on that Sunday, or that you told me you had received Wright's account a and took it on account of your commission, paying me the half of my day's expenses; but I recollect that you paid me the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. down and I booked it—you were not entitled to retain your commission out of the monies I received—you always had your commission paid every month; but when you re<lb></lb>quired cloths, I directed my tailors to take it out of your commission—the book will show that you had 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week; you received the last 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week on 14th July—I think you started that day to the Midland Counties—you promised that the terms upon which you went were 7 1/2 per cent and your expenses paid—there was no settled amount for your expenses—I paid your railway expenses and 7 1/2 per cent but not your hotel expenses; you were to pay for your lodging and keep out of the 7 1/2 per cent—you were to pay for your lodging and keep out of the 7 1/2 per cent—you could do on the journey 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. surely that would pay you—you hadl 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when you started 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. afterwards, and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. after that—I recollect the last Kent journey that you went, you charged me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for your expenses, and I made the same journey for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in three days and a half—you spent a week and charged 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for six day's reilway expenses and I paid it—you once took the money out of what you received; that was on the last journey—when you take you expenses out of your receipts it would be your duty to show it in your accounts and what the balance was, and you did so—I gave you 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 14th July, to start on your journey—I sent you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more on the following Thursday, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. you collected from Mr. Hackney, that made 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for fourteen days' travelling expenses; but you had no business to shop fourteen days, and had notice to come back.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I entered Mr. Rolf's service in February, at a salary of 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 2/12 commission—he was in a very struggling way of business, and had scarcely credit for a yard of cloth—I took my salary as I could get it, sometimes 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. sometimes 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and we pulled together until I was able to go out of town to extend the trade; I had my own interests in view as well as his, and endeavoured to be as cautious as possible. My expenses have been very little over 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day, which is very small indeed to represent an old house, and is very difficult indeed to build up a new con<lb></lb>nexion. I received the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Hackney because I had to leave</p>

               <p>my patterns in pawn to charter myself to Derby; what else could I do? I must have stayed there, at a frightful expense in the shape of an hotel bill, instead of which I collected this money, redeemed my samples, paid my bill, and just cleared my way up to London. I went without my dinner and without half my meals to make the money go further; I endeavoured to do all I possibly could but the journey was failure. This money was spen in <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> expenses. Mr. Rolf has sworn tht I have not given credit for Strickland's account, how that is, I know not; I received it and am fully convinced that I paid it to Mr. Rolf. Five years ago I was charged in this Court for the same thing and had a years imprisonment, and it is hardly likely that I should throw away a change again for such a paltry amount; I paid him this money but unfortunately cannot bring witnesses to prove it; I have been negligent and careless: for having had troubles of a domestic nature, I have given way too much to drink, but as to embezzling the amounts, I should as soon think of putting my head in the fire.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to my mother, Sarah Wayland, who is a widow, and is a post-horse-keeper at Richmond. On the 27th of December, about seven o'clock, I saw two cushions, and the rug safe in the gig under the gateway on my mother's premises at Cumberland-yard, Richmond. I had been to take a party to a dinner, and left the gig and this property quite safe—my sister called me about nine o'clock, and I found the carriage door open—the cushions and rug were gone—these are the articles—(<hi rend="italic">looking at then</hi>)—I am quite sure they are my mother's.</p>

About ten minutes before twelve o'clock, I was coming past the Eight Bells, and saw the prisoner offering these articles for sale—I asked where he brought them from—he would not tell me—I asked where he was taking them—he would not tell me—I said, I must lock him up—he would not tell the Inspector his name, nor any thing else.</p>

I live with Mr. Briggs, pawnbroker, in St. John-street: The prisoner brought it to pledge with me on the 27th of March, between ten and eleven in the morning; she said it was her own, and as I was examining it, I observed a ticket pinned on the corner of it, and saw that it was Mr. Cordy's; upon that I went to Mr. Cordy's to enquire if they had lost a sheet; I have had it ever since.</p>

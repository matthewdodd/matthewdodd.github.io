I met a man at the door of Mr. Barrett's shop, he told me to bring half a pint of rum, and change for a two pound-note; I took one pound nineteen shillings, and I met the man by the door of Mr. Barrett's shop; he said you have been a long while, give me the change; here is the note; I do not want the rum. He gave me this bit of paper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant foreman in the East and West India Docks. On the morning of the 15th of Dec., I found a package of copper in No. 11, warehouse, on the ground-floor—it was rolled up in a package, different to what we ever have—it had no wrapper, or anything round it—it had no business there—there was some copper there which had been on a ship's bottom, within a few yards of this—suspecting it was not right, I told my superior, Captain Harrison—he directed me what to do, and I secreted myself behind some rope—on the 16th I went there again, and about ten o'clock the prisoner came down—he was a messenger there, and had no business in the warehouse—he walked directly up to this parcel, took it, and walked away—as he passed me, I moved—he heard me, and turned, and looked—I took him in the alley—I asked what he had got—he said, "Nothing"—I took him to the office—I went back and found this</p>

               <p>copper about five or six yards from where I saw him take it from—he passed by the place where I found it—this is the copper.</p>

Striven showed me what he had seen—I saw this little parcel of copper on the package in No. 11, warehouse—the prisoner had no business there, without he was sent with any message—he had no message when he went there on that occasion—the copper had been in the warehouse five or six weeks—I have looked at these pieces produced—upon my oath, I believe them to have formed part of the bulk that was 55lbs. de<lb></lb>ficient.</p>

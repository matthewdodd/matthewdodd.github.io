                  <hi rend="italic">Murden's Defence.</hi> I received the amount in change for a half-sovereign. When I was first taken, the sergeant looked over my money, and it was all correct. I was taken to Wandsworth, and two sergeants and an inspector looked over it for half an hour, and there was no bad money; and on the Friday, when I came up on remand, the policeman produced the money, and there was no bad money there. I was sent for trial, and when I had been locked up three or four hours they came and said, "There is another charge against you." I said, "What?" He said "There is a bad shilling among your good." I said, "Nonsense; why did you not find it out be<lb></lb>fore?" Is it likely? It must have been put in. The Magistrate said, "Very likely you got it where you got change." I said, "I am sure the publican would not give me a bad shilling. I was not with this woman at all, I was with an Irishwoman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Claydon's Defence.</hi> It was a female who was with me, not this man. She asked me to fetch her half a quartern of gin. She pointed to a public-house, and said, "Fetch it in this bottle." I did so, and gave her the change, She asked me to hold the basket and bottle till she came back from selling her tape. I stopped half an hour, and was tired of waiting. I went past the public-house and met the prisoner, who asked me to have a drop of beer. I went in, and they said it was bad. I know the woman, but have not seen her.</p>

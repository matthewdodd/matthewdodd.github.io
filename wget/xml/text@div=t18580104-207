                  </hi>. I am a boot maker, and live in High Street, Woolwich. The prisoner had been working for me for about twelve months—On 31st Dec. my sister told me she came to my shop, and I took her work in; that was about 10 o'clock—I saw her leave the shop—these boots are mine; they have my mark on them—I could not tell whether I had seen them that day, but I believe them to have been in the stock—there were about three dozen altogether, and these are two of them—they are two odd boots—I am sure these had never been sold—after the prisoner had left my shop I received infor<lb></lb>mation, and these were missing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Moore, a pawnbroker, at Woolwich. On the evening of 31st Dec. the prisoner brought these boots to me; she asked me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on them—I saw they were odd ones—I asked her how she came by them—I put them on one side, and sent for a constable—the prisoner waited about ten minutes, and then left—the constable came, and I gave him the boots—I knew the prisoner before.</p>

In consequence of information, I took the prisoner, on 1st Jan., at her house—I said, "Where did you get those two odd bluchers from that you took to Mr. Moore's shop last night?"—she said, "I never was in Mr. Moore's last night; I never had any bluchers"—Isaid, "You must go with me to Mr. Moore's"—I took her there, and they said that she had been there—I was taking her to the prosecutor's, and she said, "I suppose it is Mr. Grinley's?"—I said, "Yes, it is."</p>

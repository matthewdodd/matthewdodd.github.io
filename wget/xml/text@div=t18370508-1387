                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Everill, of Clarence place, Lambeth, a hosier. About four o'clock in the afternoon, on the 13th of April, the prisoner came for a skein of silk—he gave me half-a-crown—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and put the half-crown into the till—there was no other there—I soon after looked at it, and found it bad—I took it out, and put it into my bed-room cupboard—it remained there till the Monday following—I delivered it to the policeman on the Tuesday morning—I did not take it out on Monday—I did not mix it with any other money—I am certain it was the same—on Monday, the 17th, at half-past eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came again for a skein of thread—I served him—he gave me a bad shilling—the policeman passed my shop—I called him, and he took the bad shilling—I had never lost sight of it—on the next morning I gave him the half-crown—I am quite certain the prisoner is the person that came for the silk on the Thursday, and the thread on the Monday.</p>

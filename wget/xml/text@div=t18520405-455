                  </hi>. I am a plate worker, of Swan-yard. In Oct. 1850, I lived in Church-street, near my workshop—Davey was a neighbour of mine seven or eight years, I know her perfectly well—I knew Partridge by name, but had no acquaintance with him—I believe Davey is married, a person lives with her as her husband—in Oct. 1850, she applied to me to know whether I would be security to the St. Martin's-lane Loan Society, for a son of hers, named William Wear, who was living in Poland-street, Oxford-street—I had known him some time, but not much—I believed him to be a respectable young man—I said I would consider of it—in a few days she applied to me</p>

               <p>again, and I consented—the loan was to be 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; she said her son and her were going to have it between them—on 24th Oct. a clerk from the loan office brought me this promissory note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I signed it, this is my writing on it—the clerk took it away—mine was the first signature on it; I saw no one else sign it, and did not see it again—about March or April I heard that the payments were falling in arrear, and I complained to Mrs. Davey two or three times, and I mentioned it to her about five or six months ago; she said she would see the parties from the loan society, and endeavour to go on with the payments—I understood William Ware to be her son, and not the mala prisoner.</p>

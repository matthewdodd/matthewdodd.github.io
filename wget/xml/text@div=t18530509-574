                  </hi>. I am an instep leather manufacturer, and live at No. 4, Point-street, Portsmouth. On Monday, 18th April, I was at Slough, on my way to London—I met the prisoners at a public house at Slough—they asked me if I was going to the big town—I said I was—this was about 10 o'clock in the morning; I had slept at the house the night before—they left the house about an hour before me, and went towards London—I started in the same direction, and overtook them three or four miles from Slough; they were lying down on the side of the road—they got up, and walked with me—I do not know how far we walked together; it was a good many miles—after we had walked some distance, Gibbs asked me if I wanted to purchase a razor—I told him no, as I did not use a razor—he asked me 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—at last I bought it of him for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a pint of beer, which we had when we came to a public house—we stepped there about an hour—in order to pay him I took out my purse—after leaving the public house I continued to walk with them, and just about dusk we arrived at Harmondsworth—we were still on the same road—Gibbs then collared hold of me, and asked me if I saw that bitch (there was a ditch there)—he laid bold of me by the jacket and waistcoat collar, and threw me back in the ditch, and Walker ransacked my pocket—they took six instep leathers, a pocket knife, and a purse, containing a sovereign, three half crowns, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the instep leathers are my own manufacture—I had had my pocket knife a long while—when they had done this, Gibbs said, "I don't want your b—company any more," and be gave me a cut over the head, knocked my hat off, and kicked the crown out—they then walked on, and I stood till I could get some assistance—I watched them part of the way, till they turned the corner, and then I lost them altogether—I met with two policemen, Luckett and Sergeant Beechey, and went in search of the pri-soners—we found them at a public house in bed—their clothes were lying some on the bed, and some by the side of it—I saw them searched by the policemen; they found two instep leathers and a knife, which are my property.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the landlord called for or the waiter. - A. No, I asked the first man for the guinea, he said I should have it in a minute.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the first man say any thing when he gave it to Travers. - A. He said I should bet a guinea as well as him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you consent to bet at all. - A. No, I told him I could not bet, it was not my money; then I sat a little while, and got up, and I said I must go; they insisted on my paying for the porter, I pulled out the notes, and held a five pound Bedford note in my hand, and while I was returning the other notes in my pocket, the prisoner Burke snatched the five pound note out of my hand, I asked him for it, he said he would give it me directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give it you again. - A. No; then the tipsey man went out, he said he would order a crown bowl of punch; the first man and Travers went along with him, and left me and Burke together, I offered to go out, Burke said stop a minute, they will be in directly; I stopped, and then got up and said I will not stop any longer, I must go, then Burke got up and went to the door first and stopped me, he would not let me open the door; I said I will go, he went out of the door and went into Tavistock street, I followed him, I asked him for the note at the corner of Tavistock street; he put his hand in his pocket, took out a bit of paper, and said here is your five pound note, I was going to look at it, he said put it in your pocket, you fool, you will lose it; I was going to read it, then he offered to snatch it from me, I put it in my pocket rather than he should do that, I thought I had got my own note again; I followed him and asked him for the guinea, he said he would give me the guinea as soon as he got change; he went down Tavistock street, and just crossed Caroline street; at the corner of Caroline street in Charlotte street he went into a public house, he called for a pot of porter, I said I could not stop, I wanted my guinea; he said he must call for something to get change, he called for some gin, he drank it, and went out of the house the back way into Caroline Mews, I followed him to the back door, he set off running as fast as he could down Caroline Mews, I ran after him, crying out Stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you catch him. - A. No, he ran down Great Russel street into St. Giles's, he kept all the while before me, I kept crying Stop thief, but nobody stopped him.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. I apprehended Travers on the 20th in Dyot street, St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Burke's Defence. On my going into the Cock public house, Tottenham-court road, there were three or four people in the room, I called for a pint of porter, and sat separate from them, I did not know any of them whatever; in about ten minutes time a tipsey man came in, he said he had been to New-market; the man that was drinking with the prosecutor said he would toss up with him for a pot of porter, if he would call three out of four; they tossed, and the tipsey man lost; the tipsey man then proposed to toss for a guinea a-piece, it was agreed to, I stood up on hearing they were tossing for money, I being a sporting man, and we all bet a guinea apiece, the prosecutor put down a guinea and lost it, we all lost a guinea a-piece; then the tipsey man said he did not mind if he tossed for five pounds, we all put down five pounds a-piece, the prosecutor put his five pound note into this man's hand, he lost it; they then left the room, and the tipsey man threw down a five pound note on the table, saying, there was a five pound note, take it and drink it among you; they left the room, and the prosecutor and I were left together, I took up the five pound note, O, says the prosecutor, I must have that five pound note, I have lost my master's money, I am a going to pay a bill in the city; I took up the note called the five pound note, the said note I had in my hand the whole time; I told him I had no right to give him any of the money back, for I had been losing my money as well as him; we both went to the door, and in the street he insisted on my giving him the money back, he took the five pound note out of my hand, whether good or bad I do not know, he put the said note in his pocket; he says, now all that I want is a guinea, I told him I had no right to give him any money whatever, I wished him to give me part of the five pound note that he had got in his pocket, he replied that he would not; I then left him in the street.</p>

               <p>Travers's Defence. I was going down Tottenham-court road, I went into the Cock public house, I saw the prosecutor and another man at the door talking; the man who was along with the prosecutor said to me, How do you do, I replied you have the advantage of me; he said he was going in to drink, he asked me if I would drink with him, I said with all my heart; I drank with them, Burke came in, a little while after that a man came in intoxicated, he said he had been to Newmarket, and had lost a great many bottles of wine, he would toss for a pot of porter with them; he tossed, he lost, they tossed again, he said he would toss with them for a guinea a-piece, Burke put down a guinea, the prosecutor put down a guinea, they asked me to hold the stakes, with that I took up the money and held it in my hand, the drunken man won every time but once; at the last toss, the prosecutor he said to me, young man let you and I go out, I said no, they tossed again, and the man that was drunk won, the young man the prosecutor got up and said, I am ruined, it is my master's money; the tipsey man went out, and said he would send them a crown bowl of punch; Burke and he went out together, in about two minutes I went out, I knew none of the parties whatever till Burke's name was mentioned, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Burke called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Travers called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

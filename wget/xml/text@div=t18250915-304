The prisoner lodged with me for six weeks; I took him in distress, having known him. On the 27th of July, at six o'clock in the morning, I came down stairs, and found the shop door open - it was fastened the night before. I could not find him in the house. I had seen him go to bed the night before; he usually opened the shutters, which was not done. I missed this property, and found the watch in pawn. I waited at Mr. Laws, West-street, Smithfield, from seven o'clock till half-past five, when the prisoner came in with a bundle. I asked what he had done with the property he had taken - he did not tell me; he had got my hat on, and had left his own behind. I said he was not going out till the officer came; he went backward to the privy for ten minutes, and was just coming out when the officer came, and found on him, a pair of trousers, two aprons in a bundle, and a half handkerchief in his pocket - a duplicate was found in the privy.</p>

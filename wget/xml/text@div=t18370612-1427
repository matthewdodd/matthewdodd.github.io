                  </hi>. I am eight years old, and live at No. 10, Princess-street, Barbican, with my mother, who is now the wife of Edward Dingley, a gold and silver wire-drawer. On the 28th of April my mother gave me some things to take to Mr. Hemmings, No. 6, Artillery-court—I got to Lamb's-passage a little before seven o'clock, and the prisoner came up and asked me what my mother's name was—I said, "Dingley"—she said, "Do you not remember I promised your mother to give you a doll when you were old enough to take care of it?"—I said, "No"—she said, yes she did, and if I would come with her she would give it to me, or would I rather come to-morrow morning at ten o'clock—I said, "I would rather come to-morrow morning at ten o'clock"—she said she would shore me where she lived, and try and get it to-night, if I would come to-mor<lb></lb>row morning—she said her name was Susan Clipsy—she took me to Fins<lb></lb>bury-market, and pointed out where she lived, next to a public-house by Finsbury-market—I had a bundle—she then said she would ask her mo<lb></lb>ther to give her a basket to put her aunt's bundle into; and she would put the doll on the top of it—she then took me to the iron gate, and took the eight pairs of shoes from me; as she was a long time gone, I went to where she said she lived, but could not find her there—I then came home and informed my mother.</p>

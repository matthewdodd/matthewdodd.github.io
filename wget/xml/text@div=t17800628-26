               <p>I am a broker in Holbourn. On the 7th of June I was opposite New Turnstile, near the Vine Tavern, which is about thirty or forty yards from Mr. Boggis's; it was between the hours of six and seven. I saw the prisoner come down the Stile with a large piece of wainscoting, he put it upon the fire and gave a great huzza.</p>
               <p>Where was the fire? - Opposite the Stile in Holbourn. I saw him after that bring wainscoting at two or three times, and pieces of cornices, and put them likewise on the fire.</p>
               <p>Where did he bring this wainscoting from? - I cannot justly ascertain that.</p>

               <p>Do you know from your own knowledge whether that was the house the mob were in and which they were pulling down at the time? - To the best of my knowledge it was, but I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - Yes, I have seen him go by attending executions. I have seen him on the sledge. *</p>

               <p>From what house? - I do not know of my own knowledge. I saw the prisoner there.</p>
               <p>Did you know him? - Yes, I have seen him often and knew him. He was bringing pieces of wainscoting and cornices at several times, which he chucked upon the fire in the middle of the street.</p>
               <p>How long was the prisoner there? - I cannot say. I was there about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner huzz or any thing? - Yes, in my hearing he did.</p>

               <p>Was you at that house in Turnstile on Wednesday evening the 7th of June, or Did you see any thing of the destruction of Mr. Boggis's house? - All I saw of it was a man knocking at the door to get in. He said, If they would not let him in he would knock the door down. Then I went away to work.</p>
               <p>What time was it you saw them knocking at the door? - Between five and six o'clock. I returned again in two hours; the house then was partly pulled down; there were two or three boys in the inside.</p>
               <p>How many people were there about it? - About six or seven; I then saw the prisoner with some wood under his arm and upon his shoulder going towards Holborn; I did not see what he did with it as I did not follow him; he took it from opposite Mr. Boggis's house.</p>
               <p>Was there any other house pulled down besides Boggis's? - Yes; the Ship was attacked; some of it had been pulled down in the morning and some the day before.</p>

               <p>How was it when you returned? - It was torn almost all to pieces; there is a little part of the wainscoting standing, the dining room window was entirely knocked out; all the wood work and glass was beat out, but not the window.</p>

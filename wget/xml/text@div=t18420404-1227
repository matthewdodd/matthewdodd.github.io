                  </hi>. I am the wife of Daniel Heath, a broker, in Gos<lb></lb>well-road. In November last the prisoner came to lodge in two furnished rooms at one house—she said she was the wife of a commercial traveller—she left on the 15th of January, without giving any notice—when she went out in the morning I asked her if she had any of the rent she could let me hare—she said she was going for some, and she would when she returned—I did not see her again till the 1st of March—she took the key of the room away with her—during that time I did not open the door of her room—the was taken into custody on the 13th or 14th of March—after she was taken into custody I went into her room, and missed a sheet worth 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am sure it was in the room when I let it to her—she had no authority from me to sell or pawn it.</p>

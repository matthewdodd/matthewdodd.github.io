On Sunday, the 28th of June, about half-past tea o'clock in the morning, my house was closed—I heard a knock at the door, and on opening it the two prisoners came in—I asked what they wanted—they said they were travellers, and wanted refreshment—I said, "What I" they said, "Half-a-quartern of gin"—they came to the bar and I served them—it came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they gave me half-a-crown—I gave them 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not notice that the half-crown was bad till five minutes after they wcrt gone—I had put it into my pocket—I had no other money there—I then con<lb></lb>cealed it in my bed-room, in a pewter sugar<lb></lb>bason on the sideboard—nobody but my son was in the house at the time they came in—he did not see what I did with the half-crown—it remained in the bason till the following Sunday—I never told anybody of its being in the bason—oo Sunday, the 5th of July, about ten o'clock, the two prisoners again knocked at my side door—I was watching for them, expecting them—I looked through the window, saw they were the same men, and let them in—they asked for half-a-quartern of gin and laid down half-a-crown—I took it up, drew the gin, and said, "This is a bad half-crown; you gave me one, you smashers and coiners, this day week"—they wanted me to give it them back—I kept it, called for a constable, and bolted both my doors—before the constable came the prisoner Brown said he would knock my by head off if I did not give him the bad half-crown, and he would give me a good one for it—I refused—shortly after<lb></lb>wards a constable came in, and he sent for another—when he came I gave the prisoners in charge, and said I had taken another bad half-crown of them that day week—they did not deny having been there—one of them, I do not know which, said, "It was not a bad half-crown I gave you, it was a bad shilling"—I sent my son for the half-crown, and told him where to find it—I give them both to the policemen—they were both marked in my pretence.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 13th of November, I was with the prosecutor and took the prisoner at work, and charged him with this robbery, he said he knew nothing about it. I went to his lodgings in Fitzroy-place, and found two cheeses, two loaves of bread, and a kettle, my brother officer found the bag the cheese was in; we waited till the prisoner's wife came home, and on searching her she begged hard to go backward; I let her go, and after that I went and found the handkerchief down the privy, which I had searched before she came in, and it was not there then; I found seventeen shillings on her.</p>

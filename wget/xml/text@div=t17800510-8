As I was fitting in my compting-house writing, on the 25th of April, a woman came into my shop with a long red cloak on. The compting-house is in the side of the shop, and has a view of every part of the shop except just the door. I turned round to see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100012"></xptr>who it was. She asked for some muslin. I thought she had a suspicious appearance, and therefore came into the shop to watch her. I then saw the prisoner standing in the doorway; I had not seen her before.</p>
               <p>The woman in the red cloak was not the prisoner? - No. When I first saw the prisoner in the shop I saw something white hanging under her cloak.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner been in your shop? - She was standing in the door-way in the shop waiting, to all appearance, for the woman who came to ask for the muslin. She had been in the shop, but had not asked for any thing.</p>
               <p>Was she within reach of the counter? - Yes, she was within reach of the counter. She had a on a black cloak. I saw this piece of muslin under her cloak. I advanced to her and put my hand under that part of the cloak where I saw the muslin. Then I turned her round, and said to my shopman who was with the other woman, be witness that this woman has concealed a piece of muslin under her cloak. He said he saw it. I immediately sent for a constable. She said it was very hard when a person came into the shop that I should put a piece of muslin under her cloak and charge her with a theft; that was all she said.</p>

               <p>You do not know how long she had been in the shop? - I did not see her come in.</p>
               <p>You do not know whether she bought any muslin? - I am sure she did not.</p>
               <p>This is an open shop, where you exposed your goods to sale? - It is.</p>
               <p>This is the piece of muslin you found upon her? - It is; it has my mark upon it. There was about six yards and a half of it.</p>
               <p>Do you know where it lay? - We had been very busy and there was a parcel of muslins lay upon the counter by the side of the prisoner. This piece lay there.</p>
               <p>Is it a whole piece or a remnant? - It is neither, it is a cut piece.</p>
               <p>Did you know that it had been cut before? - Yes; I cut it myself; it is marked in characters, one mark by my man and the other by me: this is my mark.</p>
               <p>What is the meaning of that mark? - The price that it cost.</p>
               <p>How long ago did you mark that? - I marked it in the month of February.</p>
               <p>She submitted to be searched, and did not attempt to run away? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you seen this piece that day? - Yes, that very day.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The gentleman asked me what I wanted; I said a piece of dark cotton. He took me round the waist and pushed me to the counter. He took that piece of muslin and said I had taken it. He said he had been robbed the day before, and if it lay in his power to hang me he would, for he would do it to deter others. And then sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I said I would take every step that the law would afford me; that it was a very serious matter to her, and I would prosecute her.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the value of this piece as it is now? - It cost me nine shillings and sixpence per yard. There are six yards and an half of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I desired to be searched; he would not search me. I lived servant last. I was at home with my friends. I live in the country. I did not think it necessary to have any witnesses to my character, as I was innocent.</p>
               <p>Jury to the Prosecutor. Are you sure that muslin was not sold after you saw it, before you found it upon the prisoner? - I am very certain, because I brought it myself to shew a customer.</p>

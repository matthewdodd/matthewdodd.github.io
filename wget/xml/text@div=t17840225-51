               <p>Here is one dozen of handkerchiefs; going down Ludgate-hill, between three and five in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner standing, I said, what have you got here; she said, nothing; and, upon looking, she had these handkerchiefs; (Produced) I said, where did you get them; she said, she bought them; I said, where; she said, in Cheapside; I asked her what shop; she said, she should not tell me; I said, if you do not I shall take the handkerchiefs and you into custody; she said, if you do, I will swear a robbery against you; after much altercation she went with me a little way up the hill, and I called a coach.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>These are our handkerchiefs, they have our mark, they belong to Mr. Badger.</p>
               <p>- RICHARDSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I only know that we lost this quantity of handkerchiefs, on the 27th of January, they came in the 22d, I have the bill of parcels from Mess. Ashmore, Badger, and Keelings, Cheapside.</p>
               <p>Do you know, of your own knowledge, how many the parcel contained? - No, only by the bill of parcels.</p>
               <p>Had any been sold of that parcel? - None had been sold.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - Because in looking them over we found them all there, we keep a till book, I in general keep it, sometimes Mr. Turner keeps it.</p>
               <p>Does not he sell in your absence? - He did not sell any.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - Because there is none in the book, we missed them the 28th, we missed eleven, we never missed them nor examined them till these handkerchiefs were brought to us by Catchpole, the parcel had been opened, and they were all put at the end of the counter, there were none sold because none were entered in the book.</p>
               <p>What number remained? - I cannot recollect, now all the others were there.</p>
               <p>How many are there? - I cannot recollect, it is here in the bill of parcels, what are there we had, I compared them the 28th, when the others were brought.</p>
               <p>Is that the bill of parcels you examined them by? - No.</p>
               <p>Where is that bill of parcels? - That is destroyed.</p>
               <p>Who destroyed it? - Mr. Badger's people, it was returned there with fourteen handkerchiefs that we did not like, then we had a fresh bill of parcels of the remainder.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250126"></xptr>Were these handkerchiefs stolen before you returned the fourteen or after? - Before.</p>
               <p>Therefore you parted with the original bill of parcels since these handkerchiefs came back? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Badger. What did you do with the bill of parcels that you got back? - I cannot say, I did not receive the handkerchiefs back myself, some people belonging to our house did, but who I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Can you speak to the number you sold to Mr. Turner? - Yes, it was four dozen and ten of that number and mark; and two dozen of that number and mark were returned according to our book.</p>
               <p>How many are there? - There are twelve of them, but they are marked for eleven.</p>
               <p>Court. These are them that you sold to Mr. Turner? - On the 22d, I sold him four dozen and ten, they had this mark and number; as to being the identical handkerchiefs, I cannot say, two dozen of them were returned.</p>
               <p>Court to Richardson. Have you brought your books here? - I have brought the till-book of what we sell in the course of the day.</p>

               <p>But you cannot tell the number that remained? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you examine the goods when they came in? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. If the evidence amounted to this, that a certain number had been sold by Mr. Badger to Mr. Turner, and that all that number remained except these, and that no such parcel appeared to have been sold, that would be evidence to be left to your consideration, but there is no evidence that all the rest remained.</p>
               <p>Jury. You are not sure you ever had such a quantity, you never examined them when they came into your house? - No, not till the 28th.</p>
               <p>Court. We cannot supply the defects of evidence, it is the prosecutor's business to lay evidence before the Court.</p>

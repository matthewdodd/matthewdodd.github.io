The prisoner was in my service - he was employed to receive money for me; he never paid this 5d. or this 1s. 6 1/2d.; he was to account in the evening, or in the morning before business - he left me on Monday, the 25th of February.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long had he lived with you? A. Two years; I allowed him 3d. a bottle on wine, and 1 1/2d in a shilling on beer - this paper is an account of more than a week; but on the 27th of January, he left me, and never accounted to me for what he took - he came back, and I said I would give him a chance, of retrieving himself by his coming back, if he would pay me the money every night, or in the morning; he is in my debt, 19l.; I cannot tell to whom he might sell beer when he took it out - I delivered him beer and liquor to sell; when he came back to me, I allowed him his commission, but it was to be applied to the reduction of the debt he owed me - I received this letter from the prisoner - (read.)</p>
               <p>To Mr. Scott.</p>
               <p>SIR, - I take the earliest opportunity to drop a few lines to you, as a personal interview would most probably lead to an altercation, which I wish to avoid - and as I cannot, consistently with my present circumstances, return to your employ under our present arrangements, therefore if you will take the credit on your own responsibility, I will return again to your service, but to pay daily for the goods I receive from the bar - and to be unavoidably obliged to give credit is more than I am able to do in my present situation; if you do or do not approve of my proposal, if you will send an answer back by the bearer I should feel much obliged - respecting the difference between you and me, I will endeavour to collect the money I have owing to me, and pay you as soon as I possibly can. I remain your humble servant,

               <p>COURT. Q.When did he last account to you? A. On the 23rd of February - if he had then paid me more than he received, I do not know whether he might not have had recourse to this very money to have made it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Upon your oath, do you not know it was his custom to supply the people every day with beer on credit? A. I have no other way of knowing but from him, and I would not believe a word he said; this paper is dated the 24th of February, and it is when I received the money of the 23rd - when he returned, after leaving in January, he owed me 20l.; I treated that as a debt, because he begged I would do so - on the evening of the 24th of February he made an excuse, and did not settle with me; on the morning of the 25th I went into the City, and when I returned he had left - he took every thing belonging to him away, but an old coat and an old pair of trousers; I had nothing to do with the credit - he was to pay me.</p>

             sworn. - Last Saturday, between six and seven o'clock, I was coming down Oxford-street, and saw a butcher coming out of Mr. Eyresls shop, I believe the prisoner at the bar to be the same man, but I cannot be sure; I was standing opposite the door, upon the foot pavement, on the same side of the way, and about a minute after, a man came out, in a blue coat, with a roll of carpeting upon his shoulder; I don't know who that man was; before he had got five yards past the window, he let it fall, I suppose it was rather too heavy for him; then the person that I believe to be the prisoner, looked round and saw the carpet upon the ground, he had got about ten yards before the other man; he turned back, and lifted the carpet upon his shoulder, and told him to go along, and he went along with it, and Johnstone went along with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he follow him or how? - A. He walked along-side of him; a gentleman desired me to knock at the door, and ask Mr. Eyre if they had lost any thing, which I did, and Mr. Eyre immediately went after them.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the prisoner? - A. I cannot swear to him, he was a man very much of his appearance, but he had not the coat on that he has now.</p>

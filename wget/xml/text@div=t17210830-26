Elizabeth Belchier confirm'd the Prosecutor's picking her up and going home with her to her Lodging in the Prisoner's House, where he <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172108300004"></xptr> would have lain with her; but she would not let him, unless he would give her 6 pence first, he said he would give her a Shilling after wards; but she told him that Whores Wages and Hackney Horse Hire were always paid beforehand; so he went away: That as soon as he was gone the Prisoner told her (this Evidence) that they would yet trick him out of his Sword; so they changed their Riding Hoods and went after him, and she (this Evidence) pickt him up and had him into the Alley, and when he had removed his Sword from under her Back, the Prisoner drew it out and ran home with it; kept it there 5 Days, then sold it, and she (this Evidence) had part of the Money. The Prisoner denied the Fact, and said it was a malicious Prosecution, because she had arrested Belchier for Money she owed her, and called the Officer she employed to prove it. The Officer deposed, that he did Arrest Belchier for 5 l. at the Prisoner's Suit; who then swore she would have the Prisoner's Life; and that if swearing one Robbery against her would not be sufficient, she would swear Ten. She also called several to her Reputation. The Jury considering the Matter, <rs id="t17210830-26-verdict140" type="verdictDescription">

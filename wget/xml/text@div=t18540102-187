                  </hi>. I live at No. 30, Wellington-street On a Saturday in Dec., both the prisoners represented to me that there was an omnibus for sale—Gayton told me so, and Chapman was with him—they both spoke to me respecting the omnibus—when we got to the place, both the prisoners looked at the omnibus, and they came and said to me, "It is 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. it can be bought for"—they both came to me as I was standing in the yard—on the faith of that representation I authorized Gayton to pay 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of some money of mine which he had in his possession, he being my servant—the omnibus was afterwards brought to my establishment, and I afterwards paid a further sum into the hand of Chapman—the last payment was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

            . I have known them all for years. We first met between six and seven o'clock in the evening. I generally go out with them on a Sunday evening, but it was by accident that we all met. White and I had been together all the afternoon, at the King's Head and the Wellington, public-houses. We then went to the Duchess of York. White went home to tea, leaving me there. We had a pint of porter each at the King's Head, and a pint of purl between us at the Wellington. I had a pint of beer at the Duchess of York. Thomas came in and drank with me. Nailer came in soon after. White returned, and we all went to the Fox, public-house, about seven o'clock, and had a glass of gin and water between us. We were rather drunk when we left the Fox. It was then about nine o'clock. We then went to the Duke of York, public-house, and had four glasses of gin and water; I do not think we had more. We then came on towards home. It was about ten o'clock. All four left together, and were a little groggy, but knew what we were about, and could walk. When we got to the corner of the <placeName id="t18231203-34-crimeloc184">Duke of York</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18231203-34-crimeloc184" type="placeName" value="Duke of York"></interp>

I thought it was done in a joke, and asked him for it, thinking he might break the glass. He put his hand to one of the others, but which I cannot say, or whether he gave it him. I asked him for them. He took no notice, but walked on. The tobacco dropped out of my pipe; and they shoved me down and took my money from me. We had then got about seventy yards from the Duke of York. I cannot say which of them pushed me down. I was stooping, but did not fall, for they shoved me down, and my money was taken out of my pocket as I laid on my back. They then let me get up. It was dark; there were no lamps. I cannot say who took my money. They used no violence; more than one of them took it, but I cannot say whether all three took it. They were all on the spot. I was not kept down above a minute. I thought it a joke, and followed them on a good way, but made no alarm. I came up to them, and asked for the money. They kept laughing, and said, "All stuff!" I said, it was no use playing their jokes in that manner. I left them in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and went home. They said they should go to Islington. Whether it was a joke or not I cannot say. I said, "You may as well give me my money;" but they went on by the Rosemary Branch without answering me. I passed Thomas on Monday night, in Shoreditch, as I was going to the Office, but did not speak to him. I have not seen White since. I have not got my watch, pin, or money since.</p>

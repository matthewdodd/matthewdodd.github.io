                  </hi>. I work in a brick-field. On Tuesday, 26th Feb., I was at the Forester's Arms, Hammersmith—the prisoner came in—he said some<lb></lb>thing to me about a drunken man who was there—I told the landlord what he said—on the Thursday I met him in the street—he asked me what I had been saying about him—I said I had been saying nothing but the truth, and he up with his fist and hit me—on the Saturday, about half-past twelve o'clock in the day, I was at the Robin Hood with a man named Betts, who went into the tap-room, while I stood at the bar—after he had been there a little while I heard a scuffling—I went to the tap-room door and saw the prisoner take up a poker and strike Betts on the shoulder—Betts rushed to take it from him—we got it from him—we did not strike him—while we were struggling, somebody called out, "He has got a knife in his hand"—when I came from him I felt blood trickling down my left side—until then I was not aware I had been stabbed—I found I was stabbed under the left arm, and had a cut on the right wrist, which I had not felt done—I did not see anything in the prisoner's hand till after he struck me—he then had a knife like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was taken to Mr. Hunter, a surgeon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Shepherd's Bush. Mowbey, and me, and Wright went to the Robin Hood—we found the prisoner there, sitting in front of the fire, with two women—I asked him the reason of his striking Mowbey on Thursday—he said he would strike me, and immediately picked up the poker and struck me with it—he said he would d—d soon knock my head off if I interfered with him—Mowbey came to the door—we both struggled to get the poker from the prisoner, and he stabbed Mowbey under the arm—I then saw a knife in his hand—he stood up in the middle of the room and said if any one touched him he would stab them—Mowbey was taken to a doctor, and the prisoner shut up the knife and put it into his pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 12, Queen's-road, Regent's-park—in Sep<lb></lb>tember of last year, I was engaged by the prisoner as clerk—I believe I was with him five weeks—I saw there besides the prisoner, as Walter Berthold,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186211240075"></xptr>
               <p>a man named Lister—the first fortnight I knew the prisoner under the name of Frederick Teed; afterwards, from some occurrence, he told me his name was Walter Berthold—I know the prisoner's handwriting—all three of the cheques produced are in his handwriting—I left the service because he gave me some instructions which I did not think proper to carry out—the name of Teed, Lister, and Co. was over the door, and Walter Berthold and Co. on a plate—I knew no one besides the prisoner and Lister—I know Lister's handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">letters produced</hi>) these letters are both in his hand<lb></lb>writing—(<hi rend="italic">three others produced</hi>)—two of these were signed by the prisoner, and one by me—the prisoner directed me to sign that one, to order twenty puncheons of whiskey.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Whilst there, did you see any letters come? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not, except two or three which armed there whilst the prisoner was at Sheffield—when I went, the name was up, Teed, Lister, and Co., and Walter Berthold—I have sent letters signed Walter Berthold—I cannot say that they were not in ihe prisoner's handwriting—I have not seen the letters—the signatures were in the prisoner's hand<lb></lb>writing—I did not see any letters in the office signed, "Walter Berthold," in a different handwriting to the prisoner's—he introduced himself to me as Walter Berthold thus; a man called there and asked for Mr. Teed—the prisoner said Teed was not there—I was present at the moment—he also told the man that Teed never came to the office, except once a month—the prisoner knew I was astonished at it—I afterwards went with him to look at some revolvers, and he told me that he had broken off companionship with Teed, and only established the business with Walter Berthold and Lister and he represented himself to me as Walter Berthold—he did not represent he was a partner of Walter Berthold, but he was the principal—I understood from him there was no other person whose name was Walter Berthold—I am positive of that—I never saw any signatures as Walter Berthold, except in the prisoner's handwriting—he did not tell me that Walter Berthold was employed in the hat manufactory at Winchester House—he did not tell me that Walter Berthold had established a business at 26, Park-street, South<lb></lb>wark—the cause of my leaving the prisoner's service, was not that I was en<lb></lb>trusted with money to pay and did not, but that the prisoner went to a friend of mine, Myer Ansell, for some steel pens—he went there as Lister—Ansell agreed to send the pens to the office, and he was to pay on delivery—afterwards the prisoner wanted a month's credit, and Ansell would not agree to it—he then found they were not respectable people, and would not send the goods—the other cause was, the prisoner told me to get a price list from Sheffield for electro-plated goods—the price list was 25 per cent. discount—I told him the price was "nett"—he said they were very cheap, and gave an order for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—I said the price was "nett," but it was 20 dis<lb></lb>count, and on that I left him—I did not believe him to be a respectable man—he never charged me with having money of his to pay away and not doing it—I did not give notice on leaving—I never went for any wages afterwards.</p>

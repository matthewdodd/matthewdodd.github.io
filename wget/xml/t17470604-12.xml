             and I goes and opens the Door, and I desired him to sit in my Vaults, and if any Person came down there, with an Intent to come into my Vaults, he should secure them. He was waiting two Days, and I think on Friday was fortnight, I went down, about 6 o'Clock; the Prisoner at the Bar had open'd my Vault, and this Servant of mine push'd out, and cries out, Whose there? He shuts the Door and puts up the Bar, and pinn'd him in; and comes to me, and cries out, Master! Master! I have catch'd him. I went to see for the Constable; and he will give you an Account that he found him there. He own'd, when he was took, he had been frequently in, and took Cyder from time to time.</p>
               <p>Court. You have not indicted him for breaking your House, but for 20 Dozen of Cyder; there is great reason to suspect him. Did you find with him any of your Bottles, or any of your Cyder?</p>
               <p>Lucas. We found none upon him.</p>

            . Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Roadly. Yes, I catch'd him in the Vaults, one Saturday in May. The Prisoner at the Bar came and open'd the Street Door, about 6 o'Clock in the Morning; all the Time I was watching for them that should come into my Master's Vault; he came and open'd my Master's Door, and came in: When I heard him in, I goes and takes hold of the Door where the Prisoner at the Bar was, and I fastened him in. I heard him rattle among the Bottles, and I ask'd who was there; the Prisoner at the Bar did not answer me; so I clapp'd the Door upon him. Then I said he should stay till such times that he did answer me; so I fastened him in, and went up Stairs.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. I think the Prisoner is Clerk to a Gentlewoman that deals in Coals, that has Vaults by your Master's Vauls. Have you not known, that he and your People have frequently drank Cyder together?</p>
               <p>Roadly. I never saw him before that Time.</p>
               <p>Butler. I am Constable of the Night. I went down with the Prosecutor to his Vault, where we found the Prisoner at the Bar; and he own'd he had drank about a Dozen.</p>
               <p>But the Prisoner. upon his Trial, deny'd the Fact, that he had ever taken any away, but what he had drank, together with the Prosecutor's Servants.</p>

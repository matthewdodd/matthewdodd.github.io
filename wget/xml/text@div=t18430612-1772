                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Mill-wall, Poplar. On Monday night, the 23rd of May, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoner came to the house where I live to ask for a light—I asked my mother for one to give him—he said, "Never mind the light, I want to speak to you for a minute or two"—he called me out, and asked me what I had hit him for the night before—I had not done so—it was my brother-in-law—I told him it was not my fault, and I supposed he wanted to kick up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I asked him what made him come at that time at night—I saw his two hands in his pocket—he pulled his hands out of his pocket, and was going to hit me—I knocked his hands off, and hit him—he then hit me again on the side of my neck—then we hit one another, and I knocked him down—I did not see any<lb></lb>thing in his hand, but felt a knife go into my lip—it cut my mouth—I hal<lb></lb>looed out that he had cut me with a knife—I knocked him down, and took the knife away from him—he tried to get away, but I held him, and gave him up to the policeman—I cannot remember the first time I saw the knife in his hand—it was not before I fell on him—I gave the knife to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the brother of Dennis Driscol, and live in the same house with him. On the Sunday night, about ten o'clock, the prisoner came into the house, and kicked up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—my brother-in-law turned him out—on Monday, the 23rd, they were keeping it up, and he came in about eleven, and stopped there till his mates were going home—he afterwards came back again to the door, and asked my brother for a light—my brother fetched one, and as he came to the door, he said he did not want the light, he wanted to speak to him outside the door a minute, and when he went out the pri<lb></lb>soner knocked him down—my brother had not said anything to him before that—my brother got up and hit him—they hit each other, and knocked one another down—I saw the prisoner put his hand into his pocket, but could not tell what he took out—I did not see any more till my brother got up, all streaming with blood, and said, "Oh, you have stabbed me with a knife, have you?"—he took hold of the prisoner, and took the knife out of his hand—the policeman happened to come along, and he gave him the knife.</p>

               <p>the prisoner was then standing up, and he attempted to run away—I think my father took hold of his shoulder—I did not see him kick him—the pri<lb></lb>soner was down twice—he got up, and was knocked down again—I am quite certain of it—he was not on the ground when he put his hand into his pocket.</p>

On the 23rd, between twelve and one o'clock, I was on duty at Milwall, Poplar, and heard a cry of, "Murder" and "Police"—I went to Carter's-row, where the noise seemed to come from, and saw the prosecutor covered with blood—he said he had been stabbed, gave me this knife, showed me a wound on the side of his neck, and told me to take the prisoner into custody—the prisoner was standing among five or six others who surrounded him—I took him—he said he had his re<lb></lb>venge, and he hoped I should do all I could for him.</p>

Q.</hi> Was Driscol's father one of those round him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not see him doing anything to him—the prisoner had blood on his face and on the front of his shirt—I could not tell whether the blood came from himself—his face was covered with blood, and so was the front of his shirt—his eye was blackened—I did not see any other wounds, nor any cuts in his face—I did not see any other wounds but the blow in the eye—I cau<lb></lb>tioned him, that what he stated to me I should state to the Magistrate, before he said he had had his revenge—I believe he is an Irishman.</p>

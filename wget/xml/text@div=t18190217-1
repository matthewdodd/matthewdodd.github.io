            . On the 29th of December, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I went to show a gentleman a house of mine, in <placeName id="t18190217-1-crimeloc3">Buckingham-place, Fitzroy-square</placeName>

When the light came, I found a key inside; I knocked at the door, very hard, several times. A mob came round, and said somebody was running across the roof; I went through the next house, and found my yard-door open; I then saw my street-door opened, and two boys run out I ran to the door, and cried out Stop thief! Several persons pursued, and Gurney, who was convicted last Session, was brought back - the prisoner came to the watch-house, and was taken. I returned to the house, and found a quantity of lead taken off the roof, from the gutter, by the trap-door - it was fixed; the whole of the gutter was taken away, rolled up, and put on the party-wall; I took it to the watch-house. I afterwards compared it with the gutter, and it fitted exactly. The key had been left with Mrs. Johns, to show the house.</p>

            . I was going up Buckingham-place, and saw several people round the house; I saw two boys run across the roof, told the prosecutor, and he went through the next house into his own; I then saw two boys run out of the house - I pursued, and took one, named Gurney, who was convicted last Session - the prisoner was the other, I am certain of it; he came to the watch-house about five minutes after, and enquired for a boy, named Gurney, who was taken for some lead - the constable searched him, and found a pair of pincers on him.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was at the watch-house, Gurney was given into my custody; after I had locked him up, I went to the watch-house door - there was a number of people standing there; the prisoner came up to me, and asked if there was not a boy brought there for stealing of lead? I saw his hands were very black and wet, as if he had been handling something - I took him in to Gurney, and asked him if he knew him? he hesitated at first, and then said he did. I then said I thought he was concerned with him - he said he knew nothing of the robbery; I searched him - he was very unwilling to be searched. I found a pair of pincers in his coat-pocket, which appeared soiled, as if they had been pulling lead up. I was going to lock him up, when he began crying, and said he would tell me all about it, and that he, Gurney, and another boy, named Johns, went to the house about seven days before, to steal the copper and bells, but found they had been taken away; that they went again on the 29th to steal the lead from the gutters, and used the pincers to draw the nails out - I compared the lead to the place, and it fitted exactly.</p>

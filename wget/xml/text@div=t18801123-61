                  </hi>. I am a fruiterer and greengrocer, of 153, Cleveland Street, Fitzroy Square—I left my place on Monday morning, the 2nd November, at about 7.30—I occupy the first floor—I returned at 2 o'clock on Tuesday morning—when I left home everything was safely locked up in drawers and two cash boxes—there was about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of penny postage-stamps, and a quantity of jewellery, including 16 or 17 rings, 16 or 17 brooches, earrings, and other articles—when I went into my room it was dark, and I fell over my clothes, which were thrown across the room, and the window was open—I went down and called a policeman, who came up; I got a light and found all my property gone; six drawers had been broken open—I found a chisel and a knife on the table—the prisoner had previously worked for me—I went to the station and gave information, and went to Clark's house the next morning, where I saw him and two young women—I said to dark "I was robbed of a double set of harness last night; you were round there last night, do you know anything about them?" he says "No;" I said "Who last was round there?" he said "I don't know;" I said "Yes you do, you were in the fish shop at 12 o'clock, you know;" he said "My brother was round there, and Wiggins and Sadler;" I said "We will go and see Mr. Wiggins, where can we find him?" he said "I don't know, we might find him in the bread shop"—I went there in a cab and found Wiggins and one of my men in the shop—"I looked Wiggins up, and Clark and I went away in the cab to a place in the Theobald's Road, his brother's—his brother was in bed—he says to his brother "Here is Mr. Moore wants to see you"—he woke up and says "What have you brought him here for?" Clark says "I don't know, he wanted to see you, and I brought him here," and I said to his brother "You ought to be ashamed of yourself to do what you have done for me; you turned my place over last night while I was away; I have locked Wiggins up, and he has rounded on you in the station-house; you may as well tell me all about it and where my stuff is, and I won't turn a policeman on you"—I stayed there for a considerable time, and had a cup of tea with them—up came Bullock, and I said "Sadler?" and he said "No"—I said "You turned my place over while I was away last night;" he says "How do you know I did?" I said I had locked Wiggins up, "he has turned round on you and told me you done it, or else how should I</p>

               <p>know where to find you?"—he said "We will take you where your stuff is;" I said "That is all I want"—they took me to a public-house in the Strand—Sadler says "I will go and see if I can see the man"—I said "I will wait here a quarter of an hour"—he went away for half an kour and I followed him—he went to a place in the Strand, and I went to the place, and they said he was not at home—I said I would wait for him, and waited for an hour—I then came back to the same public-house, where I afterwards saw Sadler and Clark—Sadler said Bullock was not in, but he would be back in half an hour or an hour—I waited there for a little while and Bullock came in—they spoke to him quietly, and he came in to me and said "Yon have acted like a man; you don't mean to tell the police; you ought to hate had this stuff back, but it cost me 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., you cannot expect me to be 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out for you;" I said "Certainly not, this stuff belongs to my relatives, and I value it more than anything; I will give you 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of my own pocket"—I put down 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he took it up and put it in his pocket, and went away for an hour—he said "Who will come for it?" I said "I will;" he said "No, you cannot;" I said "The boy (Clark) will go," and he went away and brought me some stuff back—he turned round and said "You have got 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of stuff there, don't grumble;" I said "All right, I don't grumble, wait till I see it"—he went round to another public-house and <hi rend="italic">sits</hi> down, in the back parlour and opened it and looted at it, and seeing it was not what I wanted, I said to Bullock "I want a large gold watch, a diamond ring set with three diamonds, and a nugget pin and another nag set with three emeralds"—he said "You cannot have them unless I have another 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" I said "I am not going to be made a fool of and be messed about by you, I shall turn a policeman on you;" and I jumped into a cab and gave information to the police—I saw Bullock again when I was jumping out of a cab the game night at 12 o'clock—I went back to the public-house the same night; when I get outside the public-house I saw Bullock and two or three often in a cab; he jumped out of one sitter, and the sergeant laid hold of him and brought him into the public—Clark came in and said "Do not do anything wrong; here is your stuff," and he pulled out my watch and diamond ring—Bullock was taken to the station and dark was let off—I kept him in my employ for a few days—I told him he had better have some supper and go home, and see me to morrow morning—he came, and he was taken into custody—I did not give him into custody—I should never hare got this stolen property except for him—I do not believe he had anything to do with it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi>). I went on the 2nd November to the prosecutor's house, 153, Cleveland Street, and from inquiries I made I Went to a public-house in Castle Street with the prosecutor and Sergeant Salmon, where I saw Bullock in company with three other men in a cab—one of them was Sadler—two of them jumped out and ran away—I asked Bullock to get out of the cab, and as soon as he got out the prosecutor said, "I give him into custody for stealing my jewellery; I gave you 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get this back; now you see I have turned <hi rend="italic">copper</hi>"—Bullock went into the public-house before I got hold of him, and there I saw dark—he attempted to hand the prosecutor this gold watch and diamond ring—I took mem from him and said, "Where did you got this from?"—he said, "From a strange man in the street"—I then took him to the Tottenham Court Road Police-station—I searched him and found five contract notes, a diamond ring, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, some coppers, and a Bank of Engraving note on him—he said nothing in answer to the charge—I have since tried to find Sadler, but have not been able—Clark was taken to the police-station at that time, but not charged—subsequently the case was handed over to the Public Prosecutor, and I received certain directions, and I took Clark in custody outside the Green Man in Euston Road—I told him I should take him into custody</p>

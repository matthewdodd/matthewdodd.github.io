               <p>When Mr. Cocks's coachman made application to you for the great coat, did Taylor shew any reluctance in going to the office with you? - He behaved as well as a man could do.</p>
               <p>Answer the question fairly and candidly, did he go voluntarily? - He did.</p>
               <p>And he told the same story at Bow-street, he had told you? - Yes.</p>

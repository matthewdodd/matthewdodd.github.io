I had missed old timber several times. On Wednesday the 8th of January instant, I went and watched, and saw the prisoner, with two pieces on his back, about ten feet long. A girl at a public house said to him, that is Mr. Travell's wood, he will soon be after you. The prisoner went down Red-lion-street with it. I followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. In what street are the old houses you are pulling down?</p>
               <p>Travell. They were in <placeName id="t17660116-31-crimeloc194">East-street</placeName>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176601160031"></xptr>Q. How near was you to him?</p>
               <p>Travell. I was within about six yards of him. I ran but could not catch him. I went and took the timber up. and in about ten minutes time, the prisoner came back again to the same place.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was this?</p>
               <p>Travell. This was after 9 o'clock. He walked backwards and forwards several times, and at last I went and took him standing near the King's Head.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the same man you had seen with your timber on his shoulder ?</p>
               <p>Travell. I am sure he is.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a light or dark night?</p>
               <p>Travell. It was a star-light night, very light. Then I took him in to the King's Head, and told him, if he would confess who was concerned with him, I would be favourable to him. He would not. I took him to the watch-house: there was another man came to appear for him, who desired I would be favourable to him.</p>

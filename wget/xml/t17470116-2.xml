She then said, they were pushed into her Apron; he replied, no, I believe they were drawn in; so he sent for the Constable, she fell upon her Knees, and begged for Forgiveness, and said it was the first Fact. <rs id="t17470116-2-verdict9" type="verdictDescription">

             . Do you know the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Riston . I only remember seeing her in the Shop. On the <rs id="t17470116-2-cd12" type="crimeDate">25th of August</rs>

She said she sold a pretty many, but what she sold was in Gentlemens Families; she said her Sister kept a Shop the Bottom of St Martin's-Lane, she said if we used her well, she would be a very good Customer. She desired I would bring the Silk Handkerchiefs the next Day to her Sister's House, and if I could get her the same of them Silk Handkerchiefs, she would have a Piece. I said to the Boy, Has not this Woman stole something. I do not like her leaning over so. I asked for the Chints Lawn, so we missed it. The next Day I said I would take the two Handkerchiefs to the Place where she said her Sister lived; I went, and asked the Gentlewoman if her Sister was within, so she said she did not know what I meant; then I went back and told my Brother, that I thought it was a Bite.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first Time that you heard of this Chints?</p>
               <p>Riston. The 27th of December last, Mr Wilson heard that we had lost a Chints Gown, and there was that and all Sorts of Linnen-drapery Goods at her Lodgings; there was the Piece of Chints Lawn, I know the Piece perfectly well, there is my own Hand-writing on it, I gave a Description, as marked with a red Pencil, before I saw it.</p>

               <p>- Bilby . The Prisoner lodged in Park street with me, Mr Kenton and she was there together as Man and Wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they Man and Wife?</p>
               <p>Bilby . That I cannot tell, she went by the Name of his Wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid the Rent?</p>
               <p>Bilby. Mr Kenton.</p>
               <p>Q. Who claimed a Property in the Goods that were found in Mr Kenton's Room?</p>
               <p>Bilby. After Kenton found his Wife was taken up, he then said he was not married to her, he acknowledged before the Justice she was not his Wife, and that he had no Right to the Things, that they were not his .</p>
               <p>The Prisoner at the Bar claimed the Goods in the Room as her Property, before she was convicted: accordingly the Key was delivered to her as a Person that had the Property of those Goods, some of which Goods, besides the Chints, was claimed in Court by others.

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Mills, stay-maker, of Holywell-street. On the 9th of September I was sent to Smith's for 15 lbs. of cane, and had two half-crowns given me to pay for it - I saw the prisoner, and told him I wanted 15 lbs. of cane; he went up stairs, fetched an armfull down, and weighed it in the scale - I did not notice what weight was in the scale; he did not tell me the weight, or what I was to pay, but I paid him the two half-crowns; the cane was in long sticks, tied up in two strings - I took it to my master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your master here? A. No; I do not know the weight, nor whether I got more or less than I asked for - I am sure there was more than half the quantity, because I was fetched down next day and asked about it; I had taken the came up stairs - there was no more in the house, as we had used it all up the day before; there was not a stick uncut - four other persons were in the room I placed it in.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You are sure there was more than 7 1/2 lbs.? A. Yes, I am certain - I paid 5s. for it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was any body near enough to see what you paid for it? A. There was a man near enough, but whether he was looking that way I cannot tell; I have seen him about the Court - master never complained that he received less than he paid for; it was not weighed after I brought it home - it was taken from the persons word whether it was weight or not.</p>

            , JUN. I am clerk to Mr. Smith - it was the prisoner's duty to account to me for money he received for sales, and to me alone; on the 9th of September, about twenty minutes to nine o'clock in the morning, he accounted to me for 7 1/2 lbs. of cane, sold to Mills, and gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160059"></xptr>me half a crown - we had began business about seven; I have been in Mr. Smith's service five years - cane is about six feet long; about forty canes would average 15 lbs. - the difference between 7 1/2 lbs. and 15 lbs. would be quite visible; it was sold after half-past eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He accounted to you almost immediately after? A. Yes - I was not present when it was weighed; I saw the prisoner searched about four hours after the transaction, but he had been out - one shilling and a halfpenny were found on him; his lodgings were searched about eight hours after, but none of our property found there.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Could any person, used to cane, be deceived in the appearance between 7 1/2 lbs. and 15 lbs.? A. Not if they were used to it; very few stay-makers use cane.</p>

            , SEN. I am in Mr. Smith's employ - the prisoner never accounted to me for the sale of this cane; it was not his business to account to me - he may have done so at times, when my son has been out; Mills occasionally dealt with us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not your son swear he accounted to him alone? A. He did; he has accounted to me when my son was out of the way, and there were others to whom he might occasionally account - I was not present when this cane was weighed; there is a wide difference in the appearance of 7 1/2 lbs. and 15 lbs. - some cane is stouter than others.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I can only say I am innocent.</p>

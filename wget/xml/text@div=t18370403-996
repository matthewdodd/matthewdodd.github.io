                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty on the 16th of March, about a quarter before ten o'clock, in Petticoat-lane, and saw the prisoner Jones with this coat hanging on his arm—I went to him, and from hit appearance and the goodness of the coat, I thought he had stolen it—I asked him where he was going with it—he said he was an omnibus conductor—I asked where he got the coat from—he said he had had it two years, that he gave 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it to a Jew, in Long-acre—I asked him where he lived—he said on Tower-hill, but refused to give me the name of the street or the number, and I took him to the station-house—he resisted, and I had a very hard turtle with him in the street—he tried to get away—it was rather dirty weather, and the coat was splashed at if it had been worn.</p>

He did try to get from me—there had been a coat stolen the morning before, and I thought this might be it—he said he would go to the man who had lost the coat, and give it to him if he had lost it, and in going along he ran away.</p>

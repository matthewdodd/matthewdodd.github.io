             depos'd, That he lodged at Mr. Read's Mug-house for some Time past; and being asked to give account what their Demeanor usually was when the Company which used the House met together, he answered, That he never knew the Society give any Provocation or Affront to any Person, except that once they turned a Man out of the House for hissing at the Duke of Marlborough's Health: And being asked, whether they ever drank Confusion to any Persons, or to any Sort or Order of Men; he answer'd That he never heard any Confusion drank but once, and that since the last Sessions, they drank Confusion to the Ottoman Attempts against Prince Eugene and the Empire, or to that Effect. He further depos'd, That the Friday-Night before the Day mentioned in the Indictment, a Mob gathered about the Mug-house, whereupon some Gentlemen sent to a Mug-house in Tavistock-Street to some of their Friends, who immediately came and disperst the Mob; so that no Harm was done that Night, only a few Panes of Grass were broke. That upon Monday the 23d of July, in the Evening, a Mob began to gather in the Street when the Society was assembled; that one Overs, a Constable, came to the Door with some Watchmen, and drew up in a Rink before the Door, and then the Mob began to increase very fast, and hiss'd the Gentlemen as they went in and out; whereupon the Witness went out and ask'd them what they hiss'd at, but they threw Stones at him and at the Windows. That some Time after one Johnson, another Constable, came with more Watchmen, but they did not endeavour to disperse the Mob, but encouraged them, and they continued to throw Stones at the House whilst the Constables stood by. That he being in the Coffee-Room, a Stone was thrown out of the Street into the Room, which hit him upon the Leg; whereupon he went out to the Constables, and told them, he wondred they would suffer Stones to be thrown into the House by the Mob when they had Power enough to disperse them; but they answer'd, that the People in the House threw the Stones from above and broke their own Windows; which was impossible for them to do, for the Window shutters above were fast shut, so that no Stone could be thrown out. That Mrs. Read offer'd the Watchmen a Quart of strong Ale to drink the King's Health, but the Constables would not suffer them. That Mr. Hucks offered them a Crown to drink the Kings's Health, but the Constables refused it; and he having given it to one of the Watchmen, the Constable made him return it. That all this while the Mob continued throwing Stones at the House and Windows, so that was scarce a whole Pane left below Stairs; whereupon one Badcock, a Constable, who was in the House, went out and read the Proclamation, and the Mob all the while hiss'd at him. That very soon after the Proclamation was read the Constables and Watchmen went away, and the Mob went away at the same time: And being ask'd what made the Mob go away with the Constables and Watch; he said, he believ'd they did not care to stay after the Constables were gone, for that they were more afraid of the Gentlemen in the House than of the Constables. That the next Morning about Six a Clock the mob began to gather again, and threw Stones at the Windows; upon which he went out to persuade them to be quiet and to do no more Mischief, but he received two Blows on his Head by Stones, one of which gave him a great Swelling in his Forehead, and the other cut him on the side of his Head, and made him bleed very much.</p>
               <p>That thereupon he went into the house and brought out a Stick and drove them a little way, but struck no body but the Man who hit him with the Stone.

That Mr. Read and the Grenadier presented their Pieces 3 or 4 Minutes, and bid them stand off and have a care; but they pressing on, Mr. Read and the Grenadier fir'd , and Vaughan fell. That the Mob coming on still with great Fury, the Witness and another Man consulted together to make a Barricade upon the Stairs, by which Means the upper part of the House was preserved till such time as the Mob were disperst by the Guards: But that below Stairs the Windows and sashes were all broke to pieces, the Bar and the Cupboard, and the Post to which the Coffee-Mill was fixt , were broke down, and also the Benches and Wainscoat, and it look'd just like a House that was pulling down; and all the Goods were broke to pieces and destroy'd.</p>

That a Constable and some Watchmen came to the House, and afterwards another Constable and Watchman, but they fir'd rathet to encrease the Mob;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171610100002"></xptr> upon which he went out and bid the Mob be quiet and go away, or it should be worse for them. But the Constable took their part, and said the Windows were broke by the People in the House, and bid the Witness go away from the Door; and said the House ought to be pull'd down to the Ground. That the next Morning the Mob gathered again, and threw Dirt and Stones at the Windows; and a Woman came up with two Brickbats and broke the Windows with one of them; upon which he bid her be gone; but she threw another, crying out High Church and Ormond, Damn all the Hanoverians, Down with the Presbyterians. That thereupon he took hold of her, and was bringing her into the House; but one Delander a Watchmaker made several Strokes at the Witness, and he was knock'd down by some among the Mob; and the Woman was rescu'd from him. That he getting up again pursued Delander towards the Water-side, and took him, and brought him into the Mug-house; but the Mob increasing, and he having told his Name and where he liv'd, was let go.

That when he came out again the two Constables who had been there the Night before seized him and carried him to another House, and told him they would have the satisfaction to see him Hang'd ; but he told them he had the satisfaction to know he should not be Hang'd that Day.

             depos'd, That on Monday Night he going by the End of Salisbury-Court in Fleetstreet, saw a great Mob in the Court, and was told they were going to pull down the Mug-house; and going up to the House, he saw two Constables and several Watchmen in the Street before the House, who encouraged the Mob, for that he was sure they were able to have dispers'd them, if they had a Mind to it. That Stones were brought in Baskets to the Mob, some of 7 or 8 Pound Weight, and laid down just by the Constables and Watchmen who suffered the Mob to throw them at the House. That when the Constables and Watchmen went off the Mob presently after run away, apprehending (as he believed) more Danger from the Gentlemen in the House whom they had abused, than from the Constables. That the next Morning he went there again, he saw a great Mob breaking the Windows and Goods of the House to pieces; and heard them say, Just thus will we pull King George from his Crown, which is none of his own.</p>

             mention'd many of the Particulars of the Riot, both on Monday Night and Tuesday Morning, to the same Effect with the former Witnesses. That after the Mob had beat the Grenadier and the others with him back to the Mug house, he saw a Man bring out two Bottles and carry'd them over against the Swan Ale house, where he and several others drank the Pretender's Health by the Name of King James the Third, and were answered with Huzza's by the People at the Swan Windows.</p>
               <p>Mr. Carleton Smith deposed, That he was sent by my Lord Mayor to Salisbury-Court on the Tuesday Morning, to see what was doing there. That when he came there, he found the Crowd so great that he could not get in at the End of the Court in Fleetstreet; so he went thro' St. Brides Passage, and saw two Parties engaging and 
               <persName id="t17161010-1-person43">
                  Daniel 
                  Vaughan 
               <interp inst="t17161010-1-person43" type="surname" value="Vaughan"></interp>

             deceased at the Head of the Mob. That as the Witness was getting into the said St. Brides Passage to save himself, Vaughan was shot; and fell just by him. That presently he heard a great Noise,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171610100003"></xptr> and rashing of Boards breaking in the House. And then he thought high time to go and inform my Lord Mayor what was doing. That the Prisoner was brought before my Lord Mayor that Day, and committed by his Lordship. And that the Prisoner had then a Patch upon his Nose.</p>
               <p>Mr. Badcock depos'd, That being informed on Monday Night, that there was a Design to pull down the Mug-house, and being a Constable, he was desired to go thither to keep the Peace, which he accordingly did. That he found a great Mob about the House, and a Constable and some Watchmen before the Door. That the Mob stung Stones at the House, whereupon he went out to the Constable, and desired him to keep the Peace and to disperse the Mob; but he answered, that there was no Disturbance but what was made by the People in the House, and that his Hour (10 a Clock) was not come. That the Mob continuing to throw Stones , he went out again, and found Johnson (another Constable) there, and about 20 Watchmen. And the Witness told him, he wondred he would suffer the People to throw Stones so, and to insult the House; acquainting him that he himself was a Constable, and offering to assist him in dispersing the Mob. But Johnson answer'd him, that he (the Witness) was no Constable of the Night, nor of that Ward, and had nothing to do there, and that there were no Stones thrown but what were thrown out of the House, which was impossible , for the Shutters were fast shut, so that nothing could be thrown out at the Windows. And then one of the Watchmen took hold of the Witness, and would have pulled him out of the House. That afterwards he went up Stairs, and often came to the Stair-head to hearken whether the Noise encreased or not. And after some time finding it very great, he came down, and ventured into the Street, and read the Proclamation; and during the time he was reading it, the Mob threw Stones and Dirt so thick, that he was forced to turn his Back to them for fear of receiving Mischief from them. That presently after reading the Proclamation, the Constables, and Watchmen, and the Mob went away almost at the same time.</p>

             deposed, That he saw the Prisoner among the Mob on the Monday Morning; That he had a black Patch upon his Nose; That after the Proclamation was read, he saw the Prisoner advance towards the Mug-house with a Stick in his Hand. That he saw him afterwards chopping the Frame of the Window with something like a Butcher's Cleaver. That during all the time of the Mob, the general Cry among them was, High Church and Ormond, No Hannoverians, No King George, Down with the Mug-house.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner in his Defence said, he did not join with the Mob, but was coming through the Court accidentally in his Way from Dinner out of Shoe-Lane to his Place of Work; and denied his being in Read's House: Then he called abundance of Witnesses, who were all heard,</p>
               <p>The First swore he gave the Prisoner the Blow on the Face which occasioned the Patch.</p>
               <p>The Second, that he put the Patch upon his Nose.</p>
               <p>The Third, that he dined at her House in Shoe-Lane with the Patch upon his Nose; and went away about One a-Clock.</p>

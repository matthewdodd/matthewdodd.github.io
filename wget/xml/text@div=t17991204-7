             sworn. - I live in Martin's-lane, Cannon-street: On Friday evening last, I was taking tea at Garraway's coffee-house about half past seven; I took off my great coat and put it at the back of my seat; there was a public sale at Garraway's that night, and just as the sale was announced to begin, I observed my coat slide away; I thought somebody was taking it in a joke; I thought no more about the coat; when I got up into the sale-room, I saw a person putting on a great coat, I saw it was mine; I told him, I believed he had got my coat; he said, no; it was, I told him; I believed he had taken it from the coffee-room, and I should lead him down; he immediately cried out for mercy; he said, he was in great distress, and hoped I would not expose him; I I took him down stairs, and Mr. Howell, the master of Garraway's sent for a constable; I asked him, who he was, and he refused; he said, he was of a very good family, and he would not expose them; I could not get his name that night, although I felt disposed to let him go if he would; he was taken to the Compter, the coat remained in the bar till I took it away in the evening to my own house; I examined the coat, and found my gloves and my handkerchief in the pocket.</p>

             sworn. - I am constable and patrole; I was sent for to Garraway's coffee-house I took charge of the prisoner; in the office the prisoner confessed to taking the coat, and begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I expected the benefit of Counsel, I am very inadequate myself, I never was in a court before; all I can say, my Lord, is, I met a Mr. Barry, and I submitted that very question to my Counsel last night, whether until I could find out this Mr. Barry, it would not be necessary for me to put off the trial; he sent word this morning for it to go on; Mr. Barry was an old shipmate of mine, he was a lieutenant on board the Crescent frigate in the last war, I met him about four in the evening; I told him my situation was not the most pleasant; he desired me to meet him, and we made an appointment to meet at Garraway's coffee-house, where I never was, but once in my life before that, some year ago; I went there precisely at six, I stopped in the coffee-room from six till very near seven; I never knew it was a sale-room, but not seeing my friend, and seeing all these gentlemen leaving the coffee-room, I waited till the best part went up, and then I went up, thinking my friend might be there; in going up the stairs, at the bottom of the stairs, there was this coat; I took the coat up in my hand, went through the whole room, where I suppose there were one hundred persons, but saw nothing of my friend; I had the coat in my hand holding it up to the light to look at it, when that gentleman came up; I told him how I had got it, and that I was bringing it down with an intention to give it to the waiter; I have no more to add my Lord, I must submit to the Court.</p>

               <p>Mr. Rodwell. He was in the act of putting the coat on when I came up to him.</p>

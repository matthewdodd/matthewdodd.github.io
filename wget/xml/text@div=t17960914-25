               <p>Q. Be so good as look at that bill, and see if that is one of the bills you delivered to him? - A. It is; I did not see him again till he was in custody about a month after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever bring the bills to account to your office? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the amount of the whole? - A. About 1200l. they have none of them been recovered from that time to this.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner's hand-writing? - A. Perfectly well; I have had many opportunities of seeing him write.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the receipt the back of that note, is that his hand-writing? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that letter, and the promissory note annexed to it, do you believe that to be his handwriting? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at that, (shewing him another letter?) - A. This is his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when that letter was received? - A. The Monday morning about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he send any money with it? - A. No money whatever; he enclosed a promissory note for the three bills he had received.</p>

               <p>Q. I understand it was contrary to his orders, he had no authority to receive money for any bills? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If it is tendered, is not he bound to receive it? - A. He is not.</p>
               <p>Q. If it is tendered, do you never receive it? - A. Never; I would make an observation when I said never; young men, when they first come into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140082"></xptr>the office, not knowing the business, may have received money.</p>
               <p>Q. The general rule of the business is the contrary? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. None of these bills to your knowledge have been forth coming? - A. None of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Your masters, as Notary Publics, are bound to make good these bills? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time were the two letters received? - A. I cannot say; it might be a week, or it might be a fortnight; I cannot charge my recollection.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You are a fellow clerk in the same office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to tell us, that having been fifteen years in the office it is not the custom to receive the money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they not put into your hands to obtain payment? - A. It is generally supposed so; but the particular reason is, to know the reason of its not having been paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the whole use of a Notary Public is to obtain a sum for presenting them? - A. A Young man may take the money if he is intimidated.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never received bills that you have offered? - A. I cannot charge my memory whether I have or not; it is so long since I have carried out bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you often done it? - A. I have not often done it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you received money on bills? - A. It is probable I may; I don't know that I ever did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. By intimidated you mean they offer to pay the bill, and refuse to pay the fee? - A. That may be the case.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. There are eleven bills, of which he gives no account? - A. There are.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. Q. You speak to this bill that has been produced, and undertake to say it is one of the bills you gave him; had you received them the same day? - A. There are two; I undertake to speak to both.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you venture to speak to these bills from recollection? - A. No; from seeing the bills themselves, and some marks upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you undertake to swear these bills went through your hands, and you gave them to the prisoner? - A. Yes; I can speak to them from the bills themselves, as well as from the books.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear from your recollection alone without the books? - A. I can from seeing the bills; I could not without; there is the private mark of our book on the bills.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You have copies of all the bills mentioned in the indictment? - A. I have them in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. See whether the mark of the book is on that bill? - A. It is. (The first letter read.)</p>
               <p>Messrs. Atkinson and Robson, 16th of May.</p>
               <p>Sir,</p>
               <p>I have been swindled out of the bills on the West-walk, Saturday last; I received the following bills, 20l. 2s. 6d. on noting on Watts and Gibbs; 12l. 12s. on J. Collings; and 10l. 10s. 6d. on Mr. Lukyn. I beg you will not distress my mother by enquires after me, for the is in too much trouble already from my bad conduct.</p>
               <p>"Your obliged humble servant, J. Gilbert."</p>
               <p>The enclosed is a promissory note for the notes I have received, which, when in my power, I will make up, and you must act as your own good sense will lead you.(The other letter from the prisoner, in consequence of his having been advertised, read).</p>
               <p>"Sir,</p>
               <p>"Advertisement is not the method to recover the bills, and puts me to perpetual shame; I never attempted, or intended to negociate them; you can have no idea of the state of my mind, verging on despair; but I am determined, if I am taken, which is very improbable, not to give up the bills which I have obtained by a stratagem from those who defrauded me of them; there is but one mode to obtain them, upon the following terms: pay to

               <p>Q. What is the custom of your business respecting notes? - A. The first instruction is, you are to bring this bill, or note, back, and take no consideration for it, but bring it back as you receive it; that is invariably the rule, else I would not continue in the profession; we return them the next morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you are liable at present to account for near 9001.? - A. I cannot say that; some were accommodation paper, others are demanded, and I am threatened with actions at this moment.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the advertisement inserted? - A. The Thursday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you advertise him again? - A. The first advertisement was for obtaining the property.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the advertisement (shewing it him) you caused to be inserted? - A.

            , the publican, the very same day you gave me these bills? - A. Yes, most clearly.</p>
               <p>Q. And you received that money, and gave a receipt for it in the name of your employers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are a fellow clerk of mine? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had no warrant of attorney for that purpose? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why might not I have received it as well as you, you being a fellow clerk -</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came you to receive that? - A. It was from a publican in Bond-street. For the accommodation of both parties the bills were left at our office; we sent them out in the evening to the Notaries, and the same direction as with other bills not to receive them at that time.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was that single bill received by you, under specific directions respecting that bill alone, or are all bills received in the same way at your house? - A. When they go out of the office for the purpose; this bill was never out of the office.</p>
               <p>Court. Q This bill was left for the purpose of your receiving it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you never received any other bills? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. And have not other clerks received other bills? - A. During the length of my clerkship I may have received bills when I have been sent out for them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Bills sent for the purpose of being received? - A. They were not sent for the purpose of being received.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. One or two you may have received? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. But the directions you gave with them were the contrary? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I conceive I had as much right to receive a bill as Withers my fellow clerk; when I received these bills, the money was presented to me; one bill, a taylor, Collins, took the bill from me forcibly; I told him I had no orders to receive it; he told me, whether I had or not he would take it; and I was obliged to go about other business, and I thought I might receive others as well as that, It was not that I intended to convert it to my own use, but it was a temptation subsequent to that. I chearfully submit to my sate whatever it may be; or I shall be very willing to serve his Majesty abroad.</p>

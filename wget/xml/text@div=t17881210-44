            ; I was one; as we were coming by Northumberland-house, there were two women and the prisoner; there were a great many people: I had on my head some prints; I happened to come between these two women, and the bundle that was on my head happened to touch one of the women over the head; the prisoner at the bar made no more to do, he laid hold of the bundle, and pulled it off my head; he struck at me, I struck at him again, which blow I missed; then he struck at me again, and knocked me down to the ground; I got up again; I could hardly recover myself from the blow I received; for when I was down, he kicked me in the eye; I said to the people, how can you see a man knocked down in this manner, and not take a boy's part; I said, says I, d - n me, lend me a stick, and I will knock him down; then he ran after my fellow-apprentice; and a boy said, that woman has run away with your goods; and I ran to several places after her, but never heard of the goods afterwards; I had hold of the goods, when he pulled them; I had not much power to hold them as they were on my head.</p>
               <p>Did he pull them away clean from you? - I felt him pull them off.</p>
               <p>When you struck at him again, you neither of you had the bundle? - No.</p>
               <p>What time was it? - I believe, to the best of my knowledge, it was about six in the evening, or rather after; there were a great number of people passing by.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's council. Was it on the Northumberland side of the way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The shops were not shut up? there was light enough? - Yes.</p>
               <p>No great chance of a man's getting away? - No.</p>
               <p>Those two women were women of the town? - They seemed to be so.</p>
               <p>You and your fellow-apprentice were a little witty with them? - Yes; I said d - n you, stand out of the way.</p>
               <p>You said d - n you, you b - h, stand out of the way? - I did not say b - h; the bundle was gone before any blows were struck.</p>
               <p>When he had licked you, then he wanted to lick your fellow-apprentice? - Yes; as I lay on the ground my fellow-apprentice struck at him.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Mr. Dorrington? - I never saw him, to the best of my knowledge, till I came to Mr. Hyde's.</p>
               <p>Dorington is the sweeper at Mr. Hyde's? - I do not know, I heard him say he belonged to Justice Hyde.</p>
               <p>He advised this prosecution, I believe, and was to have three guineas? - I never heard he was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100029"></xptr>What are you to pay him? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Has not he preferred these two indictments? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether there is any reward in case this man should be convicted of a highway robbery? - I heard say there was, but I said I did not want any thing.</p>
               <p>Then you heard it was twice forty pound if you could but find him guilty? - I heard there was forty pound among four.</p>
               <p>What four? - The two that took him; they belong to one Mr. Smith, an ivory turner, and me and my fellow-apprentice.</p>
               <p>Is not Dorrington the fourth? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Who was this judge that told you about the reward? - It was Mr. Whitfield.</p>
               <p>What judge is he? - That was at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Then this man never meddled with you till you told the women to stand out of the way? - No.</p>
               <p>And then he licked you both? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How much is the grave-digger to have? - I did not hear.</p>
               <p>Court. When you ran after the woman, did you come back again? - Yes; to see if I could see my fellow-prentice any where, and two women told me the man was in the watch-house; I went there, and then to my master.</p>

               <p>I am the fellow-apprentice of the last witness; we usually go round to the customers for linens; we went down to Westminster about half after six; coming by Charing-cross, we saw two women and the prisoner; the other witness had the load on his head; he went between the two women; the bundle touched one of them over the head; the man caught at the bundle, and pulled it off; he turned round to save the bundle, and the man knocked him down, and kicked him on the ground; I went to assist him, and the man struck at me; I ran away from him, and he ran after me; and caught hold of my handkerchief, and almost throttled me, and tore my shirt; he was taken into custody by one Smith, and he threw something on the ground; I do not know what became of the bundle; it was lost.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner touch the bundle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see him pull it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When he was pulling at the bundle, did not you think it was necessary to take some care of it? - I did not see what became of the bundle at all.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing said by your fellow-apprentice? - I did not hear him say any thing at all.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing? - No; he pulled the bundle off his head, and he struck at him, and the prisoner struck at him again; I did not hear the prisoner say any thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There was plenty of room for your fellow-prentice to pass between the women? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Of course he said nothing to them, not they to him? - No; I am quite sure I heard nothing pass.</p>
               <p>If he had said d - n you, get out of the way, to the women, you would have heard that perhaps? - I did not hear any thing.</p>
               <p>How much of the reward are you to have? - I have not heard any thing about a reward.</p>
               <p>You was not at the office with your fellow-apprentice? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Do you know a person of the name of Whitfield? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear Whitfield say that there was a reward of forty pound to be divided among four of you? - I did hear something of forty pound penalty; I did not know any thing of any reward I was to have; I understood that it was forty pound penalty if we did not appear.</p>
               <p>Did not he say, there was forty pound to be divided between four of you? - I have heard talk of forty pound reward.</p>
               <p>Why did you tell me just now that you knew of no reward? - I had heard of it.</p>
               <p>Who advised you to prefer an indictment<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100030"></xptr>for a highway robbery? - They said, at the office, that it was a street robbery.</p>
               <p>Who said so, Dorrington? - I have not seen him; he only sent us to Hicks's-hall, and gave instructions for the hill.</p>
               <p>How much is Dorrington to have, if you convict this man? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you know he is to have three guineas? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know what the goods were that he had on his head? - There were two whole pieces of callico, one was ell wide, and the other yard wide, and there were other quantities.</p>
               <p>What colour? - The yard wide one was a dark pattern, and the other a lightish pattern.</p>

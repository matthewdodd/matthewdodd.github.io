I am the widow of Mr. Samuel Rigg—I live at 5, St. James's-terrace, Notting-hill—my husband died in September, 1858, leaving a will appointing Dr. Gourley executor and two others, James Horton and William Parnell, and I was named executrix—the will gave me a life interest in the property, and at my death it was to be divided amongst different persons—the other gentlemen renounced the probate and Dr. Gourley disliked to act at that time—he afterwards accepted the trust, and he and myself proved the will—we have acted as executors under the will—before my husband's death the defendant had attended us professionally—at the time of my husband's death we had in the bank of Messrs.

Mr. Watson said he should not do anything to-day, but we suspect he will issue an execution on Monday; he mentioned that you had advertised a meeting for Wednesday next. The costs of the reference, and Mr. Loxton's fees, 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., cannot be enforced for some time, in fact not till November; but, in the mean time, Mr. Watson can tax the costs, and prepare to make you pay some in November, which will add 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the expenses. We ought to add that Mr. Watson is under no positive undertaking or binding legal promise to wait till Monday for the 103<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but as it was clearly understood between us, and he promised not to issue execution to-day, we do not for an instant believe that you will be annoyed with an execution before Monday.—Yours truly, Miller and Horne."—"The University of Edinburgh, August, 1860.

Bryan, Esq., Dacre-street, Westminster.—My Dear Sir—I had some reason for withdrawing the amount of the enclosed cheque, which I shall be much obliged to you to have the goodness to send to your bankers and obtain cash for it, until I send for your cheque for it, which may be in a few days; or to request you to pay it into my bankers—should you require a hundred or two of it don't hesitate to use it.—I am, my dear sir, yours truly, <hi rend="smallCaps">D.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Museum-street. On the 29th of March a silver watch was pawned with me by Thompson, in company with another female, who I believe was the prisoner - it was pawned in the name of Fitzmorris, in which name Thompson had been in the habit of pawning.</p>

            . My husband is a labourer, and I sell things in the street. I met the prisoner in the street last Monday fortnight, and took her with me to the pawnbroker's, where I was then going; we there pawned the watch, and the prisoner bought a shawl, which is here - I gave the duplicate to her.</p>
               <p>MR. CRUSH. This is the shawl I sold; the watch was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050118"></xptr>taken out on the Wednesday, and has not been found - these are the duplicates of it; it was a silver watch, jewelled; the maker's name was Wilks.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN CORNISH. My watch was No. 535; the maker's name was Wilks - here is the bill of it.</p>

             (a prisoner.) On the Monday morning in question I went with the prisoner down the Broadway; we met the prosecutor, and went and had some half-and-half; he offered her 1s. to go home with her - we went home; she and the prosecutor went up stairs - when she came away from him, in about an hour and a half, she showed me a silver watch; she opened it, and I saw two fives and a three; I cannot read much, but I can tell figures - the figures on this paper (looking at one) are 1831; I saw the prisoner go down the court with a man and Thompson.</p>

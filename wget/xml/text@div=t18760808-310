                  </hi>. I live at 24, Ashley Place—I have been an officer in the Army—on Thursday morning, 22nd June, about 2 o'clock, I was walking down Grosvenor Place—I had proceeded as far as the Co<lb></lb>operative Stores, a man had been walking near me all down the street—I turned into a place to make water, when the man came up and accosted me—he continued to follow me—I got as far as Rochester Buildings when the prisoner came up from the same direction—I had come down an alley—it was a small alley where I had turned down—there was a gate there, and the first man said "If you will come inside this gate and give us all the money you have got, you can go"—he opened the gate with a key—I gave them the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that I had, and then they demanded a set of shirt links that I had, which I gave them—they then asked if I had any. more money or anything in my pockets, and I gave them a knife and a key and two or three cards, which was all I had—the prisoner kept on asking for money and threatened to call the police—he did not say what for; he said "If you don't give me the money I will call the police"—this went on for some time until the door was opened from without by a boy—I seized the oppor<lb></lb>tunity and struck the prisoner as hard as I could in the eye with my fist and ran out—the prisoner followed me some way down the alley, and I said to him "If you will come in the morning to Victoria Station I will give</p>

               <p>you a sovereign for the links—I said that to get rid of him—I went to Victoria Station the next morning and saw both of them—I said "Have you brought the links?"—they said "No," but the prisoner said "If you will give me a sovereign and the other man 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. we will bring them at 6 o'clock to night"—the prisoner spoke; he took the lead—I went again at 6 o'clock to the same spot—the prisoner then demanded 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "You can't have the links under 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "I will give you 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to<lb></lb>morrow morning at 10 o'clock"—at 9 o'clock next morning I communicated with the police and went with a detective to keep the appointment—I found the prisoner there alone and gave him into custody—I have since seen and identified my links.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have left the army about four years—I resigned on a pension; I was in the Artillery—I was coming from my Club on this occasion—I was perfectly sober—I saw no police in the street when I was first accosted by this man, nor afterwards—I think Rochester Buildings are small lodging houses, with a court-yard—there was quite light enough for me to see the persons who were speaking to me—I was very much alarmed—I am certain that I struck the prisoner; he has the mark on his eye now—I had never seen him before—I was with him two or three minutes at Victoria Station next morning—the other man was the first I saw, and he went and fetched the prisoner, and then the prisoner took the lead in the conversation—I gave 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the prisoner, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the other—I saw the prisoner alone next morning—there was nothing in his manner to in<lb></lb>dicate that he was <hi rend="italic">soft</hi>—the detective was about 200 yards behind me—he came up in about three minutes—9 o'clock that morning was the first time I made any communication to the police.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When the first man came up to me, he said "What are you going to give me?"—I said "What do mean?"—he said "If you don't give me all the money you have in your pocket I shall accuse you of an unnatural crime"—I said nothing to that, I was very much frightened and walked on, and he followed me, and then the prisoner came up.</p>

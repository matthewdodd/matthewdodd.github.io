            . I am shopman to Mr. Thomas Lingham. I was in a room at the end of the shop - I heard the shop-door open very gently, at the same time an errand boy, who was chopping wood up stairs, gave me some information. I went into the shop, but did not miss any thing. I stood at the end of the counter for seven or eight minutes, but no one came in. A person then stared into the shop, and I thought he was coming in. I went out at a back door, and up a passage - I saw the prisoner go into the shop. I looked through the side-window, and saw him walk up to a row of shelves, behind the counter - I did not see him take any thing, but he came out soon after, with this piece of kerseymere before him - I took hold of him, and took him back to the shop.</p>

I was at work in my shop, she saw me both going and coming. She opened my room door. I got off from my work, and asked her what business she had to open the door. She said she wanted one Durant, a harpsichord maker. I said you have been up stairs, I suppose with no good design. A woman that was washing for a lodger, came down and said to the prisoner, I know you to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175606030006"></xptr> be a thief and a whore; I saw you whip'd up St. Martin's Lane. Said I, I must search you; but did not, and let her go. My wife was in bed where the spoon was taken from; she got up and missed the spoon, then I suspected the prisoner had taken it. Then I went about to some pawnbrokers to enquire for it; and after that it was brought to Mr. Fell, who stopt it, and sent me word, and I went and found it there.</p>

He then said that he had it of a shoemaker named Glover, and he had it of one Durant. I secured him. After that Glover's wife came and told me Durant was taken, that is, the prisoner. I went to Mr. Fielding's where Glover and Durant were; they were sent to the Round-House, Mr. Welch not being there. When Mr. Welch came Durant was committed, and Glover was set at liberty, but since he ran away. There is one

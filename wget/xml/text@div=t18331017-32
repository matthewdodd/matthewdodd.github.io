            . I am in the service of Mrs. Goulding. I went with Ballard the officer to the prisoner's lodgings, where we found these six pieces of music; they had all been published at our shop, and this one had been only published a few days - I lost this or one like it; we sell it for 6s.; 1 value it at 1s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you any means of knowing how many of this you had sold but by your books? A. No; the books are not here- I cannot tell whether this one had been sold, but we lost one of them.</p>

            . I went to the prisoner's lodgings on the 7th of September; I found this music there - I went and took him at his master's in Bond-street; I asked if he had any music at his lodgings; he said yes, but he did not know the name of it - I asked if he would know it if he saw it; he said, "Yes" - I then showed him this piece, and asked where he got it; he said, "I took it off the counter at Goulding's."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say it was by mistake? A. It might be at that moment that he said so - I cannot say it was not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pensioner at Greenwich-hospital—the prisoner was also a pensioner there. I missed my shoes on the 25th or 26th of May, in the morning—I had put them close to my bedside the night before with two handkerchiefs and a pad, which hung over a nob at the foot of my bed—I missed them when I got up about five or six o'clock in the morning—the prisoner does not belong to our ward, he slept over our ward, but he could have come down into it.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 26th of May, about two or three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner in the chalk-ward where there are some lockers—I saw him go to No. 49 locker, take something out, and put un<lb></lb>der his coat, and look about, and then go away—in consequence of suspicion I had, I called the firemen, and we went to the locker, and saw two pairs of shoes, and two handkerchiefs, and a pad in it.</p>

On the 26th of May I was at the Nelson public-house, Deptford, between three and four o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon—the prisoner came there and offered a pair of shoes for sale to several persons, who declined buying them—he came to me—I refused to buy them, but he followed me out of the house, and I gave him a shilling for them.</p>

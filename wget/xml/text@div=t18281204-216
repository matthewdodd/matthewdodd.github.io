               <p>AMELIA WOODROFFE. I live at No. 17, Denmark-court, Strand. On the 26th of November, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I had been to the English Opera-house; I went, also, to Drury-lane Theatre - I was coming back to the English Opera-house again, and, as I came out of Drury-lane Theatre, I saw the prisoner, in <placeName id="t18281204-216-crimeloc1149">Bridges-street</placeName>

That was the first time I saw him; I said, "I don't know," and then the one in the white fustian jacket said to the prisoner, "It is of no use, it is a duffer's watch" - (I had had no conversation with the woman and the man; she had left me on the Friday, and this was Monday) the prisoner said, "Never mind, we will have it;" I then crossed over Russell-street, towards Bow-street, to get from them - the prisoner then came up and said, "What is it o'clock?" I made him no answer - this was in Bow-street; both of them had followed me - I did not see my servant again; I went into Bow-street - the prisoner came up to me again, pulled my cloak aside, and took the watch in his hand, but it was supported by two watch-books and a tape; it hung it my belt - he turned it round; the other man was ten or fifteen yards from him at that time - that man gave a whistle, I think with his fingers in his mouth, by the sound, and the prisoner caught hold of the watch; I called Watch! the watchman came up and took the watch out of his hand; I still retained possession of it - the books still held it to my belt; he said to the watchman, "It is of no use taking me - it is only a duffer's watch;" the watchman laid hold of it at that time - he asked the watch-house-keeper to allow him to speak to me; he then gave me a desperate blow, and knocked me down in the watch-house - I had a desperate black eye; the Magistrate would not believe he had knocked me down, but he said himself that he had; he said, "Will you appear against me to-morrow?" I said Yes, and he gave me a desperate blow; I never saw him before, till I saw him talking to my servant, nor had I seen the man in the fustian jacket before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How many names have you? A. Clara Fisher is the name I go by, because I do not wish to disgrace my parents, by going by my right name; I was living with Mrs. Belasco - she keeps a brothel in Denmark-court; my servant's name is

             - she was living with the prisoner at that time - she is no rival of mine, for I had never seen the prisoner before, she was servant to Belasco; one or two ladies live there - I occupy the first-floor, and another lady the other; there are dress lodgers and lodgers in ordinary - I was a lodger in ordinary; the watch was my own - I gave twenty guineas for it, and that woman knew it; I had had it between twelve and eighteen months - I have been at Belasco's nearly two years; Mrs. Belasco was not with me when this happened - one of the books which fastened my watch is lost, and the other broken; the prisoner followed me for about a quarter of an hour - the watch was not to be seen until the man came up, and took me round the waist; I crossed over to Bow-street to find somebody to get hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any difficulty in getting the watch if he was disposed? A.Decidedly; because I held the seals, and pulled the watch, or he could have got it - I pulled the stone out of one of the seals with holding it; I will take my oath it was in his hand when the watchman came up; Ward told the Magistrate that it belonged to Belasco.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040105"></xptr>prosecutrix call Watch! I was a few yards off - I came up; the prisoner, and a good many more stood in the street - I suppose five or ten stood together; the prisoner said "Watchman, it is of no value, it is only a duffer, not worth 5s. - I don't call it any thing to be given in charge for;" I asked if she insisted on the charge - she said Yes; she charged him with attempting to take her watch, and breaking the guard from her side; I took him to the watch-house, and he there hit her on the bridge of her nose, and knocked her down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. About what o'clock was this? A. After twelve; I sprung my rattle when I got him in charge - there were two of them together; one wore a fustian coat; she said he was one, and so I sprung my rattle - I have not had the watch; she had hold of the seals, and he said to me, taking hold of the watch,"Watchman, it is only duffer:" I will not swear whether he had hold of it when I came up - I saw it in his hand, but did not see him take hold of it; I now know where Belasco lives - I have been there for Woodroffe three times: I did not know her before this: she has kept the watch herself - the Magistrate ordered it to be given to her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What does duffer mean? A. I asked him what he meant; he said it had no works in it; I never knew Belasco's house before this happened - it is not in my parish.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I hope you will put the watchman on his oath whether he thinks this is spite or not - it is nothing else; I have known the woman ever so long, but lately have not spoken to her; and seeing me talking to Ward, she and Belasco took and followed me, took hold of me, looked me in the face, and let me go; I said to Ward, "These young women are following us;" they came and stood round us; the watchman came by - she said, "I give charge of this young man:" he said, "What for? I won't take him unless you say the charge," and she said, "He has attempted to take my watch:" I have known her these nine months.</p>

            . I lived at Belasco's four months; it is a house of ill-same - there was a dress lodger there besides the prosecutrix; I was in Belasco's service, not in hers; this happened on the Tuesday after the Friday on which I left; I met the prisoner in Brydges-street - he stopped and spoke to me; he walked on - I stopped to tie my patten; she and Mrs. Belasco came out of Mother H.' oyster shop - I heard her say to Mrs. Belasco, "Here he is, so help me God I will;" (I have often heard her mention the prisoner's name, and say she would send him out of the country if it laid in her power) the other young woman said, "No, don't Clara:" she said," I will;" she gave Mrs. Belasco her muff, opened her cloak, then took a brass watch which she wears, and gave it to Mrs. Belasco, who took off her gold watch, and gave it to her; and, before they could get to Bow-street, Mrs. Belasco stopped and took hold of this young man by the collar, and then let him go again; Mrs. Belasco and Clara then ran round him and began a quarrel with him for the space of five minutes; she called the watchman, and insisted on his taking charge, and when he was taking him to the watch-house Mr. Belasco went up to him, and said, "Let him go:" the watchman said he must do his duty - I did not go into the watch-house, for Mr. Belasco heard me say I would speak for him, and he wanted to give charge of me; I went away, but went before the Magistrate the next day, and stated what I have here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had there been any quarrel between Fisher and the prisoner? A. Not that I know of; they never associated together or cohabited; I cannot say why she wished to send him out of the country, for I never heard - she meant transportation no doubt; I saw her change the watch, and then she charged him with attempting to take it - she never had a gold watch in her possession before; she was only trusted with the brass one - I suppose she was ashamed to swear a robbery against him for the brass watch; he did not attempt to take it from her - he was never near her; they followed him - she gave him in charge at the end of Bow-street, she followed him all that way, and then called the watchman; I was behind her at the time.</p>

            . I live in Portland-town, Regent's-park. I am attending here on another case: while standing among the people yonder, my attention was attracted by some conversation between the watchman and prosecutrix: I heard her reprimand him for keeping company with the prisoner's friends over the way, or at least out of doors, and at the same time she gave him 3s.; I can be positive there were three sixpences, and I thought it was a crown, but am certain of 4s. 6d., at the same time saying, "If you want drink, here is money to get it, but till the trial comes on keep yourself sober?" there was something so particular about the admonition, I thought it right to mention it.</p>

I produce the deposition of Samuel Groome, deceased—I was present when they were taken—the prisoner was present, and had. an opportunity of cross-examining the deceased and he did so. <hi rend="italic">Read, dated Great Northern Hospital, 5th November. Samuel Groome says:</hi>"On October 17th, I went home to bed, the prisoner came in afterwards and took hold of my trowsers to take some money, and began to hit me on the head and private parts, and blew the light out. I could not see if she hit me with any instrument, and I bled—I was in bed and it was after I got out that she struck me. The prisoner has threatened me before: <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. When she came in I was in bed. I did not get out of bed with a broom to strike her. Some halfpence dropped out of my trowsers when she took hold of them. I did not use a rake to strike her; I did not knock her teeth out; I had had a quarrel with her in the course of the day."</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the Great Northern Hospital—on 17th October, a little before midnight the deceased was ad<lb></lb>mitted—I examined him and found a large lacerated wound of the scrotum—it was not deep, but the skin was torn deeply—there was a large flap of the skin hanging down by a piece—it was torn right off from the purse, but not completely separated—it might have been done by an instrument like the rake produced—considerable violence must have been used—he got in flammation of the lungs, and died on 9th November—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found the brain and membranes of the heart healthy—the cause of death was inflammation of the lungs—that would have been ac<lb></lb>celerated by the wounds he received—an old man with such wounds has to lie in bed a long time, and that in old people often causes a low state of inflammation of the lungs—in my opinion death was accelerated by the wound, and inflammation was the result of the weak state into which he, was brought by that wound.</p>

I told him I should be done early and be home early. I was at the street door when he came in. I said "How late you are." He went upstairs and got into bed. I went up into the back room and poured out a cup of tea. I went to pour myself out a cup of tea and then went into the front room and took up his trousers, and five penny pieces fell out of his trousers. I said "Is that all?" At that he was wild and got up and sat on the bed and beat me with the broom. I struck him with the rake. The teeth part was turned towards his stomach."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in her defence, stated that he knocked her teeth out and knocked her down at the least provocation and was very cruel in his passion, that he was stronger than her, and that she tried to lock him in, and the acci<lb></lb>dent happened with the rake, but she did not know there had been an accident; that when he went downstairs she went and bolted herself in the closet, and a man afterwards said he had gone to the hospital; that she found the rake on the landing, and that she was all over bruises</hi>.</p>

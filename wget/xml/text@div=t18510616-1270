                  </hi>. The prisoner was in my employ about six weeks, to cast cement chimney-pots. About 24th April, I missed this chimney-pot mould—the prisoner was about to leave me at the time—I might have seen it safe about a fortnight before—he had been using it to cast chimney-pots—I had two of these moulds—they were kept in the shop where the prisoner worked—I have examined this mould—I am positive it is mine—I did not speak to the prisoner about it when I missed it—I left in<lb></lb>structions</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185106160016"></xptr>
               <p>—I did not see him when he fetched his tools away—I had pre<lb></lb>viously missed four bolts or screws belonging to the chimney-pot which he had in use—he denied knowing anything about them—I afterwards found them secreted—he kept his tools in that shop, but they were outside the shop when he was about to take them away—I did not see him go away—he went in the morning before I came—he did not work every day latterly; he came backwards and forwards as he pleased—his work was piece-work—I saw my mould at Messrs. Dikes and Wingall's nearly three weeks afterwards—in consequence of what Mr. Dike said, I went to the police, and had the pri<lb></lb>soner apprehended—I had two moulds—the prisoner provided one—he came to me for the express purpose of making some large pots, but one mould not being sufficient to keep him employed I desired him to make another.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Am I to understand that he never made any demand for wages? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He made a demand on the Saturday night, if you please, but I would not give him any—he did not make a demand for any sum; he wanted wages for what he had done that week—I have never paid him anything for what he did that week—he came again on the Monday; I refused to give him his wages then—I do not know that he threatened to summon me; he was very abusive—he has not summoned me—he did not come to me on Tuesday: he came and fetched his tools—I did not hear that he had again demanded his wages; he could ask no one but me, and I was not there—I do not recollect that Staines told me that he came for his wages, he told me he had been and taken his tools away—I will not swear that he did not say he had come again for his wages; he might have said so—I did not see him on Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday—I have not heard of his coming—I met him in the street afterwards, but he did not speak to me, nor I to him—I never heard of his going to the Rochester-row Police-court about me—I do not know that I told Mr. Dike that I owed the prisoner money, but I would not pay him—I might have told him so—I did not pay him, because his work was not finished—I did not tell Mr. Dike that I owed him money, but would not pay him—I will swear I never made use of such words—he had done about three days work that week—I might have told Mr. Dike I owed him the three days' wages—I will swear, as far as my memory serves me, that I never said to Mr. Dike, or any one else, that I would not pay him—he did three days' work that week, and did not do the work properly, and I would not pay him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Wingall, a builder—the prisoner first came to work for me about 8th or 9th April—he began to cast chimney-pots about 1st April—he told me he should bring some moulds—I cannot say when he brought them, but they were there in the week that he began work—they were his own, as far as I know—he said he was at work</p>

               <p>for Mr. Mitchell, and he could come and fill the moulds for me, and go to Mr. Mitchell's and fill his—there were three small moulds; I did not take particular notice of them—some time afterwards there was a large one there—he worked for me about five weeks—he left the moulds at my place; some of them are there now—Mr. Mitchell came to my place and claimed one of them: I believe this is it—the prisoner came to me the following week, and said be had taken a place to do work on his own account—he asked me if I would purchase a mould; I said I did not want one, but I would let him have a little money, and he could come and work it out—I advanced him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but not with an intention of keeping the mould—it was one of the moulds that the prisoner left that the prosecutor claims.</p>

                  </hi>. I applied to the prisoner at Mr. Mitchell's request, and asked him where the mould was that was in the shed when he went to work; he said he knew nothing about it—this mould is Mr. Mitchell's; I have known it two or three years, by moving it from place to place, and by the bolts.</p>

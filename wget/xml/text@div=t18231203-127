            . I am a salesman, and live in Broad-street, St. Giles's. On the 7th of September, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I was called down, and found the prisoner in my shop; he produced three books for sale; I asked if they were his - he said Yes; that he bought one at Cheltenham for 12 s. I asked him the titles of them - he gave rather an incorrect account. I asked if there was anybody near who I could send to, to say they were his - he said his mother lived at Bayswater. I told him to go behind the counter, while I sent for an officer; he behaved in a most violent manner - got to the door three times, and seized the books. Several<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030052"></xptr>bad characters were round the shop. I took him out, and met Bartlett, who took him.</p>

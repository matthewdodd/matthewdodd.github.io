                  </hi>. I am in the Coldstream Guards. The prisoner belonged to the same regiment and the same company, but I had very little to do with him—on the 11th of October he was discharged from the Cold<lb></lb>stream Guards—I was aware he was discharged that day—on the evening of that day I went with him to the Three Horse Shoes, at Hamp<lb></lb>stead, in company with a man named Burkhill, who had also been discharged, and his brother, Richard Smith—there were two more soldiers when we rot to the public-house, and the deceased, James Chaplin, was sitting with them—in the course of the evening the prisoner went and fetched half a gallon of beer, and gave it away to some people in the house, while the reckoning was going on—when the reckoning was called for, there was a dispute about paying it—Burkhill got up, and said, "I shall be half a crown, George Smith, what will you be?"—the prisoner said, I shall be nothing it all—in consequence of that there was a dispute and a fight between the prisoner and me—in the scuffle I fell down by the fire-place on my knees, and Chaplin jumped over the table, and struck the prisoner—Burkhill got up, and got hold of Chaplin and pulled him on the settle, and parted them—we sat down together after that, all of us, and were drinking again comfortably—the Smiths staid there about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I heard no further dispute between the prisoner and Chaplin before they left—in about a quarter of an hour George Smith got up and went out, and the other one followed him—I staid a good while myself—think Chaplin remained there a quarter of an hour after, as near at I can tell—I consider the prisoner was very much advanced in liquor, more so than the other, but I cannot say he was drunk—when I went out of the house, Chaplin was not so bad in liquor as the others.</p>

I am groom to Mr. Longman, of Hampstead, On Wednesday night, the 11th of October, about ten o'clock, I was in the mews, in Church-lane, and James Chaplin came down the mews to inquire for a man who helps me in the stable, but the man was not there—I wished him to go to the man's lodging in Golding-square, Hampstead—I know the Field-place in Church-lane—it was not necessary for Chaplin to cross the Field-place to go to Golding-square—he appeared to be sober—a few minutes after he left me I heard a noise in the lane—I heard a scuffle and a voice or two, but could not distinguish one word—I went to the top of the mews, and met Chaplin coming out, just by the Field-place, calling out that he was stabbed, that was before he fell—at the same time I heard the steps of men running away—I cannot say who they were—I could see two persons between the trees, making towards the Conduit field—about two minutes before Chaplin came down the mews to ask me about the man—I had seen two soldiers—they were in the mews—they were going down to the bottom of the mews, and I called to them, and told them there was no thoroughfare that way—they turned back again, and both spoke to me, and thanked me for my kindness, and asked me to direct them to St. John's-wood—I told them, and they went out at the top of the mews, and turned the proper way—during the time they were in the mews Chaplin came down—it was before they got out—I did not know either of them—I should be very sorry to say I knew either of them—I assisted in taking Chaplin to Mr. Lord, the surgeon—I stripped him in Mr. Lord's presence, and saw the wound—I saw Chaplin's trowsers also, and there was a mark on them—I undid them, and saw the wound—it was just at the lower part of the belly, on the right-hand side.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an Inspector of the S division of police. I was on duty at the station-house when the prisoner and Richard Smith were brought therein custody—Richard had a belt and bayonet-scabbard on but the prisoner had no belt, nor any side-arms at all—they were both drunk—the prisoner much more so than his brother—I said to the pri<lb></lb>soner, "Where are your side-arms?"—he said, I am discharged—I have been discharged to-day"—Bowes was in the room at the time, and about that time he produced the bayonet, and handed it to me—I examined it and observed there were marks of blood on it, and other marks, as if it, had gone through hands in the struggle, the perspiration of bands being on it—the marks of blood might be made by it being suddenly drawn through the hand, and cutting the hand—I produce the bayonet, and have had it ever since—I desired Richard Smith to take his side-arms off, which he did—he had his belt on with the scabbard, without the bayonet—this is the belt and scabbard, and this is the bayonet—(<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—Richard Smith said it was his bayonet—I observed the prisoner's face and saw blood on it, but whether it came from the mouth or nose I could not say—it was on the left side of his face, between the nose and mouth—I afterwards went to Mr. Lord's surgery, and found James Chaplin lying on the floor—I ordered that he should be removed to the University College Hospital—next day I took the prisoner and Richard Smith to the hospital, and found Chaplin there—there were the house-surgeon and two or three other persons in the room—the moment he sat the prisoner enter the room, he said, "That is the man"—this appeared to be addressed to the house-surgeon, and I asked the house-surgeon, "What did he say, Sir?"—all this was loud enough for the prisoner to bear—the prisoner had then sat himself down on a chair in the room—I was standing by the deceased's bedside, and so was the surgeon—that was about two, or hardly three yards from the prisoner—it was a very small room—there was but one bed in the ward—I do not think the prisoner had sat down at the time the remark was made—but he was sitting down when I spoke to the house-surgeon—in my opinion, he was not more than three yards from the deceased at the time he made the remark—he was in the room and in sight of the deceased—he was near enough to hear what the de<lb></lb>ceased said—I asked the surgeon what he had said—I had heard what he said—the surgeon said, "He said that is the man"—at the same time the deceased motioned with his head towards the prisoner—he motioned when he used the words first, not when the surgeon spoke—I stated what</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the mews at the end of Church-lane on the night this happened—I had been talking to Hayes, the groom, who has been examined—I saw the soldiers come up and inquire their way, and saw them go the way they were directed, and heard them thank Hayes for telling them the way—I saw Chaplin come down the mews towards where Hayes was—he must have seen the two soldiers going out of the mews—they went up to go to St. John's-wood, through the bar—I did not see the deceased follow them—I did not notice his going, but the soldiers had not been gone above two minutes when we heard a noise, and Hayes said, "There is something of a <hi rend="italic">row,</hi> a fight"—Chaplin went in the direction the soldiers had gone—I did not notice whether he turned to the bar or not—I am certain no longer than two minutes elapsed after the soldiers left before I heard the noise—I went up on hearing the noise—when we came up to the top, Chaplin came meeting us, and said, "I am stabbed, I am stabbed"—I had got to the top of the mews then, close to the bar—he was coming down Field's-place, saying, "I am stabbed"—I then went in pursuit of the persons—the witness Bowes went with me—he went on first—I should say he was a dozen yards before me—I was there the whole time that Bowes was, till the men were secured and brought into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Wilton-crescent, Belgrave-square. In consequence of instructions I examined the hands of lie prisoner on Tuesday last—I found the appearance of recent wounds——there were three on the left hand, and one on the right—I have seen many wounds inflicted by military weapons, but have not treated them myself—I should judge the instrument that inflicted those wounds must have been very similar to a bayonet, as the shape of the wounds was nearly triangular—two of the edges were a little excavated, and the third a straight line—they corresponded with the outline of a bayonet</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it possible for such wounds to be inflicted by merely struggling with the edge of this, or having it merely drawn through the hands? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—I could not very well judge of the degree of force with which the instrument must have been applied to the part—I exa<lb></lb>mined the prisoner's back, and it was one uniform bruise—that had been inflicted probably some days before, but I cannot say whether ten days or a fortnight—I should say it was at the same time as the wounds on the bands—I did not see the body of the deceased—I have heard the de<lb></lb>scription of the wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you, or not, form any judgment whether a wound penetrating such an immense depth into the body of the deceased would be the result of a thrust, or of a heavy body falling on the instrument? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not judge without seeing the wound—it would require very great force to inflict such a wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the size of the wound in the prisoner's hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It occupied the front surface of the two joints of the middle finger; and the one in the centre of the right hand might be as large as two-thirds of a sixpence—about the size of a fourpenny-piece—there were three on the left hand and one on the right—two on the left hand, and the one on the right Had the same appearance—they were of a triangular shape, about the circumference of a fourpenny-piece, or rather larger probably—they were punctured wounds—they could not be made with the mere point of a bayonet—it must have penetrated to a certain extent—I should think about two-thirds of an inch—there were two wounds on the middle finger of the left hand, and one on the little finger; arid the other wound was in the palm of the right hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the wound in the palm of the right hand larger or smaller than those on the fingers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Rather larger—the natural formation of the hand and the bone would prevent a thrust penetrating to any great depth—a thrust might be made, and warded off with the hand, without making more penetration—it depends on the degree of resistance it meets with—the bone would be likely to prevent its going very far in. <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES LORD</hi>.

               <p>was brought to my surgery, and I examined the wound—I did not see the trace of any blood—I was struck to see so great an absence of bleeding externally—I did not see the prisoner that evening—if he had blood about his clothes and person, I am of opinion it could not have proceeded from the deceased's wound—it was in the lower part of the abdomen—I was not present at the early part of the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I did not see the body till after the integuments had been removed—the wound proceeded back out at the sacrum—it did not perforate the pelvis—that is, it did not come out at the hip—the wound passed nearly straight backward, rather obliquely inward—I should consider it had penetrated about three or four inches.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I examined the body after death—I should think the instrument had penetrated between eight and ten inches into the body—it was an oblique wound—I should think it must have required very great force indeed to penetrate the body in that part to that extent I should think it would require much greater force than the ordinary thrust or stab of a man scarcely able to stand from the effects of liquor—I hardly think the bayonet would have taken the direction it did if the body of the man had fallen on it—it would require great force to inflict the wound, but I cannot imagine any position in which Chaplin could fall to have caused the instrument to take that direction—it is possible it might be done by the whole weight of his body being thrown on it in the struggle, bat I do not think it probable—I think an ordinary thrust would hardly account for a wound of such depth—it must be given with great force.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the weight of the body of the man having the instrument in his hand, and being unable to sustain himself, would that account for the depth of the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the additional weight of the body might.</p>

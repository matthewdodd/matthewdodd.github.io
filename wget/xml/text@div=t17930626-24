            , he did not see her steal the muslin, he served her with the muslin; shewed them her, and cut off a quarter of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260035"></xptr>a yard; after that she asked to look at some check, which he shewed her; while she was looking at the check one of the evidence that is here, counted the muslins again and he discovered that two pieces were deficient, which he told me; I desired him to take no notice till she had departed; she went out of the shop to the door; I brought her back by force, and when she got to the middle of the shop she dropped the two pieces of muslin; I saw her do it, and I ushered her into the parlour, and sent for an officer; she dropped them from her cloaths, they fell down at her feet in the struggle of going into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other woman near? - Not near, there were others in the shop, she had on a black silk cloak, but whether she dropped them from her cloak or petticoat I cannot exactly say, they were concealed somewhere about her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took them up? - I cannot exactly say; I believe my servant did that will be next called; I have had them in my possession ever since, they have never been out of my possession.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why should he think that I took the muslin any more than the other women that were there.</p>
               <p>Court. Was these women in the shop customers? Did you know them positively? Do you believe that any other woman came in with the prisoner? - No, there was none near her nor at the same counter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have dealt with him this seven years off and on.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have seen her at the shop many times, and her conduct has been very suspicious at times.</p>

               <p>I am an apprentice to Mr. Jubb. I saw the prisoner come into the shop, I had been out shewing some goods, and come home; I found her standing at the window, when I came into the shop I informed my master; he desired me to count the muslins that were in the wrapper; I found nineteen quantities; after she had been in I counted again, and I found there were two short; she chose a particular one, and desired them to cut off a quarter of a yard; while some muslins lay on the counter which she had been looking at, I see her draw something out from the counter while the other man was shewing her the muslins, and removed her gown on one side, and concealed them under her gown, I told my master of it; I then had orders to take no notice of it till she went out; my master desired I would count the muslins over again to see if there were any gone; I made but seventeen pieces of them; when she was gone out we went out after her, and I saw her drop two pieces, I took them up, and gave them to my master; he desired me to go for one of the runners, and then she was committed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why should he think I should take it any more than the other two women that were in the shop? - They were not on the same side of the shop.</p>

I went to this gentleman's shop, I have dealt there about seven years off and on, my husband is ordered out to sea; I am a weaveress by trade; I have got three children, and a young woman that lived next door to me asked me to make her an apron; work being short I went to this shop, and asked for a bit of muslin; so he took down the muslin, here, says he, here is the muslin; and he says to that young man cut her off a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260036"></xptr>quarter of a yard, for which I paid nine-pence, I went then to the other counter, and left two women at the muslin counter; I was coming out, and there were three women in the shop; just coming out there is a horse like standing where there are prints on it; I looks at the prints, and I says, there is a young woman that lives next door to me that wants a piece of cotton at a shilling a week; I was just going out of the shop, and Mr. Jubb came up to me, and said, come back, you have got some muslin; the two women went out of the shop, and they left me there, and they sent for an officer, and charged the officer with me; Mr. Jubb kept the muslin; he has got now also the quarter of a yard that I paid for; I have dealt with the shop for many years, and they always took notice of my children; I have got three of them now; I have those that would give me the best of characters but they did not know of my trial coming on so soon.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses to her character.</p>

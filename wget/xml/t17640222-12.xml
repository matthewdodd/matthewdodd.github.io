            . On the 30th of January the bankrupt came to my house, and said he had information the prisoner had some of his leather, and desired me to go to Mr. Finleson who got a warrant, and we went with a constable to the prisoner's lodgings; there we found, I think, twenty-five pounds weight of inward sole leather, fifteen lasts, (all marked with the bankrupt's name) and fifty pair of soles, ten dozen welts, and other parcels of leather. The prisoner said he bought eighteen pair of them soles at Mr. Marshman's in the Broadway, Westminster, and picked out eighteen pair from the rest. I asked him in what Manner he bought them; he said, by two or three pair at a time, and said the rest were all the bankrupt's property; and that his method was, as he worked for him at his own lodgings, he went and bought worse leather at the leather-cutters, and put them in and kept his master's soles; and his master's clicker brought the lasts to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has Mr. Skene been a bankrupt?</p>
               <p>Edmonds. He has been a bankrupt ever since October last, when he ran away. There were a few shoes out among the workmen, and when they came in the trade was stopt. I believe the prisoner could not have carried on this scene since he was a bankrupt.</p>

            . I was at the searching the prisoner's lodgings. I saw upwards of twenty pounds weight of inward sole leather found, fifteen lasts or upwards in a bag, with the initial letters of the bankrupt's name on each; and I saw found fifty soles, and about ten dozen of Welts. The prisoner told me he bought worser soles, and kept his master's himself, and put in the bad one's in his master's shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Levistone. I am a currier.</p>

               <p>Levistone. I have heard so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Finleson. The prisoner is a creditor to the bankrupt of 21 l. and I do think this prosecution was done in malice.</p>

               <p>Q. How many pair of shoes might you deliver out to him in a week?</p>
               <p>Skene. About 14 or 15 pair. I delivered out all the Materials. I delivered out lasts, but not those that were found in his house; the lasts that he had were only for the army, but these were customers lasts.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had taken and kept your leather, and put in worse, could you have discovered it?</p>
               <p>Skene. No; not thinking of any fault.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner a creditor under the commission?</p>
               <p>Skene. He is of 21 l. I borrowed money of him at two guineas at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you become a bankrupt?</p>
               <p>Skene. I became a bankrupt in October.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you was likely to become a bankrupt?</p>
               <p>Skene. No; he never pressed me for money, or to give him security for it. (The goods produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Skene. The lasts I know by my name on them; they are mine; and I know the soles to be mine by the cutting; they are my own cutting. The prisoner told me he had sent two parcels of my leather to Scotland that he had got in this manner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I bought two or three dozen pair of welts. There were several journeymen worked in the house I lived in for my master; and when they went away they did not carry home their lasts; they were found in my custody, but I did not bring them there; I bought a number of soles of journeymen who had them to sell, and in leather-cutter shops, and cut it out myself.</p>

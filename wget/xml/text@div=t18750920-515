Compton Terrace, Dalston, and am the wife of Edward Froggatt, a tobacconist—about 6 o'clock on the evening of Tuesday, 7th September, I was walking along Mare Street, Hackney; a man came behind me and pinched my arm very severely, and while I was turning my head to see who was hurting me another man rushed in front of me and seized my chain—I thought my watch was gone, but I</p>

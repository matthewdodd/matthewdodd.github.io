On 9nd Oct., about half past 3 o'clock in the afternoon, Gregg and'Edwards were there, with another man dressed in dark clothes—(<hi rend="italic">Gregg was here brought into Court</hi>)—that is one of the men—I saw him three times the first time he came—I was serving in the tap—people have to pass the tap to go to the staircase—when people came for liquor they faced me—the three men first came to the bar, and had half a quartern of gin—I saw them all distinctly—they left at 4 o'clock, and returned at 6, called for a pint of ale at the counter, and asked me to put the light on in the bagatelle room—I did so, and came down stairs—my room was all safe when they left at 4 o'clock, and the door locked—nobody else had come in in the mean time—there is a window on the stairs, quite near to the bagatelle room—after I bad put the light on, they went up stairs, and a few minutes afterwards Gregg came down and called for a pint of ale at the counter—I served him—the light was full on his face, and I am sure he is the same man—after he had had the ale he went up again, and came down again, a quarter: of an hour afterwards, and went Into the back yard; he then came out of the yard to the counter, and asked me for two Incifers; I gave him the box—while he</p>

I live in Henry-street, Limehouse, near Stepney Church—on a Tuesday night, in October, the same night that I saw a boy named Dyerson, I was in Driver's-buildings, Mile End-road—some man spoke to me, and took me down Driver's-buildings to a dust hole, and put a bundle of things on my head; I then came into the Mile End-road, with the man, where I saw Dyerson—when we got to Charrington's brewery Gregg crossed over from the other side, and said that it was all right, to the man—Gregg said nothing to Dyerson; the man said something to Dyerson, in consequence of which he left; and I and the man went to Shoreditch—Gregg did not go with us—the man gave me tid. at Shoreditch, and took the bundle—Gregg had a cap on—I saw his face; that is the man—it was half past 8 o'clock when I was by the sweetstuff shop in the court, before I carried the bundle—I looked at the clocks-whatever day of the week it was, I only carried a bundle once.</p>

On the 28th of December, between two and three o'clock, in consequence of suspicion, I gave Woodgate, two half-crowns, ten shillings and a sixpence, which were marked, and in the evening, when the till was cleared, my wife brought me home 13s. 6d. of that money; I did not see the prisoner till next night, when I went to the shop with an officer, called him in, and said, "Richard, I want to know what silver you have about you;" he said he had 12s., and produced it on the table, and the 2s. 6d., which I missed out of the marked money was among it; it was marked with a little dot below the neck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. From whom did you receive the prisoner into your service? A. Both my brothers gave him an excellent character; he was nearly four months with me - he rather hesitated at producing the money, before I told him I had missed 2s. the day before - I have another shop, and left this in his care; I do not sleep there, and do not know what money is taken till my wife brings it home to me - I have paid him about 3l. for wages.</p>
               <p>Q. If he wanted 2s. 6d. for a half-crown, he could get it from the till? A. Yes; I had marked 17s., and sent it the next day by Woodgate, but that all came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Woodgate told by the Magistrate, that his conduct at the office was disgraceful and he should not take his oath? A. Yes, he was; I do not know that he was turned out of the office; my brother Daniel became responsible for the prisoner's appearance here - he was in custody two nights, I think - he is not quite sixteen years old - I only employed Woodgate to lay out money on two occasions; if he went oftener it was without my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had some doubt whether the 2s. 6d. was a mistake, and tried again? A. Yes; he had the care of the till; he would not do wrong by taking change out of the till.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 28th of December, at six o'clock in the evening, I took 1l. 6s. 6d. out of the till; there were five half-crowns, and the rest in shillings - I brought it home, and put it on the table, in the presence of my husband and Woodgate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The course of business was for you to go at night to take the contents of the till? A. Yes; the prisoner managed the business there; he was taken up the next night - 13s. of the marked money came home; Woodgate had gone to the shop about three o'clock; if he had given change from the till, or taken change from it for himself, he would not be doing wrong<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060044"></xptr>- he had the very best of characters; there was some little dispute at the office, about Woodgate's deposition -I believe the Magistrate said he was not to be believed.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. There were five half crowns among the money, how many of them were marked? A. Two; there were several shillings not marked - there was not one sixpence in the till.</p>

            . I am headborough of St. Luke's. On the 28th of December I received from Gunston, two half-crowns, ten shillings, and a sixpence, marked; I went to the shop, No. 43, Brick-lane, and purchased goods of the prisoner, which came to 15s. 3 1/2d,; I paid him all the same money which I had received from Gunston; it was about three o'clock: I was present on the evening of the next day, and said to the prisoner, "If you are an innocent lad, show what you have got about you;" he pulled out 12s., and said,"I am a foolish fellow;" I cannot tell what he meant - I recognized two shillings as the money I had paid him, and the sixpence was found afterwards in the till; Gunston thought the boy might have paid it away at first.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Whether he meant that he had changed from the till, or robbed it, you cannot tell? A. No; I do not remember asking him how he came to touch the money in the till - I will not swear I did not; I do not recollect telling the Magistrate he had confessed it, but I will swear nothing about it - he did not refuse to take my oath - he left the case to be indicted at the Session; I did not go to the shop more than once; I took a man, named Davis, to the shop - he laid out 8s.; that was all found in the till - I know nothing about the 17s. - I heard it was sent, and the 17s. were shown to me next day; I saw ten shillings given to Davis - he brought two back.</p>
               <p>Q. Gunston has swore he only tried this twice; once with 15s. 6d., and then 17s.; you saw him give 8s. to Davis? A. No; the money came out of my hands - I got it from Gunston.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the sum you gave Davis? A. I think it was 10s.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Now, was there not a sum of 5s.? A. Yes; that came back right - I gave that to a boy in the neighbourhood; I got it from Gunston.</p>

               <p>MR. PAYNE. Q. Do you know that the 8s. and 5s. went to the prisoner? A. Yes; I saw the <rs id="t18310106-89-deflabel511" type="occupation">boy</rs>

            . I took a pair of silver and a pair of metal buckles out of the prisoner's pocket [ the buckles produced, and deposed to.] The prisoner said she knew nothing how they came into her pocket; she was very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Elizabeth Sands. I am wife to the prosecutor. I had these buckles in my shoes on the 29t h of January, and on the 30th they were gone; the prisoner lodged with some people in our house.</p>

            . The prisoner being destitute of an home I took her in, and have always found her just and honest. I gave her a good character and she said almost three months in her place, but she was too weak for it and was forced to come away, but with a good character. After that Mrs. Sands took her to a bawdy-house, and call'd for a quartern of rum. I believe all this is owing to Mrs. Sands being jealous of her, for Mr. Sands told me he was obliged to prosecute, or he should have no peace; and Mrs. Sands told me with her own mouth, she never found her guilty of any thing amiss.</p>

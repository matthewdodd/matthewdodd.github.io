             sworn. - I am coachman to Mr. Cooper of Southampton-buildings, my master's coach stands at Jockey's-fields: A little after nine o'clock, as I was putting my pole into the carriage, a Hackney-coach came down the mews, and was ordered to turn round, I don't know who ordered it to turn round; and I saw a box put into the coach, it came out of Mr. Lewis's stable-door; I was at my own coach-house, about five or six yards distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Who put the box in? - A. I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any thing put in besides the box? - A. A little white bundle; they got into the coach and ordered the coachman to drive to Great Russel-street, the corner of some place, I don't know where. I said to John Humphreys I would follow the coach on suspicion; there being no light, I followed it on my own coach-box, I drove to the corner of Wooburn-street; when I came up to the coach, Miss Ladbrook's servant had got the box on his shoulder, they went down Wooburn-street, I followed them no further.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner at the bar? - A. I spoke to the prisoner at the bar, and asked him where he lived; he said he belonged to Mr. Lewis of Bedford-row; I told him he would recollect he had got a box out of Mr. Lewis's stable; he said he knew he had; I told him I knew he had, because I saw him lock the door, and put the key in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You told him to recollect he had taken a box out of Mr. Lewis's stable? - A. Yes.</p>

            , Esq. sworn. - Q. You live in Bedford-row? - A. Yes. On the 26th of last month I was out of town, I returned on the Monday morning, and the first information of the transaction I received from Mrs. Lewis; in consequence of that information I was led to think the prisoner at the bar had been in the stable, and I called him up into my room, I had the housekeeper up at the same time, and my own coachman; I asked him if he had been in the stable on the Sunday; he said he had; I asked him who was in company with him; he said, at first, that Mr. Worrel's groom had been with him in the stable; I asked him if Mr. Worrel's groom had a laced hat on, he said, no; I then told him I understood that that person who was in the stable with him had a laced hat on; then he said, it was William, a servant who had just left my place; I asked him what business he had there with William; he said he was assisting him to take his things away out of the stable; I asked him if the things had been under his care; he said, no, but that the coachman had them, and that he was assisting to take them out of the coachman's stable; I asked him, if they were in the coachman's care what business had he to take them away from the coachman's stable; and the coachman, who was present, told me, that the thing which the prisoner had taken out of the stable were the things which he had before had in his custody; I asked him what things they were; he said he did not know particularly, he believed they were old clothes; I asked him what they were in; he said a square box, and a bundle; I then observed to him, that it was very extraordinary that he should have things belonging to this man; and then I asked him to tell me the truth.</p>

None; he said that was the truth; I asked where William lived; he said he did not know; I observed to him that it was very extraordinary; I asked whether William was to call again; he said, yes; I asked when; he said to-morrow; I said, what is he to call on you for; he said he wished to befriend him; I told him I thought it was a very extraordinary connection, and observed to him, that I thought he had done something very bad; I then desired him to give me an account of his plate, which was very correct.</p>
               <p>Q.After this conversation did he go out? - A. Yes; I told him he must quit my place that day month; and about five o'clock, after we had dined, he went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out after him, and were to? - A. When I understood he was gone out, and I had got information that the person who was in the stable was Miss Ladbrooke's servant, it struck me it was probable he might be gone to Miss Ladbrooke's; I went to Miss Ladbrooke, and mentioned to her the circumstance; I begged her permission to have her servant up, which she gave, and he was called up, his name is

               <p>Court. Q. What conversation had you with the prisoner, did you make use of any promises or threats to induce him to confess? - A. No; I asked him where he had been; he said, that as he understood I meant to send him to prison to-morrow, he had gone out to see a friend; I asked who his friend was; he said it was Mr. Tubb's servant, in Bedford-square; I asked him if he had been no where else, he said, no; I asked him if he had not been at Miss Ladbrooke's house, he said, no; I asked him if it was not Miss Ladbrooke's servant that had been with him the night before in my stables.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did he say in answer to that? - A. He said, no; I told him he had told me a great many falsities in the morning, and that those were falsehoods likewise; I told him he had been at Miss Ladbrooke's, that Miss Ladbrooke's servant was with him in the stable, and that the box and bundle which he took out of the stable contained wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say whose wine it was? - A. I told him I suspected it was my wine; he denied it, then I told him I had Miss Ladbrooke's servant at the door, and the wine, also the man who kept the house where Miss Ladbrooke's servant had an apartment; he then exclaimed, Oh! sir, you watched me to Miss Ladbrooke's, and cried; I asked him how he had got the wine, he said, it was the savings out of the bottles, and entreated me to have mercy on him.</p>
               <p>Q.During the time that last conversation took place, Ward and Hinsall were present? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I see that the indictment charges forty-two bottles of wine-how many servants have you? - A. Three or four servants.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore I take it for granted it was impossible to carry out of your house, at one time, such a quantity of wine, unless it was carried out by one or two bottles at a time? - A. I take it it was not so, because the box and bundle contained the quantity; I think there were two dozen and an half in the box, and one dozen in the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q.Your cellar is attached to your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not imagine it must have been taken away by one or two bottles at a time? - A. It appears to me, that it must have been carried away all at one time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not taken originally from your cellar one or two bottles at a time? - A. That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had this man the care of your cellar? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed any wine? - A. No; I trusted the care of my cellar to my house-keeper; I did not keep any accurate account of the wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Whatever quantities of wine might have been taken from your cellar, you are certain that box was the box taken from your out-house? - A. Yes; I went into the cellar afterwards, and I dis<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179704260032"></xptr>covered there had been several bottles taken from pipes that were set up by themselves, that were not come into use, to a considerable amount.</p>

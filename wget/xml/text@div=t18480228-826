                  </hi> I know the prisoner—I have seen her write so as to know her handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">looking at several letters</hi>) I believe these letters to be her writing—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Dear Madam,—I am very sorry to leave you this afternoon; but I can assure you it is all love that makes me do it. Revenge is sweet, when you can have it; and you will know this evening what becomes of me. I can assure you I could make myself happy in serving you; but I can assure you my love is too great as not to have my revenge. It will be a warning for other young men not to deceive a girl as this one has deceived me. Dear Madam, I remain your humble servant, <hi rend="smallCaps">ANNETTI MEYERS."</hi>)—(<hi rend="italic">Letter from the deceased to the prisoner</hi>, addressed, "Miss Meyers, 40, Albion-street, Hyde-park, London:—Wellington-barracts Jan. 28, 1948. Dear Annette,—I now address a few lines to you, hoping, they will find you in the enjoyment of good health, as it leaves me at the present time. I received your letter, and I should have answered it sooner, but I have been on duty. I will be at the little gate on sunday afternoon, at a quarter past-three if all be well. I am sorry to hear you have got such a bad place; but I hope it will be better. I must conclude with my kind love, and believe me to be, your affectionate lover, <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY DUCKER."</hi>)—(<hi rend="italic">The following letter was found, in an envelope, in the prisoner's desk</hi>, addressed, "Miss Meyers, 40, Albin-street, Hyde-park park, London."—"Monday evening. My dear Henry,—I take my pen in hand to write these few lines, to tell you my mind. I must say there is something the matter with you, as Sunday afternoon you did not as much as offer me your arm. We walked <hi rend="italic">like we</hi> did know much of one <hi rend="italic">other.</hi> People must have thought so to see us; and, another thing, for you to tell me you would go to see that young woman, and you would get some money. Was it kind for me to give you some? But I do not like such ways; and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184802280065"></xptr>
               <p>you say if she had not got any money she would lend her things; more fool her. No young man would make me do such a thing, except it was for some good motive; but I think, if any young man wished a young woman well, and his meaning is good to her, he would not wish anything of that kind from her. Henry, for you or any other young man, I would not do such things; and if you are not ashamed of it, I am; as I never can give you aught. Look back since Christmas how much you had from me; and so, if that is all the love you have for me, I do not care for such love, I know you care more for that young woman than you do for me, because she can give you more money than I can: she gets it easier than I can. She does not get it in service. You know it very well, that no other man but you had my company since you wished for my company; but you can please yourself, and go and see her or any other young woman that can give you more than I have; but please to give me back what you have of mine, that is, two books and the pencil that you have; but I wish to see you once more, to part friendly. You had the face to tell me one day that I could not do without you or other men. I have done before, and I know I can do now; but I am sure you cannot do without a woman. Henry, do not be afraid to face me once more, for the last time, and write to me here. I home she will be more kind to you than what I have been. One day you had the face to tell me that I had done nothing to what some had. I <hi rend="italic">done all what</hi> lay in my power, and I am not going to do what they do to raise you some money. I did not let you do what you liked to me because I thought of getting some money, no! but it was because I kindly loved you; and what did you say to me in the park the last evening? I little thought that I should have to write such a letter to you as this Henry our case will be a warning for others; you will see what kind love means soon, Henry; but do not be afraid, I am not going to do anything to you; all I wish for you to do is, to see you once more. When I asked you on Sunday if I should see you next Sunday, you said, 'It all depends;' but you did not say what, but I can think what. If you like to come next Sunday, at half-past six o'clock, I shall be able to go out then. We can make it the last time to see one another; but please to let me know, as I must tell mistress in time that I want to go out at that time; and if you have not get a penny, as you say, you can send your letter without paying for it. I hope I have said enough for you to think what your <hi rend="italic">meaning</hi> are to me. No more. God bless you! Do not forget what I told you. I will still remain yours till we part, next Sunday, or before, if you like to come; and I am, yours affectionately, <hi rend="smallCaps">ANNETTE MEYERS.</hi>")—(<hi rend="italic"> Several other letters were put in, from which</hi>

My dear Henry,—Your own feelings will explain to you how welcome your dear letter was to your own affec<lb></lb>tionate Annette; and how grieved I was to learn that you were compelled to be on picket and guard on Wednesday; but I know the duty must be at<lb></lb>tended to; but, my dear Henry, be assured, that whether together or absent, your Annette is, and will be, eternally and affectionately, your own. Should any obstruction arise, it must spring from yourself alone, as my happiness or misery in this would depends entirely upon your conduct; my very existence being interwoven with your well-being and your general prosperity. My dear Henry, I am afraid that I am thinking too must of you. You know I always did love you from the first I saw of you, and from the first Sunday I saw of you; but I never said so; but now I say so; for true confession is good for the soul. Dear Henry, I hope you are not making a fool of me. If you do not mean to be honourable to me, say so at once; because I can</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184802280066"></xptr>
               <p>assure you you will not make a fool of others; you know what I mean by that; but if I know your heart is with me, I shall then be happy, and I shall not care what I do for you. Anything that you want done, say so; with the greatest pleasure I will do anything for you. My dear Henry, I cannot, get to see you to-night, it is so foggy. I am very glad you are not upon guard to-night. I hope it will not be foggy to-morrow night, Wednesday night I mean. I will go to see you. Be one the look-out about seven o'clock, as you wished me to go. Dear Henry, when you wrote your letter you had no love to send me. Perhaps you send it to another; but I hope not. Now I have sent you my best love. I hope these few lines will find you in good health, as they leave me to-night, thank God for it. Dear Henry farewell! May Heaven watch over your health, and speedily conduct you to the arms of your faithful and affectionate and loving girl, <hi rend="smallCaps">ANNETTE MEYERS."</hi>)—("10, Northumberland-street, Sunday afternoon. My dear Henry—this comes with my kind love for you. I hope you are better, still better than you were last Thursday, when I received your letter, and I have answered it the same night, for you to have my letter on Friday morning, and I thought I should have had an answer from you yester<lb></lb>day, but my lookings were all in vain. I hope you had my letter on Friday. I have sent you the postage stamps and an envelope too that you asked for, and I hope I have not said anything to affront you; if I have, I did not know it; perhaps you will tell me if I have, Do please to favour me with a few lines, and tell me if you are better, and if you had my letters, and when you think you will come out. Oh, Henry! I wish we had a home of our own, then I could nurse you, and soon well, and cheer you up. Oh! Henry, if that happy day <hi rend="italic">do</hi> ever come, oh! how happy we shall be, with the blessing of God—with the blessing of God, I hope that day will come when we may meet to part no more, till death parts us. Henry, I should like to know you thoughts upon that matter of business—I wish I could read in your heart to know your thoughts about it—do open your heart at once and tell me—do not deceive me, dear Henry, you know I have heard a great many things about you, but you see I have not believed one of them; we will forget all that has passed, and think of what is to come—all is past and ended, we will learn to be more wise. Dear Henry, I am going to Eaton-square this evening and I am going to leave this letter as I pass at your barracks, for you to have it to-morrow morning; then, I hope I shall have an answer on Tuesday morn<lb></lb>ing, if all is well. Dear Henry, I hope those things you have got of mine are quite safe. Dear Henery, my cold has been very bad, but it is better to<lb></lb>day, thank God. I cannot write any more this time, but with love to you. Do write, dear Henry. Yours, most affectionately, <hi rend="smallCaps">ASSETTE METERS.</hi>")</p>

               <p>Q. At what time did you first come acquainted with Mr. Priddle?</p>
               <p>Harris. He came to my father's house about a fortnight before I came to town. I came away on the 24th of August; Mrs. Priddle was in the country with him: they continued at our house a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other part of their family there?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, the son.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you happen to come to town with Mr. Priddle?</p>
               <p>Harris. I went up one day into Mrs. Priddle's room, about a week before I came away, her asked me to pin some ribbands on the sleeves of her gown: further her told me, her should be very glad to have a young woman to run up and down stairs for her as a friend, and asked me if I chose to go to London. I said, I should like it very well; and I came to London with Mrs. Priddle.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your father's consent?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, I had not: I had my mother's. I went with Mrs. Priddle on the 24th of August. Mr. Priddle did not accompany us.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your father against your going?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, he was. I went with Mrs. Priddle in a returned chaise to Oxford, and from Oxford to London in the post coach. Mr. Priddle returned to town on the Friday after we got to London on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Court. I should be glad to know in general, how you lived in the family?</p>
               <p>Harris. I was not as a servant, I did any thing Mrs. Priddle ordered me to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she occasionnally order you to do the work of a servant?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, I generally made the beds, I never refused any thing her bid me do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever clean the house?</p>
               <p>Harris. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you dine with the servants?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, I dined and supped with Mr. and Mrs. Priddle; I lived with them just as they did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Priddle in town, on the night of the 17th of December?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, her went out of town on the Sunday before.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was the 17th?</p>
               <p>Harris. Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it on that night, that you was called upon to warm Priddle's bed?</p>
               <p>Harris. A little before one o'clock, Priddle asked me to warm his bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the family was up?</p>

               <p>Q. Is it next door but one to the corner?</p>
               <p>Harris. I cannot tell; I don't know any place there.</p>
               <p>Q. This was not the room where he usually lay, only when he had the gout?</p>
               <p>Harris. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the gout?</p>
               <p>Harris. He pretended to have it as bad as he had about three weeks before this.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he keep his dining room three weeks?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, he was backwards and forwards to the office even with it, he went into the country with his wife on the Sunday before this happened. When he had the gout he used to have a bed put up in this dining room. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177502180004"></xptr> lay up two pair of stairs at other times; this bed had been put up about three weeks, he went into the country on Sunday with his wife, he returned on Tuesday, and left his wife behind.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Priddle asked you to warm his bed for him, did you go down stairs for the coals?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, the girl brought the pan up.</p>
               <p>Q. He called you up into his room?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not speak to you about warming his bed till you came into his room?</p>
               <p>Harris. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when he called you?</p>
               <p>Harris. Down in the kitchen which is under ground with the servant maid.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when he called you?</p>
               <p>Harris. He asked me to make him a honey toast, he was then siting in a two elbow chair by the fire side, first he rung the bell, the girl answered the bell and then her came down and told me Mr. Priddle ordered me up to make him a honey toast, I went up, and made him the toest; he ate it, then he asked me to warm his bed, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You went down stairs for the coals?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, I had them out of the dining room, the girl brought the pan up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bell rung for the girl?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, her was up in the room when the girl came down to order me to make the toast, her went up with me again.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the request to warm the bed had been usual?</p>
               <p>Harris. He always asked me to warm the bed when his wife was at home; he told the maid her might go down stairs again and go her ways to bed; I warmed his bed and asked him whether he was ready to get into bed, he said presently, I said I thought it time for him to get into bed, because I wanted to go to bed, he said he should presently, he went and locked the door directly, then he told me he insisted upon my staying in the room that night and lying with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with the key?</p>
               <p>Harris. He put it in his left hand pocket; I told him I insisted upon going out of the room, he swore a great oath, that I should not go out of the room, but stay there all night, when he begin locking the door, I said, Mr. Priddle, I insist upon going out of the room; he swore I should not go out of the room that night; he said, I should stay and lie with him all night; I told him, I would not, I begged for mercy, I begged him to let me go out of the room; he pushed me backwards several times when I went to go towards the door, against the side of the table: I down'd of my knees and beged him for Christs sake not to ruin me, he swore he would force me to lie with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the word he used?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, the very word, when I tried to get forward to the door again, he knocked me down twice upon a sopha.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he strike you?</p>
               <p>Harris. Just in the pit of my stomach, then I struggled as well as I could to get up again, while I was upon the sofa he put his hands up my petticoats, then I went to take up the candle, I took one in my hand, he blowed them both out.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you going to do with the candle?</p>
               <p>Harris. To try to get out at the door,</p>
               <p>Q. But he had the key in his pocket?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, and I beged to be let out; I went to light the candle at the fire place again, then he took me by my cloaths and pushed me down upon a two elbow chair that he sat in at the left hand side of the fire, he blowed the candle but again in my hand, and swore it was of no use for me to try, that he would not be said nay, that I need not cry out, for if I did, he would soon stop my crying, he pulled me round the table with as much strength as possible and forced me upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you resist?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, several times, as much as I was able to do.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do, when he had you on the bed?</p>
               <p>Harris. He pulled my cloaths up, he forced me very much and I cried out as loud as possible I could, when I cried out as loud as I could the girl servant came to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this before he had lain with you?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the servant came to the door?</p>
               <p>Harris. As the girl says, I never heard her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she speak?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177502180005"></xptr>Harris. She told me afterwards, that she did speak, I never heard her, she tells me she knocked several times, but I did not hear her, he forced me as long as possible, still I was not able to hold up my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do then?</p>
               <p>Harris. He forced me quite, as much as possible he could, I was even almost dead.</p>
               <p>Q. You must tell what he did to you.</p>
               <p>Harris. I do tell you, he forced me quite entirely, to the ruin of my body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lie with you?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you was so exhausted that you could not hold up your hands, was you sensible of what he did?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, as sensible as possible I could be.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel his private parts?</p>
               <p>Harris. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this occasion delicacy must be laid aside, because a man's life is at stake, and I hope you consider what you are about, that you are upon your oath.</p>
               <p>Harris. I wont speak a word more than is true.</p>
               <p>Q. You did feel his private parts?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, very sharp.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean by sharp pain?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, very much.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you feel in consequence of that - how long did you find it so?</p>
               <p>Harris. As much as a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. That is private parts were in your's?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sensible of any thing else?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes. I found something wet come from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel it in your inside?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you tell me the truth?</p>
               <p>Harris. Every word.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you kept upon the bed?</p>
               <p>Harris. I believe as much as two hours, he was forcing me all the while.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lie upon you all the time?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, all the while.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he repeat this affair with you more than once?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, but once.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lie with you only once?</p>
               <p>Harris. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At the end of two hours what became of you?</p>
               <p>Harris. He unlocked the door, and pushed me out of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go?</p>
               <p>Harris. To my own bed-room, I went first to my fellow servants, the maid's room, her door was locked, I could not get in to tell her of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you lay in a room by yourself?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to get in at the maid's room?</p>
               <p>Harris. I knocked four or five times at her door.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do the next morning?</p>
               <p>Harris. I got up about eight o'clock, I went down in the kitchen and told the girl of it; I told her Mr. Priddle, had quite entirely ruined me, she desired me to send to my friends and I did.</p>
               <p>Question from the Jury. Whether you or the maid spoke first of it?</p>
               <p>Harris. The maid asked me when I came down, what the devil I had been at? I sat down in the chair; as if I was just dead.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find yourself?</p>
               <p>Harris. Very bad indeed, I could scarce make her any answer,</p>
               <p>Q. You sat down quite exhausted as it were?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, I told her as well as I could make an answer, that Mr. Priddle had ruined me; she desired me to send t o my friends, and I did directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any friends in town?</p>
               <p>Harris. Not a soul in the world, I sent directly after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew any thing to this maid servant?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, my linen, she washed my linen and saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any marks upon your linen?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What appearance?</p>
               <p>Harris. Blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Any thing besides?</p>
               <p>Harris. Not that I know of, she can tell better than I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the blood yourself upon your linen?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177502180006"></xptr>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at that time your courses upon you?</p>
               <p>Harris. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How did that blood come upon your linen?</p>
               <p>Harris. By the force of Mr. Priddle.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any man ever lain with you before?</p>
               <p>Harris. Never in the world.</p>
               <p>Court. That question is not usully asked upon accasions of this kind, for though a woman might have taken liberties with other men, it does not follow from thence, that it is lawful for any man to force her; but as the mentioned she had blood through the force of this Mr. Priddle, I thought it proper in my own opinion for the counsel to ask the question of her.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you write to your friends?</p>
               <p>Harris. On the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the next day?</p>
               <p>Harris. The Sunday was the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. The next day after you spoke to the maid?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Mr. Priddle, did he stay in town or go out of town?</p>
               <p>Harris. He went out of town on Tuesday, he said he was going down to Burford after Mr. Fettiplace's affairs, that was where my father lived.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you put that letter you speak of into the post?</p>
               <p>Harris. I gave it to the bell-man, at the door, and gave him a penny, on the Monday night.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner went out of town on Tuesday?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had talked with the maid in the kitchen, which was the Sunday morning about eight o'clock, you saw the prisoner and whether you said any thing to him.</p>
               <p>Harris, Yes, on Sunday morning, he rung the bell for me to come up into his room about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that it was for you?</p>
               <p>Harris. It was to make the breakfast, I always made the breakfast, I went up out of the kitchen; when the first tea was poured out, he said is this the best tea and be d - d to you, that you have for me, I said it was the same tea Mrs. Priddle drank when she was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry up the breakfast?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, the girl had set it ready.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came into the room, there the tea was.</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes. When he said that about the tea, I began crying, he said he supposed I should swear a rape against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing besides crying?</p>
               <p>Harris. Nothing at all, I told him I would if I had any friends in town; I went out of the room directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make no answer to you when you said that?</p>
               <p>Harris. Not a word?</p>
               <p>Q. He went out of town on Tuesday, was you removed from his house before he returned to town again.</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he came back.</p>
               <p>Harris. About a fortnight, his wife came a week after he was gone; she got my cloaths washed and sent me away directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention it to the wife?</p>
               <p>Harris. I told her of it, she said when Mr. Priddle came home it would cause words; she told me her expectations were that it would be so.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you go the night you quitted the house.</p>
               <p>Harris. A young man I was acquainted with after Priddle left the town, came to Priddle's house to see me; Mrs. Priddle took me to the Angel Inn, in Wych-Street, and said it would be a very good thing if he would take me home to my friends.</p>
               <p>Court. What Mrs. Priddle said or did is nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to?</p>
               <p>Harris. To this mans,

               <p>Q. What became of you then?</p>

               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>

               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. During all that time, if I understand you right, you breakfasted, dined and supped with the family?</p>

               <p>Q. The business I suppose of Mrs. Priddle</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I misunderstood one of your expressions just now, or else you contradicted yourself: you said, you always warmed the bed?</p>

               <p>Q. Why did you not warm it the second night?</p>
               <p>Harris. Because I went to bed the second night.</p>
               <p>Court. I understood you; you did not warm his bed?</p>
               <p>Harris. The first night he came home I warmed it.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened it you did not warm it the second night?</p>
               <p>Harris. Because I was not very well, I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you warm it the night afterwards?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, I was not up in the room, I was down in the kitchen with the servant girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ill on Thursday?</p>

               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As I understood you, that room was the room that fronts Chancery Lane?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your stair case is what they call, I believe a well stair case?</p>
               <p>Harris. I don't know what you call it.</p>
               <p>Q. That winds up to the top of the house: you can speak from the top to a person at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, it winds up.</p>
               <p>Q. His first expression to you, was, that you should stay in the room, and lie with him?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was while he was locking the door?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, while he was locking the door I desired to go out; he told me I should not go out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say you should lie with him, while he was locking the door, or after?</p>
               <p>Harris. After he had locked the door.</p>

               <p>Harris. Never a word, that I know of.</p>

               <p>Harris. No, the windows were fastened.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean my lord and the jury should understand, that if you had cried out as loud as you could, the maid, if she had been awake, must not have heard you?</p>
               <p>Harris. I don't know: I cried out as loud as possible I could.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are sure you heard nobody at the door?</p>
               <p>Harris. No.</p>
               <p>Q. As I understand you was sensible during the whole of this time?</p>
               <p>Harris. Sensible enough to know whether he used me ill or not.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you some blows?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He blew out the candle, then you light one of them again that he blew out, and then proceeded to violence?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He committed the offence but once?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But lay upon you two hours afterwards?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had completed his purpose, he lay upon you for two hours?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry out?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, as long as I was capable of holding up my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation passed between you, during that two hours, after he had done the mischief?</p>
               <p>Harris. Not as I remember, at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When you used to warm your master's bed, was it not usual to stay and tuck him up?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, I never meddled nor made with him, his wife used to do that.</p>
               <p>Q. But when his wife was not at home?</p>
               <p>Harris. No; the curtains were always drawn; I never touched him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the next morning, the maid said to you, what the devil have you been at?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you what observation she had made the night before, or by your to ing so bad?</p>
               <p>Harris. I apprehended, by my looking so bad, for I dropped into a chair immediately as I came in.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not tell you what she had seen, or heard?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177502180009"></xptr>Harris. Yes, she told me what she had heard the night before, she said, she heard me cry, Lord have mercy upon me; Mr. Priddle don't ruin me.</p>

               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you laid with the maid the night before?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, Mrs. Priddle ordered me to lie in the second floor.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not make the maid hear?</p>
               <p>Harris. I knocked at her door three or four times, and she did not hear me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you could call any other person in the house?</p>
               <p>Harris. I did not meddle with any of them, I went up to the man's room, I went in, and found him asleep, and I never meddled nor made with the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice to the boy?</p>
               <p>Harris. I never went beyond.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you send to this Evans; the next day?</p>
               <p>Harris. I did not send to him at all; I did not know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was totally unacquainted with Evans till this affair happened?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you did not go down stairs that night, and carry the warming pan down?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, I never touched it, I laid it upon the hearth in the dining room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at home all Sunday?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>

               <p>Harris. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did nobody put it in your head to go to a magistrate to complain?</p>
               <p>Harris. I told it this woman, her told me it was best to send to my friends; her did not understand the law no more than me; I never spoke a word to any body, I knew nobody in own.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bells were there in this room?</p>
               <p>H. One.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure there were not two?</p>
               <p>H. Not that I know, there was but one, by the fire place.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to light this candle at the fire place, why did not you think of ringing the bell?</p>
               <p>H. Because he kept me from that side where the bell was.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said, you light the candle; how came you to light that, and not ring the bell?</p>
               <p>H. He pushed me down two or three times while I was lighting it; I could not get nigh the bell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on Monday morning?</p>
               <p>H. Yes, I saw him in his room.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he breakfasted, or after?</p>

               <p>Q. What did you go into the room for?</p>
               <p>H. To fetch some work out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he then up?</p>
               <p>H. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you dine with him on Monday?</p>
               <p>H. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not?</p>
               <p>H. Because I was never asked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever stay to be asked before?</p>
               <p>H. Yes, I was always asked.</p>
               <p>Q. You had supped with them from your first coming into the family till this time, and always stayed to be asked?</p>

               <p>Q. Did any body dine with him that day?</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you see him go from the door to the hackney coach?</p>
               <p>H. I saw him from the kitchen window go into the hackney coach.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he go?</p>
               <p>H. About two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he dined before he went?</p>

               <p>Q. Those letters you spoke of, you gave with your own hands to the bell-man?</p>
               <p>H. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody could stop the letter?</p>
               <p>H. Not unless they stopped it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you write the second letter from?</p>
               <p>H. From Priddle's, I put the second letter in the same way I did the other.</p>

               <p>H. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have given a very imperfect account of Mr. Priddle's health; you must be a little cautious considering the situation he stands in, I ask you whether during the whole of that week he was not exceeding infirm with the gout?</p>
               <p>H. Not at all, he went in and out of the country very well, he was very well when he used me thus.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you dress his foot?</p>

               <p>H. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What sort of a dressing was it?</p>
               <p>Harris. Only a little stuff done over with a feather upon his leg.</p>
               <p>Q. And you apprehend nothing was the matter with him?</p>
               <p>Harris. I fancy very little.</p>
               <p>Q. What could be the use of pretending to have the gout if he had not?</p>

               <p>Q. As you only saw him through the kitchen window, you cannot say how he went out of the house?</p>
               <p>Harris. No further than what I heard this girl say.</p>
               <p>Harris. I saw him go off the kitchen steps without any help, I saw him step into the coach himself, and nobody touched him.</p>
               <p>Q. What cloaths had you on that Saturday?</p>

               <p>H. Two pints of wine and a lemon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you nothing to eat?</p>
               <p>H. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mr. Priddle's son of twelve years old, the servant, and you, had two pints of wine and a lemon?</p>
               <p>H. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you pay for it?</p>
               <p>H. Half a crown, and nine pence for the horses.</p>
               <p>Court. What occasion had you for the guinea?</p>
               <p>H. I gave the son some money to pay for the turnpike as we went along, he never produced any of it, he said he had lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many turnpikes did you go through?</p>
               <p>H. Two or three, I am not sure which.</p>
               <p>Q. How was you to make this guinea good when you came home?</p>
               <p>H. From the servant girl, she took her cloaths and pawned them for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that before you went out?</p>
               <p>H. Not till I came home, she did it, and I gave it to the servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Why it seems a little wonderful after you had been so terribly ill used by Mr. Priddle, that you should be so willing to spend his money?</p>
               <p>H, It was not his money, they were my cloaths the maid pawned.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what became of the change out of the half guinea?</p>
               <p>H. I had settled that, I had given it the maid to settle a bill she had paid for Priddle in the house, for victuals, tea, sugar, meat, bread, and butter, things for the family, that her had bought.</p>
               <p>Q, Then you was to be at the expence of this riding out yourself?</p>
               <p>H, Yes.</p>
               <p>Q, You did not mean to charge that to Mr. Priddle?</p>
               <p>H, No.</p>
               <p>Court, Can you tell how much you gave the boy to pay the turnpikes?</p>
               <p>H, Eighteen pence or two shillings</p>
               <p>Q, But that would not make out your six shillings?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177502180014"></xptr>H. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you borrow the guinea?</p>
               <p>H. The son asked me if I had money enough. I did not know how much I should want, I borrowed the guinea before I knew whether I should want it or no.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home, though you might have changed this guinea, by the account you give of what you laid out, you had enough to make up this guinea?</p>
               <p>H. I had the turnpikes to pay as I came back, the boy said he had lost the money.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you left out of the guinea when you came home?</p>
               <p>H. About fourteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must have called at some other place?</p>
               <p>H. I paid three shillings in London while the horses stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you set out?</p>
               <p>H. About twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. What time had you these two pints of wine?</p>
               <p>H. About three.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no inclination to eat?</p>
               <p>H. We had nothing to eat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you dined before you set out?</p>
               <p>H. We had some sausages sent home to Priddle's.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of this wine did you drink yourself?</p>
               <p>H. I drank but one glass of it, the people of the house took part of it; the three shillings were paid for the horses at a place in Holborn, where they stood sometime before we went.</p>
               <p>Q. The horses were brought there from Bristol Causeway, were they?</p>
               <p>H. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had fourteen shillings in your pocket when you came home, why then did you pawn your cloaths for a guinea?</p>
               <p>H. I asked her to go and get some money to make the guinea up, her brought me a guinea, and the other fourteen shillings went towards the house keeping.</p>
               <p>Q. So you pawned your own cloaths?</p>
               <p>H. No the girl pawned her own cloaths for the guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Evans you say got a lodging for you?</p>
               <p>H. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, what name did you go by at that lodging?</p>
               <p>H. By his name.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not married to him?</p>
               <p>H. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not married to him now?</p>
               <p>H. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you live at that lodging, and go by the name of Evans?</p>
               <p>H. Three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you go by that name?</p>
               <p>H. Till my friends came to town.</p>
               <p>Q. What advantage was that to be of to you?</p>
               <p>H. I did not desire it, he desired me to go by the name of Evans.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Haines, the servant of Mr. Priddle, that went out with you?</p>
               <p>H. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never desire him to write a letter to Mr. Priddle, by your direction?</p>
               <p>H. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who first told Mrs. Priddle, when she came to town, or gave her any suspicion of any thing between you and Priddle?</p>
               <p>H. Myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Alice Lee tell her you had more sweet hearts than the hair dresser?</p>
               <p>H. No; her never could say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear her say so?</p>
               <p>H. No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Since some evidence has fallen from her, my counsel have no instructions about, will your lordship give me leave to ask her two or three questions?</p>

               <p>H. I never touched his leg after the Saturday night he used me ill.</p>
               <p>Here the Counsel for the Crown moved the Court, that the prisoner's witnesses might be examined separately. They were accordingly ordered out of Courts.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in company with any of these people, after Saturday night?</p>
               <p>H. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person she directed to fetch the mare, that she wanted to ride herself?</p>
               <p>H. In the first place, his son asked me if I would ride out with him: I told him, I did not care if I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you rode that mare before?</p>
               <p>H. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you send for the mare?</p>
               <p>H. His son was to go to fetch these two horses for him, and I was to ride out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he fetch them?</p>
               <p>H. No, this man came accidently while his son was out; the son was gone out with the father: when he went away, he went away from the door with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then who fetched the horses?</p>
               <p>H. This man came to the door and enquired after Mr. West, we told him Lee and I had talked of coming to the faran, he said, he would send them: that was Mr. West's man that lives at the farm.</p>
               <p>Court. Has the prisoner a farm?</p>
               <p>H. I don't know whose farm it is: it goes by the name of West's farm at present: he sent the horses next morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When was the next time you saw the man, Waters?</p>
               <p>H. I do not know his name.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he next call at my house?</p>
               <p>H. The morrow after we had been there.</p>
               <p>"A gentleman in the gallery, informed the</p>
               <p>"court, that he observed one of Mr. Priddle's</p>
               <p>"clerks had concealed himself behind the seat of</p>
               <p>"one of the sheriffs. In consequence of which</p>
               <p>"the witnesses were again ordered out of</p>
               <p>"court."</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no conversation with him about me?</p>
               <p>H. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You drank with him?</p>
               <p>H. No, he drank a glass of rum, and Haines drank one, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether she wrote any thing to her father about me, on the second of January?</p>
               <p>H. I wrote two letters to my father: he says, he never received one, but I wrote them: Evans wrote one since.</p>
               <p>Court. You wrote both these letters before you left Priddle's house?</p>
               <p>H. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was that wrote on the 2d of January?</p>
               <p>Court. She said, she was gone from your house before the 2d of January.</p>
               <p>Pris. The question I want to have asked, is, whether she wrote to her father on the 2d of January about me?</p>
               <p>Court. Was you at Priddle's on New-year's Day?</p>
               <p>H. I went the week after New Christmas Day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you left Priddle's house, was it that you sent the last letter?</p>
               <p>H. Both the letters were in December.</p>
               <p>Q. Then did you write any letter to your father, on the 2d of January?</p>
               <p>H. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177502180016"></xptr>Q. You must know how many you wrote?</p>
               <p>H. I wrote two to my father.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Is this letter (producing one) her own hand writing?</p>
               <p>H. No, that is no letter of mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You say that is not your hand writing?</p>
               <p>H. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Court. You are sure that is not your hand writing?</p>
               <p>H. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at it more particularly?</p>
               <p>The witness after having carefully examined it again declared it was not her hand writing.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Counsel. Did any body write it for you?</p>
               <p>H. No, nobody ever wrote a letter for me in their life but Evans, he wrote the last letter.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. My Lord there is no post mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is not own hand writing.</p>
               <p>Court. Let the witness come to the table and let us see her write, do pray take the letter eg in and look at it.</p>
               <p>(She examines it again.) H. It is no letters of mine.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you any letter at all from your father?</p>
               <p>H. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this affair?</p>
               <p>H. Yes, I received letters from my father, before Priddle used me as he has done, several letters.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any letter from your father taxing you with improper behaviour; any angry letter from your father?</p>
               <p>H. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any letter of your father's to you, that Mrs. Priddle read?</p>
               <p>H. She always read every letter of mine:</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no sort of ill will of distaste between Mrs. Priddle and you?</p>
               <p>H. No, never before this affair happened.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Miss Harris you have told the court upon what day Mrs. Priddle came to town, had not you and she some words?</p>
               <p>H. Yes, the night she came home.</p>
               <p>Q. About what?</p>
               <p>H. The bill of the house, and she struck me and knocked me down several times; she beat me very much that night she came home.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that before Mr. Priddle came home.</p>
               <p>H. A week before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the bills you gave your mistress: (Shewing the witness some bills wrote upon narrow slips of paper.)</p>
               <p>H. No they are not.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you deliver several bills to Mrs. Priddle?</p>
               <p>H. Yes, I gave her them all.</p>
               <p>Q. How many?</p>
               <p>H. All upon one piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Are these the bills?</p>

               <p>H. No, they are not.</p>
               <p>Court. Are these your hand writing?</p>
               <p>H. No, they are not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I produce them also as her hand writing.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whose hand writing they are?</p>
               <p>H. No, they are not my hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the bills you delivered to Mrs. Priddle in your own hand writing.</p>
               <p>H. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect how much money the bills came to?</p>
               <p>H. About five pound seventeen shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. These come to five pounds thirteen shillings and threepence; do you remember whether you put down any thing, about the horses in that bill?</p>
               <p>H. No, I charged nothing for the horses.</p>
               <p>Court. Here is an article for horses 1 s. which seems the twenty-first of December, which is the day you rode out, there is a cross to that article, I suppose they were disallowed: do you remember your mistress making any exception to the account.</p>
               <p>H. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember her making any marks or crosses to the account?</p>
               <p>H. Her said there were too much things used: her did not mention one thing more than another, her never mentioned one thing.</p>
               <p>Court. Look a little at that bill again, and be very attentive to it, and say, whether it is your hand writing or not?</p>
               <p>H. They are not my writing upon my soul.</p>
               <p>Q. But were not these the bills presented to your mistress?</p>
               <p>H. No, they were not upon these slips, the bill I gave her was upon a half sheet of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had Mrs. Priddle been at home before you delivered the bills to her</p>
               <p>H. I delivered them to her the very night she came home.</p>

               <p>Counsel for the Crown. You made no charge of the horses?</p>
               <p>H. No.</p>
               <p>Court. It is not likely she should charge horses, because it was a business Priddle was to know nothing of?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How many sums of money and to what amount did you, Alice and Lee agreed to deduct?</p>
               <p>H. None, because I paid it every farthing, for the things that were bought.</p>

               <p>Q. What pawnbrokers did you carry them to?</p>

               <p>H. Her never paid me any, her never settled with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after Mrs. Priddle came home and knocked you down, was it before you made it up with her?</p>
               <p>H. When I went up into the dining room to settle this bill, I told her how Mr. Priddle had used me; then her said she would fetch home the things from the pawnbrokers and send me away.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177502180018"></xptr>Court. That is supposing this Monday she speaks of was the second of January.</p>
               <p>H. I came away the Sunday he came to town.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She has told your lordship of writing to her father, here are two letters, I desire to know whose hand writing they are, are they your fathers hand writing; but if your father is to be examined it is material, these are two letters to myself from her father; what I make use of them for, is to shew her father received no information from her all the time. Whether she ever told Evans, any thing of my having treated her ill.</p>
               <p>H. No never.</p>
               <p>Court. What was your reason for not telling Evans?</p>
               <p>H. Because I thought if I told him, I should have no where to be, till my father came to town</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Evans courted you for marriage.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time, and when, make any observation about her linen?</p>
               <p>L, That very morning, I saw her take her cloaths up, she happened to be out of order the week before, I said are you mad or bewitched, what have you been about,</p>
               <p>Q. You meant she had her courses?</p>
               <p>L, Yes,</p>
               <p>Q, What did you observe?</p>
               <p>L, I saw blood and nature upon the cloaths, I thought it very odd she should be out of order again so soon, she said, she was quite entirely ruined, I bid her write to her friends directly,</p>
               <p>Q; Are you a married woman?</p>
               <p>L, I am a widow,</p>

               <p>Lee. I thought it had been the courses, it was so soon after her courses, that I thought a man must have had something to do with her; or else it was extraordinary their returning so soon again.</p>

               <p>Lee. Making my fire in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the kitchen door open or shut?</p>
               <p>Lee. Open: when we are down stairs in the kitchen, it is impossible to hear any body up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember one Evans, an hair dresser?</p>
               <p>Lee. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when the young woman came first acquainted with him?</p>
               <p>Lee. That Saturday night, when she went to have her hair dressed: I believe, he was an entire stranger, till the Saturday, when she went to have her hair dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how it happened she went to have her hair dressed?</p>
               <p>Lee. Miss Harris told me she was going out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. With whom?</p>
               <p>Lee. She did not say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the reason she gave?</p>
               <p>Lee. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Evans before this Saturday night?</p>
               <p>Lee. Never, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first time you saw Evans?</p>
               <p>Lee. The Thursday after.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master went out of town the Tuesday after this Saturday?</p>
               <p>Lee. Yes, the Thursday next following I saw Evans for the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, this girl kept very close at home, at Priddle's house, during the time you staid there, till this affair happened?</p>
               <p>Lee. Yes, she always did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she go to plays, or any thing of that sort?</p>
               <p>Lee. Never, in my time, before this happened?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear her speak of this Evans?</p>
               <p>Lee. Never before that Saturday night, she told me she called by chance at that hair dresser's, and he dressed her as a strange person.</p>
               <p>Q. During the three months and a week that you was there, did you ever know h er ride out, either on horseback or in a coach?</p>
               <p>Lee. Never before this happened; that was the day after Priddle went out of town.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know Miss Harris sit up with Mr. Priddle?</p>
               <p>L. Priddle desired her one day, when he was very poorley with his leg.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>

               <p>L. Whether on the Thursday or Friday before that Saturday,. I cannot tell; I think it was the Thursday before the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long she sat up?</p>
               <p>L. I think till two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any offer to sit up with Mr. Priddle, in the room of Miss. Harris?</p>
               <p>L. I offered to sit up an hour with him with all my heart; Priddle was very poorly.</p>
               <p>Q. His leg was bad, at that time?</p>
               <p>L. It was rather bad, but not so bad but he could walk.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you make the offer to sit up, instead of Miss Harris?</p>
               <p>L. The Thursday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the answer Miss Harris made?</p>
               <p>L. Mr. Priddle said, I need not sit up at all for Miss Harris would sit up with him.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday the 17th, what time did you go to bed?</p>
               <p>L. I was ordered to go to bed about eleven by Mr. Priddle, but I did not go to bed till one. Mr. Priddle gave us all order to go to bed at eleven; only Miss Harris.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else did he order to go to bed?</p>
               <p>L. Master Priddle was a-bed, and there was only me in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no man that lay in the house?</p>
               <p>L. Yes, William.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he go to bed?</p>
               <p>L. Before me; it might be before eleven, I cannot tell to a moment.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he had any orders to go to bed?</p>
               <p>L. When the first orders were, they all went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him he was to go to bed?</p>
               <p>L. No more than what we always do, when we put out the fire; he went to bed rather before eleven, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was your room, how high?</p>
               <p>L. The two pair of stairs fore room.</p>
               <p>Q. Directly over the room Mr. Priddle was in</p>
               <p>L. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to bed about one; what time did you get to sleep?</p>
               <p>L. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Miss Harris sleep with you?</p>
               <p>L. She came up stairs, and told me she would lie in my bed, if I would go and lie there too.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>L. That morning, about four o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. You never told us that you had seen Miss Harris, till about seven in the morning?</p>
               <p>L. Not to speak to her.</p>
               <p>Q. But she spoke to you, you say, your door was not locked, was it?</p>
               <p>L. No, it was not locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Miss Harris come into your room?</p>
               <p>L. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She opened the door, and spoke to you?</p>
               <p>L. Yes, she asked me, if I would go up stairs into the garret; I said, I would lie there till next morning: and in the morning she told me all about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose garret, Harris's, or your's?</p>
               <p>L. It was my garret: she asked me if I would get up from the bed-chamber, where I lay, and go and sleep in her garret: to which I said, I would lie where I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You was a-bed, in the two pair of stairs room: was that your room?</p>
               <p>L. No, my room is in the garret.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Miss Harris lie with you?</p>
               <p>L. No, she lay in a bed, in another garret.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she open the door of your room?</p>
               <p>L. She came where I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you sleep that Saturday night?</p>
               <p>L. In my own room: I always lay in that room when Mrs. Priddle was out of town.</p>
               <p>Court. Then, if I understand you, this door was not locked: but

               <p>Q. Did you abuse Miss Harris?</p>
               <p>L. I told her, I thought she was wrong not to ring the bell; she said, she could not get at the bell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say she was imprudent?</p>
               <p>L. I told her she was very imprudent not to pull the bell; she answered, she could not pull the bell.</p>
               <p>Q. When Miss Harris came up to you, you say, she opened the door and came in: had she her cloaths on?</p>
               <p>L. She began to pull them off to go to bed; then she went down stairs to draw some small beer.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure she went down stairs?</p>
               <p>L. Yes, I believe she did?</p>
               <p>Q. Had she her cloaths on when she came into the room first?</p>

               <p>Q. Was it light?</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know she did that?</p>
               <p>L. She always did.</p>
               <p>Court: But you don't know of your own knowledge that she did warm the bed on the Sunday night; you only think so because she always did?</p>
               <p>L. I did not see her warm the bed on Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you warm his bed on Sunday night?</p>

               <p>Q. Did Miss Harris ever tell you, Mr. Priddle promised she should never want for money?</p>
               <p>L. No, she said, she had money of her own in the hands of Mr. Priddle. Mr. Priddle before he went out of town, told Miss Harris to pawn any of his things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Mr. Priddle say so?</p>
               <p>L. No, Miss Harris told me so. I said, no Miss, let us pawn our own things, least we should get into any hobble.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you pawn these things?</p>
               <p>L. In Cursitor-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you raise upon your things?</p>
               <p>L. My own all for a guinea and 15 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pawn all the things, or did Miss Harris pawn any of them?</p>
               <p>L. I pawned them by her order.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you raise on Miss Harris's cloaths.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you pawn any cloaths at any other pawnbrokers than that?</p>
               <p>L. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that habit pawned?</p>
               <p>A. On the Monday.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you remember any person taking a ride on the Wednesday?</p>
               <p>L. Yes, master Priddle, Miss Harris, and the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing being pawned to raise a guinea?</p>
               <p>L. Yes, Miss Harris told me, she had spent some money and desired me to pawn her things for a guinea to pay Hains, the servant, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether that guinea was over and besides this half guinea and 17 s. you spoke of?</p>
               <p>L. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing pawned before Mr. Priddle went into the country?</p>
               <p>L. No, we paid for what we had before.</p>
               <p>Q. This guinea was to pay the man: what day was it; after they rode out, or before?</p>
               <p>L. It was the same evening after they came home; there was some money raised in the morning to redeem the habit that was pawned on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who sent for the horses when they rode out?</p>
               <p>L. I don't know which, for they are both fond of a jaunt.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mrs. Priddle came to town, did you say any thing to her of what happened to Miss Harris?</p>
               <p>L. I did tell Mrs. Priddle before Miss Harris herself, what had happened to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mrs. Priddle, Miss Harris had more sweet-hearts besides the hair-dresser.</p>
               <p>L. Miss Harris told me she was crossed in love, and therefore the first man that would have her, that she liked, she would marry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell Mrs. Priddle, she had more sweet-hearts besides the hair-dresser?</p>
               <p>L. I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did she go by in the lodging in Wych-street?</p>
               <p>L. Evans.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they pass as man and wife there?</p>
               <p>L. I think they did?</p>
               <p>Q. How many rooms had she?</p>
               <p>L. One.</p>
               <p>Q. How many beds?</p>
               <p>L. One to be sure, as they passed for man and wife: they did not need but one bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live at that time?</p>
               <p>L. With my friends.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Evans and her in bed together?</p>
               <p>L. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Miss Harris came into the room where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177502180025"></xptr> you was a-bed, and had a conversation with you as you have told us, how long did she stay there?</p>
               <p>L. She called with the beer in her hand, I did not see her go down to fetch it.</p>
               <p>Q. I should be glad to know before you got up to go down to finish your ironing, how long this girl was in the room with you?</p>
               <p>L. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. A quarter of an hour?</p>
               <p>L. It might be longer.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether she at that time complained of what Mr. Priddle had done to her.</p>
               <p>L. She was all of a tremble and terror, and said very little at that time.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, the witness has flatly contradicted several things in the evidence of

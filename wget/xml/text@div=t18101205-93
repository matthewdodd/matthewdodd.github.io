On the 1st of December, the prisoner came into the shop; she asked to look at some shawls, I shewed her several, she had six of them cut off, they were two shillings a piece, and when I had put them up in paper, she had not money to pay for them. She had a man with her. She asked me to go home with her. I went with her into a public-house in New Gravel Lane. She said she had not got the money, the man was to pay for them. The man went out, and then she went out to look after him. She came in again, she said, she could not find him. She took two shawls out with her to go and look after the man; I did not see her take them out, I missed them after she was gone. I waited some time in the public-house, to see if she came back, and then went home. I returned to the public-house again, and found her in the tap-room; she then said, she did not know any thing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of this woman before. A. No further than she has been a customer at the shop.</p>

On Saturday evening, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181012050051"></xptr>prisoner came to my shop, she had two shawls in her hand, she asked me to take care of them, as the person where she lived was getting tipsy, and was turning them out of doors.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Pike. On December the 1st. I was witness of the prisoner purchasing six shawls at two shillings each; she said if the lad brought eight shillings, she would give him a pound note. The lad returned to me, and said,</p>
               <p>"they were a complete set of swindlers, they had got two handkerchiefs. I went with the lad to the public-house, and there I saw the prisoner and the sailor that came with her. She swore that she knew nothing of the shawls. the sailor appeared to be drunk. I sent the boy to Shadwell office. The officer came and took her in custody; she said then,</p>
               <p>"let me go, I will find the shawls," she went into Mrs. Collins's, and got the two shawls. These are the shawls, they have our private mark, they are my master's property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence I was at the public house with this sailor, he said he would give four or five girls two handkerchiefs a piece. He went with me to this shop and desired the man to come to the public-house, he did, the sailor told me to take one.</p>

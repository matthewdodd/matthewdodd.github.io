My shop was broken open on Thursday night, the 17th of April, and this property taken - I have seen part of it since at the Mansion-house; some samples of the property were offered me on the Monday by Taite, which I believe to be mine - we followed the prisoner and Taite to Peter-street, Westminster, the same evening, and there they met another man in a cart; the officer got some further information, and seized a coach with this property.</p>

            . I sell drugs on commission, and live at No. 33, Bedford-street. The prisoner came to me on the 21st of April, and offered me a sample of some grain tin and safflower, and said he had some cochineal - I was to meet him about eleven o'clock and got a sample of it; I went to him at twelve - he said he could not get a sample; I was to see him again at three - he then said he had not the goods, but was to have them next day, and if I called at one o'clock I should see them; I went next day - he was not there - I showed the sample he had left me to Mr. Barnes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Had you known him before? A. Yes, for nine or ten years - I knew where he lived; he was aware that I knew him.</p>
               <p>HENRY GILL. I am clerk to Mr. Barnes. I only know the place was broken and the property stolen: there was a dog on the premises who was stabbed in two places, and was dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.About what o'clock in the evening had you seen the premises safe? A. Ten minutes to eight o'clock on the Thursday night.</p>

               <p>DANIEL FORRESTER. I went to Brick-lane on the 21st of April - I saw a cart and two boys; the prisoner gave them some wrappers; I followed the cart to Blackfriars-bridge and then to Westminster-bridge - the two boys were put out there; Walker had joined the cart on the road; the next morning I went with Herdsfield to Wheeler-street - I saw a coach stop at a house and the prisoner got out; I went up to him, and said, "Get in again, what have you got here?" he said, "I brought them from the market;" I said, "What market?" he said, "I shall say nothing more at present."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was open day-light? A. Yes.</p>

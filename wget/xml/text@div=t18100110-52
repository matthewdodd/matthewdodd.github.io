The head of the cellar stairs leading into Mrs. Stafford's passage had been broken down, her cellar door had been forced open, and her street door was open in the morning.</p>

Skinn affected great surprise and sorrow upon the occasion; Vickrey observed that he supposed that he would have no objection to a search, we searched, and could find nothing, except two pieces of paper, in which copper had been tied up by its appearance, however, these were things that we could not swear to. My partner and I agreed that if Skinn would come up to the magistrate at twelve o'clock the next day, we would not take him up that night. The officer asked him how he spent his time on the Sunday night, he said, he was with some friends, playing at dominoes at the Ivey house, till three o'clock in the morning; Vickrey then said, he should make a point of going there, and enquiring if any such person had been; nothing else passed at that time. I had not been home above ten minutes, before a person came that lodged in Skin's house, told me, they were packing up their things, and going off. Immediately I ran, and in my way I got a watchman, and when I got to Skinn's house, I found Skinn was gone; I saw a bundle tied up in the shop; I then enquired if his wife was there, I saw his wife, I gave her in charge of the watchman. I saw a little girl that had been calling out to Skinn's wife, he took hold of her.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Skinn again. - A. On the next day, at his father-in-law's house, in Type-street, Grub-street. I had information, and me and Vickrey went to the father-in-law's house in Type-street, there we found Skinn. I asked Skinn, what was his reason for running away, and not coming down to Worship-street according to his promise, he observed, that as his wife had been taken, he was unhappy, and protested his innocence: upon which we took him before the magistrate in Worship-street, he was then examined.</p>

               <p>Q. Before this was signed by the prisoner, or before the prisoner said any thing on the subject of this charge, did you tell him, that he had no occasion to say any thing without he pleased. - A. When I asked the prisoner if he had any thing to say, he immediately said, I will tell the whole truth, I was prevailed upon, or over persuaded to do this with three or four others. I then stopped him short, and told him, that any thing he then should say would be afterwards produced against him on his trial. It was perfectly optional with him, and if he did say any thing, he would say it with his eyes open, and before he signed, I gave him the same caution</p>

            . Q. You are an officer belonging to Worship-street. - A. I am: on the first of this month, I received information that Mr. Gilbert's warehouse had been broken open; I went there about half after two o'clock on the same day. I saw Mr. Mobsbey, one of the partners, he led me to a place where he supposed the entry was made, but I soon discovered it was not made that way; I then went down in the cellar of their house, I discovered, that part of the partition to another cellar had been taken down, by which they could get through there, I went through that place, and found a flight of stairs which led up to the passage of the same house, only it is separated by the passage; at the top of these stairs, I discovered a pannel had been taken out, which parts the cellar stairs from Mr. Gilbert's shop, that was likewise big enough for me to go through, the door on the top of these stairs likewise had been forced open, it had been fastened with a large brass button, that button had been forced out of its place, and fell on the ground, the hole in the partition went into Mr. Mobsbey's shop. I went back the same way I came up, not being satisfied how the entery was made; I went into Mr. Mobsbey's cellar; I saw that there was a way down into the cellar from the street; I examined it, I found by putting a small instrument in, they might raise the cellar flap; I had no doubt the entery was made that way, there were no fastening to it; and from the nature of going from one cellar to another, I was satisfied that it was somebody that was, or had been about the premises. I went into the accompting-house, I discovered a desk had been broken open by an iron crow; the marks were there, I then went to the cupboard, where I was informed the money box was kept, I could see that was opened by an instrument, the same as the other, but not with so much force. I then left the place, desiring Mr. Mobsbey to make enquiry where Skinn could be found. I went on the Wednesday evening to Skinn's lodging, Mr. Gilbert makes a mistake in saying Tuesday, I went there on the Wednesday evening, I think between seven and eight o'clock, we waited a considerable time in the street before he came home; we watched him into his house, and went up stairs soon after him, we went into Skinn's room on the second floor, he and his wife were both in the room, I told him that Mr. Gilbert's house had been robbed, and there was some reason to think he knew something about it. I have heard Mr. Gilbert's account; it is quite correct as to that part; I left the prisoner, with his own promise to come to the magistrate on the next day, and told him I should make some enquiries where he was on the night the robbery was committed; I then with the other people, left the prisoner's room, it was half after eleven o'clock at night. On the next morning, I went to the Ivey-house in Goswell-street: I returned to the office, I found Skinn's wife in custody; this was on Thursday, Skinn was not then in custody. I waited at the office expecting that Skinn would come, he did not come; I learned where a relation of his lived, I went there, and at last I got to Type-street, at seven o'clock in the evening; I went into the house I received information he was there, but I did not see him. There were two old women there, there was a room at the back of this place, I went into that room, and there I saw the prisoner standing; I asked him why he did not come down to the magistrate according to his promise, he said, that he knew he told us an untruth; that he was out all that night with some girls and did not wish his wife to know it; I then brought him to the magistrate; it was after the prisoner Skinn made the confession that Brown was apprehended, Armstrong apprehended him. I apprehended Jones on the Saturday night following, in New Gravel-lane, Ratcliffe Highway, when he was brought to the office, he begged of me to get him an interview with the magistrate.</p>

             - A. she is lately deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Jones and some men coming to your house - A. Yes. On the first of this month in the morning, to the best of my recollection there were four besides himself.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time in the morning was it - A. It was very dark I cannot tell what hour it was, I was awoke out of my sleep by my deceased mother, my mother was very bad, she was sitting up in bed, we had a rushlight burning, she was awake, I was awoke by her, she informed me that somebody was tapping at the window, I had no clothes on; I went down stairs, Jones spoke to me, I knew him before, but none of the others, I let him in, and as soon as I saw the others I ran up stairs and got into bed before any of them got into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a table in the room - A. Yes; I put the rushlight on the table just before I got into bed.</p>
               <p>Q, When they came into the room what did they do - A. They all stood round the table, I could not see much it was only a rushlight, they enclosed the table; I heard the sound of money on the table, I heard one of them say, what shall we do with it, another said, throw it down the privy; and another swore a great oath that it should not be left in that quarter. Some of them were pulling some halfpence out of their pockets, one of the papers broke and part of the halfpence flew about the room, they left the remainder of the halfpence that were broke on the table, and one of the papers they put into the bed. In the morning I counted them, there wanted a few halfpence of ten shillings worth of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Jones before - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of the other persons that were there - A. No; I never saw them before in my life.</p>
               <p>Skinn's Defence. I have very little to say.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. I am innocent that witness here is well known to be a common thief. A person came to me in prison she asked for Jones, there was a man with her he said, that Jones and four more committed a burglary last Friday night was a week.</p>

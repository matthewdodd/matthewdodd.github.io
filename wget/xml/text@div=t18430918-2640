On Monday night, the 5th of September, I was on duty in High-street, Poplar, about half-past twelve o'clock, and saw the two prisoners, who I knew before, with two females and two other men—they had been to the public-house near there—the land<lb></lb>lord opened the door and told them he did not want them there, for he was going to close his doors, and he shut the door—on observing that, I said, "My lads, see about getting home, it is getting on for one o'clock"—I then went to the end of my beat, and came back again near on ten minutes, to about thirty yards from the same spot—I saw the same six persons at the corner of the Black Boy-lane—there was another man and woman standing at the corner—I told them it was time for them to go home—they wished me good night, and went away—I then passed the prisoners—I did not speak to them then—I had got about two yards by them when I was hit under my left ear, and knocked down in the road—I turned round the moment I could get up, and got a kick in my right eye from Cotter—one of the other men said, "Leave ago of the man"—I had caught hold of Cotter's leg—I said, "I shall not, he is my prisoner; let me get up and take him fairly"—Campbell kicked me several times in the side, and said, "Kick the b—in the throat, and make him leave go"—one of the other men kicked me in my left side, and said, "Now will you leave go?"—I said, "No, I shall not"—I had got Cotter by the left leg, and every opportunity he got, he kept kicking me with his right foot about the head, or wherever he could—he kicked me in the mouth, and caused my nose and mouth to bleed very much, so that I could not halloo—I still kept his leg—the same man that kicked me on my left side jumped upon me, and went up Black Boy-lane—the third man kicked me on the right side, just by the hip, and took my wind away—Mr. Abbott came out of his house, hearing two females crying murder—the parties then broke from me, and ran up Black Boy-lane—I held Cotter by his heels—he slipped out of his shoes, and went after them—I kept his shoes—I had assistance to get up—I found I bad two wounds on the back of my head, which I got by kicks—they bled.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father at the Harrow public-house, High-street, Poplar.

               <p>him on the face or head with his fist—I did not observe whether he did any thing with his legs or feet—he ran some little distance up the street—Webb got up and called out "Where is he?"—I pointed him out, and he followed him, and attempted to lay hold of him, but he escaped his grasp, ran up Black Boy-lane, and got away. Webb seemed to be beaten in a very dread<lb></lb>ful manner, and was quite exhausted—I saw Campbell mixed in the crowd close to the policeman, but did not see her do any thing.</p>

On Monday sight, the 5th of September, I was at the corner of Black Boy-lane with a female—I saw Campbell—she shoved against me—I told her not to shove me against the wall—I afterwards saw Webb—he told me to go home—I said I was going directly—as I was going home I heard a cry of murder, and as I returned towards the spot I was knocked down by a man in a white jacket—I got up again, went again towards the spot, and saw Cotter run past me without cap or shoes. I afterwards saw a girl with a cap and shoes in her hand—she gave them to a man who keeps a shop at the corner of Black Boy-lane, and he gave them to one of the officers—I have known Cotter a long while, and know this cap and shoes to be his.</p>

I am the wife of Alfred Oliver—I keep a wardrobe shop at 59, Great St. James Street, Lisson Grove; it is one door from the Grove—I have known the prisoner about two years, he has lodged with me just upon two years, at that house—he was married, and his wife lived with him, they occupied the second floor front room, they only had the one room, it was more of a living room, there was a bed in the room—he is a shoemaker by trade—he used to work in his room and take the work home, to his master, Mr. Bosher—his wife died a little over three months ago, about four</p>

               <p>months now I should say, as near as I can remember—she died in that room—I did not know the deceased, Emma Bellamy—I had never seen her with the prisoner—he had spoken to me about her; about a week before the crime he told me that she was very respectable and a nice young widow—I saw her come out of the house one morning near upon 12 o'clock, and having no female lodger I wondered where she came from and I went up and asked the prisoner if he had bad a visitor—he said it was a visitor of his, that she was very respectable and I need not be afraid—he gave me to understand that he was keeping company with her—I did not see her again until this matter occurred on Saturday, 17th October—up to that day the prisoner did not keep much to his work, very little, but he was very-quiet with it always, I seldom knew when he was at work or not—he was a very sober man, I never saw him the worse for drink—on Saturday, 17th October, somewhere about 2 o'clock, I was in my parlour—I heard some faint screams of "Murder!" and "Help!"—I thought at first it was in the Grove and I ran out into the Grove with one of my little boys; seeing nothing there, I returned and I heard it again; I opened my parlour door and then heard that it came from the prisoner's room upstairs—I ran up stairs and knocked at the door; I tried the door, it was locked, I ricked the handle about and knocked at the door very loudly and said "Cranwell, what are you doing to that woman?"—after a few minutes I heard him repeat once to her "You have deceived me," and I heard the woman say once "Oh, spare my life!"—that of course alarmed me more, and I told him if he did not open the door I would break it open, but I had no answer; the woman said "Break it open"—I then broke the door open somehow, I pushed my foot against it very violently in my fright and the door flew open and I went into the room—the woman was lying across the bed, not in the ordinary way, but" across it—I did not see her face the first minute I went in, I went close by the side of the bed to look for her face—the prisoner was kneeling on the bed, very near to her—the woman's face was covered with blood—I said "Oh, Cran<lb></lb>well, what have you done?" or something to that effect—he did not say a word, he never spoke to me—I saw a knife lying under the pillow as I was coming out, it was a small shoemaker's knife—I then flew down and called my husband—I then ran down to a little boy who was minding the shop, and from that I ran across the road to speak to a neighbour—my husband had followed me down and he sent the little boy for a policeman—when my husband returned from the shop doorway we opened the parlour door and-were going out with a view of going up to Cranwell's room, when we saw the deceased come running down the stairs—my husband caught her at the bottom step and while he was laying her down in the passage Cranwell came running down the stairs as if going to see where she was—he never spoke a word to me—I then shut the door and left it to the police and the rest; I believe the prisoner returned upstairs again to get his hat or something and I afterwards saw him run up the Grove for the doctor; that was imme<lb></lb>diately after he had run upstairs; be seemed as if he had come to himself and went for a doctor, and Dr. Brisbane came and attended to the woman.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner and his deceased wife had lived on very affectionate terms—during the last fifteen months of her life she was in a very distressing state of health—she had been attending a dispensary", there was a blow up of the gas and she was very much injured—she also suffered from some internal complaint—the prisoner was very kind and attentive to her, and most considerate, I saw a deal of that—from my experience of Him</p>

               <p>during the two years he was with us he was a man of very humane dispo<lb></lb>sition and temperament—I think it was only a week before this Saturday that I had the conversation with him about the woman having been to his room, it may have been a little longer, it may have been a week or ten days, I could not say; I had never seen her before that day, she was then leaving the house about 12 o'clock—I can't say whether she had slept in the house that night—the prisoner was the only lodger we had—whether she had come in with him overnight I can't say, I know nothing of that—from the time of his wife's death he seemed in a state of great despondency and melancholy at times, and he repeated several times to me how he missed his poor old lady—I don't know whether he was in the habit of sitting in his room doing nothing; I never was in his room after the funeral day—I dare say he was not so regular in his work during the last fortnight, or three weeks prior to this occurrence, he seemed unsettled; he. seemed very unsettled from the time of the funeral; he did not seem to get more settled—it was not more than ten minutes from the time I heard, the first scream till I got up to his door; I don't think it was more than ten minutes from first to last, I really could not say, but it was all done very quickly, a very few minutes—I was very much excited and frightened—I only heard the expression "You have deceived me" and once I heard the woman say "No, no"—when I called out to him he made no reply—when I burst open the door he was on his knees on the bed—he looked at me—I said something to him, he made no reply, he remained kneeling on the bed—I did not notice whether he had anything in his hand—I said before the Magistrate "He appeared to me like a man in a fit"—when he went to fetch the doctor he seemed as if he bad come to himself—when he was kneeling on the bed he looked as if he did not know, me, he looked mad, scared—his eyes were full of a very peculiar looking expression, he stared at me in a very wild way—I went up to the bedside, he remained kneeling on the bed, he never moved while I was in the room—I was a very short time in the room, only the, moment I spoke to him, when I saw her face I rushed off directly—she did not speak—I did not notice any matches lying at the foot of the bed or near the fireplace, or whether the fire was just lighted, I never looked, I was too frightened—I did not go into the room afterwards—I remember his coming in on the Saturday, my husband was at home—we occupy all the house but the top room—we were in the parlour behind the shop at dinner; the lodger coming in from the street would pass the parlour door in the passage and go upstairs; the door was shut, he would not see anything of us—I merely heard him with his latch key and walk upstairs very quickly,—he had a latch key to come in at any time he liked—I know that the woman came in with him on that occasion, I looked round and just caught sight of her dress as she was going upstairs.</p>

I live at 59, Great James Street, and am the husband of the last witness—I have known the prisoner somewhere about a year and nine months, while he was lodging at my house—sometimes I did not see him once in six weeks when his wife was alive—I have no recollection when I saw him before 17th October; I saw him on that day in the Grove Road, somewhere about 12 o'clock, with a female—I did not know who she was—had never seen her before—I did not speak to him or he to me he was on one side of the road and I on the other—on this Saturday I was asleep—my wife awoke me and told me that Cranwell was doing something to some woman—I got up shortly afterwards—I heard smothered screams; they appeared to come from upstairs—I did not hear any words, only the screams—I was in the first floor front room—the prisoner's room was over that—I went downstairs and sent the boy after a policeman, and as I came back from the shop door I saw the deceased woman coming down the stairs, she was half way down the lowest flight, she had no boots on; she was walking by her<lb></lb>self, she was covered with blood; she had one hand on the banisters, and with the other hand supporting herself by the wall—I caught her—she fell into my arms at the foot of the stairs—I laid her down in the passage—she did not say anything to me—I did not see the prisoner at that time—I went out to the shop door to call for assistance, I called a neighbour over, and by the time I came back and he came over, which was two or three-minutes, the prisoner had come downstairs—he stopped within two stairs of the bottom.—I said to him "A very bad job, Cranwell," or words to that effect—the woman was lying in the passage at this time—I was between him and the woman—the only answer he made was "She has deceived me"—he then ran upstairs again—the boy had come back with the policeman just then, and the prisoner came downstairs again—I or the neighbour pro<lb></lb>posed going for a doctor and the prisoner said he would go for the doctor—he went out—he had no hat on when he came down the second time—the policeman came in just as the prisoner was starting for the doctor and he, went with, him—Dr. Brisbane afterwards came with the prisoner and the policeman, and he attended to the woman—since his wife's death I had seen the prisoner perhaps once or twice a week.</p>

On Saturday afternoon, 17th October, I was on duty in Lisson Grove—about 2.25 in consequence of what I heard I went to 59, Great James Street—when I first went into the shop I was told by a man who beckoned me into the shop to follow the prisoner who came rushing out of the shop as I went in; he passed me in the shop—I don't think he was near enough to hear what was said to me—I followed him to Dr. Brisbane's, that was about 200 yards off; he walked, and I followed; he was some distance in front of me—I was in uniform—he opened the door at the doctor's and was standing with the door open in his hand when I got up to him; Dr. Brisbane was there—I asked the prisoner what was the matter—he made no answer, but I heard him say to the doctor "Be quick, doctor, be quick"—that was all I heard him say—the doctor then put his hat on and with me followed the prisoner back to the shop—I went into the passage and saw the woman lying down there—the doctor proceeded to examine her and while he was examin<lb></lb>ing her the prisoner said that it was not only her throat cut, but she had scalp wounds—I then asked the prisoner who did it—he told me, at the same time showing me his hands, that he did it with his own hands—I saw then that he had blood on his hands—I told him that I should take him into custody on a charge of attempted murder—he said "Very well," but he must have his hat—I asked where his hat was—he said "Upstairs"—I told him I would send some one to fetch it, but he insisted upon going himself to fetch it—I followed him upstairs to the room and he fetched his hat—it was in the top floor front room—I won't say positively, but I believe it was on the side table, he had to go round the foot of the bed to get it—on going upstairs I asked him if the woman was his wife—he said "No," his wife had been dead some time, but that this woman had deceived him—I then took him to the Police Station and left him in charge of the sergeant and went back to the house—the Magistrate had not arrived when I took the prisoner from the house—he was quite sober—there was nothing in his manner that attracted my attention, not the least in the world—I had seen him before, but I can't say that I knew anything of him—I had seen him in the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood—I knew what he was by trade.</p>

I live at 30, Lisson Grove—I am a Doctor of Medi<lb></lb>cine—on Saturday, 17th October, about 2.30,. the prisoner came to my house, he beckoned me and told me to come at once with him if I wanted to save a life—I asked him what was the matter, I received the same answer, "Come at once if you want to save a life"—I then went with him, he took me to 59, Great James Street, it took us two or three minutes to get there—I went into the passage and found a woman lying there with her throat cut, bleeding profusely—I examined the throat, it was an incised wound between 3 and 4 inches long and 1 1/2 deep, none of the large arteries were cut—the windpipe was cut but not severed—I did what I could to stop the bleeding—while I was examining her the prisoner said "It is not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187412140045"></xptr>
               <p>the throat alone, but there are scalp wounds as well"—I then examined the head and found there were nine scalp wounds, five on the left side of the head and four on the right, varying from 1/4 inch to 1 1/2 inch in length, and all of them in point of depth were down to the bone—they were such wounds as might have been inflicted with a shoemaker's hammer or any other blunt instrument—I heard the prisoner say that he had done it—afterwards Mr. Mansfield, the Magistrate, came to the house with his clerk I thought the woman was sinking when I saw her first—I did not see the prisoner taken away by the policeman, I was too much engaged in attending to the woman—it was about half an hour after I got to the house that the Magistrate came—I heard the woman make a statement to the Magistrate which the clerk wrote down; she was exceedingly exhausted at the time from loss of blood; my opinion was that she would sink at that time—I don't remember that I said anything to her as to her condition—the state<lb></lb>ment took about ten or twelve minutes, after that I had her removed to St. Mary's Hospital, I went to the hospital with her and left her in charge of the house surgeon, I did not see her afterwards—at that time my opinion as to her life was exceedingly unfavourable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said before the Magistrate that when the prisoner cam to my house he was in a state of the greatest excitement, "wild" is. I think father too strong an expression; he was in a state of great excitement, he first of all beckoned to me with his finger and then caught hold of me by the arm and dragged me towards the door, using the words I have stated—I have been in active practice fifteen years and a half—in the course of my experience I have come across a good many cases of diseases of the mind—insanity has different phases and different shapes, you can hardly find two cases exactly alike—I have read a good deal on the subject—there is imbecility, which can be detected at a glance; there are many maniacs who are insane upon particular points and quite sound" upon others; they may go through life discharging the ordinary business of life and yet upon one particular subject be quite out of their mind—there is a form of insanity known as "impulsive insanity"—I have read of cases of a man being to all appearance of sound mind down to the commission of an act and after the act, and yet at the time of committing the act being insane; that would be a case coming under the class of impulsive insanity—all these medico<lb></lb>legal questions are I think to a considerable extent matters of opinion—in forming an opinion as to whether a person was insane at the time he com<lb></lb>mitted an act, I should decidedly take into account an heriditary taint of insanity in his family—I have seen it stated by writers on insanity that where insanity is shown in the father it most frequently shows itself in the sons, and where it is shown in the mother it more frequently shows itself in the daughters; I have not observed it myself in my own experience—I think it is a matter worthy of attention that after the commission of an act the person does not attempt to evade justice; that would depend to some extent upon where he was at the time—the exhibition of his bloody hands and saying "I have done it," is a circumstance that I should take into account; it is certainly peculiar—these circumstances taken together I would say are significant—the commission of an act without apparent motive, and towards a person with whom he had been upon affectionate terms, would be an important matter for consideration and would strongly weigh upon my judgment in coming to a conclusion whether the person was of sound mind or not.</p>

I have gone into the question of insanity more than most men—I do not of course refer to those gentle<lb></lb>men whose particular province it is—I have no doubt that on some few occasions I have found myself in conflict with other members of the profes<lb></lb>sion in the view I have formed—I have no experience of such a form of insanity as impulsive insanity unpreceded by symptoms of insanity or fol<lb></lb>lowed by evidences of insanity—I should expect to find prior indications of some sort of insanity, or subsequent ones, one or the other—I think in most cases there are delusions, although they are not always manifested, for instance, in the case of Melancholia, you cannot draw them out, they are taciturn, they will not speak, hence you cannot tell what they are pro<lb></lb>bably impelled by—I should give full value to hereditary taint in judging of insanity—it would be a circumstance of importance that a man's brother, or father, or cousin, had indications of insanity—it is a significant circum<lb></lb>stance that an act is committed without motive, and that there is no effort to escape after its commission, and that there is a voluntary surrender to justice—the difficulty as far as my experience goes, and I believe it will be confirmed by every man' who has had any great acquaintance with insanity, is that the forms of it are most intricate, and I think it is pretty much a matter of opinion—there are some cases of course, in which you can have no moral doubt whatever, cases of Melancholia for example—there are maniacs who are profound melancholia—many persons have come to this bar who I have deposed to as being insane; but there is great difficulty sometimes in detecting insanity, even by the most skilled—I have no expe<lb></lb>rience of insanity in the father being transmitted to the son, and from the mother to the daughter—the same type of insanity is apt to be transmitted—a melancholy and desponding condition is worthy of consideration in a matter of this sort.—I have not observed that the prisoner has been wakeful at night since he has been in Newgate, because I have not seen him at night—he told me that he had, and I instituted inquiries about that and he did not appear to be quite confirmed; I think it came to nothing—I said to him—"I think you sleep more than you think, because your symp<lb></lb>toms do not show it."—insanity is frequently attended by epilepsy, that is to say, there is very often insanity associated with epilepsy, but it passes off with the seizure more frequently than not—an insane father and an epileptic mother might most assuredly lead to some dangerous results in the offspring—I should consider they would be very susceptible.</p>

He said 'No, you have deceived me.' I said' No.' He then held me by the throat, took. a knife, and cut my throat. The man's name is James Cranwell I have walked with him five weeks."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From your experience are you of opinion that a man may commit an act of violence without any indication of insanity beforehand or afterwards and yet be insane at the time he commits it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never saw such a case, but it is in my experience and reading and knowledge that such cases have been—I agree with Dr. Gibson that almost all the cases I have seen have shown some indications of insanity beforehand or afterwards—I should take the instance of the hammering at the wall such as has been described as one index, and also the tendency to lowness and depression—that is an element worthy of consideration—then I should take as a very important one indeed in this or in any case a very strong hereditary tendency to insanity, and epilepsy and insanity are most frequent concomitants of homicidal mania—epileptic mania is a most dangerous malady in reference to the lives of others and themselves, and it is frequently hereditary the motive<lb></lb>less nature of an act is an important consideration also, also the fact of no effort being made to escape, and the showing of hands covered with blood—if I may also given the account which the prisoner gave me of the deed, it was upon that I form my opinion to some extent—I think the whole mass of circumstances taken together indisputably prove that at the time the prisoner committed the act he was of unsound mind—I especially lay stress upon the epileptic character of his appearance at the time the deed was committed, the staring eyes, the fixed expression and after<lb></lb>wards a sudden recovery—those are exactly the characteristics of an epileptic sudden mania; also being comparatively cool and collected within a short time of the occurrence would be in favour of the view I am now putting forward—it is quite consistent with his having been under the influence of this impulsive attack at the time he committed the deed—I also think that the dissipation, I don't mean drunkenness, but the tippling and general excitement to which he had been exposed for four or five weeks before, is another element which I would lay stress upon, and his peculiar nervous organisation rendering him liable to such an attack—it is also a very material circumstance that he was to all appearance on affectionate terms with this woman down to the time of her death; the general former history of the prisoner, his gentle manner and demeanour and the whole history of his former life as an affectionate man suddenly terminating in this horrid crime seems to me to be another element in the case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw the prisoner last Friday in company with Mr. Gibson, Dr. Rogers, and Dr. Maudsley—Dr. Maudsley is a well known and accomplished physician, and has written works upon mental disease—I was with the prisoner rather more than an hour—that is the only time I have seen him except to-day in Court—Dr. Maudsley is not here as a witness—I should not like to say that the prisoner is of perfectly sound mind now; I can find no indication whatever that he is not, not the smallest—I should say that he knew he was going to be tried for murder, and that he knows now that he is being tried for murder—before forming an opinion as to hereditary taint, it would of course be so much the better to know the cir<lb></lb>cumstances of the insanity of the different members of the family—if a man became mad from drink, it might very possibly be from an hereditary taint—I do not believe drink would produce insanity unless there was a strong predisposition to it in the individual; it would produce <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—I would except that—there is insanity known as <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> produced by drink—it is unquestionably important to know the kind of insanity the members of a family suffer from before forming any real estimate of the</p>

It is stated in' a book of authority that with regard to impulsive insanity or irresistible impulse, the doctors who present that theory should be able to form a distinct conception between impulses that are irresistible and impulses that are unresisted—I think the only way in which such a line can be drawn is to take the physical concomitants, and if I find that the man who commits the crime is at the time in a state of physical suffering, with staring eye-balls, in a state of great excitement, and has at the same sine a tendency to epilepsy, which in' this case, from the brother's evidence, I believe, I should put that down probably, not certainly, as an irresistible impulse—if I should not find the physical symp<lb></lb>toms I should distinguish the case; here there were no physical symptoms till after the crime was committed, but they continued—it is quite possible that he would be in a state of excitement, being caught in such an act as this.</p>

I reside at 33, Dean Street, Soho—I have had charge of the Infirmary of the Westminster House, in Poland Street, for two years and a half, and was previously for twelve years medical officer of the Strand Union—I have a very large number of insane persons coming under my care, passing through my hands into the various asylums; I have had 160 lunatics pass through my hands in the last <hi rend="italic">two</hi> and a half years—I have been in Court during this trial and heard <hi rend="italic">the</hi> evidence on the part of the prosecution and defence—I have heard Dr. Tuke's opinions, and entirely coincide with them, more especially as to the hereditary character of insanity and its taking a specific form—hereditary insanity is a well-established fact—I don't know that it is transmitted from the father to the son, it sometimes escapes the son—I saw the prisoner last Friday—so far as his physical condition is con<lb></lb>cerned I agree in the opinion expressed by Dr. Tuke—as far as regards that one particular feature in the case I formed my opinion entirely from the condition in which Mrs. Oliver discovered him, coupled with an unnatural condition of pulse for a man of fifty-two years of age—a person of that <hi rend="italic">physique</hi> is less capable of resisting his emotions—his pulse never altered while we were with him, and he was very placid and quiet the whole time.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. It is not the result of my experience to expect previous fits of epilepsy before that spoken to, of knocking his knuckles against the wall—there comes a time when it reaches a climax; it does not necessarily follow that it should come on at an early period of life, it would depend very much upon the habits of the man in the preceding months—he does not appear to have been following his work in the same manner as formerly and he had given way to an unnatural description of despondency at the death of his wife, I mean despondency that caused him to neglect his work and not to lead the regular life that he previously did, that would lead on in a man</p>

               <p>predisposed to insanity to the homocidal outbreak; I am talking of epileptic insanity—I have had cases come under my observation that have been sent to me by the police which were unquestionably insane and that had been insane a few days, or at least have manifested such eccentricity or peculiarity of conduct that I have detained them upon the original certificate till I have satisfied my mind they were fit to be discharged—I sometimes think that we physicians are not sufficiently observant of the proofs of insanity before hand—I think if we looked a little more closely into a man's antecedents we should observe things that would indicate insanity and take steps to prevent it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). On 16th July, about a quarter to 2 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in York-street, Stepney—I saw the prisoner, John Bass, come up to the wall of the back yard of Mr. Corder's house—in a few minutes he was raised over by another man; I cannot tell who that other man was—I waited a few minutes, and then went round to the front of the house, and there saw John Bass in the cellar—on a few minutes James Bass came back to the wall that John had got over, and coughed two or three times loudly—he then passed me and went into Barnes-street—I waited a few minutes, and I lost sight of the light from the cellar—John Bass then came over the wall again, and I went in pursuit of him, calling "Stop thief!"—I saw James coming towards the prosecutor's again; he let John pass and me also, and then he ran to me and said, "What is the matter, policeman?"—I kept in pursuit of John Bass, and saw him fall down in a doorway; he pretended to be drunk—James cames up and said, "The man is drunk; you want some assistance"—he then went for a policeman to assist me—he did not bring a policeman—I handed John over to another policeman, and said, "Take care of that man," and I went back to Mr. Corder's house—I returned again and met John Bass with the con<lb></lb>stable, and brought him back to Mr. Corder's—James Bass then came back</p>

               <p>again—I called Mr. Corder up—I asked him if he knew John Bass; he said he did—I then brought James, and asked if he knew him—he said he did, that they were brothers, and had both lived with him—I examined the house, and found that the cellar flap in the back yard had been opened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">James Bass.</hi> I was never past the house but once; I saw the policeman running without his hat after a man; I went up to him and asked what was the matter; he said, "There is a thief running; try and stop him;" I ran with the policeman until I saw my brother lying with his face on the ground; the policeman sprang his rattle, and said to me, "Go and fetch me another policeman;" I went and fetched two more constables, and then went back to see if I could find the policeman's hat, and I saw my brother at the corner with the policeman; he asked me if I knew him, and being dark I did not; he then called Mr. Corder up, and he said he knew us; I was never past the wall but once, and that was on my road home. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He passed the wall once, and came back a second time. <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> My brother has acknow<lb></lb>ledged that I was not in his company after 12 o'clock on the Saturday night, when he left me to go home as he was the worse for liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Duke of York public house. I know both the prisoners—they were both in my service, about three or three and a half years ago—I was called up on the morning of 16th July by the policeman—I found my cellar flap had been opened—I had seen it safe three nights previously—a large nail had been put in between the flap and the cill, which would enable a person to raise it up—there is a bolt to it, but the bolt would leave it after drawing it so—the cellar is part of my dwelling house—I did not find anything disturbed in the cellar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Jeremiah Biles—on the 12th of March, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I was going home over Westminster bridge with my brother—a tall man spoke to me—I did not take any notice of him but walked on, and he gave me a violent blow in the neck—I turned round to see who struck me, and felt something at my side catch hold of me—I found it was the prisoner's hand in my pocket—I seized his hand, got hold of it, and found my purse containing 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in hit hand—I held him till my brother went and got an officer—he would not give me the purse—I held his hand, and never let go of him till he saw the policeman coming—he then gave me the money—he followed me and abused me, and called me everything he could think of—he followed roe from about the middle of the bridge till I got over the bridge, about five yards—I then saw the policeman and gave him in charge—when he saw the police<lb></lb>man</p>

               <p>he tried to run away, and the policeman took him—he did not let go of the purse till he saw the policeman—the policeman was crossing the road at the time—he still kept following me for about five yards—there was only one policeman—there were a great many more young boys and a man with him—while I was holding the purse the other boys told me to let him go, they pinched and knocked my arms to make me let go—I stuck to him till he gave the purse up—I gave the purse and money to the policeman.</p>

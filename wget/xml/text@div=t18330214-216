On the 13th of February I left my room at a quarter before eight o'clock in the morning - my watch was hanging over the mantel-piece; I returned in ten minutes, and it was gone - the prisoner lodged with me; she was there when I left the room, and was gone when I returned - on Friday she sent for me, and told me she had taken the watch; I told her, if she had pawned it, to give me the duplicate, and I would get it out; she said, "No, I will not do that; I did it with the intention of being transported;" I said she had better tell me where it was - she said she would not, that she had destroyed the duplicate, and she would not tell me where it was till I fetched an officer to take her; she put up her hands and said, "If you have any companssion on a female you will take me up - if you do not, I will do murder."</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk and messenger to Mr. Rotch, barrister and magistrate, of Furnival's-inn. On Wednesday, 17th of Nov., about half-past 10 o'clock, I saw the prisoner going up the stairs to the next floor to where Mr. Rotch's chambers are—he had a letter in his hand, and a bag on his back—I went up to my room and missed some jackets, trowsers, waistcoats, and other articles, which were safe when I got up in the morning—I then went to the beadle of the Inn; found the prisoner in his custody, with the bag I had seen him with, and which contained my clothes—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them—the bag is not mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am beadle of Furnival's Inn. I saw the prisoner going through the gateway into Holborn with a bag—I stopped him, and inquired from whom he brought the bag or the things in it—he said he brought them from Mr. Warden—I knew there was not such a name in the Inn, and asked him who he was; he pointed round the corner to where Mr. Rotch's chambers are—I detained him till Wood came up, and told me he had been robbed of his clothes—I said "then open that bag"—he opened the prisoner's bag, and found the things there—the prisoner did not make any resistance, but offered me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to let him go.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 77).

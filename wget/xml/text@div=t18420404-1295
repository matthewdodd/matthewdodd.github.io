                  </hi>. I am a constable in the London Docks. On Saturday, the 26th of March, I saw the prisoner coming past the London Docks with something behind him, which attracted my suspicion—I found this copper concealed under his waistcoat with a strap and buckle—I asked what he had there—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "You have"—I laid hold of his collar, felt his breast, and said, "Come here"—he resisted very much, and wanted to get away from me—with the assistance of a Thames police watchman I took him inside the gate again—the strap and buckle were outside his waistcoat, and under a <hi rend="italic">jumper</hi> or short frock which sailors wear—the copper was under the strap—I asked if he had been to work—he said, 14 No"—I said, "How came you possessed of that copper?"—he said, "I picked it up on the jetty, this is the first time, you may as well let me go, I am an old custom-house officer"—I cannot call to mind any thing else that he said—I was examined before the Magistrate—what I said was taken down in writing—he had a jacket at well as the copper—it was thrown over his arm—I had no suspicion that was stolen—I said nothing to him about the jacket at that time, not till he had been to the station, and I had been to different shops making inquiries—I then asked him was that his jacket?—he made no answer at first, but after a time said, "No, it is not, I found it with the copper"—I after<lb></lb>wards went on board a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Marmion,</hi> in the Docks—I went down the hatchway there, and found copper there of the same description as this, with the same marks on it.</p>

On the 10th of December the prisoner came into his shop; a lady had just bought a pair of gloves - I put them into a piece of paper for her, and the lady complained that they were gone; the prisoner was near the place where I had put the gloves, and I saw a bit of the paper under her shawl - I accused her of having them; she said they were things she had bought - I took them, and found they were the gloves which I had sold the lady; the prisoner had not bought any thing - we told her we should charge an officer with her; she said "Do," or else we should have let her go - she offered to pay for the gloves.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see her searched? A. I did, and no property of ours was found on her; she said she had picked them off the floor- the lady had paid 3s. 4d. for the gloves, and I delivered them to her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I begged him to let me go.</p>

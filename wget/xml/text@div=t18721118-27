                  </hi>.

Messrs. Wood &amp; Co. Pay Louise M. Gore 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Alice C. Gray," endorsed "Louise M. Gore and Mrs. Turner"—it was never paid—I could not hear what the prisoner said to the young man, but he spoke very loud to me, saying "Will you oblige Mrs. Turner with change for a cheque for ten guineas," and, being a customer for years, I gave her the money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Hall said "I am willing to go," and Mr. Carter went out of the room—Read said "I will tell you all the truth about it," but Mr. Carter was called back, and I repeated to him in her presence what she had said, and then she said "I have part of the money in my box, and I will give it to you"—the statement was made perfectly voluntarily.</p>

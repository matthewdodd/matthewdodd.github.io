            . I am a constable. I was sent for to apprehend the prisoner: I asked how he came to do this; he said it was not his intention to rob any one; that Newland put the hay into his cart, and he threw the ropes and the tilt in; he did not deny but that he knew there was hay in it - he wished the prosecutor not to have him taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he deny having the hay in the cart? A. No; Newland has been seen once since, but he has not been caught.</p>
               <p>- LAMBERT. I am clerk to Mr. Zachary Langton and Co. - the property belongs to their firm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). After unloading, it appears the man had taken this hay. I had not the slightest knowledge of its being in my cart till I got up to put the ropes in: I then saw it and was afraid to get myself or the man into trouble if I threw it out - so he went off with the cart.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character and was recommended to mercy.</p>

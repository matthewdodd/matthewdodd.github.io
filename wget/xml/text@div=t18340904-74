The prisoners were both in my employ - they drove two loads of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040047"></xptr>hay on a Saturday in August - I went to Whitechapel with them - I delivered them to Mr. Sweeting, the hay-salesman, to sell - I saw a man talk to Mr. Sweeting, and he put some chalk on the shafts; they were to be sent to Mr. Curtis's hay press - they were taken by the prisoners - there should be thirty-six trusses in each load.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You did not count the trusses on the carts yourself? A. No; the prisoners were very good servants.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Curtis. The prisoners brought two loads of hay - I counted twenty-eight trusses in the first load - then Mr. Curtis's son got on the wheel, and that took off my attention from that - the other load had thirty-six trusses in it - the prisoners threw a bundle of hay off each load, just as they got in at the gate, and when they were going away, they put them in again - I should, not think they were worth 5s. - I considered it was for the use of the horses - they were banded, but they did not appear the size of a truss.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Curtis. I saw the prisoners come in with two loads of hay - each prisoner threw down a bundle of hay outside the gate - I know what a truss of hay is - what they threw down, was not as much as a truss, but it was tied with two bands - they took it up openly, and I said it was not fair, it belonged to my master - the prisoner gave me no answer - the officer afterwards came to my master's - no hay had been taken away before he came.</p>

            . I am a coal-merchant, and sell beer. The prisoners came to my house on the Saturday afternoon - they each of them brought some hay on their shoulders, and pitched it down outside the door, but they said nothing about selling it - they called for some beer, and bread and cheese - the policeman came up and said, "Do you want to sell this, what do you want for it?" - they said, "Three shillings a truss" - they called them trusses, but I do not consider they were trusses - there had been some pulled out - they did not say any thing to me about selling the hay - I said, "What do you bring hay here for? I don't want any."</p>

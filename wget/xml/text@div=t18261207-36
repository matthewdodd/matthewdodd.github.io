I apprehended Saunders about eleven o'clock on Saturday night, the 11th of November; I heard the rattles spring, and found the watchman securing him at Wapping - I took him to the watch-house and asked his name, which he refused to give - I found this ring on him, and asked where he got it - he said it was immaterial to me.</p>
               <p>JOHN NEWMAN. I keep this house. I know this ring to be mine, and the ear-ring belongs to my child.</p>

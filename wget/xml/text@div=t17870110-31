            , of Hendon; on the night of the 4th of November, I went to bed a little after eleven; I shut up my shop myself a little after eleven; I fastened the windows, and bolted the two bolts of the door, and put up the bars; my husband asked me if I was sure I had put up the bar; I said, I thought I was perfectly sure; but I went back to see, and all was secure; the next morning I arose a little before seven; I was the first person up, and I found the fastenings of the door quite undone from the inside; they appeared not to be undone but broke; the shutters were as I left them, but the pins being turned round, the keys were at the top instead of the bottom; they might turn the pin round on the outside, but being a spring key, it would not come out; the shutters were in the same state, excepting the holes bored; the pannels of the door are here: in this hole there is room for a man to put in his arm, and by that they could unfasten the bolts, and by the top hole they could lift the bar off.</p>
               <p>So that these two holes commanded all the fastenings and the door? - Yes, Sir, they did.</p>
               <p>What did you lose? - Thirty pieces of printed cotton, more than an hundred and fifty yards together, of the value of thirty pounds; a small quantity of printed linen, some muslin, some coloured silk handkerchiefs, striped dimity, plain cotton, diaper table cloths, some new women's shoes, a piece of silk handkerchiefs, and other things.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100046"></xptr>Did you hear any alarm in the course of the night? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose it was light when you got up in the morning? - Yes, it was; it was seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>(The witnesses examined separate at the desire of the prisoners.)</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Waddle. What may be the value of all the things that you have lost? - About an hundred pounds, as near as I can guess.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you enquire whose house that was? - No, she was in bed; and he was just come out of bed.</p>
               <p>Then you did not enquire who that house belonged to? - No, I understood since from her, that she took the house, I found a great many different patterns of remnants of linen; of new pieces.</p>
               <p>Court. Are there any of these things that can be particularly sworn to? - These two handkerchiefs; my information was that four housebreakers lived in that court; and I was shewn the two houses the night before; I never saw the women before to my knowledge; and I may have seen Franklin, but I am sure I do not know; Macmanus has got the pick-lock keys, and Shallard has the pistol, and the dark lanthorn; I was present at the examination, and I saw Mr. Macmanus take one handkerchief off Drudge's neck, and the other off Franklin's.</p>

               <p>I went with Jealous to Islington; I went into the first house, there we found Drudge and Beeston; I have nothing to produce that was found in that house; then we went to Franklin's house, and these gimblets were found in his bed room. (Three gimblets produced) And this silk handkerchief I took off his neck; and this I took off Drudge's neck; these remnants which Jealous has produced were found at Franklin's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Drudge. Did you take off my handkerchief till after I was committed before the Magistrate? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>What account did Franklin give of the manner in which he came by that handkerchief? - He told us something about buying it; but I cannot speak to that; I did not take any notice of what he said.</p>
               <p>Jealous. I found a knife with a saw in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100047"></xptr>it on Baker, when I took him; the balls were found in Beeston's room.</p>

               <p>Have you compared that bullet mould with the other five balls? - I was present, and saw it compared, and they fit exactly; the pistol was loaded with a ball; I have not got the ball.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whether the pistol was loaded with a ball made in that mould? - No, my Lord, I do not.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a carpenter; I live at Hendon; I repaired Mr. Waddle's door after the robbery; I took out these two pannels, and put in another.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at these gimblets, and this saw, and tell us if you observe the mark of such gimblets? - This hole was bored round with a small instrument and not a saw.</p>
               <p>Tell us if you observe the marks of these gimblets? - This gimblet answers the size of the hole; the holes are all bored with one gimblet; they might have been bored with a smaller one first for the sake of preventing the noise; but the large one is introduced afterwards; a gimblet is the last instrument that has been used in boring; these pannels are in the same state they were when I took them out of Mr. Waddle's door.</p>
               <p>Court. One of these gimblets answers to born the pannels? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then there is nothing particular that you have made any observation on only that one? - No.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Waddle. Look at this muslin handkerchief? - Here is a mark upon this which is No. 15; that is my hand writing, a private mark.</p>
               <p>Then from that you are enabled to swear it was your property? - I am; I lost such a one that night; I have no doubt of its being mine.</p>
               <p>(Shewn to the Jury, marked with a pencil No. 15.)</p>
               <p>Court. Look at this other muslin handkerchief? - This I have had a great while in my shop; being very much out of the square, and I could not dispose of it; there is no mark that I can swear to so punctually, as I can to the handkerchief being so out of the square, and so many times passing through my fingers, that I have no doubt of it; I lost it that night.</p>
               <p>Look at these linens, and cottons, and tell us if you lost any of these patterns? - I lost of these three patterns, none of this; one was seven yards, what there were in the others I cannot justly say; but I am sure I lost of all these three patterns; and I lost a quantity of corded dimity like this; the mark has been taken off of this; this is a muslin neck handkerchief which has no mark on; but I lost of this pattern and quality; and I lost some such neck handkerchiefs as these; one of these handkerchiefs which was found on Franklin's neck I have very great reason to believe was mine; I have the fellow handkerchief to it in my pocket, the size I dare say will answer one with another; this was one that I had taken for my own use, and it had not been washed. (Compared, corresponding in quality, and pattern and size.) I have no doubt at all but I lost this the evening of the robbery; the other handkerchief found on the prisoner Drudge does not belong to me.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no mark then on that handkerchief that was found on Franklin? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Shallard. Was the handkerchief made when you found it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jealous. I took Baker on the 28th; his wife said, it was her apartment, and she let it to these young people; Baker was taken in Turnmill-street; I only know it was his house by what she said; she acknowledged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100048"></xptr>him to be her husband; and there were men's clothes in the room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, to Mrs. Waddle. Do you know any of those people? - I have seen them before passing about.</p>
               <p>How lately before your house was broke open? - I cannot say; Mrs. Buck's father and mother live at Hendon, about half a mile from me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever see all the three prisoners in company together at Hendon? - No, I have seen them occasionally in the neighbourhood passing; I do not recollect seeing them in company together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Franklin. Did you ever say that both these handkerchiefs came off one piece? - No, I never did; I said, I thought it was mine; but I should be able to say with certainty when I brought the other piece.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Which of us did you see at Hendon? - I said, some of you.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you ever see of them women at Hendon? - I have seen Mrs. Buck at my shop.</p>
               <p>Is she a married woman or no? - I do not know, she calls herself so; I never saw the others at Hendon; Mrs. Buck has been <rs id="t17870110-31-deflabel167" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Jealous. This iron crow was found in Franklin's room; Baker's wife said, she let out the apartments to these people.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Baker ever claim any property in the man's clothes that were found there? - No, he never was taken back to that house if it was his.</p>

               <p>Was any thing said about Franklin's house? - I do not recollect.</p>

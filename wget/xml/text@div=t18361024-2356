I have known the prisoner two years and half—he came to me on the 10th of March, 1835, in Little Pulteney-street, with these reins in his hands, and asked if they were any use to me—I took them from him in the street—about eight months previous to his being taken he came again to my shop, with the leather in his hand, and asked if it was any use to me I said, "No"—he said it was throwing about the stable, and of no use—there was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. standing between us, and he said, "We will talk about that another day"—he put the leather down, and went away</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 15, Old Boswell-court, in the parish of St. Clement Danes. The prisoner came in June, and had a ready-furnished room in my housh—a female lived with him as his wife, and I know nothing to the contrary—on the 3rd of Dec. I went into the room—he was in debt for rent, and I had given him warning—I missed different articles when my wife fetched me up into the room—she was crying to see so many things went gone, and the prisoner gave me seventeen duplicates of my property—he said he had not done it himself, and neither did he advise it or sanction it, but he handed me the duplicates—all the bed-things were gone, they had scarcely anything but a carpet to cover them—he must have missed the articles every hour he was in the room—there were three paintings in gilt frames, a looking-glass, and all the articles mentioned in the indictment—the brass knobs were taken off the drawers, the feathers from the bed, and part of the bed-ticking gone.</p>

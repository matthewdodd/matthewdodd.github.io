On the 13th of May, about twelve o'clock at night, I was alarmed by the dog barking - I sleep in the house. I got up, looked out of window, saw nothing, and laid down, and in about five minutes, I heard somebody talking to

               <p>"Here are the carpenters coming," supposing they had come to call us up; he said,</p>
               <p>"Master, it is robbers and thieves." (I could not distinguish by the voices, that it was more than one person) I told him to go down stairs, and I would meet him at the bottom; but while we were going down, they escaped out of the window. On getting down, I found two windows broken open, which I am quite sure were fastened over night, by shutters and a bar across. I found the shutters of one window open, and the glass taken out; a man could then undo the fastening, and enter the house - it was all secure when I went to bed at ten o'clock. I went out, and found they had broken the carpenter's shop open - it is about twelve yards from the house; I found nobody and went to bed again. The prisoner had worked as a carpenter for Mr. Byng two years before, and was acquainted with the place. The house is about 300 yards from Mr. Byng's dwelling-house, and enclosed with it by the park wall - it is all in the farm-yard, and is the farm house. I sleep there as bailiff, merely as his servant - I have no tenancy in it.</p>

            . I am labourer to Mr. Byng, and sleep over the scullery. I went to bed about ten o'clock, and was awoke about twelve, and hallowed out</p>
               <p>"Chiltern," who was to come that morning. I found the prisoner holding a stick over my head - I knew him before; my watch hung over my head - it was moon-light, and there are no shutters to the room. I am certain of him, he said,</p>
               <p>"Hush," and asked if I had any money, I said, No; another man was with him. When I said, I had no money, the other man said,</p>
               <p>"Take and tie him;" the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"No, we won't tie him, he seems to be quiet, we won't touch him." Then they asked me if any body was in the next apartment, I said, No; the other man took a few halfpence out of my waistcoat pocket - my breeches were under my head, they did not feel for them. I saw the prisoner reach his hand over my head, and take my watch; he then said to the other man,</p>
               <p>"Do you go down stairs, and tell the others to keep back." I had no conversation with the other man - they both went out, the prisoner following him. Dumble came to me, and we went into the yard, but could not find them. They had taken two panes of glass out, which was entire when we went to bed; they could then undo the fastening - it was a casement window, that must be the way they entered. I had known the prisoner about a year, he lived about half a mile off, and had worked at Mr. Byng's with me. I declare on my oath he is the man. I have never found my watch - it was silver, and it is worth 40 s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You have not seen me for upwards of two years - A. No; not till that night. I had not seen him for a year together then; he had not lived in the neighbourhood for the last two years. I am certain of him, we were quite intimate together when he worked at Mr. Byng's. The moon was nearly full.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not work there above four months - A. No, I saw him at Mr. Byng's, and in the neighbourhood for a year together. They were about four minutes in the room after I awoke. I recollect his voice and features too.</p>

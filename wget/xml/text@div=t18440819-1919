                  </hi>. I live at No. 99, Cheapside, in the house of my bro<lb></lb>ther, James Parkins. On the 21st of July, I saw the shop shut up at nine o'clock at night—the men shut up the shutters—I saw them leave, and bolted the door after them—the house and shop are connected—I went up stairs, and shortly after my attention was attracted by a noise like a bar failing—I went down stairs, and saw that a bar had fallen across the shop, leading from the cellar door at the back of the shop—I went up stairs again—about half an hour after, I heard a noise like the drawing of the latch—I went down again, and found the street door opening into the shop unbolted—the servant was in the house—I bolted the door again, and went up stairs—about ten o'clock the prisoner came to the door—he had lived with us, but was not doing so then—he asked if our foreman had left some money for him—I said, he had not—he asked me if I could give him anything—I said I could not—he then went away—I bolted the door after him, and went up stairs.</p>

The prisoner was at my house last Saturday se'ennight, drinking in the club-room, he borrowed 7 d. to pay his reckoning, saying, he had nothing but 2 d. and two had half-pence about him. My wife went up stairs. After which he was missing about two hours; when he appeared again, he said to one in the house; how far do you think I have been? I have been in the Strand. After this we found he sent his wife to redeem things out of pawn, that came to thirty shillings and upwards, as the pawnbroker has since told me.</p>

               <p>Aldred. I lost 70 l. out of my beureau.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who took it?</p>
               <p>Aldred. No; we imagine it was taken at the time he was absent from the club-room, about eight o'clock that night: upon this I took him up, and before justice Fielding he was asked what his business was in the Strand at that time; he said he went to meet a person in a court there that he had been acquainted with two years. Mr. Fielding asked him, what business that man was of? he said, he did not know. He was asked, if he saw that person that night; he said, he did not, but he then went to the Unicorn, in Shoreditch, and he met the man at the door, and he paid him three pounds nine shillings, which he owed him upon a note, and after that he borrowed a guinea of him. I got a warrant and searched, but found no money, (as a lad had given him information of it before hand.) I found this piece of iron, in the condition it is now (producing a piece of iron turned crooked, very proper for forcing open drawers) his wife said it was a spindle that she used to wind silk upon, and how it came to be bent she could not tell.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know who took it?</p>
               <p>M. Aldred. No, I do not; but I believe the prisoner did; he was out of the club-room much about that time.</p>

               <p>M. Aldred. No, I did not. I had lost the key of my chamber-door about a fortnight before, the prisoner was at our house at that time, we did not find it, and we got another key.</p>

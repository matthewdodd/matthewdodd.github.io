On the 11th of November I came home as the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010025"></xptr>watchman was going one o'clock at night, between Thursday and Friday. I saw three men on the opposite side of the way; I did not know them, and do not know whether the prisoner was one or not. I am always in the habit of trying the bar of my shutters, which I did, and found it was all right. I have six shutters, and a bar runs across them all, it was safe. I heard nothing till between six and seven o'clock, when my wife alarmed me. I went down in about a quarter of an hour, it was then past seven. The shutters had been taken down by my servant. I found eight dozen of ivory-handled knives and forks gone from the front of the window, a pane was broken - I suppose they had been drawn through that pane. On Saturday, the 13th of November, I saw two dozen and a half of knives and forks at Marlborough-street, and two dozen of table knives and forks, and a pair of fancy buck carvers, which I had lost - the two dozen and a half were in the hands of the pawnbroker, the others the officer had - they are my own make.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am servant to Mr. Baker, who is a pawnbroker, and lives in High Holborn. On Friday, the 12th of November, between one and two o'clock in the day, the prisoner came in, and offered to pledge two dozen of knives and forks, I asked him whose they were? he said they belonged to a person outside the door, who had sent him in. I immediately ordered the apprentice to shut the street-door - the prisoner seemed very much confused, and wished two or three times to go out to find the person whom, he said, had sent him in. I would not let him. I sent for an officer; he was taken into custody, and searched in my presence, and in his pocket were found two wires, one of which had a sharp hook at the end.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you judge the purport of them - A. They are calculated to draw any thing out of a shop through the window - I know no honest purpose to which they are applicable. While I was gone to Marlborough-street, two dozen of knives and forks were found in the same box in which the prisoner had stood. He was not half an hour in the shop; they were found within an hour after he left. A woman who came in found them, she is not here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. The boxes are private - A. Yes, he came into a private box - it was there I secured him. I would not let him go out, fearing he might escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not desire Mr. Barker to go out and look for the person - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not write to Mr. Barker to inquire for the woman who found them, and stop her - A. He received such a letter.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he bring large or small knives - A. One dozen of large and one dozen of small.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you remember my saying I refused to take them of the man, but he said he could not take them in, as he was a ruler in the King's Bench, and had broken his rule - A. He said they belonged to a man who was a ruler in the King's Bench.</p>

            . I shut up the prosecutor's shop at nine o'clock; the window and shutters were all right then. I went there nearly at seven o'clock in the morning, it was then light - I found the bar rose up out of its place, and one shutter wrenched over the other - I was obliged to have the assistance of three men to get it down.

             re-examined. The knives and forks are mine. The large ones are worth 44 s. a dozen, and the others 36 s. I had sold none of this pattern.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I received the property, and did not know it was stolen. As to the wire, I can answer that charge by a person I used part of it for in mending a jack-towel roller and umbrella. I went to the next-door neighbour, and borrowed a hammer and file to break the wire off - I rolled it up, and put it into my pocket. If I had intended to dispose of the knives I should never have said they belonged to another person, I should have carried them a great way off. The prosecutor said the knives had been rubbed.</p>

            . The prisoner used the wire to put up a jack-towel of mine. I live at No. 29, Kensington Gravelpits. He put up the towel on a Thursday, about a month ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was so much as a month ago - A. I believe so; he is a currier - he is no relation of mine. I have known him nine months. He has slept in my house for these last four months. He put the wire at each end of the roller - he said he bought it in town.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a single woman - A. Yes. The prisoner slept in the first floor, I slept on the second. I am independent. I do not know of his having any knives, or cleaning any. He had been out of business some months, and boarded with me, on a promise of payment when he was able. I have known him by name nine years, and personally more than twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the day he was taken up - A. I do; it is three weeks ago - I believe he had been using the wire the week before that. When I first saw him in town he was a leather-shaver, and worked for Mr. Tales, of Bermondsey. I went there to see him with a friend, when I first came to town.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The small wire was for the purpose of mending an umbrella.</p>

             re-examined. He had put the small wire on the top of an umbrella.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you remember the Thursday night before he was taken up - A. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come in - A. Nearly upon seven o'clock, and went to bed about ten. I went to bed at the same time, as soon as I had fastened the house. I locked it, and took the key into my own room, which was also locked.</p>
               <p>Q. How do the windows of the lower room fasten - A. With a bolt fastened to the shutter. I locked the parlour, and took the key of that into my room also. The back door has a bolt, but no lock - it leads into a small yard which communicates with other houses. There is a garden at the end of it, paled round, it leads to a back way.</p>
               <p>Q. A person can get over the pales - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010026"></xptr>Q. How can you be sure he did not get up and go out while you was asleep - A. I had the key. There is a lock to his room. I always take the key of his door up stairs myself. There are only three rooms in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was locked in - A. He was locked in - I had the key of his door. My sister slept in the room with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a window is there to his room - A. There is a sash window back and front, nearly as high as I can reach from the ground.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There are three rooms, the parlour and two bed rooms - the bed room stairs come into the parlour. I could not get to the back door, as the parlour door was locked. As to the property, it is not likely that a person who got it honestly would give it to me to dispose of - no doubt they stole it. I have tried all I could to make a discovery on the subject. I am really innocent, I call God to witness it. I had no motive - every prospect in life was before me. I could have a hundred pounds if I asked for it. There is a case which will shortly come before the Court, where a person was waylaid into a public-house. Folly is no crime - I have suffered for it.</p>

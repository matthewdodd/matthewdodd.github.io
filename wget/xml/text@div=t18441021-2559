                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Edwin Jaggars. On the 18th of Oct. I was at the bar of my public-house, at Woolwich—I had some sove<lb></lb>reigns and a half-sovereign on a shelf—I had occasion to leave the bar a short time, and when I returned I saw the prisoner going under the counter, where he had no business to be—I asked him what he wanted, and accused him of having taken the money—after that I took three sovereigns and one half<lb></lb>sovereign out of his hand—I sent for a file of the guards, and he was taken.</p>

Thomas Ainger presents his compliments to J. Philpott, Esq. and, at the earnest entreaty of Mrs. Clarke, begs to submit the enclosed document for his charitable con<lb></lb>sideration. Mrs. Clarke is a native of Lyme Regis, Dorset; daughter of the late James Baker, and related to John Baker, boot and shoemaker of Coombe-street, and maternally related to John Harding, a butcher, of Bridge-street, in that town; having a knowledge of J. Philpott's, Esq. family for many years, Mrs. Clarke is induced to hope he will add his signature to the memorial, to enable her to procure the boy's admission on to-morrow, that being the day of admission. The Rev. Thomas Ainger has taken more than usual interest in this case, having known the family during their residence in this parish, and hopes the motives which prompt him in thus addressing J. Philpott, Esq. will plead some apology. P.S. Mrs. Clarke begs to mention the names of a few individuals in Lyme, known to her family"—followed by a number of names.</p>

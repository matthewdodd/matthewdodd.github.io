            . I was present, but not playing; Pomroy threw down a pot of beer, and interrupted the play, that was the cause of the dispute - they called each other shufflers as to which had paid for the most beer, and Pomroy pushed the prisoner, hit him, and gave him a black eye; there were two or three scuffles, not regular fighting - I saw the deceased fall with the right side of his neck against the form, and he died; Dukes was in the middle of the ground - the cause of the fall was Dukes' scuffling with him; as soon as Dukes found the accident had happened, he got on a horse and rode for a doctor.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I was called by the Coroner to examine the body the day after the accident - there was a fracture of the skull, at a part where the artery passes through; the artery bled internally - the blood had formed at the basis of the skull, and the pressure of that blood caused his death, by producing a paralysis of the heart and lungs.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Sylvan-cottage, West-street, Walworth. About half-past twelve o'clock on Christmas night I met the prisoner near St. George's Church in the Borough—I went with her to a house in Flint-street, Friar-street—I went up-stairs and took off my coat and waistcoat—I had a watch in my waistcoat pocket, with a braid guard attached to it, which was round my neck—I did not leave the watch in my waistcoat pocket; it was hanging to my neck; after I had been there a few minutes I missed it—the prisoner was sitting on the bed close to me—I accused the prisoner of taking it—she denied it—I picked my guard off the carpet; it had been cut from my neck—I then took the prisoner out of the house—I asked her to go out—I then seized her, threw her down, and called for assistance—a policeman came; we both got up, and I gave her into custody—I accused her of taking my watch—she denied it, and said I had it on my person—she asked me to search—I had put on my coat and waistcoat again, and I searched every pocket, including those by the fide of my coat—a policeman came and the prisoner said, "Search your pockets again, you have it on you"—she came close to me, and I felt her hand touch my right-hand coat pocket—I put my hand in that pocket and found the watch—I gave it to the policeman—I had been drinking, but was sensible of what I was doing.</p>

                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">policeman M,</hi> 59). About half-past twelve o'clock that night I went to Flint-street—I saw the prisoner on the ground, and the prosecutor with his legs across her, keeping her down—he said, "Policeman, this woman has got my watch, and here is my guard"—he produced this guard to me; it is cut or broken—they both got up—the prisoner said, "I have not got the watch, search about, you have got the watch yourself"—he searched his right-hand coat pocket, in my presence, and all his pockets, and found nothing—the prisoner said, "You have not searched enough, search again, you will find it"—she came across—she had the watch in her left-hand, and I saw her put it into had pocket—I had my light turned on—he immediately found it in his pocket, and gave it me—this is it.</p>

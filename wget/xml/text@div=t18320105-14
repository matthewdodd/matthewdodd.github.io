On the 26th of December, about twenty minutes past three o'clock, I was going along the north side of Whitechapel, towards Mile-end, and between Essex-street and Angel-alley, my attention was arrested by a horse running in the street - I turned my head over my right shoulder, to look at the horse, and saw a man close at my right shoulder; on looking in his face he fell back; I had no suspicion at that time - when I got thirty yards further I got to <placeName id="t18320105-14-crimeloc81">Angel-alley</placeName>

               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner? A. I do not know- I did not see him again till I saw him at Lambeth-street, on Tuesday, the 27th; I am quite sure of his person- I did not know him before; I have not found my watch- it was worth 20s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q. You turned to look at a horse - were you not rather flurried? A. Not at all; it was not running towards me - the rains hung at his heels; I turned to look after it, and saw a man, who I do not doubt was the prisoner - it was a bright clear day, but not sun-shiny; there were not many people passing: I am rather hard of hearing, but could hear him- I was very collected; it was in the High-street.</p>

            . On the 26th of December, about twenty minutes past three o'clock, I was standing at Mr. Morley's door at the corner of Angel-alley; I heard the prosecutor say, "I know what you are about;" I looked round, and saw the prisoner against the prosecutor, standing before him; I saw another man run away - I did not see the prisoner do any thing but stand in the way of the prosecutor, to prevent his going after the other man; the prosecutor went after the other man - I knew the other man before, and have frequently seen him and the prisoner together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner wait there till the prosecutor came back? A. He waited a minute, looked up the court, and then went away; I saw the prosecutor come back - I rather think I had seen the prisoner and that man go out together between ten and eleven o'clock that morning, but am not positive.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you remember what kind of a day it was? A. A very fine clear day, not at all foggy- I only observed the prisoner standing in the prosecutor's way - he stood there a minute after the prosecutor was gone after the other man, and walked deliberately to the end of the court, apparently to see what was the matter, then walked away; I did not see him hustle the prosecutor.</p>

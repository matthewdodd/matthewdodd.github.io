               <p>I am warden and constable of Cornhill ward, and street keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner pick a gentleman's pocket? - I did not. Mr. Ghrimes gave me an account of it, and I went and see the prisoner at the corner of Exchange-alley, leaning against the corner of the alley, with this very handkerchief that Mr. Ghrimes has sworn to, wrapped round his wrist.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a red handkerchief with white spots? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept it ever since? - I have. I said I had got a charge against him; I desired him to come along with me. He made no resistance, but he came along with me to the compter; and I found two more handkerchiefs on him, two knives, and a pair of sciffars, and six and thirty shillings worth of stamps, which belonged to one Mr. Hart, the corner of Lombard-street; but he would not prosecute.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When you came up to me, Mr. Rule, you asked me what I was about? I told you I was about nothing, I was very much surprised at your asking me that question; says you, you have been picking a gentleman's pocket of this handkerchief! I says, I am surprised at you, I have had it above three months in my own pocket; says you that is nothing to me, I have got a charge of you, and you must go along with me to the compter; and I immediately acquiesced and went with him.</p>
               <p>Ghrimes. I am positive to the handkerchief that I see him take from the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I should be glad to know whether this young gentleman ever had seen that handkerchief, or had it in his hand before now? - I did before the Lord Mayor, and as soon as it was taken away by the street keeper; I had it in my hand and I am positive it is the same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have a person, if it can he admitted, that can swear to that handkerchief, that I had it for upwards of three months in my own possession, and once in washing it she had it a fortnight in her possission.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - Yes, I know the handkerchief; it is a small spotted one, rather pale and worn, rather in holes, I think there are two or three.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you washed it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the colour of it? - Red and white, rather lightish red; I believe I have washed it half a dozen times; I wash his linen.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you last wash it? - I take it to be six months ago; I have not washed it for him since.</p>
               <p>Court to Rule. Are there any holes in it? - Several. I did not take it from him till I took him to the compter; I did not know that I had any right to search him till I see him to the compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that woman come to him in the compter, or see the handkerchief that day? - No; I did not know that he had such a woman belonging to him.</p>
               <p>Q. To Gbrimes. How far was he from; you when you see him take it? - About two yards. I see it continually in his hand; he never put it in his pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Chequer-square, Aldgate. On the night of the 31st of March I was in Whitechapel—a woman came and asked me to give her something to drink—it was past twelve o'clock—it was not two—I went to a public-house with her, and had something to drink—I had been drinking—I cannot say I was sober—I know I went into the house, and some person struck me in the eye—I was not dead drunk; I could walk—I cannot recollect everything that was done—I cannot say that I know everything that occurred—if I had been in a sober state of mind I should not have gone into the house—I know part of what was going on—we had some<lb></lb>thing to drink; I do not recollect what—I think I paid for it—I was struck by somebody; I do not know who—I saw Nelson inside the house—when I was struck he laid hold of me, and I felt a check at the guard of my watch—I am sure it was there when I went in, for it was there when I got outside—it was round my neck—when I felt the check I cried out, "Don't rob me"—I went out and called for the police—there were several persons, but I do not know who they were—I think the man that struck me had a light coat—I do not think it was either of the prisoners, but Lloyd struck me outside—Nelson did not strike me at all, to my knowledge—he was inside when Lloyd struck me outside—when I got out I missed my watch-guard and the seals, but the watch remained in my fob—I gave it to the policeman, and told him about the others being gone.</p>

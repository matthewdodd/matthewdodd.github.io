On the morning of the 25th of October I went on board, and saw him standing near the bread-room, where these cases had been; I saw something in his hand; he stepped aside, and put it down; I found the lock of the bread-room drawn, and the staple out; I went to a little cabin which I saw the prisoner go into; he kept pressing the door too; I told him to move, which he did very slowly, and I there found those cases; I said, "You rascal, is this the return you make for what I have done for you!" he said he knew nothing about them; I went and called the carpenter; he then said he had taken one case to ask what it was.</p>

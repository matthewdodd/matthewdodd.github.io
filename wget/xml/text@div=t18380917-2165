                  </hi>. I live at No. 69, Brook—street, Lambeth—I am not in any business. I was formerly in the employ of the East India Company—in 1834, I was pensioned off by the Company, after long ser<lb></lb>vice, at the expiration of their charter—I had a brother, named Willams Bricknell—he died at the beginning of 1834—at his death I came into per<lb></lb>session of a freehold estate at Stock well—it consisted of houses, with garden ground attached to them—they were underlet to Mr. Bricknell—I afterwards took possession of the premises, and was looking for a tenant for then—I was at that time acquainted with a gentleman, named Patten, who resided it Medway—street, Milbank—I was in the habit of visiting him—I because acquainted with the prisoner about the time I came into possession of the property—I first saw him at Mr. Patten's—he married one of his daughter—he is a surveyor, I believe—I told him I wished to get another tenant for my property, and he said he would take or purchase it—I had before that become acquainted with a person named Potter, who is a brick-layer and plasterer, in Clapham—road—I first saw him by his coming on my premises while I was there—he made me an offer for the premised, and I accepted it—that was in September, 1835—there was a written agree<lb></lb>ment between us, which was prepared by Mr. Kempster, Potter's solicitor—the paper was executed and signed the day after he made me the offer—I saw the prisoner very shortly after, and told him I had entered into an agreement with Mr. Potter, and had granted him a term for ninety—nine years, at 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—the prisoner said it was a very imprudent agreement on my part; that I had had advantage taken of me—I had received sixty guineas rent before for it—the prisoner said if he had taken them he would repair the place and build on it, and he said if I wrote him a letter, dating the letter before the agreement with Potter's it would do away with Potter's agreement—I have seen the prisoner write, and believe this (a paper) to be his writing—I received it, I suppose, two months after the conversation I have mentioned—when he presented it to me he told me this was the way my paper should be drawn out for my security, and it would then do away with Potter's Chancery suit; I should be quite safe—Potter had taken pro<lb></lb>ceedings in Chancery against me—I agreed to this proposal, and he said if I went to Mr. Moore I should get the necessary deeds prepared there—I afterwards received this letter—I believe it to be the prisoner's hand<lb></lb>writing.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183809170053"></xptr>
               <p>"1. A short agreement must be made, and dated in September, to show that the sale was effected at that time, in case any inquiry should arise as to the time of making the sale; this is not absolutely necessary, but it will look better.</p>
               <p>"2. An assignment must be made to enable me to grant leases, and to render me safe in making improvements, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>"3. A deed must be held by Mr. Bricknell, to secure to him a perpetual rent—charge, and also a penal sum of 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to secure to him the re—possession of the freehold in years. This term should be long enough to allow of the Chancery proceedings being brought to a close, or aban<lb></lb>doned.</p>
               <p>"4. The same deed must secure to me the granting of a lease for seventy years, otherwise the lease I grant would be bad."</p>

               <p>"Dear Sir,—I am sorry to hear that you have been in any trouble about Potter, in regard to your letting the Stockwell property to him. I have no idea that the Court of Chancery will compel you to confirm an im<lb></lb>prudent and injurious contract, entered into in an unguarded moment, and by surprise, and which must necessarily be highly injurious to the interest of your successors; and as far as I am concerned in the purchase of the property—I beg you to make yourself perfectly easy, for let the matter terminate how it may, I entirely exonerate you from any liability on my account, not doubting in the least that you have acted in the matter with perfect integrity throughout. I beg to remain, dear Sir, your very obedient and faithful servant—<hi rend="smallCaps">J. STANFORD</hi>."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re—examined. Q.</hi> Did he tell you, at any time, the use you were to make of the letter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—in case Mr. Potter should be very troublesome with me, I was to be sure he would take no advantage of it—that it would exonerate me for any trouble he (Mr. Stanford) might get into—in consequence of his directions I went to Mr. Moore, in the begin<lb></lb>ning of January, 1836—Mr. Moore was quite a stranger to me then—I had quite a difficulty to find his house out—I went there again a day or two after, on the 6th, and Mr. Moore then produced these deeds to me, which I exe<lb></lb>cuted at six o'clock in the evening—I paid him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to allow me to execute them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any other deed executed about the same time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, that was the only one, except the rent—charge deed, which was exe<lb></lb>cuted about a month after—(<hi rend="italic">this being read, was an agreement, dated 26th January, between Samuel Bricknell and the prisoner, conveying the premises to the prisoner, in consideration of</hi> 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—no portion of that 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was ever paid to me—(looking at some deeds)—I cannot precisely say the time I executed these deeds—it was after these time Mr. Moore moved from Harley—street to chambers—it was about a month after the other deeds, I believe—I went and executed them by Mr. Stanford's directions—he said he be<lb></lb>lieved they were ready, and I went, and by chance met him there—I un<lb></lb>derstood from him the object of those deeds before I executed them—he said I should be secured by a rent—charge—(<hi rend="italic">the deed was here read, dated 28th January, 1836, which set out that the </hi>850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had not been actually paid, And agreeing to lake in lieu of the same a rent—charge of 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per annum</hi>, &amp;c.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time you executed these latter deeds, in whose possession were the title—deeds of the property? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In Mr. Stanford's—he had ob<lb></lb>tained</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183809170054"></xptr>
               <p>them from me the beginning of November, 1835, as soon as potter filed his bill—before that they had been kept in the Bank of England—I gave them to Mr. Stanford, because Potter filed a bill in Chancery against me—Stanford saw the bill, and in reading the bill he said they would take my deeds from me—I asked him how I was to save them—he said give them to him, and he would send them to his banker's—in consequence of that I took them from the Bank of England, and gave them to him—I had no conversation about outstanding terms at the time I executed there latter deeds—after executing the deeds I was told that Mr. Hele was in possession of the premises—I saw a copy of his notice to the tenants—in consequence of that I was advised to file a bill in Chancery against the prisoner and Mr. Hele.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Veal, from the Six Clerks Office, here produced the bill dated 9th, March, 1838, also Stanford's answer to the same, dated 26th June, 1838</hi>.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was it you first became acquainted with the contents of the answer to the bill you filed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—it was two months ago I suppose—in consequence of that I went to the office of Edwards and Wormald to make inquiry, and was there shown the deed in question—this signature to it, purporting to be mine, is not my writing—it was not made with my knowledge or authority—I never executed any deed referring to this matter but in the presence of Mr. Moore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before the prisoner's answer was read to you, did you know of the existence of any deed which purported to be executed by yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, months ago, by telling the circumstance to a friend of mine, he told me I had absolutely conveyed my property away, because I had assigned the outstanding terms—that was, I think, some months before I filed the bill—I had never seen the deed till I went on the occasion I have named, after hearing the answer read—I went before the Magistrate, I belive, about a week after I saw the deed, and complained of this offence—I pub<lb></lb>lished bills on discovering this, offering a reward for the prisoner—I caused him to be sought for, and a warrant was issued for his apprehension—I after<lb></lb>wards received information where he was, and found him at the Lock-up house in Carey—street, a prisoner for debt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> By the answer which has been read, it is stated the deed was executed at Leicester, in April; where were you in the early part of April, 1836? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At home, in London—I was not at Leicester at that time, nor for years before—I was living at my accustomed residence in April, and was very frequently in the habit of seeing the prisoner about that time—the dispute between Potter and myself was arranged last June twelvemonths—I have not received any of the rent—charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR FREDERICK POLLOCK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have left the question unfinished about Potter—did you not pay Potter a sum of money to dispose of the suit? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I paid him his expenses, amounting to about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think—I did not give him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides—I gave him what was asked altogether—I believe it included the costs——I do not pre<lb></lb>cisely know what was paid—I have receipts at home for it—I will not swear it was exactly 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think I can swear it was not 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—it was above 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—part was for costs, and part to satisfy him—he said, "I have been to an expense, treating people, and so on, I will take a sum of money—and I paid him—I cannot say how many months I was acquainted with the assignment of the outstanding terms before I filed the bill—six or seven, or ten months—my bill was filed in March—I might have known of it ten months before—as far back as May, 1837, very likely—it was not</p>

               <p>so far back as 1836—it might have been twelve months back—I think not more because I lost sight of the gentleman who gave me the information—he was then living at Mr. Wright's, who is one of the trustees—my present solicitor, Mr. Hodgkinson, prepared the bill—the reason it was not come before was, they did not choose to go on with it—I was desirous—I saw the answer I suppose about two months after the bill was filed—Mr. Sanford, I believe, owns a house in Pall Mall—I have been there repeat<lb></lb>edly—I knew he lived there—he is a married man, and has one child, I believe—he has been married two or three years, I suppose—I knew him as a single man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now did not you go to his house in Pall Mall, and against the pillars of that house stick certain placards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They might be stuck there, I do not stick them—I went there with some in my hand, and gave one into the house—I do not think I gave more—I cannot tell what became of the rest—several were distributed—I have got some of them now by me—I do not know that I directed them to be stuck on Mr. Stanford's houses—they might do what they liked with them—they might be about the pillars—I dare say that was done by my directions.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, when before the Magistrate, did you make any charge against Mr. Stanford for forgery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—there were very few words said—the Magistrate advised me to put in bail—I told the Magistrate the circum<lb></lb>stances, and asked him for a warrant—he said it was out of his district, or else he should have no hesitation under the circumstances to grant it—it was Mr. Trail—I did not prefer an indictment against Mr. Stanford for forgray till after I was indicted for the placard, but I had the intention—I had no intention of doing so till I saw the instrument itself—I had been told of its existence, and I took steps about it months ago—I employed Mr. Watts, a solicitor—I do not suppose he is here—this is not my hand<lb></lb>writing—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the signature of a letter which was doubled down</hi>.)—I</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not exactly prepared to say whether I shall ex<lb></lb>pose my affairs—I only appeal to you as a gentleman—I have some in Commercial—road—there was at one time a notion that a rail—road might pass there—I did not consult Mr. Stanford on the subject—I had some conversation with him about it—I see in his answer he speaks of it, but I did not take his opinion about it—I had no occasion to ask his opinion about it—common conversation occurred that I had a house or two there, and should be glad, as it would better pay me, if they went over it—I have the ground—rent of four small houses there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the latter end of 1836—it was because he did not pay me the rent charge, and I saw there was a deficiency somewhere—I went to his house in Pall Mall—I do not know when that was—it was the latter end of 1836.</p>

In 1836 I was practising in my profession in Harley street—I know Mr. Stanford, and also Mr. Bricknell, the prose<lb></lb>cutor—I gave instructions to Counsel to prepare some deeds in which they were parties—I received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Bricknell on account of the ex<lb></lb>panses—Mr. Stanford first mentioned the circumstance to me, and I be<lb></lb>lieve Mr. Bricknell was also with him several times subsequently—Mr. Stanford brought the draft of conveyance to me previously prepared, and stated it was the sale of the premises by Mr. Bricknell to him, but it was agreed between them that the consideration—money was not to be paid, but in lien a rent—charge of 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be given—I laid the instructions before Mr. Jarman, and requested him to prepare the conveyance—there was a reference to the rent—charge in the conveyance—on my giving instructions to Mr. Jarman, he required an endorsement of the rent—charge on the deed—I explained the circumstance both to Mr. Bricknell and Mr. Stanford, and requested the endorsement should be made—they both objected to it, Mr. Bricknell saying he was perfectly satisfied with the conveyance, and objected to it with Mr. Stanford—I requested the parties to sign a memorandum, stating it was their express desire the endorsement was not made—I explained it, I apprehend, as fully as I possibly could to both parties—I understood Mr. Bricknell and Mr. Stanford were connected by marriage—I thought Mr. Stanford had married a relation of Mr. Bricknell's—I cannot state from which of them I heard that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the course of your communication with them, did you ever hear any thing or have any thing to do with any assignment of terms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I</p>

               <p>never had any thing to do with any assignment of terms; but on looking at my papers, I find a note written by Mr. Stanford to me, which has reference to an assignment, but I never heard of the existence of a deed—(<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>ducing the note</hi>.)—I received this note subsequent to the execution of all the deeds, and their being given up—I never saw this deed assigning the outstanding leases till the last time I was called here last Sessions—Mr. Stanford never gave that deed to me to get executed by Mr. Bricknell—I never heard any thing of the party.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you attorney for both parties, or only for Mr. Bricknell or Mr. Stanford? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Both parties—I first knew Mr. Stan<lb></lb>ford; but I was concerned for both parties—Mr. Bricknell paid me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of fees to counsel, and so on—I received this note at the time it is endorsed by me—he says in it that he will call on me about the outstanding terms, but I never heard of it before, and never saw him about it after wards—he says, "I will call about the proceedings of my brother"—he did not call about his brother's proceedings—about June I was absent from my business—I think not before—I am occasionally absent from business—a lad in the office attends to the business while I am out—I do not know a person named Piper, to my knowledge—I never heard of the name—I was not absent then from pecuniary difficulties—I was subse<lb></lb>quently—I was neither in prison or out of the way—I was in the Isle of Wight at that time, in March, April, or May—to the best of my recollection I was not absent during any part of April—J cannot positively swear it without consideration, but I could if I were to refer to my dates—I was not in confinement then, but I was in December, 1836—I was taken in exe<lb></lb>cution—I think those difficulties existed in the month of April.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As near as you can tell us, in what month was it is he finally ceased to have any thing to do with the parties or their deeds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of recollection, the last communication I had with Mr. Brick<lb></lb>nell or Mr. Stanford on the subject, was at the date of the note in March—I had nothing to do with either of them in my office since that—I forget the name of the lad I left in my office while I was absent, but his mother keeps a shop in the passage between Lincoln's—inn and Lincoln's-inn fields—he is twelve or fourteen years old.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an attorney, carrying on busines in partnership with Mr. Wormald; our office is at No. 12, Great James-street, Bedford—row. The draft of this freehold conveyance was prepared by Mr. Carter, who has chambers in the house; in fact, the whole house is his property—the prisoner came to make an apology, in having removed the draft from Mr. Carter's office—he said he considered there was a delay in the business, and had taken it to another attorney, and got it engrossed—I am not certain that he mentioned the attorney's name—he wanted to raise 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the estate—I had a client at that time of the name of Hele—I negotiated between the parties for Mr. Hele to advance the money—when the terms were agreed to, Mr. Stanford brought me the title—deeds, and I pro<lb></lb>ceeded to investigate the title—the draft of the freehold conveyance was prepared in our office—the rent—charge was not—I never heard of that for a long time afterwards—when I proceeded to investigate the title I found outstanding terms which must be got in—I told the prisoner they must be called in, and assigned to fresh trustees—he made some little objection, but at last said, of course, if I insisted on it, it should be done—the draft of the deed of assignment of terms had been prepared by Mr. Carter at the time of</p>

               <p>the conveyance, and finding that was not executed, I insisted on its being executed—I forwarded the draft to the solicitor of the trustees for his ap<lb></lb>oval, and afterwards, on its being returned, got it engrossed—it was then executed by the trustees, after it had been executed by Mr. Stanford, and thought to me as executed by Mr. Bricknell—I gave it into the hands of Stanford to have it executed by Mr. Bricknell—at that time it was not executed by either of the trustees—it was executed in my office by the prisoner, and witnessed by my clerk—he told me Mr. Bricknell was gone to Leicester, and the deed must be sent there to him—he told me Mr. Bricknell at Leicester on the same day as I delivered the engrossed deed to him—was all one conversation—it was first intended I should send it by coach, but in the course of the conversation, there seemed some doubt whether he had got the correct address of Mr. Bricknell at Leicester, and I trusted the to him, that he should go to Mr. Bricknell's house, to ascertain the correct address—I wrote a letter to Mr. Bricknell by his direction, as to how it was to be executed, and it was put into the parcel—I cannot be cer<lb></lb>tain whether I told the prisoner how it should be witnessed—I gave him he letter and deed, made up in a parcel—I did not know where Mr. Brick-lived at that time, except so far as the address said, at Lambeth—I had never seen him then—this was on the 21st of April, 1836—on looking at my papers, it appears I saw the deed again on the 25th of April, because on that say I forwarded it to Mr. Wright, the solicitor of the trustees, for execution—the prisoner brought it to me on the 25th of April, purporting to be exe<lb></lb>cuted by Mr. Bricknell—that was at my office in Gray's—inn—he did not tell one in what way it was executed—he brought it back, saying, "Here it is, executed," and, of course, I asked him no questions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If I understand your statement right, the original draft of the assignment of terms was prepared along with the lease and re-lease, as part and parcel of that transaction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly, and they were all intended to be executed together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you any reason to know that Mr. Stanford left behind him the assignment of terms at Mr. Carter's chambers from anything but in<lb></lb>advertence or omission? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I look upon it he thought the other deed quite sufficient, and did not know the distinction—I did not see Mr. Brick<lb></lb>nell at all about the matter at that time—I did not see him at the time the drafts were prepared—the assignment of terms was, as a matter of course, to be executed with the other deeds—the draft of the re—lease was gone from the chambers—I was very angry, and Mr. Stanford apologised and explained how it arose—I never corresponded with Mr. Bricknell, or saw him write—I parted with the document said to be forged on the 21st, and got it back on the 25th.</p>

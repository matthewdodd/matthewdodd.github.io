                  </hi>. I am mate of the <hi rend="italic">St. Jean</hi> packet which trades between New York and London. On the 2nd of June she was in St. Catharine's Dock—George Watson was the cook—about three months ago be fell against the side of the vessel, and hurt his side a good deal—he was confined to his bed for two or three days—I do not know which side he hurt, but think it was the left—he was a lusty man—I endeavoured to ascer<lb></lb>tain whether he had fractured a rib, but could not, as he was so lusty—he returned to duty in two or three days, and I thought him in perfect health—on the 2nd of June, in the evening, the prisoner, who was steward of the vessel, told Watson to bring up some dirty plates out of the cabin—he refused, saying it was none of his business, but it was so—he went down after being told two or three times, and brought them up—after he came on deck some words passed between them, which I did not hear, but they did not appear exactly in good temper, and after some time I heard the cook say he would thrash him in five or ten minutes, and if he liked be would do it now, if he would step on shore—the prisoner made no answer, and no other words passed—the cook put down a basket he bad in his hand, turned himself round suddenly, and put himself in a fighting attitude—he was four or five yards from the prisoner, who then put himself in an attitude to fight—he stripped off his waistcoat and went towards him—they then got close together—I went to part them, and succeeded in doing it directly—I sent the prisoner to the cabin, and the cook to the galley—I did not see a blow struck by either party—I was close to the prisoner, and if there had been a blow, I think I must have heard it, if not seen it—I could not see their fists—after the scuffle, the cook said he had not struck the prisoner, but intended as soon as he could get hold of him—I heard no more of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in the New-road. On the 3rd of June, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, I was called to see the deceased at his residence—he was not in bed—he com<lb></lb>plained of pain in the left side—I found bruises, and a discoloration of the skin—I pressed on it, and it produced considerable inconvenience—on making the pressure with my hand, I found a distinct cracking on the left side, indicating a fracture of the rib—there was a drawing of his breath, accompanied with pain—I ordered him to bed, and saw him next morning—on my first visit, I ordered ten leeches to his side, with proper medicine—next morning I encircled the chest with a roller—the remedies gave him relief—he died on the 10th—I examined his body—there was the same discoloration of the skin—on opening the body, on the left side of</p>

               <p>the lungs, there was a considerable quantity of fluid—an oblique fracture of the left rib—the left lung was in a state of collapse, and on the right side there were general adhesions of some date—the right lung was considerably contested—the other organs were healthy—the ribs were most likely dis<lb></lb>turbed in opening the body—his death was caused by the inflammation on the left side, the effusion of fluid in the cavity of the pleura—the inflammation was caused by the fractured rib, which appeared recent—I cannot particularize any time—I should not think it could be two months, from the appearance—a fracture may be caused by a variety of causes—I suppose this was caused by a blow—I think it must have been a very severe blow, if it was in a fight.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

            ; we live in Rockingham-row, New Kent-road. On the 21st of June I was going to Bedford-square, to pay some money, and had the property stated in the indictment in my reticule; I had received the notes at Sir R. Carr Glyn's bank, about the 8th of June; I am sure they were part of the money - I had put them into my reticule: I left home a little after ten o'clock, and twisted the strings of my reticule round my finger. I came to Charing-cross by the stage; the money was then all safe. I was proceeding up <placeName id="t18270913-3-crimeloc20">George-street</placeName>

I saw a man running immediately before me, round Buckeridge-street; I rose immediately, and followed him; I called Stop thief! two or three times, but no one came to my assistance. I was robbed close to the door of the public-house: I observed nothing against the house; I followed the man who was running - he was the one in the brown coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Up to that time had you seen the face of the man in the brown coat? A. I consider that I had, as he looked at me, and I believe the man who was running was the same, I gave information at the office: one Flanagan was afterwards taken, on suspicion of being one of the persons at the post: I stated to the Magistrate, that I believed him to be the person, from his great likeness to the present prisoner: I cannot say that the prisoner is the man, but, as it was proved that the other man was not one, I believe the prisoner to be the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You believed the other to be the person? A. At that time I did. I never stated to the Magistrate that the prisoner was not the person- I did not consider him to be the man at that time. I went to Marlborough-street with some officers one or two days after the robbery, and several men were produced to me - I cannot say whether Riley was one of them, but I fancy he was; I did not then think that I had seen the right man. I had a very imperfect view of the man who robbed me; I shook my head, and said I did not see the man as I thought- I had a very imperfect light, and could not distinguish the features of any one of them. Flanagan was afterwards taken by my description, and I said I believed him to be the man - I spoke distinctly to him; the prisoner was committed about a fortnight after I had seen the three men, and he had been produced to me twice in that time I think. I was present when a painter and a boy were examined.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was Hems, the painter, present when Flanagan was first examined? A. No; he was at the last examination.</p>

            . I am a painter, and live in Eden-street, Regent-street. On the 21st of June I was employed in painting Tristram's public-house; I began on the 20th. On the 21st, about a quarter before twelve o'clock, I was on a ladder painting the lower window in Buckeridge-street, which forms a corner with George-street; I heard a faint voice below cry Stop thief! I got down immediately, and saw Mrs. Macpherson - she went on three or four yards ahead of me; I had seen a person running past me before I heard the cry of Stop thief! - it might be two minutes before - he came running out of George-street from Mrs. Macpherson, at the rate of about five miles an hour; it was as much as he could do to clear my ladder. When I first saw Mrs. Macpherson she was running past me, all over mud, and her reticule strings were hanging down. I can swear that Riley is the man who ran by, before I heard the alarm- he had his hand clasped up to his side as if he had something tucked up; he had a kind of snuff-coloured long coat on, corduroy or fustian trousers, white stockings, and half-boots laced up. I was first examined at the office on the Thursday-week after the robbery: nothing has been said to me by either of the prisoners as to my attending here or elsewhere, but there has been by other persons - the man was in my view a quarter or half a minute; I saw his face perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Were you not afraid of falling from your ladder? A. Yes; I got down directly.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130007"></xptr>COURT. Q. After this happened did you go into the public-house? A. Not till I went in for my dinner. I then saw the landlord in the bar, and was going to speak to him about the man running by, but a butcher, who was with me, asked if I had seen any thing of the robbery: I said I had. Tristram called me to him, and said the less I said about it the better.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is the butcher here now? A. No; I think Tristram must have heard me, for I went to the bar to get some beer, and he beckoned to me with his finger, and I understood then that he wanted to speak to me; several people were in the house - I cannot say whether any were in the bar; I did not know Tristram till I went there to work; he said, "The less you say the better - I speak for your own good."</p>

            . I am twelve years old, and live with my parents in George-street. On Thursday, the 21st of June, I saw the prosecutrix in George-street, near the Cock public-house; I saw the prisoner Riley go up to her - he caught hold of her by the side, took hold of her reticule, and pulled her down on the ground; he then ran round the corner into Buckeridge-street; he wore a brown snuff-coloured coat, and corduroy trousers: I had seen him along with two more, who went away when he went up to Mrs. Macpherson. I saw him again between six and seven o'clock the same evening, in George-street, in the same coat, and he has it on now. I was was taken before the Justice next day; a person was shown to me there, but that was not Riley. Mrs. Macpherson was there, and I knew her to be the lady I had seen robbed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Were you taken to Clerkenwell prison? A. Duke, the officer, took me there - it might be a month after this; Hems was not there; I saw Hems at the time of the robbery; I was very near him, but did not speak about it; I mentioned it the same evening to Mr. Clock, at the coach-makers in Russel-street; I did not know Hems before; he had the same coat on in the evening as he has now, but at the time he committed the offence he was dressed different.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You told Mr. Clock, at the coach-makers in Russell-street, of it the same evening; was that the house Mrs. Macpherson was taken to on the occasion? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 21st of June I went to Tristram's, the Cock public-house, in George-street, St. Giles', twice, and saw him both times, but said nothing to him till the second time, which was at night; I told him the Magistrates of our office were very angry at a robbery having been committed at his door at twelve o'clock in the day, and that he seemed to know nothing at all about it; I told him to inquire and learn out who it was, and let me know; he said all he could learn was, that it was a little boy in a fustian jacket: I described the nature of the robbery to him, and said the lady had been robbed of two 10l. and two 5l. notes, six sovereigns, and some silver. Fagan, a patrol, was with me. I called upon him several times afterwards, but never could get any further information. I have two notes which were sent to me by Mrs. Macpherson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not always find him at home? A. I did; he always gave the same account; I did not give him the number or date of the notes; he has been out on bail, and surrendered to day.</p>

             re-examined. These two notes have certainly been paid into the Bank, for they are cancelled.</p>

            . I accompanied Duke to Tristram's house, and heard him state the amount of the notes lost. I was afterwards sent from our office with a summons for Tristram to attend Riley's examination, and took him there with me; I told him I brought him there about two notes which were traced to him, and had been stolen from a lady in George-street: he said two notes were exchanged at his house on the Monday after the robbery, by a man who had a glass of brandy and water; I asked if he knew him or had taken his address: he said he never saw him in his life before. I said it was a strange thing that he should take two 10l. notes of a stranger; he said he had frequently done so; that he exchanged notes for any one who called there, and never took their addresses.</p>
               <p>RILEY's Defence. At the office I was brought out by myself for the lady to look at me - she said I was not the man.</p>

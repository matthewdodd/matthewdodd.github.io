I was sweeping the door at eight o'clock on the morning of the 16th of June; the prisoner came up to me and said he had helped to build the Institution, and was desirous to see it; I said he might come in and look at it; I then went to breakfast; my wife said there was a stranger in the yard; I got up and saw that he had got into the shrubbery; he went and took a stove that stood there, and put it over the rails; he then got over himself; I ran down to Staple's-inn, to the porter; we followed; he was taken in Cursitor-street with it; he said a man had employed him to carry it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am agent to the Solicitor to the Treasury—on the night of 23rd September, in consequence of information, I went to Old Street Station, and saw the two prisoners, and several constables, one of whom, Boultbee, gave me four packets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), each containing ten bad sixpences, separately wrapped in paper—I said to Horse, "You will have to account for the possession of this, it is counterfeit coin"—he said, "I know nothing about it, there was nothing found on me"—Smith said, "Don't you though; I won't say any more about it here, but I will elsewhere"—Miller said in their presence, that he had been watching them a considerable time.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). On 21st September, I was with Boultbee, in the City Road, and saw the two prisoners and another man and woman—I watched them from 7 till 8.45; they went into the Green Gate, stopped there some time, and then came out and went over the City Bridge Road to a public-house, where they sat in the garden, and then came back to the Green Gate—I seized Smith, and Boultbee seized Horse—I had been into the houses and made inquiries—I said to West who was crossing the road, "I will hold this <hi rend="italic">chap,</hi> and you search him"—Howse, who was close by, said "If he has got any counterfeit coin about him, I know nothing about it"—nothing had been said about counterfeit coin—I saw West take off Smith's cap, and take four packages of money from it.</p>

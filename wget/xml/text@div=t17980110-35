               <p>VALENTINE ROMLEY sworn. - I am a watch-house-keeper of St. Giles's; two patrols brought the prisoner to me at the watch-house, as a suspicious person, on the 15th of December, Friday night, a little before eight, there was a bag of tools brought in with them; I searched the prisoner, and found three planes in his pocket, with the assistance of the patrol, and they were sworn to the next day.</p>
               <p>TIMOTHY PENDEGRAST sworn. - I am a patrol of St. Giles's parish; on Friday the 15th of December, about a quarter before eight, my partner and I were standing at the corner of Compton-street, opposite St. Giles's-church, and we saw the prisoner at the bar, and another man, with some carpenter's tools in their custody, and we thought sit to apprehend him; there were some in a bag, the prisoner had three planes in his pocket, and two saws in his hand, one belonging to the prosecutor, and one to another man; the other man had a bag, and he made his escape, he ran away and left the bag behind him; we took the prisoner to the watch-house, with the three planes and the two saws.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BURN sworn. - I was in company with Pendegrast, I know no more of it than he does; the two men both took us to a pawnbroker, to give them a character, that we might not take them to the watch-house, there were seven planes in the bag; we took the planes to Marlborough-street, and the watch-house-keeper has had them ever since. (Romley produced the property which was deposed to by Judge.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The young man that was with me, told me, he would give me a pot of beer to help him to carry these tools, and in Compton-street these watchmen stopped us.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

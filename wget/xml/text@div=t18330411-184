               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Are you a coachman? A. Yes, and have been so for twenty-six years; the prisoner's omnibus was not galloping at all - I did not see him whip the horses; I know, by experience, that when horses get to a piece of fresh gravel, they make an additional exertion to get over it - there was some fresh gravel at this place; the prisoner did his utmost to stop his horses - I did not hear him use the expressions which have been stated; I did not hear a sancy word out of his mouth - Mr. Kid got down and gave what assistance he could; I have no notion of seeing either of these witnesses there at all, but I spoke to Randall after the accident; I knew the deceased - he was a very old man, and I think he was rather deaf.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, have you not been examined by the attorney for the prisoner? A. I have seen this gentleman, and told him what I had to say; Gook, the officer, sent me word to attend, but I believe the attorney for the defendant sent for me to attend the Coroner.</p>

            . I saw this accident - I was thirty or forty yards off when it happened; I was speaking to a young man named Randall - I saw the omnibuses galloping, Mr. Kid's particularly - the prisoner was whipping right and left; the poor man was crossing the road, and the near wheel knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you bound over by the Coroner? A. I gave my oath before the Coroner, and he ordered me to attend at Queen-square.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's master; he has been three or four months in my employ - I was on the steps of the omnibus at the time; one of the horses was not galloping, I could not see the other - the prisoner stopped instantly, got down and ordered a coach, and said he would pay for it; he was in tears the moment he got off the box- both the prisoner and I called the coach; I have a horse-keeper, whose business it is to put curbs on the horses, but he had not done so that day, which made them require more strength to pull them in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What deodand was put upon the omnibus? A.20l.; I attended at the hospital, and saw the deceased several times - I did not see him when dead; the prisoner was not crossing to pass the omnibus which was in front of him, but there was some loose granite on the road, which was a little worn in the centre, and I conjecture he went there for that reason - we were between forty and fifty yards behind the other omnibus at the time.</p>

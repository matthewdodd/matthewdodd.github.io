               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, three days before, and I believe he took my money. My money was in my pocket-book, and my pocket book was in my waistcoat pocket, and my passport was with my money. When I went to bed I put my waistcoat under my head.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the pocket book - A. Twenty doubloons and my passport; a doubloon in Spain is worth sixteen Spanish dollars. In the morning I got up at six o'clock, I could not find the waistcoat, the doubloons were gone, and the passport. I found the pocket-book, there is nothing in it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember Gotty the prosecutor coming to your house - A. Colman the prisoner brought him to my house to lodge; they both slept together in one bed. When Colman first brought Gotty was on the Friday evening; he then asked me whether I had room; I said, yes; he then said he had plenty of money, that is the prosecutor had, and on the next morning they both came to my house, they breakfasted and dined at my house; they went to bed at ten o'clock. In the morning Gotty told me in the presence of 
               <persName id="t18111204-30-person337">Colman</persName>
             that Colman attempted to get out of the window, and he opened it for that purpose, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181112040026"></xptr>that he had lost all his money. Upon that I sent for an officer, but the officer was not up. They both went out together at six o'clock in the morning. The prisoner took the prosecutor to a bad house. This was before we had the conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that - A. The prosecutor told me so. About twenty minutes after eight, after they had been out, I saw the officer search the prisoner, there was found on his person two three shilling pieces, two sixpences, and a few halfpence in his pocket. Inside of his stocking was found one doubloon, towards the heel under his foot. Previous to the prisoner being searched the prisoner said he had no money.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 9th of November I went to Mr. Shaw's house, I searched the prisoner, I found one doubloon inside of his stocking close to the heel. He said he had no money. This is the doubloon.</p>

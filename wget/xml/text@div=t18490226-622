Sir,—I am instructed by Mr. Duncan, of 59, Great George-street, Bermondsey, to apply to the London and North Western Railway Company, for compensation for the injuries sustained by his wife, Mrs. Duncan, and his brother-in-law, Mr. O'Brien, while they were travelling as second class passengers on the Company's railway. On Monday, 4th Sept. last, they were coming from York to London, when at Linsland tunnel, near Leighton Buzzard, a collision of trains took place which caused the injuries alluded to. Mrs. Duncan was at the time pregnant, and in consequence the accident caused her to be con<lb></lb>fined four months earlier than she would otherwise have been, and its result also was a miscarriage. The shock of the collision caused her to be thrown forward with great violence from her seat to the one opposite, and thus shook and bruised her, that ever since that time she has been ill, attended by a sur<lb></lb>geon, and almost wholly confined to her bed. Mr. O'Brien, who was in the same carriage with Mrs. Duncan, by the same collision had his knee bruised, and his chest and forehead severely injured; so great was the injury to his lungs that it has caused a spitting of blood ever since. He also has been at tended by a medical gentleman, and like his sister incurred a very heavy medical bill. Yours obediently, John Harrison."</p>

I know nothing about—I was sot consulted about it—it was written entirely without my knowledge—I was requested by Mr. Duncan to bring an action against the Company for the injuries detailed in my letter of 26th Oct.—I refused to bring it—I afterwards heard from a solicitor's clerk that an action had been brought by another attorney—On 16th Dec. I sent this letter (<hi rend="italic">marked C</hi>) with an enclosure to the Company, by the direction of Duncan—I enclosed this copy of a letter by a person named Darke, (<hi rend="italic">D</hi>) which I received by post, it was copied by one of my clerks—I had a communication with Duncan on the subject of Dark's letter before it arrived, and when it did arrive I enclosed a copy of it to the Company by his desire.</p>

Sir,—The medical gentleman representing the Company having seen Mrs. Duncan and Mr. O'Brien several times, is fully aware of the serious injuries sustained by my wife as well as by Mr. O'Brien; you will no doubt be informed by him that Mrs. Duncan is still very ill, requiring great care, quiet, and nourishment, and in the event of her being again pregnant, it will be attended with great danger. Mr. O'Brien has suffered severely from the injuries to his knee and chest, and is still spitting blood; especially at night, when his cough is very bad, which will prevent him from attending to his business for some time; if he should do so before he is thoroughly well it may bring on a relapse, the consequence of which may be very serious. Under these circumstances, I do hope, that we shall not be compelled to pro<lb></lb>ceed on an expensive litigation against so powerful a Company, where the means of a private individual would be perhaps entirely wasted, entailing utter ruin upon ourselves and families, who have already suffered severely enough. I am willing to accept 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the injury to Mrs. Duncan, and Mr. O'Brien is willing to accept 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., provided it is settled this week, as Mr. O'Brien has been informed by his solicitor that unless proceedings are issued directly it cannot be tried this term. In the event of this arrangement not being made, Mr. O'Brien wishes it to be tried as soon as possible, and this letter is of course without prejudice in either case, should we be compelled to have recourse to a Court of Law. An early answer will oblige. Yours obediently, R. Duncan."(<hi rend="italic">C</hi>), "Messrs. Barker, Hayes, Barnwell, and Twisden, solicitors, 1, Lincoln-inn-fields. New Inn, 16th Dec, 1848. Gentlemen,—Duncan and O'Brien, and the London and North Western Rail<lb></lb>way Company. At our last interview I stated to you the willingness of Mrs. Duncan and Mr. O'Brien to make a declaration of the truth of the statement which has already been laid before you relating to the accident they met with on your railway, since then I have had with me Mr. Robert Darke, who is a traveller in the house of Messrs.

               <p>which I think it best to send herewith. Mr. Darke adds, on being questioned by me, that he was coming from York, on 4th Sept., 1848, on his way to London, starting from the former place about five o'clock in the evening, that the accident occurred about three o'clock the next morning. He also states, that Mrs. Duncan was so injured on that occasion as to be obliged to be car<lb></lb>ried into the station. That before the 4th Sept. last, he knew nothing of Mr. O'Brien or Mrs. Duncan, but at that time he gave to the former his name, and the name of the house in Northumberland-street, Strand, which be used when in London. Mr. Darke states his willingness to make a declaration of the fact he has spoken to. He refers to C. H. Millet, Esq., clerk to Messrs. Hunt, solicitors, 10, Whitehall, who will speak to his respectability. Mr. Darke will be in town again on Thursday, when if you desire it, he will call upon you, and repeat the information which is now supplied you. I need scarcely add, that the parties are very desirous of an early determination of this affair to induce you to give an early attention to it. I am, gentlemen, yours obediently, John Harrison."—(<hi rend="italic">D</hi>)," J. Harrison, Esq., 5, New Inn, Strand. 11, Northumberland-street, Strand, Dec. 15th, 1848. Sir,—Mr. O'Brien having made application to me this morning respecting the accident which took place on the North Western Railway on the 5th Sept., I beg to state that I was present, being one of the passengers on that unfortunate occasion, and that I was in the same carriage with Mr. O'Brien and Mrs. Duncan, (whom I afterwards found to be brother and sister) when the accident took place, and afterwards I saw them on the line, and likewise at Leighton Buz<lb></lb>zard, and came to town with them. I was very much shook myself, and did not forget it for several days, but having received no particular injury I did not trou<lb></lb>ble myself about it, nor had I any time, but will not travel by railway again if I can go by any other conveyance. They appeared very much frightened and hurt. I had told Mr. O'Brien that if he wanted me at any time he might depend on me to come forward, if I could do so conveniently, as I considered it a piece of gross negligence somewhere. I will do myself the honour of waiting on you this afternoon at three o'clock, if you wish it, but am leaving town on Saturday. Your obedient servant, R. Darke."</p>

I have never been in the habit of attending fairs—I have attended a fair, as a looker-on—I have not been in the habit of running about to fairs in the country, making nothing, and in no employ<lb></lb>ment—I get my living as a compositor—I have been with Mr. O'Brien two or three times; he is a master printer—I have never been a master printer—I have described myself as such, living at Wilson-street, Brunswick-square—I have taken in jobs on my own account—I remember an action in the Ex<lb></lb>chequer against the Sheriff of Surrey—I then described myself as a muter printer—I do not recollect that I afterwards said I was not a master printer, and lived in Bermondsey—I lived in O'Brien's house at that time, in Ber<lb></lb>mondsey—I was in his employment—I had a brother, named Alfred Darke—he has been dead four years—I lived with him—I did not travel in the country with him—I never went into the country with him—I think I went once with him to Exeter—I do not recollect that there was a third party with us—I was never charged with passing bad money—I had an unfortu<lb></lb>nate brother—I cannot say whether he was unfortunate or not while living with me—I do not remember his being charged with passing bad money—I do not recollect any bad money being made in our house—after I had writ<lb></lb>ten the letter, I went with Duncan to Mr. Harrison's, who asked me some questions about the letter—Mr. Harrison made an alteration in the date, at my suggestion—it was altered from 5th April to 5th Sept.—Mr. Harrison asked me whether I was in the train, and I said I was—it was proposed that I should make an affidavit to that effect, which I did not consent to do—I told them I would make a declaration, that declaration was to contain the terms of the letter—I would not let it go so far as an affidavit—there was no particular inducement made to me to make the declaration, not after I de<lb></lb>livered the two letters to O'Brien—there was no inducement whatever—I was not to have any money—after I delivered the two letters to O'Brien, he said, "I shall be enabled to let you have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," which had been long owing to me for work—he was in my debt, and had been a long time—nothing whatever was said about money before I wrote the letter—I did it without any promise of remuneration; it was done unawares—I had not time to consider—I was entrapped into it—I was obliged to go to Mr. Harrison, but I very soon discovered, after I saw Mr. Harrison, that there was a conspiracy—Mr. Harrison heard of it very soon afterwards, through me.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of John Sinfield, a ship-steward; he is now in China. In Sept. last I lodged at Duncan's house, in George-street, Bermondsey—on 4th Sept. I left some glass at the house, about four in the afternoon—I saw Mrs. Duncan—I was there on the following day; I saw her then, and continued to see her for some time afterwards—I called on 5th, between seven and eight in the evening—I moved in on that day; continued to live in the house, and saw her pretty well every day—I remained there a month—I saw very little of her—she appeared to be well till the last few days—I saw her about the house, doing her duty as mistress of the house day by day—when I saw her on 5th, she was sitting in the kitchen—towards the last few days of the month Mr. Duncan told me that she had been under a surgical operation; that was the first I heard of her illness—she did not give me any account of the illness—I heard nothing about a fall down-stairs, or anything of that sort—I do not know whether any medical man attended her—I cannot say whether she was confined to her bed at all in the early part of the month—I did not see her—I heard that she was confined to her bed for two days—that was on the Thursday before 3d Oct.</p>

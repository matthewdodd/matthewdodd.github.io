               <p>Q. How did he search for it? A. By rubbing his hand against my fob-pocket - another afterwards unbuttoned the flap of my trousers and felt for my watch; I had none - and the one who had felt said "The b-r has got no toy;" they then took off my cravat and then my hat; the man who took off my hat said, "Now give the b - r a rum one;" and the man on my right side said, "Don't hurt the poor b-r;" he then untied the rope and run away; the prisoner Downes is the one who held my left arm, or took my money from my left hand - he either held my left arm or took my money - he stands the second person from the Jury - I am certain he is the person who was in the position I have mentioned - Ore, who is third from the Jury, stood rather in front of me on my right side - I am certain of him - Bishop was standing rather more in front of me, on the right side - he kept pushing Ore and another (who stood rather more in front of me on the right) away to get closer to me - he stands nearest to the Jury - he pushed Ore with his right arm and another with his left, to get closer to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Look attentively at him, and say are you sure of his person? A. I am - Hackman (who stands fourth from the Jury) stood on my left hand, rather in front - I am certain of him - I asked the person, who took my keys, to give me them back as they would be of no use to them - he returned one of them saying, "You b-r, there is your key;" I went into a chandler's-shop, about a yard and a half from where I was robbed; after I left there, I went towards Bethnal-green-road and gave information to West, an officer, and asked him to go with me - I gave him a description of, I believe, seven or eight of the persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these persons presented to you then for the first time, or had you seen them before? A. I had seen them frequently when I have been walking in that neighbourhood by day-light, visiting my patients - I gave information at Worship-street, and accompanied the officers on the following day about the neighbourhood of Whitechapel, and saw a great number of persons of their rank and appearance, but none that I could identify that day - on the following morning I identifield one, and a few days after two others, neither of the prisoners are any of those persons - In consequence of information I received afterwards, I went to a place where one Sarah Holt worked -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260024"></xptr>it was on the Saturday after the robbery; I think Garton accompanied me - he found my two cases of lancets on her - and in consequence of the information we received from her, the prisoner Ore was apprehended - Downes was also apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the robbery did you first see Downes? A. I think it was on the 4th of October at Worship-street-office, he was with two or three others in the yard - I pointed him out myself without any suggestion from any one - Hackman was apprehended, I think, about a week after Downes - I first saw him at Worship-street-office amongst, I suppose, about thirty persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you point him out, or was any suggestion made from any other person? A. I was sitting in the Magistrate's room, and in about a quarter of an hour Mr. Bennet desired me to walk into the office and point out any person I knew - Hackman was then standing in the body of the office, not among the prisoners, and I pointed him out.</p>
               <p>Q. You described seven or eight men to West, did you in particular describe any person at the bar? A. I described Downes and Bishop - Bishop at that time had his hair hanging down his face - I saw him some days after I saw Downes - I saw him at Worship-street, it was before Hackman was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Under what circumstances did you identify Bishop? A. I was taken into the lock-up-room by Gleed, there was about a dozen other prisoners there; I was ordered to pick out the person who robbed me, and I pointed him out without any intimation whatever from any body; I received an order from the Magistrate to go into the room and pick out the man, and I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When, for the first time after the robbery, did you see Ore? A. I saw him at his father's house in Wilmot-street, Bethnal-green, after the robbery, I think about the 20th of September, and I then knew he was one of the persons who were present at the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Immediately after the robbery, you went into a chandler's shop - did you borrow any thing? A. I borrowed a hat of Mr. Fernie, a butcher of Bethnal Green, about eight o'clock that evening - I went first to Mr. Marsden, but he had not got one to fit me. When I went to West and to Mr. Fernie, I had neither hat nor neckcloth- that was just before eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Look once more at the persons of the four prisoners- do you entertain any doubt whatever of their being part of the persons who robbed you that night? A. I have no doubt whatever.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. How are you so particular of your memory as to time? A. The clock struck eight after I borrowed the hat - the transaction might last two or three minutes: I then went to the chandler's-shop kept by Dover - I staid there about five minutes - I saw neither the man nor the woman who kept the shop - I have seen the woman since; she is not the person whom I saw in the shop that night, for that was an elderly person. Fernie lives about half a mile from Dover's, but I had seen West before I went to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a bell rings in that neighbourhood at eight o'clock? A. There used to be, but I do not know whether it is continued. I felt alarmed at first, but when the man on my right said I should not be hurt, I certainly was not so much alarmed then. It was barely twilight - not daylight; it was not daylight nor dark; it was daylight, or nearly so - twilight had not began: they were lighting candles in the chandler's-shop when I was stopped against their door, while the prisoners were committing the assault - it is not uncommon to light candles before dark. I saw the colour of Bishop's clothes - he had a blue coat, and black or dark waistcoat, and dark or blue trousers - Ore had a long blue coat, and black or dark waistcoat; he stood about a foot or a foot and a half from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, on your examination, you could see the person who seized you on the right-hand, but could not observe the man who pinioned your left arm? A. I could not observe the person who pinioned my left arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the prisoners all produced to you in custody? A. Ore was at his father's house - the others were all in some place of confinement. Hackman was in custody, I suppose; though he was in the office, and not among the prisoners, he did not tender himself as a witness for some persons under examination - not to my knowledge. I think it was on the 19th that I went to Ore's father's house; there had been an examination at the Police-office, and I went in consequence of something Holt said; I took my Solicitor with me - this was before the trial took place here last Session, one or two days before, but after a bill had been found by the Grand Jury; I asked him, in his father's presence, if he could give me any information respecting a case of lancets.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he then, upon your certain knowledge of him, taken into custody? A. No; I gave information that night of him, and I think he was taken in about a week afterwards - the conversation at his father's lasted three or four minutes. My lancets were left at Worship-street, in the hands of the officer. I appeared here against three persons last Session, and was positive of all three of them- one of them went away at large, in consequence of his not being active, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to Ore, when you were going away, that it was very fortunate for him he was not acquainted with such characters? A. I believe I said something to that effect.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. - Where had you been to last before the robbery? A. To Mrs. Oliver, a patient, near Fleet-street-hill: I merely spoke to her at her gate, but did not go in - the last house I was in was Mr. Richman's, a gun-maker, in Church-lane, Whitechapel; that is three quarters of a mile from the spot - I came direct from there, only stopped to speak to Mrs. Oliver, I raised a cry of Stop thief! immediately after the robbery; nobody else called Stop thief! I believe; two persons came up, I think; but I cannot speak to the number - I pursued the thieves for ten or twelve yards, up a street, which I think is Fleet-street, calling Stop thief! Some persons came up and begged me to hold my tongue, saying the gang was so desperate, they would murder me if I did not. I then went into the chandler's-shop; some persons came in; I think it was the same two men who came up when I called Stop thief! I think only two came into the shop; I do not recollect more - there was an old lady in the shop, and a woman stood at the door - I only saw two women when I went in, but before I got away there might be a dozen persons at the door - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260025"></xptr>saw no more in the shop - I do not recollect seeing Mrs. Dover that night - I cannot say whether I saw her or not; I was considerably agitated in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to Mrs. Dover, on being asked, that you did not know any of the robbers? A. No, I did not, nor that I could not identify them - on the contrary, I said I should know some of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not repeatedly say, in the hearing of three or four persons in the shop, that you did not know any of them? A. I certainly did not: I do not know a woman named F. Burdet, nor

            . When I got to Bethnal Green, it was a clear starlight night - I might be five minutes going there- it was then a quarter of an hour, or rather more, after the robbery, I suppose a quarter of an hour; it was not dark when the robbery was committed; I heard the clock strike eight after I went for the hat; I was above a hundred yards from the church, and heard it strike distinctly; I went into Fernie's house; I did not count the clock, but I am satisfield it was eight; I know it was after seven, and could not be nine.</p>
               <p>Q. You conclude from those circumstances, and not from counting the clock? A. Yes; I was in the house, and not paying attention whether the bell rang.</p>
               <p>Q. You have sworn to seven people positively - can you swear to more? A. Yes, I should know the man who took my hut: I never said I could swear to sixteen or seventeen- the robbery might last more than two minutes - I am certain of eight persons; the officers took me next day to see some persons, they were not in custody; I suppose I saw a hundred at least - I had eight officers in all; they took me to suspicious persons: I had described the persons to the officers; they took me round the neighbourhood to persons they suspected to be bad characters.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not state on the former trial, that you could not tell who was on your left side? A. No; I said I could not tell the person who pinioned my left arm.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY.* Q. Did you see Bishop except at the Police-office? A. I saw the back of some person one day in Dover's shop; it might be Bishop; he stood with his back to me, I do not know whether it was him.</p>
               <p>*Not Peter Alley, Esq.</p>
               <p>Q. You identified him at the office, and would know him at any time you saw him? A. Yes; I went into Dover's about five minutes after the robbery; it was, I suppose, twenty minutes before eight o'clock; I was robbed at half-past seven - I could not see the whole twenty persons who robbed me; I never said that Bishop stood on my left hand - he stood next to Ore, in front of me, on Ore's right-hand; I did not state at the office that the robbery was committed after eight o'clock; I did not perceive that any of the prisoners had sticks, but some of the gang had - Bishop did not speak to me, he spoke to Ore, and pushed him aside to get more forward.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not a full view of Bishop in Dover's shop? A. I never saw his face after the robbery, till I saw him at the office - I might be two minutes in Dover's shop.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Ore was apprehended a week after you had been to his father's house - when you saw him there, had you any doubt of his being one of the persons who robbed you? A. Not the slightest - I have frequently seen all the prisoners about the neighbourhood before the robbery, and knew them all.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many years have your engagements led you to pass about that neighbourhood? A. I have been in practice in the parish about ten years. I have met them about singly, and at other times in company together - I feel confident of them all - I have not the slightest doubt whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw Ore at his father's house - as you did not doubt about his being concerned, how did it happen that a week elapsed before he was apprehended? A. I complained at the office that he was not taken, and the answer I received was, that the officers had been after him, but could not take him - I gave directions for his apprehension the very evening I had seen him - he had only his shirt and stockings on at his father's, but I knew him the moment I saw him.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Were any of the persons engaged in the transaction without their hats? A. Hackman had no hat, and another whom I have not seen; the other three prisoners had hats - I had seen them about the neighbourhood occasionally, both with and without their hats.</p>

            . I am a butcher and cow-keeper, and live in Church-street, Bethnal Green. On the 11th of September, I saw Mr. Fuller at my house, the corner of Fuller-street - it was, as near as I can state, about ten minutes before eight o'clock; he was without a hat, and had a silk handkerchief round his neck - I lent him a hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you any particular reason for speaking to the time? A. As near as I can tell, that was the time. I had been at the public-house opposite; I went there about half-past seven o'clock, and had been there a quarter of an hour when I was fetched out to him - I did not particularly notice the time that I went to the house - there is a bell rings at eight o'clock; I did not hear it ring - I speak to the best of my belief of the time - when I went to the public-house, the gas-light in my shop was lighted; I do not know how long it had been lighted.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a dark night? A. Middling, I believe; there were lights in the public-house - I was not there long - it was too dark to see without candles - I do not know whether I could distinguish the features of a man out of doors by the light of the sky.</p>

            . I am constable of Bethnal Green. On the evening of the 11th of September, I saw Mr. Fuller in the shop of Mr. Marsden, the churchwarden -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260026"></xptr>there was a crowd round the door. He said he had been robbed a few minutes back, and described a tall person, with a greasy hat, dressed in a black coat - he described several, and said he should know them again - he had neither hat nor cravat on when I saw him - I am certain he said he should know several of them - it was better than twenty minutes to eight o'clock when I saw him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Had you been out on duty that night? A. No, I had been standing in the road, the corner of a turning, where I live - I had been at home, and had been out about ten minutes, when I saw him - I had lighted candles some time before I came out - I did not particularly notice how long - it was a bright starlight night; there was a moon afterwards, I believe; but I did not observe it at the time; there might have been one before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you particularly noticed the time? A. Yes; after I saw Mr. Fuller I went to a public-house, the Blade Bone, five doors off, to get my brother officer, and it wanted then about two minutes to a quarter to eight o'clock.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. In consequence of information I received I went to the house of Sarah Holt, on Saturday, the 16th of September; I went to where she was at work, at Duff and Brooke's, in Spital-square, and accompanied her to a house in Quaker-street; Mr. Fuller was with us - when we got there there was nobody in the house but some children; in the course of a minute she produced these two cases of lancets from her bosom - she told me where she got them. I was at the office on some occasions, when Mr. Fuller was there; I was there when Hackman was - he pointed him out as one of the persons at once, without any hesitation; he was in the office with, I believe, twenty other persons - they were all ordered to put on their hats, then Mr. Fuller was called in, to go into the body of the office, to see if he knew anybody - he went round into the body of the office, and picked Hackman out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any intimation given to him to direct his attention to one person more than another? A. No; the persons all stood just as they were, they were only ordered to put on their hats.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Hackman was not brought there by any warrant or summons? A. No; I believe he had been apprehended the night before, and brought there on a charge - he was in custody: he stood among twenty persons; they were not all prisoners - he was not handcuffed; I do not know of his having been there twice before, offering to give evidence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you go round with the prosecutor the day after the robbery? A. Yes - I did not point any persons out to him; I do not know whether anybody else did: nobody was taken that day in my presence - there were six officers besides me; it was the second day after the robbery.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was done two days after the robbery? A. We accompanied Mr. Fuller with a search-warrant, to a house on Fleet-street-hill - he pointed nobody out to me, nor I to him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had he been there before, as a witness? A. Not to my knowledge; he had been all night in the watch-house, and sat there in his clothes; I and the prisoners stood in the body of the office; the Magistrate was in an elevated seat - the persons in the office stood indiscriminately mixed together; I stood perhaps two yards from Hackman, who stood about the middle of the room - there was one person between me and him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you go with Downes to a person named Bailey, to get the lancets? A. I know he went to a place in Bethnal-green, but I do not know the person's name; I passed the door with him- he rang the bell - whether he got the lancets there I do not know; he gave them to me in Brick-lane, between nine and ten o'clock on Saturday morning - that is about five minutes walk from the house where he rang the bell, but it was the next morning that he gave them to me; Mr. Houghton, whose son had been taken up, told me to apply to him to get the lancets on the Friday, and after that he passed the door, and rang the bell.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you none when you asked for them at first? A. No - a young woman named Kitty Watson lived up stairs in the house, where he rang the bell; she is married,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260027"></xptr>and I do not know her husband's name; I do not know who else lodged there.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you deliver the lancets to the officer? A. Yes, to Garton, or Mr. Fuller - (looking at them), these appear to be the same - he went into the house on Friday night, and on Saturday morning gave them to me.</p>

On his return we went to the Angel and Trumpet public-house, at Stepney, where we arrived about eight o'clock, or a few minutes after; on our way I bought some bread and meat, which we took into a box, where

             were sitting. Now, as I understand the offence was committed after eight o'clock in the evening, I hope you will be satisfied that I could not be one of the offenders, because I was at the time near two miles from the spot. - All, my Lord, that I know about the matter is this: - a woman named Sarah Holt came to me, and said that George Houghton was taken into custody for the robbery, and that, although he was innocent, he might lose his life if the prosecutor swore against him, and she understood the prosecutor only wanted to have his instruments returned to him; I knew Houghton was innocent, because he was at the Angel and Trumpet when we first went there, and being anxious to save an innocent man's life, I undertook what Sarah Holt requested. Having heard that some men named Bailey were concerned, I went with Sarah Holt to John Bailey, who said he knew nothing about the business, and I afterwards went to his brother, William Bailey, who gave the instruments to me - I gave them to Sarah Holt, and she, as I was told, handed them to Houghton's mother, from whom Mr. Fuller and Gooding received them. This, I most solemnly declare, was all I had to do in the affair. I have reason to believe the prosecutor has been misled, and that he was induced more from suspicion and misrepesentation, than from his own recollection, to accuse me and Downes, and afterwards Hackman, whom it was well known was coming as a witness on our behalf - that the prosecutor may believe he is right I do not dispute, because he can have no object in accusing innocent men, but that he cannot safely and prodently swear to so many individuals as he has done, must, I humbly submit, be apparent to every discriminating mind, when it is considered that the offence was committed in the dusk of the evening, that it only occupied, as the prosecutor says, about two minutes - that he must necessarily have been in great trepidation and alarm, and that all the robbers were strangers to him. The prosecutor, at the Police-office, deposed that I was the person who either held his left arm, or took his money from his left-hand pocket - but I am informed, that when giving evidence against Houghton and Boyce he said, that Boyce seized his right arm, and he could not observe who seized the other; these statements, I submit, are inconsistent with each other, and cannot be reconciled. I refrain from making further observation, being well assured that I may safely trust my case to the penetration, justice, and humanity, of your Lordship and the gentlemen of the Jury.</p>
               <p>ORE's Defence (written). My Lord, I most positively and solemnly assert that the prosecutor is entirely mistaken in accusing me of being a party to the wicked offence committed upon him. I am a weaver by trade, and work for my father at his house, where I also live, and where I have every thing provided for me in a comfortable way: I had, therefore, no motive whatever for joining in the crime which is falsely laid to my charge. On the day the robbery was committed, I was in company with Downes and Hackman, in Hare-street and Brick-lane, from about four o'clock in the afternoon, till a little after seven; we then went to my father's house, which is in Wilmot-street, and I went in to get some money, as I was going out to spend the evening, and was in the house more than a quarter of an hour. When I came out I rejoined Hackman and Downes, who were waiting in the street, and we all three went to the Angel and Trumpet public-house, near Stepney church, and there we remained till half-past ten o'clock, and then went home together and separated soon after eleven. I have witnesses to prove this, and to show what time I went to the Angel and Trumpet, and what time I came away. I heard of the robbery being committed, as others did who resided in the neighbourhood; but was neither accused nor suspected, as I believe, of having had any share in it, until I was taken into custody. On the 19th of September, Mr. Fuller, and another gentleman, who, I have since been told, was Mr. May, his attorney, came to my father's house and asked for me - I was at work at the time, and my father called me - I went down as I was, in my shirt-sleeves - they did not accuse me of the robbery, but asked me if I knew Sarah Holt - I said No - they then said she had told them that I had given her the instruments; this I denied, and said I knew nothing about them, nor of what they consisted. They then asked me if I knew George Houghton; I told them I did, and that I saw him last, about eight o'clock, on Monday the 11th of September - they asked me whether I knew Norton, Quay, and some other persons - I said, No; and they answered it was very well for me that I did not know such characters - they next asked me if I knew Downes, and I told them I did. My father said he did not believe that I had any business with the robbery, as there was a good table for me at home, and that when I went out he gave me what money he thought fitting for my years. They then said that they did not come to accuse me of the robbery, but merely to gain intelligence; this was before the trial of Houghton. If the prosecutor had identified me as one of the party, why did he not have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260028"></xptr>me taken up at that time as he ought to have done? Instead of this, he tells me he did not accuse me of the robbery, but that he came to gain intelligence. I heard no more of this business till Downes was taken up, and then my father, knowing I had been with Downes on the night of the robbery, questioned me very seriously about it, and advised me, if I had any hand in it, to get out of the way, and he said he would let me have what money I wanted - but knowing that I was innocent I refused to conceal myself, and remained in my ordinary business, going about as usual, till the 25th of September, when I was taken up, as I believe, for no other reason than to prevent my being a witness for Downes, as I could have proved that he was not at the place when the robbery is stated to have been committed. I had no sort of concern in the affair - my witnesses will shew that I could not have been there - and I leave it to your lordship to determine whether men, who were in my company all the time, are not more entitled to be believed than the prosecutor, alarmed as he must have been, and as he had good reason to be - and when it is considered that the robbery was committed, as the prosecutor says, in about two minutes, and when it was dusk or dark. I am informed that the prosecutor told several people that he could not swear to any of the robbers; yet he has already sworn to three persons, and now swears to four more. He has altered the time of the robbery to account for his taking up the persons who were at the Angel and Trumpet, but all the witnesses say the robbery was committed after eight o'clock, and they knew this from the circumstance of the bell ringing. Thus, it is plain, the robbery was committed at the time we were at the Angel and Trumpet, and could have had no hand in it. I shall not trouble the Court any further than again to declare, and call God to witness, that I am entirely innocent, as are also my fellow-prisoners, Downes and Hackman, who were with me all the evening.</p>
               <p>HACKMAN's Defence. I can say nothing further than what my fellow-prisoners have stated. I believe I was apprehended that I should not be a witness for Downes and Ore; I had several times attended at Mr. Harmer's office to give my deposition, as I could prove their innocence. On the 16th of September I saw Houghton's mother, she asked if I would attend this Court to prove his innocence - I went to several persons that day, whom I knew to be at the Angel and Trumpet, when Houghton was there - I took to her house their addresses and business - she neglected to let me know when the trial was coming on, or I should have been here - Sarah Holt told me she had the instruments from Downes - I went to him, and he said he had them from Bailey - I went and saw Bailey, he said he did give him the instruments, but did not know he was going to give them to the woman - I understand part of the name is erased on one of the instruments.</p>
               <p>MR. FULLER re-examined. These lancets are mine, one of them is marked F. Fuller, which is my brother's initials, but they are mine - the other is marked with the maker's name.</p>

            . I know the prisoner Bishop. I saw him on the 11th of September at eight o'clock at night, that is the nearest hour I can fix - I went with him to the Hospital public-house, Whitechapel-road, and continued there till ten o'clock - he was not out of my sight during that time - he had called for me at No. 1, Hare-marsh, where I live - we got to the public-house about a quarter past eight o'clock - Lewis Tideman and Elizabeth Preston were in company with us there.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are they acquaintances of yours? A. No; I have seen them before, but not to be acquainted with them - I have seen them three or four times before - Preston lives in Wilmot-street - I do not know where Tideman lives - I know more of Preston than him; I have known her two years - she was not acquainted with Bishop that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you fix on eight o'clock? A. Spitalfields bell was ringing eight as Bishop came to my door- it was a darkish night, as far as I recollect - it did not rain, nor did the moon shine - I did not take notice whether the stars were out - Preston and Tideman were drinking by themselves in the public-house - Bishop had half a pint of gin and cloves, and we drank together - I had a full glass, there was not quite a glass each - Bishop had some - I do not know who was helped first - I was helped second - Preston was helped first, Bishop third, and Tideman last - I recollect now that Preston was helped first - we had no conversation together - we drank each other's health, that is all - I have said all I know, and that is all I can say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to represent that you had no conversation with Bishop, Tideman, and Preston, from eight to ten o'clock? A. No, not a word, further than drinking health.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to represent that no conversation passed betwixt these three persons and yourself, except drinking health? A. No, nothing passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you talk about any thing that happened lately? A. No - I do not know the landlord - I have been there several times since - he is not here that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you must have had conversation; do you mean to represent to the Court that from eight to ten o'clock nothing passed in your hearing, except merely drinking each other's health? A. Nothing at all, I swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. You said nothing, and nobody said any thing? A. Yes, nothing passed but drinking health - I have known Bishop a year and a half - he wore blue trousers, a round fustian jacket, a red silk handkerchief, a black silk hat, white stockings and shoes that night - it was not so dark but that I could see what he had on.</p>
               <p>Q. At eight o'clock it was light enough for you to see white stockings, fustian jacket, and so on? A. Yes; if I had met him in the street I should have known him directly by his dress.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. This robbery made a great deal of conversation in the neighbourhood? A. It has; I have heard no paper read about it - nobody has read the Sessions' paper to me - I have heard it talked over once - I do not know whether that was before Bishop was in custody - he was taken one Sunday night - I heard people talk about reading the trial in the newspaper, but they had not then got the paper in their hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the drinking between all four of you, or had you separate refreshments? A. Separate refreshments, except the gin and cloves - Bishop and I drank two pints of porter - the other two were drinking their porter, they were at the house before we got in, and we left them there - Bishop and I went away together.</p>

            . I live in Flower and Dean-street, Spitalfields. On the 11th of September, I went to the London Hospital public-house, Whitechapel-road - I got there by seven o'clock - Bishop came in in about an hour and a quarter with Lydia Bender - they continued there till very near a quarter to ten, as far as I can recollect; we drank separately; when they first came in they called for a pint of beer - I gave them my pot to drink - they drank - and when theirs came in I drank out of their pot - we paid separately for what we drank - I left a little after ten o'clock, they left very nearly half an hour before me - we had a quartern or half a pint of mixed liquor - Bishop fetched it from the bar - I cannot tell whether it was gin and cloves, or gin and raspherry.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What makes you certain you got there at seven o'clock? Q. It was seven by the tap-room clock - there is no seven o'clock bell rings - Bishop came in at a quarter past eight o'clock - I did not look at the clock then - it was a quarter past - I am sure it was not at eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not at eight o'clock? A. I cannot swear about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not more than half-past eight o'clock when they came in? A. I cannot swear exactly - I can swear it wanted more than a quarter to nine o'clock; as near as I can judge it was about a quarter past eight - I will not swear it was not half-past - we had the gin and cloves about half an hour after they came in.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you talk about? A. Why about George Houghton, William Adey, and Sidebottom, who had gone down to the Angel and Trumpet - Bender was sitting at the same table with us, she was not talking to me - the table was between us - we talked about nothing else - I was talking to Bishop - Bender might have talked, to Bishop I cannot my.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink Bishop's health? A. I said, "Here is luck," that is all - Bishop did not drink my health - I gave Bender a nod when I took the glass of porter - I did not say, "Here's your health" to her, nor to Preston, no further than nodding my head - the liquor made four full glasses - each had as much as the others, there was no difference.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw them go out a quarter before ten o'clock, and had no conversation, except about Houghton and Sidebotton? A. That is all - I told Bishop they had gone to the Angel and Trumpet, at Stepney, that is all that passed between us; Preston and Bender were acquainted and they sat and talked together, but I could not hear what they said, as I did not listen - I cannot say whether they talked much or little - it was darkish when I went there at seven o'clock; I do not know whether it rained, the moon was not up, but it was starlight; it was darkish, but the stars were out - I did not see the moon - I had come from Wilmot-street, about a quarter of a mile from the house - it might have rained, but not to perceive it - I cannot say whether I was helped to the liquor first, second, third, or last - I think it was second or third - I had nothing, except porter - they had one pint before the liquor and one afterwards to my recollection - Bishop was dressed in blue trousers, a round fustian jacket, and, I believe, a red handkerchief; I did not observe his stockings or hat, it was either beaver or silk. I have seen him wear a silk hat.</p>
               <p>MRS. DOVER. I know Bishop and Mr. Fuller. I saw Mr. Fuller in my shop on the Wednesday after the robbery, the prisoner Bishop was there; Mr. Fuller remained there about three minutes - Bishop was brushing his clothes - Mr. Fuller came in, and Bishop appeared no ways dismayed; Mr. Fuller said nothing to him nor to me; Bishop was standing with his back to the back-room door, in his shirt-sleeves; Mr. Fuller entered the street-door and could see him, and they could see each other; Bishop had come into my shop about half-past seven o'clock, in the evening of the robbery, for a slice of bread and cheese, and went out directly.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was Mr. Fuller's stick found in your house after the robbery? A. Yes; he brought it in his hand, and left it by the side of my counter - that I swear; he was humanely asked into my place as he was robbed; I know none of the prisoners but Bishop; he left my shop some time before the robbery; it was moonlight on one side of the way, and dark on the other, on account of the houses.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was you at home after the robbery, when the prosecutor came into your shop for assistance? A. I heard a faint cry of Stop thief! I was at needle-work behind the counter; I went to the door as quick as possible, and saw a gentleman without a hat; I suppose Bishop had left my shop three quarters of an hour then; I did not notice the time Bishop came into the shop; it was as near half-past seven o'clock as I can tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that did you hear of the robbery? A. About ten minutes after eight o'clock; I am convinced it was after eight; I was not out all that evening, and saw Mr. Fuller come in; Bishop had left three-quarters of an hour then.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear Mr. Fuller did not come into your shop before eight o'clock? A. I am confident it was a quarter-past eight; I saw him come in without a hat, and offered him my husband's, but it would not fit him - he had no cravat; he bound a handkerchief round his head instead of a hat, and left my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Bishop doing at your place, on the Wednesday afterwards? A. I had bought a bedstead of a friend, Bishop brought it home, and asked me for a brush to brush his clothes; Mr. Fuller was in my shop about three minutes at that time.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. What time was it you heard the cry of Stop thief! - A. It was ten minutes or a quarter past eight o'clock, for I observed to my little girl some time before, "It is eight, and your father is not come home;" I am certain it was after eight - on hearing the cry Stop thief! I got to the door as fast as I could, and saw the gentleman without his hat, and Charles Cousins, who had been in my shop, but had got to the door before me, speaking to him - he had come for some table beer; he returned into the shop with Mr. Fuller and several neighbours - Mr. Fuller appeared extremely bad indeed; I never saw a person look worse - we offered to send for some drink for him, and every assistance was offered him; he said he did not know the persons who robbed him - I heard him say so once or more - I am confident he said it once; I believe I asked him myself once, "Should you know any of them Sir?" his answer was, "No, I should not" - I saw F. Burdet in my shop while he was there, and believe she saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260030"></xptr>him part of the way home; he was at my shop about five minutes, to the best of my knowledge - two men, if not more, went out with him -

             was one; I forget the other's name; he lives in the neighbourhood, and I should know him - it was certainly a moonlight night; but on account of the houses, which are four stories high, it appeared very dark on the side where the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were in your shop when Mr. Fuller was there? A. About half a dozen at least, but I cannot say distinctly - an old woman was there who had taken tea with me - she is not here, but has been sent for- I am quite sure I was in the shop when Mr. Fuller came in.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What time did Cousins come into the shop? A. About three minutes before I heard the cry - what detained him was he had a newspaper; I took it out of his hand and said, "Lord, I wish I could look at it a bit;" he said, he had just got it from Parnel's, and when he had done with it. I could have it; he had been there for strong beer, and came in with the strong beer in a pewter pot, and asked me for table beer - I believe he had that in a mug; my little girl served him; the old woman was not here yesterday, nor was I - I dare say Cousins spoke to Mr. Fuller in my shop, but I did not attend - Burdet was talking to him, but I did not hear what he said - I stood on the sill of the door - when Mr. Fuller was asked in, I came in also - so many people came in that I was obliged to attend to my place, and did not hear all the conversation - I heard him say, "The villains have stripped me of every thing;" on saying that, I believe Burdet asked if he should know any of them, and I asked him myself - he went away about twenty minutes past eight o'clock, to the best of my knowledge; I never saw Houghton or Boyce; I have been subpoenaed here; I was not here on the former trial.</p>
               <p>CHARLES COUSINS. I am a weaver. On the night Mr. Fuller was robbed, I was in at Dover's, and heard a cry of Stop thief! it was between a quarter and twenty minutes past eight o'clock, for when I came out of my brother's door, the Spitalfields eight o'clock bell had been ringing about ten minutes; I went to Parnel's for a pint of strong beer for my brother, and then went to Dover's for a pint of table beer; the bell had done ringing when I heard the cry of Stop thief! it begins at eight and leaves off at a quarter past eight exactly; on hearing the cry, I came out with the two mugs in my hand, and saw Mr. Fuller at the step of the door; he had no hat or neck-handkerchief; he came to me and said, "The villains have robbed me of my hat, handkerchief, and two boxes of lancets out of my pocket;" Mrs. Dover and some one else said, "Will you come in Sir;" he did so; and I instantly came away; nothing more passed in my hearing - I left the door immediately and did not go in.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you seen any of the prisoner's before? A. I knew Downes by his living exactly opposite my mother's; I believe he is a weaver; I knew the others by seeing them come by my mother's door five or six weeks ago, but do not know them by name; I live in St. John-street, near Fleet-street-hill; I moved there on the Saturday before Mr. Fuller was robbed; I had got a newspaper for my brother to read; I cannot read; Mrs. Dover just looked at it while her daughter got the beer; I heard nobody ask the prosecutor if he should know the men; I went away directly, I did not ask him.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. This is the first time you have heard of being wanted here? A. Yes; I have not seen Mrs. Dover since the 11th of September, and never had any conversation with her on the subject; I think it was nearer nine o'clock than eight; I was at Dover's when it struck eight, and heard the bell ring - I think it was better than half-past eight; Mr. Fuller came in without a hat, with a switch in his hand, and let it down by the side of the counter - I was there sewing; I go out charing and sewing; I drank tea between four and five o'clock - I went home directly after this, and got home at nine o'clock, or not much after (I live in Thomas-street, Brick-lane;) I will not swear it was not half-past nine o'clock, or a quarter to ten - I will swear it was not ten; I live about half an hour's walk from Dover's - it is about half a mile.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, Fleet-street-hill. I was in doors when Mr. Fuller was robbed; my next door neighbour called out - I ran out, and found Mr. Fuller placed against the wall, by the door of the chandler's-shop; it was a moon-light night; I asked him to go into Dover's, which he did, and I went in with him - he seemed very much agitated; I asked what he had lost; he said he had lost his hat, his cravat, a sovereign, and 3s. or 3s. 6d.; he remained there about ten minutes; I asked if he knew any of the persons, but what answer he gave I do not know, the people being all talking - I can answer that it was from a quarter to twenty minutes after eight o'clock, for I had called in and had a pint of porter at the Red Lion public-house, at the corner of Hunt-street, Mile-end New-town - Spitalfields bell was ringing eight all the time I was going home- it strikes out at eight; I do not think it had ceased when I got home, but I sat some minutes before I heard the alarm.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How far is your house from Dover's? A. Twenty or thirty yards - I had left home about seven o'clock, to go for my work; it was dusk - it might be a quarter past seven; the moon was up when I came home - I cannot say whether it was up when I went out; I remained with Mr. Fuller at Dover's - I think he was there about ten minutes; I went part of the way home with him.

            . I live at No. 4, Fleet-street-hill, and am a weaver. On the night Mr. Fuller was robbed I heard a cry of Stop thief! it was from a quarter to twenty minutes after eight o'clock, for I had been at my own door, and heard the bell ring eight - it had ceased when I heard the alarm; I was in doors, and, to the best of my knowledge, I did not hear it when I came out - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260031"></xptr>saw Fuller standing against Dover's door, without his hat or handkerchief; Morell was up before me: I asked him what Mr. Fuller had lost - he made some inquiry of him. I went into Mrs. Dover's with them - he seemed very much alarmed; we might have remained there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; Morell and I accompanied him from Fleet-street-hill to the bottom of Fuller-street, Bethnal-green-road, which is about a quarter of a mile; he seemed much frightened, and asked if somebody would be so kind as to see him out of the neighbourhood - I offered my services. When he was standing at Dover's door I remarked it was a pity it was so cloudy, as it was not likely for him to have any assistance from the moon - it was very cloudy, and bade for rain; the moon was covered with clouds at times: I said it was a pity it was so cloudy, as I was doubtful whether he would be able to get the right parties - he made no reply; my wife had followed me to Dover's - I had no hat on, went back for my hat, returned, and found her there - she was there during my absence.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you remember advising the prosecutor not to call out? A. No, Sir - I never did, for I was not there at the time he was robbed; I only heard the call of Stop thief! when I was in-doors - I might have got to him in about three minutes. I did not say he had better not cry out, as the gang was so desperate they would murder him. I was once examined here as prosecutor of one Isaacs, a Jew - I was never here at any other time. I was not examined on behalf of persons named Bowyer and French.</p>

On the night in question I heard a cry, and went to Mrs. Dover's; Mr. Fuller had just got into the shop, and several people were there - he was much agitated; he was asked what he had been robbed of - he said he had lost a sovereign, 3s. 6d., and, I think, one or two cases of surgical-instruments, a beaver hat which cost 30s., and his neckcloth; he was asked, to the best of my recollection, whether he should know any of the robbers - I would not say but what I thought the truth; I think he answered No, he did not think he should, for he was taken at such a nonplus - he said it was rather dark, so dark he did not think he should know them if they were to come before him then. It was a lowering night - the moon shone now and then; the clouds went over it. When I went to my door Spitalfields bell was ceasing ringing; I went strait to Mrs. Dover's shop - it was a quarter or twenty minutes past eight.</p>

            . I am a weaveress, and live in the neighbourhood of Fleet-street-hill. On the night Mr. Fuller was robbed I was going to a trade prayer-meeting; the bell was ringing eight - I believe it was ten minutes after; when I got about thirty yards from my house I saw the gang coming - I believe there was about a dozen of them; I thought at first they were going to rob me; they seemed then to return from me, and my spirits returned to me again; I turned myself round - a woman sitting on a step asked me to give her a pin, which I did, and said to her, "Don't go on - there is going to be a something;" I then heard the word "Now" - it was said by the gang, who were running; they immediately rushed upon the man, and I ran back, in fright, to my own door - I did not go in, but ran back again to the corner, in my agitation, and the woman was still sitting there, and said to me, "They have robbed the man - there he stands"- I went up to him; he stood against the wall, apparently speechless - a woman came out of the chandler-shop, and asked him in; he appeared much alarmed, and his countenance was very pale; I went into the shop, and staid two or three minutes - he went away almost directly, before I came out - I was rather alarmed.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was the bell ringing when you were in the shop? A. No, nor when the gang came along - two men went out with Mr. Fuller when he left the shop.</p>

            . I am a weaver, and live on Fleet-street-hill. On the 11th of September I was at home, and heard some person call out Stop thief! I did not know but what it was boys at play; I did not go down then. I had occasion to send one of my children on an errand in about a minute after - I looked at the clock in my room, and it was ten minutes or a quarter past eight; I cautioned my child not to be gone more than ten minutes - she went for something for my supper, which is generally ready about eight o'clock. She had not been gone a minute before I heard a talking in the street - I went out to Dover's door - there were sixteen or eighteen persons there; Mr. Fuller was there: people said, a man had been robbed. I was not there above a minute before Mr. Fuller came out, and the people standing by observed, that was the man who was robbed - he appeared very much alarmed. I live opposite Dover's - it was moonlight on my side, but dark on hers.</p>

            . I have been subpoenaed here. I was sitting on the stop when Barlow came up - I saw Mr. Fuller attacked; it was from a quarter to twenty minutes after eight o'clock; I have no reason for saying so, only that is the truth. I was subpoenaed here on the last trial by the prosecutor - I am a married woman.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. What did you see done? A. I was sitting on the step of a door, and saw two young men follow Mr. Fuller - there was a whistle given, and the word Now; about a dozen came up, then there was another whistle, and more came up; as many as thirty collected I think; Mr. Fuller was attacked on the dark side of the street, between two empty houses - the moon shone on the other side - it was very dark indeed, I could hardly observe any thing before me - after he was attacked, he went to Dover's door, with a small cane in his hand; I said, "Sir, do you know any of them?" he said, "No, I do not."</p>

            . On the night of the 11th of Septem<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260032"></xptr>ber, I was at the Angel and Trumpet, at Stepney; that is nearly two miles from where the robbery took place, but not quite - I got there before eight o'clock: at half-past six I came from my father's house, and met Houghton and Sidebottom; we went to the Angel and Trumpet together, and got there before eight o'clock. I know all the four prisoners; I saw Downes there and Hackman, who had a woollen cap - I was reading a paper, and looked up and saw Downes come in; I think that was about a quarter or nearly twenty minutes past eight o'clock, at the latest - he remained there till about a quarter past ten at night; I think we went out nearly altogether, but I am not certain - he came in deliberately, not in a hurry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Hackman almost as soon as you saw Downes, or afterwards? A. I think they were nearly together; I think another person was with them, but I did not take particular notice - my attention was directed to the paper. Hackman stopped there till nearly half-past ten o'clock - the landlord would draw no more porter, and we all went out nearly together.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was Sidebottom apprehended that night? A. I heard he was - I have never said that we got to the Angel and Trumpet about half-past six o'clock- I have known Downes a long time, by working as a weaver; I have been in that line, but am now a shoemaker, and live at No. 15, Mead-street, which is a quarter of a mile from Fleet-street-hill, or rather more. They came into the public-house cool and deliberately - it was a very dark evening - the moon did not shine before I went to the house; I did not observe what sort of a night it was when they came in - I was either at home or on my way home when Sidebottom was apprehended - I had left him talking to a young woman at the door. I was never taken on any charge of robbery; I was once charged with bullock-hunting, but I did not hunt it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Sidebottom was apprehended after you and him had separated at the door of the Angel and Trumpet? A. He went out first, or we might have gone altogether; but I left him talking to a young woman.</p>
               <p>Q. After you heard the present prisoners had been apprehended on this charge, did you go to the Police-office? A. No; I went in Houghton's case - Mr. Houghton fetched me from my work, and I offered to give evidence; he was charged with robbing Mr. Fuller. Sarah Carnell waited on me at the Angel and Trumpet.</p>

            . In September last I was servant at the Angel and Trumpet. I heard of Mr. Fuller being robbed, on the Wednesday after it happened - on the Monday before that, I waited on three young men at the Angel and Trumpet; Adey and Sidebottom were there; I saw Downes and Hackman there that night; one more came in with them, but I do not know whether Ore is the man. I first saw them there twenty minutes or a quarter past eight o'clock, to the best of my knowledge - I had been out with my beer and returned; I generally take it out a little before eight; it generally takes a quarter of an hour to deliver it - when I came back, I saw Downes and Hackman coming in at the door; they stopped till half-past ten, or a quarter to eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did they stop till the house was shut up? A. They went away before the house was shut up - the landlord had not left off drawing beer.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Then it was quite light enough for you to see the person who committed the robbery? A. I ran with them and knew them all; it was moonlight, and light enough to discern their persons.</p>

            . I am the prisoner Ore's father. I live at No. 8, Wilmot-street, Bethnal-green-road; it is 1070 yards from Fleet-street-hill; I have measured it. On the 11th of September, my son left home, as near as I can recollect, at half-past seven o'clock; it was so dark I could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260033"></xptr>not see the colour of the money which I gave him to pass the evening out; Pratt worked for me; some time after this, the prosecutor and his solicitor called; my son was up-stairs at work; he inquired for Ore - I went up-stairs and called him, he was stripped at work - the first question Mr. Fuller asked him was, did he know Sarah Holt; he said, No; the Solicitor or Mr. Fuller said, Henry Ore had given her the instruments; my son answered, "Sir, I never saw the instruments, nor do I know what they consist of;" many questions were asked him - to the best of my recollection they asked if he knew Charles Downes - he said, Yes; they asked where he was last Monday week; he said, at the Angel and Trumpet - they asked what time he was there, and he said about eight o'clock; they asked how he knew it was eight; he said, because he heard some clock strike eight, but did not know what clock it was - they asked who he saw at the Angel and Trumpet; he said, Charles Downes, Adey, Sidebottom, and Houghton; they asked what Houghton was doing, and he said, reading the newspaper - they asked how many persons there were in the tap-room, who they were, and if there were any girls or not; he said, there were no girls that he knew of any kind; there were bricklayers, carpenters, and other tradesmen, but they were strangers to him - they asked if he knew Norton and Quay, and several other names; he said, he did not know those names - the lawyer replied it was a good thing for him that he did not know such characters - the Angel and Trumpet is 2260 yards from my house; my son did not go from home when they left, but remained at his work all the week - and I think it was on the 19th of September the officer took him; he was constantly at work till then - I now know Hackman, he was at the office twice among the officers - he went there as a witness for Downes and my son.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know of his going there once as a free man? A. Yes; he went to clear my son and Downes; that must be about four weeks before he was apprehended; Mr. Fuller was there at the time.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long was Mr. Fuller at your house? A. I suppose half an hour or twenty minutes; I only guess the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he was there five minutes? A. Yes; there was no hurry about it, we took our time - and I have not stated all that did pass - we were very considerate, for I thought it important - I had heard of the robbery the day after it was done, but did not know Mr. Fuller to be the person who was robbed till afterwards - I consider they were twenty minutes or half an hour with me; I am certain it was not done in five minutes, it must have been longer - my son was regularly at work from that time till he was apprehended; no officer whatever came to my place to ask for him till Sunday the 24th; when Atfield came, he did not inquire for my son, and I did not know he was an officer - I took him to be a gentleman; but I understood afterwards his name was Atfield - he did not ask for my son, but for another name.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then during the interval between the conversation, if an officer had come to ask for your son or apprehend him, they would have found him without difficulty? A. Yes; that I swear - I would have called him down if he had been asked for, the same as I did when the prosecutor came.</p>

               <p>MR. HARMER. I was employed by the father of Ore to attend his examination before the Magistrate; the prisoner Hackman came to my office twice or thrice to state the evidence he could give on behalf of Ore and Downes. He afterwards, as I believe, attended at the Worship-street Police-office, for the purpose of being examined - I have no distinct recollection of seeing him at the office; but I informed the Magistrate, in the presence of Mr. Fuller, that I had several witnesses to prove the innocence of Ore and Downes, if he would hear them - Hackman was one of the witnesses to whom I alluded, and have no doubt he was there ready to answer, if the Magistrate had consented to his examination.</p>
               <p>One Witness gave Bishop a good character.</p>
               <p>JURY to S. BARLOW. Q. On what evening in the week is the prayer-meeting held in your chapel? A.

               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know any of the persons who have been examined? A. I think I know some of them as neighbours, but I never associate with anybody - none of them were at the prayer-meeting to my knowledge - it is never on any other evening in the week but Monday - I generally go when I can; I am not a member - I have attended there off and on these twelve years - these prayer-meetings have began since trade has been bad - I felt a lively interest in it, and attended.</p>

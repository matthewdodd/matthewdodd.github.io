               <p>Q. Do you know old Hill?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. Yes, when I see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him in your life?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. I might meet him in the street, but I never saw him in conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him in your life to be told his name?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know him any otherwise than as Waters told you?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. No - I was robbed of my coat off my back, and in my coat pocket was a bottle of gin, and two ounces of tobacco.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of men were they that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. One of them had his own hair.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you that?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. I saw that myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man that had his own hair a tall man or a short man?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. He was much about my size [a middle size.]</p>
               <p>Q. Was he an old man?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. I believe he might be turned of fifty.</p>
               <p>* The description that Dorrington gives of Edward Hill is pretty just, he wears his own hair, is a middle sized man, and appears to be turned of fifty years of age.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him to be of that age?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. Only from what the evidence said.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Gascoign?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. I don't know him.</p>

On Saturday afternoon, November 3rd, I was in Barbican, and there saw the prisoner with a bundle of cloth on his back coming from the direction of Fore Street, and going towards Aldersgate—I followed him to a house in Clerkenwell and saw him go into the house and into the back parlour, and as soon as I got into the parlour I saw the cloth behind the door—I told him I was a police officer, and asked how he became possessed of the cloth—he said he had bought it, and had given 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I asked him where he bought it, and he said at 35, Jewin Street—I asked for the receipt, and he said he was a jobber and did not have receipts—he would not go with me to Jewin Street, and I sent for assistance, and another officer arrived, and he was taken to the station, and I took possession of the cloth—on going; to Guildhall he said a gentleman asked him to carry the cloth and he took' it home, and he should have taken it to the station.</p>

On the 29th of September I slept at home, and was awoke by a tapping at my door, a little after two o'clock in the morning - I found Johnson, my servant, at my door, and in consequence of what he said I armed myself with a brace of pistols; I went over the house, and at last came to the foot of the stairs, to an area which leads into the garden - I found one of the pannels of the area door cut out, and laid outside; the door was perforated with holes all round, and the door itself was open: on returning up stairs, and going out at the street door, I met Long - I saw the prisoner close at my street door, with Long; I went to the watch-house, and was shown a silver mug and soup-ladle: I afterwards saw eight silver tea-spoons at Lambeth-street office - the silver mug had a cypher on it, which I positively swear to; the other articles were not marked, but I have not the slightest doubt of their being mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When I was apprehended, did you not say you would blow my brains out? A. I said it was fortunate for you that I did not catch you in the house, or I should have blown your brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, "Let the rascal go, and I will blow his brains out?" A. I did not.</p>

            . I am a sailor. On the 29th of September, about half-past two o'clock in the morning, Mr. Young spoke to me in the street, and in consequence of what he said I watched at the back of his garden wall - I saw a young man drop from the wall, and about a minute afterwards I saw another man drop - that was the prisoner - I attempted to stop him; he lifted his hand up, with something in it, and said, "I will cut you down if you don't let me pass;" I could not see what it was - he passed me; I followed him, and came up to him; I was about three yards from him, and saw him heave this silver mug away - I stooped, and picked it up; I put it into my pocket, ran. and collared him, about twenty yards from where I took up the mug; I had never lost sight of him, and am quite certain he is the person who dropped from the wall - Norris came up, and I gave it to him.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. I went to Mr. Young's house on the 30th of September, and brought this pannel away, (producing it) here are twenty or thirty marks of two different centre-bits on it; I applied the two centre-bits to it - one of them fitted the marks, and the gimblet fitted the hole in the middle.</p>
               <p>RICHARD JOHNSON. I am servant to the prosecutor. I believe these eight tea-spoons to be Mr. Young's; he had eight of that description and I missed them; there is R. T. on the back, which was on his - it is the maker's initials - he had a sonp-ladle of this description, no mark is on it, but from its appearance, I believe it to be his; the mug I know - it has the cypher on it.</p>
               <p>MR. YOUNG. The river was dragged, and a tea-pot produced to me; the value of all the property lost could not be less than 30l.; there was a silver waiter which I have heard nothing of - I know this mug.</p>

                  </hi>. In November, 1857, the prisoner requested me to call on Mr. Jackson to receive payment of some rates—I did not take a letter; that had been sent the day before—Mr. Jackson gave me this cheque—I delivered it to the prisoner the same day—I have taken money to the London and Westminster Bank repeatedly—I knew that the prisoner had an account there; it was at the Southward Branch, London-bridge—I am not certain whether this cheque was paid in with other monies.</p>

Q.</hi> You have repeatedly paid monies that you have col<lb></lb>lected for the parish into that bank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, for Mr. Cooper; that was a regular and proper thing to do—I was employed by Mr. Cooper; I very frequently collected for him—I do not know whether he was ill at that time; he has been ill several times; he was very ill in 1858; I heard that it was brain fever—he had been ill for some time before these gentlemen went to him—it is possible that I may have taken a letter to Mr. Jackson; but the letter requesting him to pay me, I think, was sent to him the day before—I did not take the collecting books with me to Mr. Jackson's; I merely went for the cheque at Mr. Cooper's request—I don't remember Mr. Jackson's returning the papers to me; whatever he gave me I returned with the cheque to Mr. Cooper—I remember receiving the cheque, which I gave a receipt for—when I collect I generally take the books with me, and return them, with the money I have collected, in the evening—I always make entries of what I receive—I took all the books with me relating to the different rates, poor-rates, sewers, lighting, and so on; it is divided into eight books—in this instance I only went for the cheque—I have collected for Mr. Cooper for about eighteen months—I have gone through these books—I merely assisted for a very short period, to make up the cash-book—I did not call attention to the cheque received from Mr. Jackson; that would not be in the cash-book—I did not see the balance made; the prisoner's brother finished the balance—I never had anything to do with the parish at all—I was employed by Mr. Cooper, and returned my accounts to him—I was employed by him when I assisted to make up the cash-book; he requested me to do it—that was not the book for July, 1857—this is the book (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—I did not take great notice of it; it was only handed to me on Saturday night, and I was to do it by the Monday—in fact the only thing I had to do was the addition—it commences in 1855—I did not go through it, only partly—I merely did the adding-up, and the prisoner's brother finished—I made some of the entries, I have no doubt, but cannot see them now—I made them in pencil, and they have been filled up—I am not aware that I entered some sums, which bad been received by the prisoner and had not been entered before; I dare say I did—there were two or three books, but they</p>

               <p>were sent for in a violent hurry—in fact, I ought not to say that I had anything to do with the books at all—the prisoner certainly gave me the book, with the request that I would make it up as well as I could; but, as I said before, I had these books late on the Saturday; they were to be sent in on the Monday, and the brother came and took them from me on the Saturday—this is very nearly two years ago; it was in the early part of 1858—they were in a hurry to make up the books for the purpose of the audit—the prisoner was ill in bed at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. This is the July, 1857, poor-rate book—the sums entered here are in the prisoner's handwriting—there is an amount of something, about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. here against Mr. Jackson; it is in separate items, and appears to be brought forwards from various other rates, includ<lb></lb>ing the July rate—I have seen all the books; there is no entry in this, or any other book, of 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or anything like that sum, as received from Mr. Jackson—he appears to be a debtor to the parish to the amount here stated—there ap<lb></lb>pears to be in his arrear column, that is the irrecoverable column, the sums of 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I then turn to another page, still in the prisoners hand writing; one sum appears to have been altered; the casting appears to have been made incorrect in the first instance—the sums are here, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—at the time that these books were given up, the whole of that appeared to be due; I believe it is 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in the general rate, July, 1857, Mr. Jackson appears to be a debtor to the parish in the following sums, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that all appears to be due by this book—after the prisoner was suspended, I was appointed to collect, and the books were given into my keeping—in accordance with the appearance of those books, I called on Mr. Jackson for the amount of the rates, and then it was he gave me infor<lb></lb>mation—I got a cheque from him for the balance; it is something like 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that and the 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. make up the amount which appeared to be due from him in these two accounts—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the recoverable book, applicable to the general rate; it is in the prisoner's handwriting—I did not see this book until the other day—Mr. Jackson is there represented as still in arrears for the same sums which I have named, not the items of the poor-rate, this book only purports to be for the general rate.</p>

Q.</hi> You say that in the July rate-book of 1857, the prisoner has entered all the sums that you have given us, as in arrear? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; on one line the name of the occupier is put, and "Thomas Jackson" on another line; there are various houses belonging to Mr. Jackson which were separately assessed and afterwards compounded for by him, and the balance is written off as irrecoverable; a man who compounds is rated on more favourable terms—the difference between what the occupier and the owner would have to pay is written off as irrecoverable—the owner would pay the rate instead of the tenants, it appears so here; that is quite usual—the owner's name does not appear—this "compounded for" is written by the prisoner—we frequently allow a landlord to come in after the rate has been made, and compound for his tenants—these books have not been in the prisoner's possession since he was suspended; he gave up all his books at that time—I don't know whether that was at the time the agreement was entered into assigning his debts.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you made this agreement with the prisoner, you did not, of course, think he was guilty of embezzlement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not an agree<lb></lb>ment; I made no agreement with him—I, on the part of the parish, prepared the deed of assignment of his debts, or it was prepared in my office—I con<lb></lb>sidered at that time that he was guilty of embezzlement; but my clients perhaps, at that time, did not wish to treat it so—I drew out an agreement for the parish to get what they could; of course I knew very well that a collector, when he collects money and does not pay it over, is guilty of embezzlement; and knowing that, I drew that assignment; I advised them to accept it, <hi rend="italic">pro tanto</hi>—I wanted to get as much for the parish as I could.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And not being able to get the balance, you advised them to turn round on this poor fellow, and indict him for felony? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not; it was supposed at the time the assignment was taken that he only owed to the parish what was represented by the recital in the deed, but this 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not included in that sum—it was under the advice of counsel, that the last case was prosecuted; it was not under the advice of counsel that the matter was compromised; I do not say that it was compromised; the criminal proceedings were referred by the vestry—the prisoner was taken into custody in July or August last—this prosecuting him was not made known to me until instructions were given to issue a warrant against him—it was reported to the parish from time to time, that he was keeping a lodging-house at Brighton—I got 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from one surety; that was probably in December, 1858—I did not get a further sum from the prisoner; it was long before that that I sued him; the matter did not drop then, until I found he was keeping the lodging-house at Brighton—there were actions pending against the sureties, and it had been referred by the vestry, to the Finance Committee; and ultimately, in July, they reported from the subse<lb></lb>quent discoveries of great defalcations, that they thought the Vestry ought to order a prosecution for embezzlement; that was in July, 1859—it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185909190084"></xptr>
               <p>not reported to the vestry till then—it was reported that he was a defaulter to a certain amount—that was the report made long prior; but the subse<lb></lb>quent defalcations which amounted to a larger sum, were not reported till July, 1859—I cannot give any particular reason why the report was not made before that; it went on from time to time like other matters; and by July they found what could be collected from the sureties; and it was also reported to them that large subsequent defalcations were discovered, from time to time, over and above the account; and then the Finance Committee reported to the vestry—what I allude to is this; the accounts were supposed to have been taken by his brother, and his brother-in-law, I mean those accounts that were not included in that account—I have settled the action with one surety, by taking 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—and I have settled the other by taking 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by instalments—the third I could get nothing from; he was not considered to be worth powder and shot—there were three sureties—the poundage due to the prisoner is shown in the account—I dare say it may be 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on all the rates—there has been no general settlement with him on the part of the parish; each rate is audited—if he had made any application for poundage, he could have received it—there was not any general settlement; the way would be this, the auditor would go through the account, and ascertain what the poundage would be, and if he sent in his account and made a proper application for it, he would have received it; the rate-book will show it; and of course if he wanted the money, he would have applied for it—the auditor generally puts down how much is due to him—I should say that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of poundage extends to the 1856 rate, not to 1858—the rate for 1858 was not under audit at that time—we are not charging him with the receipt of any portion of that in this case, he had only received the book in the middle of January, and then the July rate of 1857 was under audit—there would be no poundage due to him; it would be due to him as soon as collected—the poor-rate is a January and July rate—the sewer and lighting is made for one year, payable by instal<lb></lb>ments—I can only say that the parish did not pay the poundage, because he did not ask for it—I know of no other reason—I am the person to whom he should apply for it—he did not make repeated applications to me to have it settled; nor to my clerk, that I know of—I have always thought that his salary would be worth 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; but he told me at the time that he was ill, that it was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never gave it my attention unless an application was made—if he required a cheque, upon his writing, it was put before the churchwardens and overseers, and they signed it; it was not then given to me, it was given to the party entitled to it—I drew the cheque; it would either be handed to me and left in my office till called for—not personally paid by me—my clerk transacts business for me—I have no knowledge or recollection of the prisoner's having made repeated applications for his money, from time to time—I have no doubt if he had put it forward in a proper way, it would have been paid immediately, like every other debt of the parish.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember the prisoner's over-paying upon the highway rate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When I made up the account for the highway rate, I found that he had overpaid that; that would not be a deduction upon this matter, it would be a deduction from the general account—I found that out, I should think, about the latter end of June, 1858—he had paid it into the vestry account, and the vestry account gave the churchwardens credit for the amount; that was discovered after I had got the books, and was inquiring for that purpose.</p>

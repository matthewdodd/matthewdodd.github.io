I am foreman at the Old Hibernia Wharf—on Saturday evening, 7th February, I was coming over London Bridge from the Elephant and Castle Station, at 11.45—when I was opposite Hibernia Chambers I was suddenly seized from behind by three men—they nearly choked me—one put his hand in my right-hand pocket, and took all I had there—I had on this coat, buttoned up—there was plenty of light—I sang out "Police"—I saw Buckley and Bryan, and I believe Kinnard was the third man, but he had a lighht coat on—I had in my pocket 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers, 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, a latch-key, and a knife just before I was attacked, which I missed directly after—I saw Grimley run across the road—I went with him to the railway station and gave information there, and went and found Bryan coming towards St. George's Church in the Borough—he was taken into custody—about 20 minutes afterwards we saw Buckley in the same locality—I identified him, and he was taken—on February 15th I went to identify Kinnard—I said I bettered he was the man.</p>

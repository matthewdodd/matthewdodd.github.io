            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Second Count. For feloniously vending and selling, on the same day, certain playing cards, with counterfeit impressions of certain marks used and denoted upon playing cards, he at the time knowing the said marks to be counterfeited. And</p>
               <p>Thirteen other Counts for like offence, only charging them in a different manner.</p>
               <p>(The indictment was read by Mr. Dampier.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. - Gentlemen, This prosecution, we all understand, is against the prisoner for an offence which he has committed against the stamp laws, and the indictment charges him with having counterfeited the impression of stamps authorised by the Commissioners for the purpose of denoting the duty on playing cards; it charges him likewise of vending and selling cards with these counterfeited impressions, knowing it to be so done.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, The act under which the prisoner is prosecuted makes it a capital offence for either counterfeiting, vending, or selling cards with counterfeited stamps, the person so acting having a guilty knowledge thereof.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Having stated these circumstances to you, I conceive I must do more, in order to apprise you of the serious and important business in which we are now engaged. The prisoner at the bar is a licensed card-maker, having two licensed shops, the one situated in Hereford-street, Oxford-street, and the other in North-row, Grosvenor-square; I shall shew you that in these two places he carried on the manufacturing and selling of playing cards. There was another place the prisoner had, which was even unknown even to the servants that were employed in either of these manufactories, in which almost all the infamous part was transacted by the prisoner himself alone.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, The extensive manner in which he carried on this business, compared with the small demand he made at the Stamp office for stamps to have legally carried it on, was one of the first circumstances that appeared against the prisoner, and that a fraudulent fabrication were made and vended, to a large extent, in lieu of the legal one, there was not the least doubt. And in consequence of this, and likewise from some other circumstances, it came sufficiently to the knowledge of the persons employed at the Stamp-office that there must be some illegal practice carried on. It was thought expedient to employ one Hockey, who is the printer of the legal ace of spades at the Stamp-office, in order to see if they could detect him in the improper practice he was carrying on, and this employment of Mr. Hockey has led to the discovery for which the prisoner is now brought here. It was in the month of May, I think the 14th, that Mr. Hockey made the first purchase; he called at his house, and asked for six packs of playing cards, Mr. Harding was not at home, but a servant furnished him with the six packs of playing cards; the charge that was made for them was about a guinea, nothing at all under what would be the trade price bought at a regular manufactory; Mr. Hockey having purchased these six packs of cards, he found that they contained all the marks and impressions of forged stamps, and he was satisfied in his own mind that they were undoubtedly forged. He was not contented with making this purchase, he went on the 16th, and purchased six packs more; Mr. Harding then was at home, and served him himself. On the 21st he made another purchase, when the same servant furnished him with six packs more, and on the 24th of May he purchased a dozen packs; the cards in this dozen were furnished him by the prisoner himself. On the 27th, he went again to the shop, and ordered five dozen to be sent to No. 74, Edgware-road; these cards were sent accordingly, and the person that carried them will be called; he will tell you (he was in the habit of giving receipts not in his master's name;) he asked his master in what name he should give the receipt, his master told him to give the receipt in any name he pleased; he was instructed where to carry them, and he gave the receipt in the name of Bates. When he returned he told his master, and his master was very well satisfied with it.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, This circumstance was in order to prevent the easy communication of tracing back these packs of cards; for all these and every one of those different packs of cards which were purchased on those specific days, in the month of May, contained the forged impressions of these counterfeited stamps, and the prosecution against the prisoner was supposed to be complete by these various instances of selling these counterfeited impressions. In consequence of that, it was thought fit to apprehend him, and to make a seizure from which information<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180050"></xptr>might be collected from the circumstances of the manner in which it was carried on. He was apprehended, and several of his servants were likewise laid hold of at the time; and from this remarkable circumstance it is evident that the prisoner must have become acquainted previously, that there was that suspicion ripened against him, that it was likely that he should be the subject of apprehension; for upon the seizure of the stock there was not one single forged impression found, although down to the twenty-fourth of May he had, wherever the sale had been made, sold cards with these counterfeited impressions; they were all removed before the apprehension and seizure; that unquestionably by some means or other the prisoner must have been apprised thereof. After the apprehension of the prisoner, the persons that assisted him in carrying on this nefarious business, who were taken at the same time, became the subjects of examination, and the connection and acquaintance of the prisoner were discovered; and that a person of the name of Leadbetter was the engraver that was employed by the prisoner, and a person of the name of Skelton was one that had considerable dealings with him; that they were frequently employed in carrying cards to Mr. Skelton, who lived somewhere near Grosvenor-square. I shall shew to you the manner in which the prisoner at the bar first seduced Leadbetter, and the manner in which Leadbetter seduced Bunning - I can hardly say seduced, employed Bunning. That the prisoner at the bar actually paid for Leadbetter's instruction in the art of engraving on copper-plates, he being a stone seal-engraver; and after the prisoner had actually paid for the instruction of Leadbetter, he was anxious to know whether he could execute a plate for him. Leadbetter attempted not only to touch up a plate, but also to engrave others for him; but in consequence of his not being able to do it for him, he was desirous of getting it done for him; he employed a man of the name of Bunning, who was himself an engraver in this line. Leadbetter led him to believe that he was acquainted with a drunken engraver who worked for the Stamp-office, who would lose his business if he did not get some able hand to do them for him. These are the outlines of the case, in which, if the facts are brought home to him, I am sure you will not entertain a doubt of the propriety of the prosecution against the prisoner, Mr. Harding.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I shall first state to you what it is we have to prove against him; I shall then state what is necessary to prove against the prisoner by the detail already applied to the facts. The first thing to be proved against him is vending these articles, knowing them to be counterfeited - for vending these packs of cards with the counterfeited impressions of the stamps, he knowing them to be counterfeited, rather than the actual counterfeiting of the impressions of that stamp. I shall shew to you that at the early stage of the business evident proof of his having vended these articles in considerable quantities to a person of the name of Hockey, and that Hockey will shew to you, beyond all possibility of a doubt, that he sold these cards with the counterfeited impressions on them; and to establish that fact, that he knew they were counterfeited, I shall here state the manner in which the duty stamps are carried on at the Stamp-office. This will of itself make it next to impossibility that any trader carrying on the business as this man did, could possibly sell or vend cards without knowing they were false. The duty on playing cards is upon the whole two shillings and sixpence; there is a duty of sixpence on the wrapper; and with respect to the ace of spades particularly, the Office makes a plate for every dealer, and upon that plate for every dealer they put the dealer's name. Every dealer, therefore, must know, that in order to get a legal ace of spades, he must have the ace of spades that is furnished by the Stamp-office themselves; he cannot get it from any other quarter. If any dealer is furnished with any other ace of spades, he must know that they were forged; for on looking upon the legal impression of the duty ace, there is charged sixpence upon the top, and sixpence on each side, and then there is the name of Harding, or of the dealer, that is, the card-maker, at the bottom; and any card-maker getting it from any other quarter, must know that he has got a false impression.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, This case will by no means rest here; but I shall shew to you the actual employment of the prisoner, and who it was that made the fabricated plate. I shall shew you by one of his servants that he had a plate in his possession of the ace of spades, and that he saw him polish the impression that is made on the label fabricated stamp, to give it that gloss which the legal stamp does, in order to meet the eye, and to be less liable of detection. You will find from his servants that, for several weeks before the time that he was apprehended, he had taken upon himself entirely the whole management of that part of the business which consisted of making the aces of spades. The legal aces of spades have twenty impressions upon a sheet of paper of a large size at the Stamp-office; they are cut in shape, and put on one side of the cards by the card-maker; they are progressively numbered from one to twenty. The plate that the prisoner procured to be fabricated, only contained four of these impressions, and when you come to examine the particulars of the plate, you will find that some of them are not correct with the original of which they were intended; for I think they have got an R instead of the E in the word Dieu. In this instance it points out, beyond all possibility of a doubt, that it is a forgery.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, You will find that he kept this part of the business to himself for six months before he was apprehended; that he cut these out, and pasted them on the cards; that he delivered the aces of spades, which were to be included in these packs, himself; and I apprehend from this circumstance of Leadbetter being actually employed and engaged by the prisoner to acquire that knowledge by which he was to fabricate the legal stamps, will make it beyond all doubt that he knew they were forged. I have pointed out these other circumstances, independent of the proof of Leadbetter, and particularly independent of the proof which will be given on the part of Skelton, because both Lead-better and Skelton will come before you as men who are more or less implicated in the guilt of the prisoner himself. With respect to Leadbetter, there is no doubt but he must know what these stamps were; and with respect to Skelton, there can be but little doubt, if any, but that he must have known the iniquitous purpose of these stamps. He will tell you that he knew the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180051"></xptr>prisoner many years; that he let him part of his premises in a back yard behind his house, and that in these premises the prisoner carried on this nefarious business; he had often seen him, and often heard him make use of the instrument for forging these stamps. I say I will desire the keeping the case, as much as I can, without the assistance of these accomplices, because I think, without their assistance, there would be very near, if not quite, sufficient to prove the case against the prisoner. At Mr. Skelton's, and at the house of a person of the name of Shinglear, were found not less than two thousand aces that had been made by Harding, the prisoner, he having removed them from his premises the very night before his apprehension to elude every means of indicating the forged business being carried on by him.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Some of the plates were found in the garden at Skelton's, and two were found in the possession of Leadbetter, to whom they had been returned by Harding, for the purpose of his secreting them. You will find that there is abundant proof against the prisoner at the bar, even if you were to put out the evidence of Skelton, or of Leadbetter, they being persons that were accomplices. You will be directed to give a very anxious attention to their evidence, and to be watchful whether their evidence is confirmed, and if it is confirmed, you may give the same reliance to that as to any other evidence. In this case you will give attention to the whole of it - how far the evidence supports the facts, and how far upon the whole these facts make out the case of guilt against the prisoner. In my mind it seems to be a case in which there will not be a possibility of a doubt, but it will be for you to determine.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. How long ago was that? - A. Near two years; I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dampier. Q. After dinner did any thing pass between you? - A. Some little time after dinner he called me on one side and said, I shall be glad to speak to you; and after that I went up stairs with him, and he said, Leadbetter, can you, or do you engrave on copper: I said, no, I could not, it was quite out of my profession; I replied that I knew a young man of the name of White, who was an engraver in that line, and I supposed he would do what he wanted to get done; Mr. Harding paused a little time, and he returned back and said, White you have mentioned, do you think this White can be depended on; or can I, or may I depend on you: To that reply I told him, I would do my endeavour to get what he might want done.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180053"></xptr>Q. Did he tell you what? - A. No; I told him I had known White from a lad, even from an apprentice.</p>
               <p>Q. What Did Mr. Harding say upon that? - A. He said he would call upon me in the course of the next week; then he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards was it that you saw Mr. Harding? - A. About three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that? - A. He came to my lodgings, which were, at that time, No. 3, Greek-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing with him when he came? - A. He brought with him four duty aces of spades with the name of Harding cut off.</p>
               <p>Q. You can only tell a name was cut off; what did he say to you? - A. He told me to take that to Mr. White and tell him to copy it as close as he could, and if he should ask any questions, to tell him it was for a foreigner at Hambro'; he then went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry these to White? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation pass between you and White? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him what passed between you and White? - A. Yes, I had some difficulty to find him; I met him in Long-acre, and he took me into some shops; I asked him to call at my lodgings, which he did; I asked him to engrave me a plate and to call on me to-morrow; when he came, he said, Leadbetter, for God's sake, do you know what you are doing of? I told him I did not; he then said, he could engrave these aces, but if he did, he must give them into the hands of a Magistrate, for he had asked a question of his friend, who was a card-maker, and he told him that.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see Harding? - A. The next day he came to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Now then at that time did you inform Harding of what you have told us, of what White said to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Harding say to that? - A. He still persisted it was no such thing; I told him that White told me it was a forgery; he insisted it was no such thing, he said he was a poor fool, and knew no better.</p>
               <p>Q. What further did he say? - A. He told me to go to White again, and to tell him that no harm should come to him if he would do it, and more than that, whatever money he wanted or asked he should have, and that he should have the money first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see White afterwards, to inform him of that? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Would White do them? - A. He told me that he would have nothing to do in it, for he thought that I knew who they were for.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, I believe, you never saw White? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Harding soon afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come to you, or did you go to him? - A. I think I went and told him what White had said.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to that? - A. There was nothing more passed after that; he never took any more notice about engraving for six or seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you lodged, then, in Greek-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After that you lodged in Titchfield-street, No. 42? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you there see Mr. Harding? - A. Yes, about six or seven months after the time I was speaking of, he came to my lodgings in Titchfield-street, he asked me and said, do you think in your own mind, you could learn to engrave on copper: I then told him I did not know, but I thought I might; upon which he said, if you will get some one to instruct you, I will pay for your instruction: upon which I applied to several people, and I was recommended to Mr. Woodthorpe, in Fetter-lane, to whom I went; he told me to call again on the next day, when I went to him, and he would give me an answer; he did afterwards do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he undertake to instruct you afterwards? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. For what sum was he to instruct you? - A. For twenty pounds or guineas, I think guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid that money? - A. Mr. Harding, he furnished me with that money to pay Mr. Woodthorpe.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had been with Mr. Woodthorpe a competent time, did he come to you to see how you improved? - A. He asked me if I had practised enough to touch up a plate for him; I then asked him what that plate was; he told me it was a plate of the aces of spades; and he said that the poor old man - the poor old Baronet that did it for him was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you endeavour to do it? - A. I told him I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. After that did he come to you again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long afterwards was it, a week or a month? - A. It might be a month.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come to you again? - A. He came to me again, and asked me how I came on with Woodthorpe; I told him very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he then shew you any thing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it? - A. He came and shewed me a plate of four duty aces of spades.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say he wanted to be done with it? - A. He said he wanted it to be touched up;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180054"></xptr>and then we walked to the other end of the room, and said, had I better touch it up here, or come to his house to do it; I told him to do as he pleased; he then said, come to my house; I went and dined there, it was on a Sunday, and after dinner he shut me into a room, and gave me some gravers, and told me to do the best I could with them.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he shut you in the room? - A. He locked the door; I tried to do it, but finding I could not do it, I left off; he came into the room about the dusk of the evening, he said, Leadbetter, what have you done? I told him I had done a little, I did not know whether it would do or no; with that he said, never mind it now, I will try to do it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect at all what the number were? - A. To the best of my knowledge it was one, two, six, and seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at your lodgings that he came again? - A. Yes, he came to my lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask you any further questions? - A. He said, he did not mind telling me what he wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he want? - A. He asked me if I could engrave on brass with my own machine; I told him, I could not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dampier. The witness is a stone engraver.</p>
               <p>Q. He asked you if you could engrave on brass? - A. I told him I could not, my tools were made of the softest iron I could get.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he afterwards ask you of your progress with Mr. Woodthorpe? - A. He came again, and asked me how I came on with Mr. Woodthorpe; I told him as before, very well. He brought me a plate under his coat, and gave me a sheet of aces of spades.</p>
               <p>Q. Containing the number of twenty? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Such a one as this? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you? - A. He told me that he would be glad if I would copy fourteen, fifteen, nineteen, and twenty, and do them as close as possible I could, he was so distressed he did not know what to do; I then told him I would. Finding I was not capable of doing it, I employed a man of the name of Bunning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate to Harding that you had employed Bunning? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give Bunning the plate, and did Bunning do the plate? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the plate so done by Bunning to Harding? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you gave it to him, what did he say to it? - A. He said it was not a proper thing to be done; Bunning said that.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, when you gave the plate to Harding which Bunning had worked upon, did Harding make any observation upon it? - A. He looked at it, and said it was very neatly done.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do upon that - did he give you any other plate? - A. He came a very short time afterwards, and told me that he liked that plate very well that I had done, and he would be obliged to me to do another, and put the name of Blanchard in; he gave me an exportation ace, a sheet of the same size as one of them; I gave it to Bunning with his directions, and got it done.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give that to Harding? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Some time after that did he come to you again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you? - A. He asked me if I had done the plates; I told him, yes; he said he would be obliged to me if I would do one or two more, with the name of Harding, duty aces not for exportation; I did two Blanchards, and then he came again for me to do a Harding, because he said he should be found out working on one number.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give that to Bunning? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that done by Bunning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And afterwards given by you to Harding? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him again with one of the Blanchard plates? - A. Yes, he came to me again to see if I would take out the palm-branch; the exportation aces are with palm-branches, and the duty aces are with leaves on them; I was to take out the palm-branch, and to put in the leaves; I was to make some alteration that they should not be exactly to pattern; it was taken out, but the alteration was not made, I had not time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the bustle there was about Lee and Hardy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. About that time Blacklin was prosecuted, and Lee ran away? - A. Yes, he came to me, and said, for God sake, help me to bury the plates; for, said he, they have been searching my house; upon which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any directions? - A. He told me to bury them; then he came again, and said, let me have them; he took the plates, and brought them again in the course of a day or two, and I buried them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what you were to do if you were asked about them? - A. Yes; he said if they came to me, and asked me any thing about it, to to say I knew nothing of any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the time you were apprehended? - A. I think it was the 25th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time were there any of these plates at your house? - A. Two.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had brought them there? - A. Mr. Harding.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they brought there for? - A. For me to bury them till he wanted them to print off.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You were taken up on the 25th of June? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. And there were found in your house two forged plates? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had employed a lad of the name of Bunning to forge others to engrave them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever told that poor lad, Bunning, that they were done for the Commissioners of the Stamps? - A. Yes, I told him they were for Mr. Shephard, that belongs to the Stamp-office.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times were you examined yourself after you were taken up? - A. Three times, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. With some little apprehension to your neck, you knew you were in danger? - A. Certainly; I had not a little apprehension, I knew I was in danger if I was not admitted an evidence for the crown.</p>
               <p>Q. That is true - pray how many different accounts have you given before you had given this to-day? - A. To the best of my knowledge there was one.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not three? - A. I cannot exactly say there were not three.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not remember, at the conclusion of your last examination, your saying that the account you then gave you would stick by, and that your former accounts were not true? - A. I cannot understand you.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you remember being asked, upon the conclusion of the last account that you gave, whether the account of that day was true, or the account of former examinations - you said, the account I give to-day is true, and the former accounts are not; the former accounts were destroyed because they were false? - A. They were false in parts.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you have given three different accounts - have you given three different accounts or two? - A. There were two.</p>
               <p>Q. And given before the same Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dampier. Q. These are the plates and the paper that were delivered to you by Mr. Harding? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dampier. One of them has the R instead of the E, on one of the plates is Diru instead of Dieu.</p>
               <p>- BUNNING sworn. - Examined by Mr. Attorney General. Q. Are you acquainted with the last witness? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you employed by the last witness to engrave any thing for him? - A. I was employed by him to engrave the aces and different things, such as card-plates, and to do his business such as he had to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that plate, and see whether that is one of the plates that you did for him? - A. Yes, that is one.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be employed by him to do this? - A. He told me they were done for Mr. Shephard, the engraver, at the Stamp-office.</p>
               <p>Q. You executed them for him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you delivered them when you had executed them to him? - A. Yes, these are the two that I did for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do some of the exportation aces? - A. I did, and some in the name of Blanchard, and some in the name of Harding.</p>
               <p>Q. How many plates in the name of Blanchard? - A. I fancy there were two; there were more than two I did in the name of Harding.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long have you been acquainted with this man? - A. About November, he came to me at Mr. Woodthorpe's.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came to you did not he represent himself as one employed in the Stamp-office? - A. He said he was employed by a Mr. Shephard, who was the engraver employed by the Stamp-office.</p>
               <p>Q. He asked you whether you could engrave what he wanted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Telling you what it was, what answer did you give him? - A. I told him I did not think I was capable, it was entirely out of my line.</p>
               <p>Q. In order to induce you to do so, did not he tell you he would give you something, and teach you music also? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you told him you must tell your master, he said you must not do that, because the Stamp-office will find it out - he told you that he had great influence at the Stamp-office, there was no harm in what you were doing of, and he could do any thing for you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you took it for granted you were doing nothing wrong, you were only doing it for the service of this man? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Attorney General. Q. Do you recollect going to the prisoner's house? - A. On the 25th of June, I went with Carpmeal and Miller to Hereford-street. Mr. Harding was in the shop when I went in; I apprehended him; I made a search in his house at that time; I found a large quantity of cards, and all of them with good stamps; they were all good aces of spades found there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend any others? - A. The last witness was there and the apprentice; we went to Leadbetter's and found in the kitchen, upon the top of his rolling-press, these two plates in paper, done up in this way. (Witness describing the manner.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Skelton's house? - A. We did, on the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Skelton at home? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the premises did you search? - A. I searched the room at the bottom of the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the articles that you found there in that room? - A. There were two rollers; it had the appearance of a press being taken down.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other articles there? - A. There was an iron fly-press that was in the room, and a flannel working jacket, and some flannel, likewise a printing-ball; the flannel has the appearance of red ink, and shews that some work has been carried on, by the red appearance; here is the marble slab it has been worked upon, the rolling-press was compleat; at a distant place we found the remainder of the press which had been taken down.</p>
               <p>Q. Then both in the room and the other place you found a compleat press? - A. We did: on the 27th we went to Mr. Skelton's, and at the bottom of the yard, about a foot under the earth, we found these other plates.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they the plates of? - A. They are four plates of aces of spades; in the room there were cards packed up, a large quantity; I saw no aces of spades in those I looked at; I looked in one, and some loose cards were in the room; on the 9th of July I went to Skelton's and made a subsequent search, and in the privy we found these four other plates; they are aces of spades.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Skelton on the premises when they were found? - A. At the first time he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in consequence of what you heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180060"></xptr>from Skelton, search another place? - A. I went to Mr. Senor's house in King-street, Grosvenor-square; I found, in the back-room, which was occupied by Mr. Shinglear, this parcel.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is it a roll? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any wrappers to it? - A. Yes, it was done up in this blue paper.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they? - A. A quantity of aces of spades; these are all aces of spades.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the number of them? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door fastened? - A. No. it was not when I went in.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop at Norwood—on Friday, 17th January, I saw the prisoner at my bar—she came for half-a-pint of porter—she tendered a bad shilling—I took it up, bent it, and returned it to her, telling her it was bad—she left—I followed her into the street and noticed her stoop twice—she went into a public-house kept by Mr. Drewitt; she came out again and stooped down to her boot, and then went on again—I watched her till she went into Mr. Rivers' shop, in High-street—when she came out I went in, said something, and got a bad shilling from Mrs. Rivers—it was not the shilling that I had bent—I left it on the counter, and went out and called a policeman—I afterwards gave it to the policeman.</p>

I am the wife of William Henry Rivers, and keep a shop at High-street, Lower Norwood—on Friday, 17th January, about half-past 5 in the afternoon, the prisoner came to our shop, purchased a pocket-handkerchief which was 3 3/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and gave a shilling—I gave her sixpence and 2 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and put the shilling on the ledge of the till, apart from other money—the prisoner then left the shop, and Mr. Reeks came in and spoke to me—from what he said, I went to the till and found the shilling where I had placed it—I looked at it, found it was bad, and gave it to Mr. Reeks who laid it on the counter, and I gave it to the constable.</p>

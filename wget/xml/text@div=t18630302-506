I live at 19, Hanwell-street, St. Luke's—on 25th February, about 9 o'clock at night, I was passing along Fann-street, and went into this house and went upstairs, with Butler, on the first-floor—I heard cries—I saw the prisoner strike him with a poker; the blow fell on his hand—I saw him raise his hand to preserve his head—I did not see what occurred after that, because I was knocked downstairs—several of us fell down stairs—the soldier was not doing anything at all to the prisoner—the room-door was open.</p>

On the 13th of October, about ten o'clock, the prisoner came to the shop with another boy, to buy some apples; he asked me to let him look at a particular picture, which was in the back room; I let him look at it, and after they were gone I missed two handkerchiefs from a clothes basket near the picture; the prisoner loitered about the door - I told him I missed two handkerchiefs, and nobody had been in the room but him; he said I must have mislaid them - I inquired of my mother, and then went after him, but he was gone, and while I was gone to the pawnbroker's he was taken.</p>

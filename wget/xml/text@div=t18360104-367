                  </hi>. I live in Church-street, St. Giles's. On the 24th of December, I was lodging with the prisoner, who keeps a lodging-house—there were seven or eight other persons in the room where I lodged—I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock—the prisoner was then in the room, and the seven or eight other persons—I pulled off my clothes—I had a half-sovereign, and the other money, safe in my trowsers pocket—I put my trowsers under the bolster—I got up between nine and ten o'clock in my morning, and my money was gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You know when you got up you found a hole in your trowsers pocket—you said the money had fallen on the floor, and you took a broom and swepty. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I swept the floor, but there was no hole in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You sent out for a deal of liquor that night, and was drunk at the same time; and I said, the next day, that if you missed a half<lb></lb>sovereign, you must have sent it down in mistake. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> you did say so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Daniel Downes, a tailor. I lodged with the prisoner—I remember the prosecutor's coming home—he went to bed with his wife—I afterwards saw the prisoner go to his bed-side, and kneel down—his trowsers were on the bloster out side—she had her hand in the pocket of them—I went and asked what she was doing—she said she was looking for a flat-iron—I told her she could</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Are you not ashamed to be telling such lies? you know you were drunk, and fighting. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I am not telling lies—the man who was in the room knows the same—I was at home all the time with my baby—we were not fighting—I have had no quarrel with the prisoner.</p>

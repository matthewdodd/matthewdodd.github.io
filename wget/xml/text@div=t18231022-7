            . I live with my father, in Castle-street, Poplar, and am in the service of Mr. Hutchinson, a cooper - the prisoner's husband was his clerk. On the 15th of September, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner, his wife, were at words, and my master sent me to see what it was about; they had just come from Lambeth-street. When I got to the door, the prisoner was looking out of window, and would not let her husband in, and was laughing at him; he sent me to fetch an officer - I could not find one, came back, and knocked at the door; Mrs. Smith opened it. I said,</p>
               <p>"Is Mr. Thorn within" - he called out,</p>
               <p>"Yes, Peter, come in;" I went in; Smith shut the door, and I got about half way along the passage, and the prisoner rushed out of the kitchen, and struck me on the head with a knife; it cut my head - she turned me out, and shut the door. I had my cap on. I put my hand up to my head, and found butter on it, and some blood, and went to the surgeon.</p>

            . I was at the house, and went with the prisoner that morning to Lambeth-street - she and her husband were quarrelling. I let the boy in, but did not see her strike him, or notice any revenge or violence in her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220008"></xptr>manner. Her children were eating bread and butter. I cannot say whether she was cutting bread and butter at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep an oil-shop at 78, Castle-street, Kentish-town—on 26th November, about a quarter to 10 o'clock, the prisoner came in for a pot of marmalade—he gave me a florin—I bit it, found it was bad, and returned it to him—my teeth made two impressions on it—he said, "I have just taken it at the railway-station; I have just come up from the country; I will take it back and change it"—he ran out of the shop—I kept the marmalade—I afterwards spoke to my neighbour, Mr. Young, and pointed the prisoner out to him—the prisoner was brought back to the shop between 1 and 2 o'clock, by a constable, who said, "Is this the man that passed the bad two-shilling piece to you?"—I said, "It is"—he asked me if I should know it again—I said, "Yes, because I bit it"—he showed it to me, and I recognised it—this is it—I know it by the two marks of my teeth.</p>

On Monday, 6th November, Mr. Young pointed out the prisoner to me in Eastcheap; he was going at a rapid pace towards London-bridge—I tapped him on the shoulder near Talbot-court—I said, "You are wanted"—he said, "What for?" I said, "You will hear presently"—Mr. Young came up and charged him with passing a bad florin in Kentish-town—he made no reply—I asked him the question two or three times, and he said, "Well, I did take a bad two shilling-piece in change of a sovereign at a railway-station"—I said, "Have you got any money on you?" he said, "Yes", and produced his purse—I examined it and found 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in good money, and the bad florin—I said, "Well, there is a bad florin here"—he said, "Yes, that is the one I took in change at the railway-station—I did not test it; I took it to Seething-lane station—I saw him put his hands to his mouth, and distinctly afterwards, I heard a noise in his throat—I said, "What have you got in your mouth?"—he said, "It is only a crust of bread and cheese"—I said, "I do not believe it, that sounds to me like money"—the inspector directed me to seize him by the throat, which I did, and this shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) came out of his mouth into my hand—he gave me his card at the station, by which he appeared to be a provision merchant, at 58, in a road in Bayswater—I inquired at 59, and found he was there in charge of an empty house.</p>

I am a cheesemonger, of 66, Carl ton-road, Kentish-town, next door to Mr. Savage, at 68; the numbers run odd and even—Mr. Savage pointed the prisoner out to me, and I followed him—he went into Mr. Suter's, the Prince of Wales—I spoke to Mr. Suter—the prisoner came out, and I followed him to Malden-road—he went to the Chalk-farm station, and took a ticket there—I left him on the platform, and went into the street to look for a policeman, but could not find one; hearing the bells ringing for the train to start, I ran as hard as I could to the Camden-town-station, and caught the train there—I shifted out of different carriages till 1 found the prisoner—he got out at Fenchurch-street, and I followed him into Eastcheap, where I spoke to a policeman—I have heard what the policeman has stated; it is quite correct.</p>

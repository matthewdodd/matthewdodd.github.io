            ; he was searched, but nothing found upon him; his lodgings were then searched, where some soap was found; he at first denied it, but when he learned that some soap had been found, he then confessed, without any promise or threat, that he had taken some from the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. Did the prisoner acknowledge that he had taken that identical soap? - A. No; he said he had taken about ten pounds; I asked, had he taken ten hundred weight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160016"></xptr>or ten pounds; and he said, it might be about ten pounds.</p>
               <p>JOHN GRIFTITHS sworn. - I apprehended the prisoner: I went, with a search-warrant, to his lodgings, and found this small quantity of soap,(producing it); my brother officer, I believe, found some more; after we had got to the Flying-horse, Mr. Taylor asked him how many hundred weight he had robbed him of during the time he had lived with him; he said he had not taken one hundred weight, he believed he might have taken about ten pounds weight at different times; he said, he might have taken it either to wash his hands or his apron, I cannot say which.(Osman, the other officer, produced another quantity of soap).</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence.</p>

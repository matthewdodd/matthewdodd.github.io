I was at home on Wednesday night when the mob came; they came with a bell, a great many together; it was between ten and eleven o'clock; I would not go to bed left my house should be set on fire. I went down and took my long staff, I thought there would be other peace officers as well as myself; there were four; they went away, and then I went and put my staff in doors; I went to the house opposite Mr. Lebarty's; I saw the prisoner there, he is a neighbour. I have known him some little time; I saw him and his wife pulling the things about; he pulled down the window shutters on the outside of the house; then the mob went in and threw different things out at the window, beds and furniture; there was among the rest a shirt or shift, which the prisoner took up and put into his pocket. I said to a neighbour it was very hard to see these things taken away from a good neighbour as Lebarty was. I saw Turner take a grate out of the house; when I took him he acknowledged he had taken the grate, and his wife took me to the house where they had sold it.</p>

               <p>During the time you saw the prisoner what were the mob doing? - There were twenty or thirty destroying every thing in the house, and throwing them out at the window. I apprehended the prisoner about four days after; there was no place to put people in, and we were afraid to take them sooner.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner, are you sure that is the person of whom you have been speaking? - He is a near neighbour of mine therefore I know him; I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you tell Lebarty this? - The next morning or the day after as soon as I could find him, because his family ran away from the house; they were not to be found the next day.</p>
               <p>Was the grate traced out? - He sold it three or four days after; I had the man he sold it to before the justice; he said his man had broke it up and made nails of it.</p>
               <p>Do you know who sold it? - The prisoner's wife.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What time did you see me taking away the grate? - When he took the grate it was between two and three o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was a watchman in the parish of St. Catherine's? - No, he was not then. They brought him in as a watchman, about three days after.</p>

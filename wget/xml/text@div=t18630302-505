                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Martin, of 1, Glasshouse-street, Whitechapel—on Saturday night, 3d January, I went into the Sir Sydney Smith public-house, Dockhead, and saw the prisoner there drinking—she gate the pot to a woman who went in with me, and told her to hand it to me—I said, "I do not want it, thank you"—I drank, and gave it back—I went home, and the prisoner came in about 1 o'clock—she said nothing, but hit me a heavy blow with a glass on the head; it knocked me senseless—I ran out for a policeman, but could not find one—I called through the window, and then went down stairs, and can recollect no more, as I became insensible—I next found myself in the London Hospital—I am sure it was with a glass—she has struck me before with a glass, and had six months' imprison<lb></lb>ment for it—she swore, since she came out, that she would have three swings on the gallosubpœnaed for me.</p>

I am the wife of James Burke, of 39, Glasshouse-street, about thirty yards from Mrs. Martin's—on this Sunday morning, be<lb></lb>tween 1 and 2 o'clock, I heard cries coming from Mrs. Martin's house of "Murder! murder! police! Annie Sullivan, you have killed me and my child!"—I saw a woman run from the corner up Garden-court, and next morning, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I found the middle part of a tumbler (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with lots of blood on it; I gave it to the serjeant—it was swept out of No. 1, Garden-court, with some sawdust, when I went for the milk.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow Prisoner's Counsel. How long have you been a shopmate with the prisoner? - Five or six years.</p>

               <p>What was you? - At the time this happened I was what they call finisher, and am so now.</p>
               <p>You did not expect any promotion? - No.</p>

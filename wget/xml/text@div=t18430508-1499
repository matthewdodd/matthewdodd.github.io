                  </hi>. I live at No. 171, Oxford-street, and am a jeweller. On the 13th of March a woman came to my shop about six o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing—I cannot positively say whether it was the prisoner or not—I believe now it was her—she wished to look at some gold watches, and pointed out one in the window—after some time she said she was commissioned by a young lady, who had lost hers, to purchase one—after some time she selected one at 12 guineas—she soon after selected a chain at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she ultimately</p>

               <p>from my master, I got my hat from the parlour, and followed her—when I got to the shop-door, I saw her ten or a dosen yards off—I am sure it was the same woman—I did not particularly notice her dress—I believe she had a dark shawl on—she had a white straw bonnet on—I do not know what it was trimmed with, but I think black, and a black veil—she had spectacles, and she appeared to me rather stout—I followed her to No. 10, Nassau-street, Middlesex-hospital—I did not lose sight of her only for a moment or two, while she turned the corners; but when I turned, I saw her, and I did not see any other woman like her—I am certain the woman who was in my mas<lb></lb>ter's shop went into No. 10, Nassau-street—I waited about for three quarters of an hour, but she did not come out that I saw.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the A division of police. On the 14th of March I found the prisoner at Mr. Wyatt's—I told her she was charged with stealing a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, the property of Mr. Wyatt—she denied it—I took her to the station in Vine-street—I asked for the key of her room, which she gave me—I then went to the second floor front room at No. 10, Nassau-street, which I found locked—the key the prisoner gave me unlocked it—I found in that room two paper parcels, one contained two sovereigns and six half-sovereigns, and the other three sovereigns and two half-sovereigns—I found 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I found some wearing a<lb></lb>parel, and two boas, one of which is brown—a shawl, and this straw bonnet crushed, and put inside two other bonnets—this trimming, which is on it now, was taken off and put into a child's bonnet in the same box—I put it on this bonnet myself—I also found a black lace veil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you get the key of her lodging? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the morning of the 14th—I made a cursory search the same morning before</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184305080086"></xptr>
               <p>going before the Magistrate—I found these articles on the Thursday follow<lb></lb>ing—I had in the meantime kept the key—I was twice before the Magistrate—I do not know that I showed this bonnet to Mr. Wyatt—it was before the Magistrate—I do not know whether I took it out of the bundle—I do not re<lb></lb>collect that I showed it to him at any time, nor to Mr. Mills—he might have seen it before the Magistrate—I do not remember that I showed it him—I am almost sure I did not—I do not know that I showed it at Mr. Mills's shop to either of his shop boys or apprentices—I showed the shawl to Chal<lb></lb>len, in the room—I went to Mills's shop frequently—I did not see Mr. Mills every time—I went there to caution them to be at Marlborough-street—I went one erening to take one of his apprentices with me about a French bas<lb></lb>ket, which it was said the party who purchased the watch had on her arm—I did not find a French basket at the prisoner's lodging—I went to her lodg<lb></lb>ing again, I think, on the morning before the examination, at Marlborough-street, but I cannot be positive—I took no notice of it—I saw two persons who came for the prisoner—I did not tell them to go away—I saw them with the witnesses for the prosecution, and I did not think that proper—I did not find any spectacles.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 10, Nassau-street, Middlesex Hos<lb></lb>pital—the prisoner lodged in the first floor back room—she then went from me, and took the front room up stairs—the was lodging there on the 13th of March—I never saw her in that room but once, which was the day before this happened—I went up to her then—I did not notice what dress she had on—she came down to my room that evening—she was then in a black dress as usual.</p>

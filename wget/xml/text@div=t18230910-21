On the 8th of July, about a quarter before five o'clock, I was at the White Horse, public-house; Dance and the prisoners were there. When I went in, Dance sat by himself - he was rather in liquor; he got up, and Insworth collared him, and sat him down again; Dance moved to get up, and he sat him down again, and Blagrove went and put his hand up the chimney, and smutted his face - he said nothing, and Blagrove did it again. He moved to go out at the tap-room door, and Hill secured and threw him against the settle, violently - Blagrove and Insworth were both in the tap-room at the time, sitting down, but did not touch him at this time. Dance was thrown down so violently that we took him out of the tap-room - he could not get up himself. We washed his face. and I left him in the wash-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How long were you there - A. An hour; I left at a quarter to six o'clock. I saw a woman in a red cloak there. Dance did not appear much in liquor. Insworth's face was not blacked. They were larking with Dance.</p>

            . I saw the deceased pushed against the settle; Blagrove had hold of his coat flap, and Hill had his hand against his breast to set him down, but there was no intention of throwing him - he was very much intoxicated, and fell against the settle with his right side. I carried him out - he said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, my loins," and groaned very much, but never spoke afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100018"></xptr>Cross-examined. Q. When did you leave the house - A. I was there all the evening. He fell down from intoxication.</p>
               <p>- MATTHEWS. I keep this house. The deceased was taken home in about two hours. I took all the care of him that I could.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The care you took was to send him to the privy, and leave him there for two hours - A. No; I sent people to mind him - he might be there an hour. I sent him home in a wheel barrow, having nothing else.</p>
               <p>G. J. R. G. DICKENSON. I am a surgeon. I saw the deceased on Saturday morning; two ribs were broken on the right side, and there was about two ounces of coagulated blood on the brain, which occasioned his death. A blow or fall against a hard substance would produce this - his general habit of body was continual intoxication; but whether it arose from intoxication I cannot say - the fall might extend the vessels. It is my opinion that the fall occasioned his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If he was drunk at the time, is it not probable that intoxication might rupture the vessel - A. Yes, without any blow. There was no external injury on the head.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Considering that he was drunk, do you think the violence he received from being forced down accelerated his death - A. I do; when I hear that he was thrown down, I believe his death was accelerated by the rupture of a blood vessel. The rupture might be very gradual - he might only feel a head-ache for five minutes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have heard that he was drunk, is it your opinion that the violence of the fall accelerated his death - A. Certainly if he fell; his head was injured. If he fell with sufficient violence to break his ribs, that might rupture the vessel.</p>

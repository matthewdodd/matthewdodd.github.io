            , I am a potter, and live in Harrow-road, Paddington. I was at the King's Arms, Edgeware-road, in October or November, and saw the prisoner there, he was asking the landlady to change a 1 l. note for a pot of beer, she said she could not. I had silver and gave it him; I am sure he is the man, I had not seen him before. He gave me the name W. Messenger, and referred me to Adams's eating-house at Paddington, (looks at a note) this is it. I then left him. I paid the note for a bill, it was returned a fortnight after, marked forged. I then went over to Adams, they knew him, but could not tell where he lived, but said they would mention it to him when they saw him. I never saw him about it. I do not know when it was returned; I am certain he is the man. I understood them to say he had lived there.</p>

On the evening of the 9th of May, the prisoner, and a woman, came into the shop, the woman asked to look at some flannel; I took her further up the shop, and saw the prisoner go out - He had stood in the shop, about three yards from the door; I asked him what he wanted, and he said he came with the woman; while I was shewing her the flannel he went out - He had a basket in his hand. I did not miss any thing - I pursued him, and followed him about twenty yards, and never lost sight of him; when I came up to him he threw the basket at me, and said"take it." He was secured before I lost sight of him. The check was in the basket-it was taken from the window, and must have been taken by a person within the shop. I did not see him take it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watch maker, and live at No. 2, Goswell Street. On 29th June I was in Cutler Street, Houndsditch, about half past 12 o'clock in the day—there was a crowd of people there—I had been followed up for a little way by two persons, one in front of me and one behind—I had a watch in my waistcoat pocket—I had some suspicions—I found the prisoner directly in front of me, so that I could not go on—I turned round, and said, "What is your game?"—some others behind me pushed me, and said, "D—you, why don't you go on?"—I had 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about me in money, and I tried to save that—at that moment I felt my watch and my money safe in my pockets—the party behind pushed me about, and pulled my left arm away from my waistcoat pocket, and turned me quite round—the prisoner who was in front of me then pulled the watch out of my pocket, as far as I could see, and it was twisted off, and I found the ribbon to which it was attached hanging down—no sooner was the watch gone than they all left me—I looked round, and saw the prisoner passing the watch to another person just behind me—I immediately seized the prisoner—he said, "It ain't me"—he struck me very violently several times on the left cheek—I held him for some time—I got him up against the corner of a public house—he got away from me once or twice about a yard or a yard and a half—I did not lose sight of him at all—I got hold of him again—he struck me a second time, and then the officer came up, and took him into custody—the man who received the watch ran round the corner—I should know him if I were to see him again—I held the prisoner till a policeman came up—I was knocked down several times—I was rather excited.</p>

               <p>through when I want to go to Houndsditch—this was on Sunday morning—it is more crowded on Sunday than on any other day—it is a regular Jews' place—any old kind of rubbish is sold there—I was about the middle of the lane when this happened—I was not pressed by the crowd the moment I got into the lane—there was a gang of them standing there—I said, "What's your <hi rend="italic">game?"</hi>—the people are about as thick as they can crowd—I could not say how many were about me; it was a complete mass of crowd—there are plenty of people always about—I had only just got across the lane—it was at the corner of a public house—I was there when my arm was turned round—when I charged the prisoner with stealing my watch, he denied it—he was very violent, and struck me several times—he knocked me down; when I got up, he struck me again—I had some assistance from the inhabitants—most of the mass got away, and I saw no more of them—the prisoner was the only one that struck me that I could see—my hat was not over my eyes when my watch was taken—they tried to knock it over my eyes, but it fits too tight—my watch was in my left side pocket—my money was in my trowsers pocket—at the station house I made a charge against the prisoner, and he denied it—he said he knew nothing about my watch—he was behind me at first—after I lost my watch, he was in front of me—it was a gold watch, a Geneva lever—I have never seen the prisoner before—I do not know whether he is of the same persuasion as myself—I sometimes go through Petticoat Lane on Sunday afternoons, when I go to see a friend of mine at Houndsditch.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 6). On 28th June I was in Harrow Alley—I saw a crowd of people there, in the centre—I went up to it—I saw the prosecutor there—I saw that some one was knocking him about; I could not tell who it was—there were a great number present—they were all thieves—he came to me in a state of great excitement, and pointed the prisoner out to me, and said he had seen him pass his watch to another person—I was coming from the pavement, and he was in the middle of the road—the prisoner had gone on to the pavement, and the prosecutor followed him—the prosecutor was in a position to keep him in sight—I immediately laid hold of him, and told him to come with me—before that I said to the prosecutor, "Has he got the watch about him, do you think?"—he said, "No, I saw him pass it to another person"—the moment I laid hold of him, he said he would not go, and resisted most violently—I laid hold of him by the collar, but he said he would not go—I was dragged about in the road for the space of two or three minutes before I got him back on the pavement again—I had hold of him by the neck—I said I would draw my truncheon—at that moment I was seized by a woman and two or three more behind—a little boy ran down to the sergeant in Petticoat Lane—I had called on the public to assist, but not one of them would do so—the sergeant came up eventually, and the prisoner then came quietly—I took him round the back way—I did not let him go at all—I found a shilling, and a tobacco box, and a pencil on him—he made a most desperate resistance.</p>

Q.</hi> This is not a very respectable neighbourhood, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it is not—this was not in Petticoat Lane, it was in an alley—there are a great many thieves there—I believe the majority of thieves go there on Sunday mornings to sell their plunder—I do not know anything against the prisoner, but I do not believe he is here in his right name—I have no reason to say that he is a thief—the parties whom I say were thieves are many of them known to me—I should say there were 700</p>

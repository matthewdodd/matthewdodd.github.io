                  </hi>. I am a seaman. I came to London from Plymouth, at the latter end of June. On the 6th of July I was At the Pavior's Arms, Ratcliffe-highway, between five and six o'clock in the evening—I was rather in liquor—the two prisoners were there, and gave me very great abuse, and dragged me out to fight—they <hi rend="italic">hauled</hi> my jacket off, and when I got out I was knocked down by the male prisoner, and could recollect nothing more till the next morning—I was at the corner of Chancery-court, close to the tap-room—I was knocked down with a fist, or something—some kind of an iron weapon was struck through my lip—I had received an advance note for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the night before, and had a sovereign and four half-crowns, and in all 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in my left-hand waistcoat pocket—I took it out in the Pavior's Arms, 'and Wrapped it up in an old letter—I do not know that the prisoners saw that—(when I came to myself next morning, both my waistcoat and money were gone)—two bakers were enticing me to fight this man—after I was knocked down the woman jumped on my face with her feet, as I am informed—I was fourteen days in the London Hospital, and never moved Out of bed, from the injuries I got—the prisoners passed as man and wife—the woman did not say much in the public-house—she did nothing to me there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Union-street, Shadwell—I was at the Pavior's Arms on the 6th of July, and saw the two prisoners and the prosecutor in front of the bar—the male prisoner was quarrelling with the prosecutor concerning a debt—the disturbance became great, and the landlord ejected them from the bar, and they got under the archway—the prosecutor was very much intoxicated, and in a beastly state—it was as much as he could do to stand—some journey men bakers excited him to pull his jacket off, and fight the male prisoner—the prosecutor did pull off his jacket, and his waistcoat was unbuttoned—they were cavilling for some time in words, and I went away to my stall at the door of the public-house, at the comer of Angel-gardens—in a few minutes I heard a great outcry of, "Oh, don't murder the man!"—I immediately ran down with two more young men—the male prisoner had hold of the prosecutor's shoulder, and they both fell down together in Chancery court—the moment the prosecutor was on the ground, the female prisoner ran and kicked him in the face—she had some instrument in her hand, but I could not see exactly what it was, and she struck him over the top lip—it was either an Italian heater, or a large door-key—he immediately became senseless—after that there was a great cry for the police, who came and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183708140064"></xptr>
               <p>the prisoners made their escape to the house at the left-hand side of the court—I did not see that male prisoner do any thing besides throw the man down—the prosecutor had a waistcoat on when I first saw him, but it was unbuttoned—I had no clear view of him after, till he was with the policeman—he then had no waistcoat on, and was insensible from injury—he had a cut on the upper lip, and bled profusely from the nose.</p>

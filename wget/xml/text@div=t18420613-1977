                  </hi>. I live with my father, John Harwood, at Church<lb></lb>hill, Woolwich—he keeps a clothes-shop. On the 14th of June, about two o'clock, I noticed a piece of iron on which some clothes were moving, and saw the prisoner leaving the door, putting the trowsers under her arm—I followed her, and told her she had taken a pair of trowsers from the door—she said she had not—I said I saw her putting them under her arm</p>

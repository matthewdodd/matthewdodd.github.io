                  </hi>. I am the widow of Benjamin Gould, and live in Worship-street. The prisoner was my servant for about two months—she came to me in June, I think—I had a cash-box containing 4 £50 and I £30 notes—it was always kept locked, and put into another chest which was locked—I did not miss the £30 note till the 29th of August—I kept my keys on a bunch—I had given them to the prisoner on the Sunday and Monday previous, to get a clean table-cloth out of the chest—on miss<lb></lb>ing my note, I asked if she had let the keys go out of her hand—she said, "No, never"—I always cautioned her not to give the keys to any one—I did not tell her I had lost the note—I never sent her to get it changed—I afterwards saw her at Mr. Whiskard's, and asked her where she got the £30 note—she said a girl in the street gave it to her.</p>

On the Friday, the day the prisoner was apprehended, she told me to look up the chimney—I did so, and found a little box which contained a Bank-note—I do not know how much it was for—the prisoner asked me for it—I would not give it to her, but said, I would keep it, and see if any inquiries were made after it—I and the prisoner went out in the evening with some chips, and she asked me for the note again—I then gave it to her—she said she would go and get it changed—we saw Sarah Stone sitting at her door, and the prisoner asked her if she would do her a favour—she said, yes, if she could, what was it?—the prisoner said, "To go and get my mistress change for this note"—we went with her to Mr. Whiskard's—Stone there produced the note in our presence, and we were detained and taken to the station-house.</p>

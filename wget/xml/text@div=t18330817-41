Yes; we had a stock in, of which these three pieces formed a part, they were numbered 34, 35, and 36 - other linen may resemble these in number and mark, but I have no doubt this is ours - we have received linen from Milk-street, but not of this sort.</p>

            . I live in Crawford-street. I deal with Mr. Morley - I ordered three pieces of cloth of him, and the next day the prisoner brought two pieces - there was an invoice of three pieces, and a piece of muslin; I made no observation at the time - he stopped his cart at the door, and I saw him take two pieces which he brought in and said, "From Mr. Morley's, Ma'am" - I told him to put it on the counter, and I did not find out till the next morning, that one was missing; the piece now produced resembles the piece which should have accompanied the other two.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not say to the prisoner,"It is all right?" A. He came to the door and said,"From Mr. Morley's, Ma'am" - I said, "Very well, that is right, put it down;" I was standing at the door when the cart stopped.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you not standing behind the counter? A. No, I was not; my sister and three daughters were - I told you to put them down.</p>

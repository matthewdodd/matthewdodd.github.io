               <p>Q.Did you lose a watch at any time - A. On the 2d of August, after I had gone to dinner, I took my watch out of my waistcoat pocket to see if it was time to go to work, it was time to go to work; there was nobody was there but Smith, he worked in the same yard that I worked. I put the watch into my pocket again and went to work I pulled my jacket off and hung it up in the shop, the watch was then in my jacket pocket. It was a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this shop - A. About six doors from the Bluecoat Boy.</p>
               <p>Q.Did the prisoner see that you had a watch - A. Yes; there was no other person with me but him and his mate; his mate's name is Waitford, he is not here. The prisoner saw me pull it out in the public-house; it was safe in my jacket pocket when I hung it up in the shop. In about half an hour afterwards they came to work in the adjoining yard. After they came back Smith came to the partition that parts the two yards and asked me to go and take take some gin; I went. I was not absent more than five minutes; the prisoner and his mate staid with me all the time I was in the public-house; I went to my work, and they went to their work; immediately I returned I went for my watch, and it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. They were with you, what possibility had he of taking it, he did not come into the shop, he asked you outside of the partition, and from the time that you left the shop he was with you, he could not be the stealer - A. No, he could not. I suspected no man but Smith and his mate, and the watch was found upon Smith.</p>
               <p>- COOK. This is the watch.</p>

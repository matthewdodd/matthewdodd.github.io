I carried it as far as Back-lane, Islington; I then saw the trunk in my cart; I did not miss it till a quarter of an hour after which might be between five and six o'clock, when I got to <placeName id="t17800913-18-crimeloc104">Islington work-house</placeName>

I went to assist; they ran away and left the truck behind them; I pursued them, and they were taken about ten minutes after; I never lost sight of them. The trunk lay on the left side of the fore-part of the cart; I think it could not drop out.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Brown of Hornsey. I was told the first cart was robbed; several of us were going out of town; I was following behind; it was half past five; upon which I got over the gate and found the two men lying down by the trunk against the wall by the work-house; upon my coming over they both jumped up; when I came within twenty yards of them they left the trunk. French, upon my coming up, drew his knife and said If I came nearer he would run it into me. However I kept to them, and then they ran away; I ran a field after them, then I could run no farther, and Woodhouse continued the pursuit till they were taken. I am positive they are the men; I had not seen them on the road before.</p>

There was nobody in sight when they went to the cart; the carts which were following them had not turned the wall, and therefore they were not in sight; it was just round the work-house; I was catching sparrows in a field, where, I believe, they did not see me; upon seeing this I went and told that man who was then just come in sight; by that time hey had just got it over the gate; they did not stop the cart but took it out as the cart went along; the people ran after them, and I saw no more of them (the trunk is produced.) I believe this to be the very trunk I saw them take out of the cart.</p>

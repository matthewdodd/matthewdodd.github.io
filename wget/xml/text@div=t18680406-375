I am the father of the prisoner Jacobs—I recollect his coming home on 15th March, which fell on a Sunday—just as we sat down to dinner, about 2 o'clock—he remained with me all the afternoon, up till 7 in the evening—I then left to go to my duty and saw no more of him—it was his constant habit to come home on a Sunday, even if he stopped away the remaining part of the week, to get his clean clothes—I live at 8, Ship Street, Millwall, close to the police station—I should say that is 2¼ or 21/2 miles from Five Bell Alley—I came home at about 6.15 next morning, and my son was in bed then—my wife is not here.</p>

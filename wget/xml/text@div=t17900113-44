I met the prisoner on Monday the 28th of December, a little after six in the morning, I believe it might be a quarter or twenty minutes; he had a bag on his shoulder; I asked him what he had there? he said, they were clothes of his: I took him to a publick-house, and found all these articles in the bag; I asked him how he got them? and he said, the sheets were his sister's, and that he had borrowed them, in order to pledge them, to raise money; I then asked him where he came from, and he said he came from Islington; and not giving me a satisfactory account, I took him to a lock-up-house; and half an hour after he told me he brought the sheets from his lodgings, the Pied Bull, at Islington; I had not then either threatened, or given him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130053"></xptr>expectations of favour; I then asked him about the other things; not promising or threatening him; and he said they were things that he found under the pillow where he slept, and that being in the dark he put them all into a bag; I then sent to Saddington; he came down to the office directly; he did not swear positively to his sheets, only compared them with others; then Frewster came down and owned the other things; the prisoner told me the soldier let him out of the house.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The sheets there is no mark on; but I sampled them with a pair more, and I have forty yards of the same cloth, and they match and tally.</p>

             . On Friday night, I can't remember the day of the month, but it was in August last, about 11 at night, I went backwards and saw Mr. Harvey's warehouse door safe. There is a press in the warehouse, and that was fast too; and the next morning the warehouse door was found open, and a piece of Holland and a razor-case lying on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Wyrill . I am servant to Mr. Stevenson, of whom Mr. Harvey rents the warehouse, and I went out about 7 o'clock in the morning, and seeing the warehouse door broke open, I informed Mr. Harvey of it, and he examined his press and missed these things. On the Monday following Mr. Harvey advertised them, and about 11 o'clock a person in Newgate sent a letter to Mr. Harvey, informing him, that the man who stole the goods was detained. Upon this I went to the prisoner Frankland , who was a debtor in Newgate, and saw the goods in his possession. Culliford was brought here then, and I could not see him at that time. Frankland took me into his room and shewed me the things, and said he gave Culliford a guinea and an half, and half a crown for them.</p>
               <p>C. Do you know any thing of Culliford's being brought before the Lord Mayor?</p>
               <p>Wyrill . When I came to Newgate, it being Sessions time, Culliford was brought here, and while he was before the Lord Mayor, he said he came to see Frankland in Newgate, and that he had these goods from another person on the other-side of the water.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Frankland . I wrote Mr. Harvey the letter, and I desire it may be read.</p>

            . I have been a debtor upwards of two years in Newgate. About a week before last Sessions, I was walking in the hall, and Culliford and another person came up to the hatch: we drank half a pint of gin together, and while we were drinking it, Frankland came up, and said, Jack, how are you? (for we vulgarly call him Jack) you are soon come back. Yes, says Jack, I told you I should not stay long. Well, says Frankland , I would have you look sharp, and see what you can get, and bring it to me: let it he what it will, I will take it off your hands. I was then called away, and heard no more 'till the goods were found.</p>

            . I have been seventeen months a debtor in Newgate. I went to the grate about my own business; I can't exactly tell the time, but I believe it was the Friday before Culliford was taken. Frankland shook hands with him, and said, I am glad to see thee, Jack! and if you get any thing worth your while, bring it to me, and if it is the King's plate, I will take it of you. I afterwards heard Frankland say he had read the Advertiser, that he had sent the gentleman a letter, and had stopped

             of Warwick in Warwick Lane. When Frankland had given me the money, he put an old pair of breeches and a broken punch-bowl into the bag, because the turnkeys should not think I had left any thing in the goal. He desired me to bring Boredon to him when Mr. Wilcox was at the Magpie, and I did so, and I heard him tell Boredon, that he was going to be moved to the King's Bench, and therefore should want money, but he would make it up 3 l. On the Monday following I went to the Porto-Bello in Chick-lane, and seeing the things advertised, I got the paper, and brought it to Frankland . He clapped me on the shoulder, and said, What are you going to be a thief and thief catcher too! I will stop you, and so he called for a pen and ink and wrote to the gentleman, and had me taken.</p>

               <p>Frankland. This Gulliford came to me and brought these things to me as India goods. I told him Maryland and Virginia were a great way from the East-Indies . He said he came north about for fear of the privateers, and coming along side of an India man, he swopp'd (exchanged) rum for these goods. He wanted two guineas on them: I had a guinea and half, and half a crown and 4 s. in silver, and upon his promise to fetch his goods away on monday, I lent him a guinea and half, and half a crown and a shilling. He asked me if I had any old rags? and so I gave him an o'd pair of breeches, and a punch bowl to put into his bag for fear the people should take notice. I shewed my wife these goods, and she telling me they were not India, I imagined he had robb'd some Scotch pedlar of them, and as soon as the gates were open, I sent for the Advertiser, and seeing them advertised, I sent a letter to the gentleman. Culliford coming to me afterwards, I desired Mr. Wilcox to secure him, and I delivered the goods to the gentleman. I deliver'd the goods in one hand, and the thief in the other, and what could any honest man do more? What reason the gentleman had to charge me with felony, I can't tell: I have lost my money: I have let him have his goods without money, and yet I have been charged with felony.</p>

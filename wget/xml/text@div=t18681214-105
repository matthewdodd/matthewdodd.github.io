                  </hi>. I am clerk to some navy agents, and live at 29, Leighton Road—during the four years I have been possessed of those pre<lb></lb>mises I have become acquainted with Mr. Pyke's handwriting—this letter, of 26th September, 1868, is his writing; I received it by post—it is a registered letter.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">This was the alleged libel. It was very long and incoherent, alleging a conspiracy on the part of the prosecutor and others to ruin the defendant and his family, and alluding to various acts of trespass and injury done to his garden wall</hi>.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many notices have you received from me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think about four—the first was in 1866, followed by others up to September 26, this year—we have not been living on terms of cordiality with the exception of this question of right—I have always tried to keep the peace with you, and I have found it impossible—my feeling has not been excited solely by these notices, there have been an immense number of other grounds—I was not asked before the Magistrate whether my feelings had been injured or insulted by you—I did not state that I was unable to give any instance—I am one of the trustees of the Wesleyan chapel in Lady Margaret's Road—I have not seen any of your notices to the trustees, warning them of various trespasses on property in Kentish Town, in which you were interested—it is a well known fact that you write to everybody, claiming everything, the ground on which our chapel is built, among the rest; but that is a question that you can fight with St. John's College, whenever you please; the ground belongs to them—you complain, in one of your letters, that I cut off some of your flowers—I received a letter from you, dated 21st September, five days previous to the present one—(<hi rend="italic">looking at several papers</hi>) these were not sent to you by me, they were sent by my solicitors, Messrs. Walker, they are signed by their manager, Mr. Cooper, they were written by my authority—one of those documents was for your signa<lb></lb>ture, you refused to sign it, and hence the present proceeding—I dare say I have seen this placard before—it was put up by me—you and Mrs. Pyke first of all tarred my wall, and I put up that, and the result of it was, that Mrs. Pyke black-leaded the wall—I am the proprietor of the wall—on 20th October, I took out two summonses against you and your wife, for painting my wall—they were dismissed—this paper of yours is not a fair statement of the case before the Magistrate, it is very unfair, inasmuch as Mr. Mansfield most distinctly stated that he could not interfere in the question of rights, so he decided and confirmed the previous question of right—you asked me afterwards to go home and dine with you, and I indignantly refused, after the treatment I had received at your hands—you put glass and cement on the wall one night, and I knocked it off intentionally—if you consider you have a right to the wall, I am perfectly prepared to meet you in a Civil Court, but upon that wall you shall put nothing—I wrote you this letter of 26th September, reqesting you to remove some wood that you had most improperly placed on the wall, and your answer to that was the alleged libel—I have not defaced your wall or balcony, or sitting or drawing room—I have recoloured the side of your</p>

               <p>house that overlooks my kitchen—I have not scooped out the mortar, or injured or defaced it in any way—there have not been mebs collected in consequence of this placard—I had a right to stick up what I pleased on my own walls—I have not dug up the foundation of your side wall—I have a right to make any alteration I please—it has not affected your side of the house—I don't remember saying that if you interfered I would settle you in a brace of shakes, possibly I might—I did not receive this paper as a warning and notice not to injure the wall—I was in possession of the house some months prior to the trial of the case of "Pyke and Crane"—I was not thoroughly conversant with the nature of that trial—I saw a report of it in the newspaper, but I don't remember it—I am not aware that an action has been brought against Mr. Keen, a bricklayer, for doing the same to the wall that I have done—I am not aware that it is now pending.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">In the Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate, and also in a very long Defence, he represented that, having purchased property in the neighbourhood, twenty-five year ago, it had been continually encroached upon, and his rights interfered with, and that it was to maintain those rights that he had been in the habit of issuing notices similar to the alleged libel, and not from any malicious or vindictive motive.

             . On the 26th of January, between eight and nine in the evening, I went to the shop door of Mr. Swan, and found it open; I went in; the parlour door too was open; I called out Mr. Swan, the prisoner met me, and said, I am Mr. Swan, what do you want? I said I know Mr. Swan very well, you are not him. He had these things bundled up, not tied up in any wrapper or any thing; I seized him by the collar; then he dropped them, and strewed them about upon the shop floor. Mrs. Swan said she had seen him that day before.</p>

            . Some time that day the prisoner and a stout man, who was in blue clothes, came into the shop in order to buy some hinges, and asked whether I had any scales to weigh silver; a question I was never asked before. As soon as ever I came in, and was told what had happened, I said if I have been robbed that is the man: it affected me so I dropped. I am very certain that is the man I saw in the shop.</p>

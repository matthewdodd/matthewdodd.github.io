               <p>I am a patrol of St. Dunstan's parish. About a quarter before eleven, on Sunday night, the 7th of June, I was going my round, I goes up Crane-court, and just by Mr. Stafford's window I see a tall man, that man seeing me coming behind, he passed on towards the top of the court, just at the top of the court he stopped to make water; I passed him a sew yards, and I thought that he lived in the court, at some of the houses in the top; I returned, and as I returned I see Mr. Stafford's parlour window open, the sash lifted up; I could not see any body about the house then. I immediately comes down into Fleet-street, and I says to the watchman, do you know Mr. Stafford's window is open?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go back again? - Yes. I took the watchman with me, and as I was going up the steps, the same man that I see standing to make water at the top of the court, I see exactly under the parlour window that was thrown up, and he met me about ten yards up the court; says I, what do you want here? says he, I come to ease myself; says I, have you been easing yourself since I see you making water at the top of the court? says he, that is easing myself; says he, don't handle me, I am a housekeeper, I will give you my address. I immediately leads him back under the window; the watchman knocked at the door, William Hull came and opened the door; I asked him if he knew his window was open? he said there was somebody in the parlour; I thought he meant there was somebody belonging to the house there, and I losed the man that I had by the collar, and he instantly ran away, and at that instant, momentarily, I see the prisoner in the parlour, laying down on the window seat, inside of the parlour; I instantly rushed in and seized him. In the parlour there was a knife case moved from a side board from behind the door, on the carpet; there was a bonnet on the floor. We took him to the watch-house, and he had nothing found on him but a tobacco box, two shillings and a silk handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to your superior judgment, and the gentlemen of the jury.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do? - I went with him, and we met a tall young man in the court, and Mr. Quick collared him, and he asked him, what do you do here? says he, I am easing myself, says he, you cannot have eased yourself since I see you.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010086"></xptr>So we went up to Mr. Stafford's door, and I gave a double rap at the door, and I asked the young man if the house was all safe; and he saw a young man in the parlour, and he said, here is somebody here; and Mr. Quick let the person that he had in his custody go; and he took to his heels; and we seized the prisoner in the parlour. When I went round my round at ten o'clock, the windows were down; both of the window shutters are inside, so that they are out of the command of a watchman, but the windows were down.</p>

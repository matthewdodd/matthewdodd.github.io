             sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Ward: On Friday, the 23d of February, I had occasion to shew some mourning rings to a customer, I sent to a ring-maker, and he sent me a case containing fourteen rings; his name is Hopkins; I put them on the end of the counter.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is Mr. Ward liable to pay for those rings? - A. Yes. I put them on the end of the counter, expecting the gentleman to call, but he did not call that day; I saw them in the case about five o'clock, when I returned from dinner; about seven, the prisoner came in with a gold ear-ring, and asked if I could match it; I said, we had some nearly like it; I was seeking for them, with my back to the window, when I suppose he took them. He did not purchase the ear-rings, but went out of the shop. About an hour after the usual time of shutting up shop, I missed the case of rings.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Those fourteen rings you would have sold, if any body had fancied them? - A. Yes; I got them for that purpose. I endeavoured to recollect who had been in the shop from five to eight, and I could not recollect any body coming in but the prisoner. On the Saturday evening, two rings were brought to me. That is all that I know about it.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer in Cheap Ward: About seven o'clock, on Saturday evening, the 24th day of February, I was sent for to Messrs. Savory and Pryer's, in the Poultry; I had a ring gave me which was broke in four pieces; I met the prisoner at Mr. Pryer's, he said, his mother lived in Houndsditch; I went down the Poultry, up Throgmorton-street, and through Bishopsgate Church-yard; in going along, he asked me to go and drink; I told him, I would not; there was some silver in his left hand pocket, and it rattled. Coming to Houndsditch, he told me that was not the street where his mother lived, but, that his mother lived in Jerusalem-court; I told him there was no such court, and I took him to the Compter. I searched him at the Compter, and in his sob pocket I found an enamelled ring, one guinea, one half-guinea, five seven-shilling pieces, and some silver. On Monday, he was examined before the Lord-Mayor.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180039"></xptr>Court. Q. Was that examination taken down in writing? - A. I believe so. We went where he told us he had sold the rings. After he had been examined before the Lord-Mayor, I went to a silversmith and jeweller's shop in Lombard-street, I think his name is Hill, there I found a ring, that ring was delivered to me; we went from there to Bishopgate-street, to a Mr. Venable's, there was another ring there, I had that; then we went near Norton-falgate, to one Mr. Barker, a pawnbroker, there was a ring there, which was pawned, I got that; then we came to Cornhill, I don't know their names, they kept the rings themselves; the prisoner took me; I saw one in each of the houses in Cornhill; there were three houses. He was committed, on the 5th of March. I have nothing more to say about it.</p>

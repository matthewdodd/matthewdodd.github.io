            . I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 1st of April, 1826, the prisoner came home from half-past twelve to one o'clock at night; I opened the door, but told him not to come in till I had got to bed - but directly I got in he rushed into the room, said he was very cold, and begged of me to let him warm himself by the fire; I sat up in my bed, and begged him to take the candle and go to bed, but instead of that he turned it upside down in the candlestick, and begged me to let him sit a bit; he laid his head down, and pretended to be asleep - I was angry with him for putting out the candle: I have a double sel of man lodging there, who work at the gas-works - I still sat up in the bed, but dozed off to sleep - when I awoke<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050107"></xptr>he had put out the fire with a tea-kettle of water, and I heard him at the handles of my drawers; I asked who was there - he made no answer: I got out of bed, and put my hands nearly to him - he said, "Don't be frightened, mistress, it is me, I won't hurt you:" I said, "What business have you here?" he said he could not get out - I said, Nonsense; he then went out, and I heard him go up the first flight of stairs - I heard no more till a little before three o'clock, when I heard somebody go out - I did not get out of bed when I heard the prisoner at my drawers; I was on my knees at the foot of the bed, and when I felt him he laughed at me - I did not alarm my husband, as I did not know he had taken any thing; when I heard somebody go out I thought it was a man who worked at the gas, but no other man went out that morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If he were in the dark, feeling his way out, would he not be very likely to brush against the drawers? A. Yes, that was what I thought he did do - I locked the door when I heard him go out a little before three o'clock, but not when he went out of my room - I did not go to sleep after he went out; I made a complaint to the officer, but I did not go before a Magistrate till the prisoner was found, which was on the 26th of March last - he owed us some money; he had been out of work some time, and we kept him - he had promised to bring us a sovereign that night; I never said I would be revenged on him, nor that I would do for him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was it you lost? A. A silver watch, a steel chain, a kersey mere striped waistcoat, a pair of brown duck trousers, some caps, and 2s. 5d. - I had not been out of the room from the time I saw the watch safe; I missed it before six o'clock, when my husband came in for some halfpence, and they were gone from off the table where they had been - I am sure no one had been in the room from the time I saw the watch safe till the prisoner came - I suppose he left the room by twenty minutes after two o'clock; I knew a man would go out a little before three, and I thought with one getting up I would lock both doors.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I took the prisoner at his own lodging, in Wilson-street, Westminster, on the 20th of March: he said he had lodged at the prosecutor's house, but he had no knowledge of the robbery.</p>
               <p>JOHN WEBSTER. I went to his lodging at Westminster - I knocked at the door and asked if William Simpson lodged there: some man called him from his dinner - I said to him, "Will, how are you?" he said, "I don't know you," and pushed the door against me - I seized him, and said' "You are my prisoner;" he was stronger than I, and he got me out - I called a Policeman, but he could not get in, and he sent for some more to break the door open, but before they came the landlady opened the door, and the Policeman and I went in - we sat in conversation, and the prisoner called me Jack, and I said to the Policeman, "Take notice of that, he did not know me before:" I had seen my watch ten minutes before twelve o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How are you employed? A. In selling pies, and what I can - I did not ask the prisoner about the 8s., which he had borrowed.</p>
               <p>JURY to MARY WEBSTER. Q. Did the other man go out that morning? A. No - he used generally to go to attend cows, but did not that morning; he used to give another man 1s. to do his work on a Sunday morning sometimes.</p>

            . I lodged eight years with the prosecutor. The prisoner lodged there - he did not come to bed that night, and he left in the morning; the prosecutor came, and inquired for Simpson - I said he had not been there; he made some complaint of a loss at that time - he then came again, and mentioned about a watch and trousers; I had seen the prosecutor with a watch the Sunday before - he generally kept it in the room they lived in; I generally went in there to have my victuals, and so did the other lodgers - the drawer was not always locked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you awake all night? A. No, but I do not think it likely he could come into the room without my hearing him.</p>


               <p>Prisoner. When I lodged with him I had been working at the gas-house - I was then employed to lay the gas round Greenwich-college; I said it was too far for me to come, and they said they could not expect it.</p>
               <p>JOHN WEBSTER. He was out of work entirely till the last week, when he said he had got work; and he took victuals with him from me every morning, and some halfpence to get him some beer - I went to every place, within a mile or two of London, in search of him.</p>

            . I am a shoe-binder, and live in Wilson-street, in the same house as the prisoner did.

               <p>COURT. Q. Did not you go to her and say, "What a horrid woman you are?" A. No; I came down with Mrs. Simpson to help her carry her child; I did not hear Mrs. Webster say any thing more; I went to Mrs. Simpson, and told her - I did not hear a single word beside what I have stated; she was speaking to two respectable women- one was oldish, and one youngish; I had never seen Mrs. Webster till I went to Queen-square, where I met with Mrs. Simpson - I am a shoe-binder; there are some men lodge in the house up stairs - I lodge in the front room, and have done so for nine weeks.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Do you recollect an inquiry being made about him? A. Yes, on that Sunday one of our men came in and said, "Here is a man wants Simpson;" Simpson went to the door, and said, "Ah, Jack, how do you do?" the prosecutor said, "Get your hat and go along with me;" he said, "No, I am having my dinner" - he then seized him, and said, "You are my prisoner;" he was quite drunk when he came - he went and brought the officer in a quarter of an hour; the officer said, "Open the door;" I said, "I shall not;" he opened the window, and said,"How foolish you are" - I said, "I will not open the door to day;" he said, "You must."</p>

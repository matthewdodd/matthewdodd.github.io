On Monday morning, the 11th of January, I heard a knock at the door. I got out of bed; I shoved up my window. A person that lived in the market told me that my shop door was open. I opened my room door; the first thing that I saw was a square of glass taken out of a casement at the back of my house. I went down stairs with a light in my hand, and found my street door open, and my back door also. I looked for the key of my shop; that was gone from the place where I generally left it. The shop is not at my house; it is in Fleet-market. I went to my shop. I saw this bundle of halfpence in this apron, which apron I believe belonged to the prisoner. It is not mine. It had a tablecloth covered over it. I went into the little room behind my shop, and found these tools, which tools belongs to the prisoner. They say he is a cabinet-maker. My cupboard that we left the halfpence in; that was broken open, and a drawer likewise that had halfpence in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that the prisoner broke open your house - A. I suspected that the prisoner had done it, by finding him in the shop, and I found the key of my shop at the shop, which I had left in my house. I found the key taken out of my house and carried to the shop.</p>

            . I am a ticket-porter at Fleet-market. I perceived the shop door open. I saw Mr. Hornden going across the market. I told him, I saw the shop door open. He told me, he would inform Mr. Beadle. He went into the shop. He said he thought it was very odd that a weight was put against the door. He went to Mr. Beadle. I never left the shop until Mr. Beadle came. Mr. Beadle and I went into the shop. There were these chissels and halfpence, and a cloth over them. We could not find the prisoner for a quarter of an hour; after all the prisoner was found in the saw-dust bin, and the key of the shop was inside of the shop, laying on the block.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The chissels were not in my shop on Sunday evening. I cannot swear to the halfpence.</p>

Mr. Beadle's door was open. I went in to see if any body was there. I was afraid to come out again for fear the watchman should take me, and when they said the door was open, I hid myself for fear they should find me in the place.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. How did they get into your house - A. By taking a square of glass out, and burning the handle of the casement.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

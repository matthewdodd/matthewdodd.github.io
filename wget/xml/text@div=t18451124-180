                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Whittenbury—we live at Manor-house, Lewisham. On Saturday, the 18th of Oct., the prisoner came for a furnished apartment, about eleven o'clock—she came with a piece of paper, with the name of a friend of mine on it—I let her a bed-room, at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—she referred me to Mr. Moss, a solicitor, who was in the habit of visiting her at times, and Mr. Vickers, a distiller—she told me a great deal about her property—she said Mr. Lowe was a friend of hers, and he sent her to me; that she met him promiscuously on the Heath, and he went into the Green Man, wrote my direction, and recommended her to me—she said Mr. Lowe was gone to London to pay the insurance; and would I allow her to stay till he called—I kept her till seven o'clock at night—he did not call, and I said I did not think he would come—she said she was to send for her piano to Mr. Vickers' on Monday—she said she had come by an omnibus, and had lost her money; how was she to get home unless I lent her money?—I lent her half a crown—she then said she should be very cold, having broken her ribs; and I lent her a black satin shawl, and a handkerchief—I was to fetch her at ten o'clock on the Monday morning to my lodging—my daughter, who is seventeen years old, took her from my house at seven o'clock at night, to get a coach—she ran away from her, and was taken the next morning—I did not see her again till she was in custody.</p>

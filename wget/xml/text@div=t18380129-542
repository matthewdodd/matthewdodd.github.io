On the 19th of January was on duty in High-street, Bromley—I did not see anybody run out of the prosecutor's shop—I saw the prisoner running about thirty yards from the shop—I pursued him, and he was stopped in my presence—he had the till with the money in it—I took him back to the shop, and he said he did it, being in want of bread-somebody said, "If so, he would have takes bread, as there was plenty about the shop"—he then said he did it for: want of a pair of shoes—there were twelve pennypieces and forty-one half-pence in the till.</p>

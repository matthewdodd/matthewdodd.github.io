On the 29th of May I was at work in the Lower-road, at an unfinished house; on my return from breakfast I saw the prisoner coming from the house, with another man, but did not know he had the tools; in about five minutes my shopmate came to work, and missed some tools, and my saw was in his basket - I followed them for about half a mile, and saw them with the tools; the prisoner had my plane under his coat; I stopped him, and called for assistance, but no one came - his companion then threw down all he had, and the prisoner pulled this trying plane out of his pocket; they both got a little way, but the prisoner was caught, and taken to the watch-house; he said he was in distress, and if I would let him go he would make me a recompense.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. Q. Do you work with your own tools? A. Yes, generally. I found the house had been opened the back way; I never said all the property was found on this man.</p>

William Gay kept his tools in my basket - I had left them all secure on Saturday night, and went at six o'clock on Monday morning to work; I put them into the next house, which was locked, while I went to breakfast, and when I came back the whole of them were gone; I saw a ladder at the back of the house. I found the basket behind the door, and these tools were taken out of it; Gay returned a few minutes before me.</p>

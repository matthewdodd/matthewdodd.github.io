                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, C</hi> 137). On 16th July last, about 12 o'clock, from information I received, I went to the house of Mr. Palmer, 6A, West-street, Soho—I went down into the back-yard to the dust-hole, and there found this ingot of tin nearly covered with dust—I could just discern one end of it—I concealed myself in a cellar something similar to a wine or coal-cellar—I remained there till about 1 or half-past, when the prisoner Still and another man not in custody came down to the dust-hole with a basket and shovel—the other man reached over into the dust-hole, and took</p>

               <p>out the ingot of tin, and put it into the basket—Still was close to him at that time—he could see the ingot put in—he had the shovel in his hand, and he filled the basket with dust, and helped it on to the other man's back—he took it up stairs, came down again, took up one more basket full of dust, and then both left—they went into Litchfield-street, close by, and took away some more dust—I followed them round into another street, where the other man, not in custody, and Still, both got up into the cart, wrapped the ingot up in some old dirty pieces of rag that they had picked out of the dust, and put it into a sack or bag—they then finished their load there, and went away both together—I and Ewell, a foreman of the firm, followed them to the corner of Upper Ground-street, Blackfriar's-road—I was in plain clothes—the cart stopped there, and Still took the sack from the cart, and went to 35, Upper Ground-street, the prisoner Barker's shop—he went into the shop, and went through into the back-parlour—I remained there a minute or so—another man, neither of the prisoners, came out of the shop—I stopped him, and asked what he had—we both went back into the shop together—the two prisoners were there in the back-parlour together—I asked Still what he had done with the piece of tin which he had just brought in—he said he knew nothing of it whatever; he did not know what I meant—I then asked Barker if he was the man belonging to the shop—he said "Yes"—I asked him for the piece of tin that the other man had just brought in—he said he knew nothing of it; he had not seen any<lb></lb>thing—(I had told him I was a constable)—I said I was quite sure he had brought it there, for I had hardly lost sight of him since he took it from the house where it came from—Barker replied that he knew nothing of it whatever—I said I should search the house for it, for I was quite sure it was there—I went through into the back-parlour, where both prisoners had just come from, and in amongst a lot of rags, piled up in separate lots, just between the partition of one pile from the other, this piece of tin was put, a few inches under the rags—it was not in the sack in which I had seen it—Still had the sack in his hand when he came out of the parlour.</p>

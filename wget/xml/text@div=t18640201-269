                  </hi>. I am an iron plate worker at 16, Gibraltar-walk, Bethnal-green—on the evening of Christmas-day, I went into my front room, on the first-floor, about 10 o'clock—the window of that room is about ten feet from the ground—I noticed that it was fastened in the usual way, and the looking-glass stood upon the drawers—about 11 o'clock that night, I heard my little girl scream, outside, and then heard something fall on the cellar-flap outside—I went to the door, and saw the witness Pinnett standing in the middle of the road, opposite the house, and saw the window open—I afterwards went up to the first-floor front, and found the looking-glass moved off the drawers on to the bed, and the top drawer open—I did not miss anything—the drawers could be reached from the window without getting into the room—I know the prisoner—he has worked for two or three days together for me; when I have been busy—he knew my premises—he had never been in this room.</p>

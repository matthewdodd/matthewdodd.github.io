                  </hi>. I live at Greenwich. I knew William John Luck—he was a labourer in the employ of Mr. Graves—I was in a boat with him, and three more; they were all drowned but me—Luck and Mills were rowing—the boat would carry us well—we were about Limehouse, coming up towards London—I saw two steamboats coming down the river—the <hi rend="italic">Prussian Eagle</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Cambridge</hi>—the tide was with us—the <hi rend="italic">Prussian Eagle</hi> passed us first: we got into the swell of it, and the boat</p>

               <p>became unmanageable—I do not know that anybody on the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Cam<lb></lb>bridge</hi> called out—I did not hear it—I was rather frightened—while the swell was going on, the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Cambridge</hi> came upon us—the bows caught our boat—I caught hold of the paddle-wheel—it was going round with me—it stopped while I was in it, and I was taken out—I am twelve years old.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman, of Horsleydown. On 17th Oct., about a quarter before ten o'clock in the morning, I was at the lower part of the Pool near the City Canal Tier, and saw the <hi rend="italic">Prussian Eagle</hi> com<lb></lb>ing—she is an Irish boat—about ten minutes afterwards, the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Cam<lb></lb>bridge</hi> came up—they were both going up with the tide, and were about three times the length of a steamer apart—the little boat was lower down the river—the <hi rend="italic">Prussian Eagle</hi> bad passed, and <hi rend="italic">kicked up</hi> a surf, and the boat became unmanageable—there were no freemen in her, and the men were frightened—if there had been a good look out on the steamer, and they had stopped her in time, she would not have gone over the boat—if she had been backed, it would have prevented the accident—she eased directly she touched the boat, but not before—a man forewards on the steam-boat looked out, and sung out " <hi rend="italic">hoy, hoy!"</hi>—I was in my barge—the boat was in its proper position with regard to the navigation of the river.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far was the boat from the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Cambridge</hi> when you first saw her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About four boats' lengths off—the people in the boat were not trying to row between the two vessels—they did not know on which side to go—they were frightened, and seemed to have lost their heads—they might have gone inside, and out of the surf if they had understood it, but they went into danger—it was their own fault, and want of understanding that led to the accident—I should have got out of the way without any trouble.</p>

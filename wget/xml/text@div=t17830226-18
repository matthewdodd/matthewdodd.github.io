               <p>What night was it? - The 30th of January.</p>
               <p>What time? - A little after seven at night, I went into the yard to turn the water into the tub, I had lost a live fowl out of the yard that afternoon, I took a candle and lanthorn to seek for it; and I went into the next yard to look for the fowl; but I could not find it, and in looking about, I went to the water tub in that yard, and the pipe and cock were cut off in that yard; I had been in my own yard four or five minutes before, and the pipe and cock were safe, and my wife desired me to look again; and I went into the yard again, and I shoved the yard door open, and I saw the prisoner standing in the yard, with a spade in his hand, and my pipe was pulled from the wall down upon the ground and cut off; the piece of pipe that was cut off was laid upon the ground, hard by where the prisoner stood; then I ran up to the prisoner and collared him; I asked him, if he came to cut off all the pipes, he said did you see me cut it off, I said no, but I am sure you have, for it was in the yard against the wall, five months ago; I looked about the yard, and there I found some pieces cut off from my pipe; the other part was sticking down, and was about a yard from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the ground dug? - No, he had pulled the pipe from the wall, and cut it to the ground; I took the prisoner before the justice, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the value of this lead? Ten-pence the justice put it at.</p>

               <p>On the 30th of January, I was going to Kentish Town, and my master told me to enquire for one Mr. Mason, and coming into Tottenham Court Road, I saw Mr. Taylor's door open, and a light, and I knocked at the door, and called up stairs, and a man came out of the yard, and went through the entry; I went into the yard to see if there was any body to give me an answer: My master is bad in bed with the ague and fever.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you see any other person besides the prisoner? - No, my Lord.</p>

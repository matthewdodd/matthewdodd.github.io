            . I live at Bishop Stortfort, in Buckinghamshire. I came to London to bring some lace on Easter Monday; I came by the Aylesbury Coach to the Bull in Holborn; a man followed me, like a countryman, and said how do you do, you are a countryman as well as I am; said he I came from Thame, and brought some sheep to sell; he said he had a sister lived at a great gentleman's house, and wanted a piece of lace; and if I would go with him he would help me to a customer; that it was a great house, and they would buy a good deal perhaps.</p>
               <p>Q. You was wiser I dare say than to go with him?</p>
               <p>Friday. Yes; I went along with him; he went into a house, first some where in Oxford-road; he called for a pot of beer; then he went out with pretence to fetch his sister, and returned and said she would be there in half an hour; we sat down; he talked about ploughing and sowing, and in a little time came in two more men; they are the men at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say or do?</p>
               <p>Friday. They said nothing to us for some time; at last one of them, and the other man began talking; he said he belonged to a ship and he would buy some lace of me but he must go to such a place.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he know you had any lace to sell.</p>
               <p>Friday. The man told him, and I had my box with me; but I must go with him to the Noah's Ark, for his wife was to meet him there. I went with him to <placeName id="t17730421-26-crimeloc150">the Noah's Ark in Oxford-road</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was there a back door to the house?</p>
               <p>Friday. Yes; I went out at the sore door; my box was found upon Dennison. (The box of lace produced by

            ).</p>
               <p>Friday. Here is my mark upon every piece; I have reckoned it up; there is about 35 s. worth wanting.</p>
               <p>Q. from Burn. Whether you did not lay some money with the other man?</p>
               <p>Friday. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the other man give you money he won of Dennison?</p>
               <p>Friday. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you loose any money?</p>
               <p>Friday. One of them asked for some change; I pulled my silver out, and he stole some of it; but that was neither of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did he take?</p>
               <p>Friday. To the best of my belief 5 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you get it again?</p>
               <p>Friday. I was in a fright.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you did not gamble?</p>
               <p>Friday. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. from Burn. Whether you did not lay your box against thirty guineas, or against any sum?</p>
               <p>Friday. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you told any body when you came back, that you had been robbed?</p>
               <p>Friday. When I went into the house a man stood with his hat off; he said what do you want; I said the gentlemen that were here; he said, O, they are gone; so I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not enquire after it?</p>
               <p>Friday. The man was so snappish with me, and I thought it was of no use as they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the only reason you did not ask for your box?</p>
               <p>Friday. Yes.</p>

            . I am a constable of the Ward of Farringdon-within; I produced this box and parcel. On Easter Monday between two and three o'clock in the day, as I was going along Thames-street, I passed a gang of notorions thieves, which I knew to be such, having detected<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177304210029"></xptr> them before; I took no notice of them till one came up to Dennison, and said, d - n my eyes and limbs let me carry the box; he d - n him again, and said he should not carry it; hearing this language repeated I thought it proper to detect them. I ran to the Rose and Crown at Queenhithe, and tapped at the window, and a brother constable came out; I shewed him the people; he was of my opinion, and we pursued them; they took up Garlick-hill; we followed them; I believe they perceived they were pursued; they all seven went into the Card-maker's Arms at Garlick-hill; I went in and put my hand upon this box, which was in a bag, and said to Dennison, my friend, what have you got here? I am of opinion you have got a box of lace which you have not come honestly by, who does it belong to? he answered I don't know; why said I, don't you know how it came here? he sa id, no; I said, is there none of you gentlemen know any thing about this box? they said no, all of them; the seventh man he ran away; I know him to be a sharper; he brought in Simms another man: there was but one person when we went into the house besides ourselves, and we charged him to assist in the king's name; he was very fearful; some gentlemen came in that had been at the vestry and assisted us, I brought a coach from Cheapside, and took Burn and another man (not him at the bar) and carried them in the coach to the Poultry Compter; when I got out of the coach; I desired the man that is not here to follow me, and told the young man to keep a strict eye upon Burn; the moment that I turned out of the coach, the young man, that was in the coach with me, called out, he has thrown something out of the coach window; I bid him run round and pick it up; he went round and picked up this small parcel of lace (producing it.)</p>
               <p>Friday. Here is my mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Duncastle. This parcel was sealed up when it was brought to me; they were carried to different goals that night, and before my Lord Mayor afterwards.</p>
               <p>Burn. That piece dropped out, I did not throw it out; it dropped out of my great coat pocket; it belonged to this man at the bar; he played thirty guineas against it.</p>
               <p>Duncastle. We insisted at the public house we would search them, therefore I suppose it was upon that account he threw it out.</p>

            . I am a constable of the ward of Faringdon-within; I went in pursuit of the prisoners; the little man had a box under his arm going up the hill; they turned about seeing us, and knowing us I suppose, went into this public house; Dennison pushed the lace from him upon the table, and seemed as if it did not belong to him; all the six denied that the box belonged to any of them. While my brother constable was gone to the Compter with one of them, Burn wanted to go to the, but the gentlemen would not let him; they said he should have a close stool, so he had a large chamber pot which was in the room; he had not been long come back before he put his hand into his right pocket, and had this piece of lace in his hand ready to give to one of his comrades; I said what are you about, sit further, you are going to shift what you have got; I immediately took it from him. (The piece of lace produced and deposed to by the prosecutor); I took from one of them this bag; (producing a purse that cannot be easily opened with counters in it.)</p>

               <p>Q. Whether we did not all go out at the front door?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I cannot tell; but two of them that were like farmers went out first; a young man in the tap room went out after them, and two men were left in the parlour when I came back; I did not see any go out at the back door.</p>
               <p>Squire. We have advertised this lace a good while, and last Sunday the owner came; we went to this gentleman's house, and enquired whether such people were there on Easter Monday; he said several people were there that he did not like, and bid his wife look sharp after them; I said to him do you know which way they went; he said he stepped out of the door<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177304210030"></xptr> and saw two on the other side of the way and three on this side, subscribing these two men as near as could be, the one with the bag on his shoulder, the other walking by him.</p>

               <p>Lewis. The two countrymen went out first; they that went towards Cavendish-street had the box; they were the people that went out last.</p>

               <p>Q. Of what?</p>
               <p>Nicholson. Old clothes. I saw this gentleman take two pieces of lace, black and white, out of the box, and call a party if he had got all of it; they said no, not a quarter of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you heard this pretty conversation?</p>

               <p>Nicholson. I knew a good woman that was taken up as a vagrant; I went in behalf of her, and I saw this man take two pieces of lace out, a black and white piece; the black this width, that might go round a cardinal, and pieces of paper wrapped round the middle of it.

               <p>Q. But I ask you?</p>
               <p>Nicholson. I am certain and sure it is not so.</p>
               <p>Q. So you happened luckily to be at my Lord Mayor's about some poor woman taken up as a vagrant, and your friend Burn happened to be there?</p>
               <p>Nicholson. I did no see him till he came out.</p>
               <p>One of the witnesses. She has brought him victuals frequently to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Nicholson. I did not.</p>

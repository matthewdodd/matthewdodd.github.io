                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Tozer. On Tuesday night, the 5th of December, I was in the parlour at the back of my shop, at Fulham—I noticed somebody leaving the shop—I called to my servant, who ran after him—the street was perfectly clear—I could not see any person—I missed 8 3/4 lb. weight of bacon, which the constable afterwards produced to me—I had seen it safe about a quarter of an hour before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman at the Ship, Fulham. On the 5th of Dec., as I was delivering my nine o'clock beer, I saw the prisoner going towards Mrs. Tozer's shop, and about 150 yards from it.</p>
               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">TURNER</hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) I heard of the lost of this bacon—at four o'clock next morning I went to the King's Arms-yard, and Fitzgerald, a constable, who was with me, took this piece, of bacon out of the window of a door of an omnibus, in my presence—I put it back, and kept watch, and about half-past six the prisoner came into the yard, removed the bacon, and placed it under this cape—I took him into custody with it on the steps of the omni<lb></lb>bus—he was not concerned with that omnibus—it is a separate yard to where he is employed—he said he saw it put there the over night—he then heard of the robbery, and went to see if it was the bacon, and if it was, he said he was d—d if he should not have it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was going to get a chop for supper, and heard some one halloo out, "Some one has taken a piece of bacon out of Mr. Tozer's snop," and next morning some one said, "Did you look into the busses?"—I said no, I would look—I looked and saw it between the cushions, and said, "Here is the bit of bacon that was lost, I shall take it to Mr. Tozer's shop"—I always go through that yard to work. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He said nothing of the sort—the yard he works in is some hundreds of yards off—the omnibus the bacon was found in belongs to a coach-builder—it is lent to different parties—I am not aware it was in his master's use—he is horse-keeper to Mr. Webb—I, was inside another omnibus in the yard, watching—I did not see him go to the omnibus, but I popped out, and found him on the steps concealing the bacon under this cape.</p>

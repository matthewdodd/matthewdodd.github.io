                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alexander Davidson. In March, 1848, I lived at 3, Harding-street, Woolwich; it is now pulled down—the prisoner was a lodger of mine—on 18th, March she assisted me in cleaning the yard—I went into my room, and she said, "Oh! look at your chest of drawers and your boxes"—I said, "Oh! lam robbed!" and ran to the door to see if I could see any one—she said, "Sea if your watches are gone"—I looked and missed them, and a jacket, three pairs of trowsers, eleven waist<lb></lb>coats and shirts—I found a shirt in the passage, and two silver watches, one of which had hung over the mantel-piece, the other over the drawers, about three-quarters of an hour before—I also missed a satin dress, and a crape and cashmere shawl.</p>

            . On the 12th of September, about 11 o'clock at night, I went into the Rising Sun public house at <placeName id="t18220911-246-crimeloc1307">Chelsea</placeName>

While there, I had occasion to take out my purse, and I then saw that I had 15 s. in it: I put it in my pocket and came out, it was very dark; the prisoner came up and said it was very dark, I said, yes. I had not noticed him in the public house. He asked me where I was going? and I said to town, and could go without his assistance. It was too dark for me to distinguish him: he walked close at my elbows until I got to quite a dark place; and there he jolted against me, and said,</p>
               <p>"Dont fall down here, for it is very dark." His hand was in my pocket at that time; he took my money out, and was feeling to see if I had a watch. I hollowed out,</p>
               <p>"I am robbed." Renton called out</p>
               <p>"Hold him." I held him, and never let him go; he scrambled about, and fell down twice, and threw my money about, but I kept holding him. A watchman came up and went with us to the watch-house. It was the prisoner, I am sure of him; I never let go of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What time did you leave home in the morning? - A. About eleven in the morning, I went to the late Alderman Rothwell's and Mr. Bowden's, there where I had lived; I dined with Mr. Bowden's servants, and we had a pot or two of beer together at a public house. I had 20 s. when I set out. I found 1 s. in my pocket next morning. I spent 4 s. with one friend or another. I called at the Windmill, the Falcon, the Castle, and then at the Rising Sun, and drank at all of them. I was sober, and knew well what I was about. I did not ask the prisoner to go with me, I told him to go about his business, but he followed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you toss for beer with him at the public house? - A. I dont recollect tossing with any one, it might have happened; I did not see him in the house. He appeared sober to me. Two half-crowns were found on him in my presence. I had two in my bag, and a crown piece. I heard money drop from him as he was scrambling; I did not stoop to look for it, for I should have lost him.</p>

            . I was going up Paradise Row, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor together: I followed them, and by a very dark place the prosecutor said he was robbed; I said,</p>
               <p>"Then hold him fast," which he did. I got the watchman. The prisoner said to another man,</p>
               <p>"If you will get me away from him, I will give you part of the money and something to drink." The watchman came up and took him to the constable's house. He showed me where the key and purse were, he had thrown them in a garden next door but one to the constable's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What business do you follow? - A. I am a shoemaker. The prosecutor might not hear what he said to the other man in the scuffle. I saw two half-crowns and fourpence halfpenny found on him. We did not look for the rest of the money. Jemmett was rather in liquor, but sensible. I think the prisoner was rather less in liquor than him.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was brought to me; I refused to take the charge, as they were both very drunk: I also took him to the watch-house, found two half-crowns on him; the prosecutor said he dare say I should find the key and purse on the spot, for it must be about; he did not say it was over in a garden.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were not they both quite as drunk as they could be? - A. The prosecutor was very drunk, and the prisoner was in liquor certainly. The prosecutor reeled about as I took the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor threatened me about, his purse, and whether I had it or not I cannot say. He swore he would knock my brains out if I did not go with him, and almost dragged me out of the public house, when the landlord refused to draw us any liquor; he fell in the road, and if I had not called to a coach to stop, he would have been run over. I lifted him up, and sat him against the wall, he said he would give any body what they required to see him to Tyburn, and what happened afterwards I dont know; he had brought a man and woman into the public house, and they all drank together. He tossed with me for beer and lost, and made a disturbance in the house.</p>

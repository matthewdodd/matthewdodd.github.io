            . I keep the Round-house in St. Giles's. On Sunday night last was seven weeks, the prisoner and prosecutor were both brought in to me, and they both charged each other Burk charged M'Ardel with stealing about three guineas ; after some time the prisoner said, if Burk would make it up, he'd send me where I should have the money: he sent me to one Mrs. Clark, in Hanover-square, which is a lodging-house, to ask her for the money. I was to tell her it was the money of her acquaintance's; I went and did my message; she bid me go out and call for a pint of beer, and she'd come to me, saying, if she had any money, she'd carry it with me, but she run away without me. When I came back she was coming away, and talked in Irish to him not to own the money upon any account; my wife was by, and heard it, and told me what she said. I then took her up, and she said when the prisoner changed a thirty-six shilling piece, he owed her some money, so she gave him forty-one shillings; he said he'd give the prosecutor that, and go to harvest work for the rest. The constable has the money, but he is not here.</p>

               <p>I had been at work at harvest, and came to town, but could not get a lodging. Burk said, if I'd go along with him, we might lie three in a bed. I was forc'd to lie on the floor, and I by mistake took his hat instead of my own. I earn'd this money in hay harvest, and he said if I would not give it him, he'd hang me.</p>

About the 23d or 24th of June last, I knew the prosecutor to be in a very desolate way; he had not money then to buy himself a pint of beer, for there were seven or eight of us gave him a shilling a piece to raise him a little money to set him up.</p>

             and Arthur M'Daniel deposed they were with the prisoner and prosecutor the night before the robbery, drinking at an alehouse in the Fleet-market; that there Burk said he had been and laid out all his money in Rag-fair, upon which account the prisoner paid three half-pence extraordinary, and in pulling out his money to pay, they saw about 50 s. That the prosecutor, instead of bringing the prisoner to his own lodging on Snow-hill, carried him to a house in Drury-lane.</p>

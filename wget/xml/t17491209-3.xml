               <p>Q. Give us an account, how you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Piercer. I was going in the middle of the Field in the foot path, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was stopped by three men, one of them, had a cutlass, or a sword.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in your habit?</p>
               <p>Piercer. I was not: the first thing they proceeded to, was to take my silver buckles out of my shoes, after that, there were two hands in my two pockets, they took out two handkerchiefs, one an india silk, the other a linnen one, and about ten or fourteen shillings, I cannot be exact; I had paid and received money that day several times; they took from me several pieces of old coin, silver and copper; two Roman coins, an Edward's sixpence, an Elizabeth, a Jacobus, a pair of wash-leather gloves. I heard them before they came quite to me, and I saved my gold watch, and three guineas and a half in gold, by putting them down in the bottom of my breeches.

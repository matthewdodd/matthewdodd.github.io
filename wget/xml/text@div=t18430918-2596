                  </hi>. I am a pressmaker, and live in William-street, Shoreditch—the prisoner was in my employ as a smith, about fourteen months, and left in May, 1842. On the 8th of Aug. Mr. Ives came to me, and in con<lb></lb>sequence</p>

               <p>of information he gave me, I went to his premises next day in the Curtain-road, and he showed me two cast-iron cog-wheels, which I believe, on my oath, to be my property—I went with Ives to the prisoner, and asked if he had sold Ives any cog-wheels—he said he had not, nor did he know anything of them—I gave him in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose all you can swear is, you had wheels of a similar kind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is a mark corresponding with my wheels, fortunately for the ends of justice, a flaw in the pattern, by which they are easily recognized—I have missed such wheels—I do not know how many—I cannot say when I missed them—I know my stock was smaller than it should be—the mark was occa<lb></lb>sioned by a crack in the pattern, the grain running crossways—I did not no<lb></lb>tice the flaw in them till Ives produced them—I then examined my stock, and found other wheels had the same mark—I have not sold any like these—I do not know how many I had, nor how many I have now—nobody but myself is allowed to sell them—Ives never worked on my premises, to my knowledge—I believe a person named Wilson, who worked for me, has set up in the same business.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the Curtain-road, and am a wheelwright—I have known the prisoner two or three years—h eworked for me occasionally—about thirteen months ago he was working at my drilling machine, and said he would bring me a pair of wheels which would work the machine easier—I said if he brought them I would purchase them—he brought them, and I paid him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, but did not use them—they laid about among my stock—within two months of his being apprehended, he came and saw them about—he threw them under the bench, threw something over them, and told me if Cannel (his uncle) saw them, he would know where they came from—in consequence of this, I went to Cannel, and from what he said, I went to the prosecutor's, about the 8th of Aug., and had some conversation with him about the wheels—he came to my shop next day, and claimed them—he said, if they were his they had forty teeth each, which these have—I after<lb></lb>wards heard him ask the prisoner if he had sold me a pair of wheels?—he said not, and he knew nothing of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you first mention about his putting them aside? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When I was asked about it—it was after I had been at the office and made it known to the police—Mr. Flanders and his attorney spoke to me about it this morning—I do not owe the prisoner anything—I have his bills and receipts to prove it—he has made an unjust claim for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and brought an action against me—after I had been to Cannel I was served with a writ, on a Saturday, and on the Tuesday following I went to Mr. Flanders—it is not twelve months ago that he first claimed the 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not think it is eight months—I will not swear it is not six—I told him I owed him no mo<lb></lb>ney, and could show him his receipt—he demanded it frequently—he served me with the writ on Saturday—I had been to Cannel before that, one day that week—I know the prosecutor, by seeing him io the neighbourhood—I never worked for him—I have been on his premises when I went to the prisoner—I do not suppose I have been there three times—I did not take a wheel into John Higgins's shop about a twelvemonth ago, and say I had bought it of a Jew—I might possibly have a conversation with him about a wheel—he might see one in my shop—I did not point one out to him—a per<lb></lb>son named Roberts was before the Magistrate—the prisoner was here last Session, to be tried—it was postponed on account of my illness—I cannot tell what was the matter with me—I am not a medical man, but I went to one—he</p>

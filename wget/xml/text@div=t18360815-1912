                  </hi>. It was the prisoner's duty to give out silk to be made by his wife into stocks—they were to be cut out before it left my place—he had not authority to send out pieces of silk uncut—I asked him if he had got any property, or any stocks, or any silk (I believe it was Roe the officer asked him) he said he had not got a dozen of stocks or a yard of silk in his house—after that, we proceeded to search his house—we found twenty-two yards of silk and a quantity of stocks, partly manu<lb></lb>factured—we had such silk in our warehouse, for the purpose of manufacturing stocks, the same colour and quality—there is no mark of mine on it that will enable me to swear to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I used to take the stocks, and sometimes pieces of silk with them, from Mr. Blenkiron's house to the prisoner's—not whole pieces—I do know that I ever took a piece as large as that—the prisoner said it was to cut the stocks off—he used to measure it with his hands—I never took a roll of silk—I do not think I ever took a piece so large as that, or any thing like so large—Bishop used to measure it on the counter—he used not to spread it out.</p>

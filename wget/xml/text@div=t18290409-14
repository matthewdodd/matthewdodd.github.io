On the 4th of April, a little after twelve o'clock, I left my shop to go to dinner - these boards were then lying on the pavement, under the shop-window; I worked with the prisoner about twenty years ago, and he often called at my shop to inquire for work - he had been asking for work that very week; I did not see him take the deals, but he was brought back with them by Field; he told me he was sorry for it, and that distress made him do it.</p>

I know Notley: I saw the four boards on the prisoner's back, about three hundred yards from the shop, on Addle-hill; I turned round, and knew them to be Notley's - I immediately went out, followed, and stopped him, and said, "Where are you going with these?" he said Notley had sent him for them: I said, "No, you have stolen them;" I took him back, and Notley claimed them; I knew them, having sawed them - I knew them by the nature of the wood; I had only sawed themhalf an hour before.</p>

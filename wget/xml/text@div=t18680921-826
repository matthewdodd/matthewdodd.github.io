I live at 6, Glen's Buildings, Homerton—on Wednes<lb></lb>day, 9th September, I was at work in Mr. Stephens' rick-yard, at Homerton—that is about a mile from the prosecutor's house—in the afternoon I was cleaning, near a straw stack, and saw this property (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) covered by a truss of straw—a policeman and myself watched from about 6 o'clock till 7.45—we saw the prisoner come up a field directly to the place where the property was—he pulled the straw on one side—he then stood and looked all round—he saw the policeman behind the stack, and then stepped away from the stack-yard briskly—the policeman went round the other side and apprehended him—the policeman asked him what his business was, and after a while, he said, "He had come for a rope, to get a horse out of the ditch"—the policeman said, "You do not look for ropes in straw stacks," and he made no answer—it was not very dark; we could see two hundred yards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. Did I not come straight from where a horse was in a ditch? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

From information I received I went to Mr. Stephens' rick vard on the 9th, about 6 o'clock—I concealed myself behind a haystack—about 7.45 I saw the prisoner come up the field to the stack yard—he moved some straw on one side—he then stood for a minute and looked round—he caught sight of me, and began to move away—I went round the other side of the stack and apprehended him—after I had him about a minute and a half, he said, "I want a rope, there is a horse in the ditch"—I said, "It is u funny place to look for a rope, in that straw stack"—I took him to the stack and took out the property—it was exposed by his pulling the straw on one side—this is a portion of it, and some more was found on the following Friday.</p>

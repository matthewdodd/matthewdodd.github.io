            . I am servant to Mr. Phipps, woollen draper on Ludgate Hill. On the 16th of August, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I was backwards in the kitchen, (we can see from thence to the shop) and I saw the end of a man's coat going out at the shop door. I pursued as fast as possible; he crossed the way opposite the Old Bailey; he made off as fast as ever he could walk, and when he got about two hundred yards, I stopped him. He had this piece of superfine crimson cloth under his arm, with a bag thrown over the end of it. I charged him with stealing it: he pointed to the other side the way, and said, That man gave it him. There were a great many people where he pointed. I brought him back to my master. ( Produced in court and deposed to.) All he said, when I brought him back, was, that another man gave it him. There was no opportunity to shift it. I saw him immediately, and I took him in about a quarter of a minute after he was out of the shop.</p>

            . The prisoner told me many places he had robbed; among the rest, was a mercer, at the Black-a-moor's Head, on Ludgate Hill. This was two or three days after he was taken. He mentioned another robbery he had committed, at the Green Dragon in Bishopsgate Street.

                  </hi>. I am the son of John Toomey, a shoemaker, and live with him at 8, Old Castle-street, Whitechapel—I know the prisoner well—on 1st August, about 8 o'clock, I was sitting with my father at work, when the prisoner came in, from his own house—he lives very nearly opposite; we are neighbours—he came in, stood in a fighting position, and said, "You old b—, I have known you many yean, and you old b—, I will murder you"—upon that he struck my father with his fist under the chin, and my father fell backwards off his seat—the prisoner then snatched up a shoe-maker's knife from my seat, and stabbed my father in the left side, without saying anything—he made a second attempt to strike him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is part of the knife—I seized him round the throat, and prevented him striking him again—after I had thrown him on the floor my father got up, and I saw him walk out of doors directly—as I was struggling on the floor with the prisoner, he cut me four times on the hand—he did not attempt to do anything after my lather went out—he hallooed and cried out while I was struggling with him on the floor—I forget what he cried out—I found myself getting weak, called for assistance, and Higgins came and held him down—I tried to get the knife from him, but could not; I caught hold of it with my thumb, and had to break the knife into my hand as it is now—I did not get the handle; the prisoner took it away with him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186209220038"></xptr>
               <p>—I saw Higgins get him out into the street, and he lay outside hallooing, hooting, and hissing; he attracted a mob of people—I gave this piece of blade to the officer—blood was then on it—the prisoner was not taken in custody at the time; he went into his own house.</p>

I am a tailor and live at 55, Fashion-street—I was passing Mr. Toomey's door on this evening, and saw the prisoner lying on the floor of the shop—Mr. Tooraey's son was holding him down, and calling for help, and then I went into the shop, laid hold of the prisoner by the had and collar, and held him down as well as I could, while James Toomey held the hand that had the knife, and took the knife from him—I saw the blade of the knife—I took hold of his legs, and we brought him out into the street—I saw the father before I approached the door, with one hand to his left side, and the other to his head.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital—on the night of 1st August, the prisoner was brought there—I found him in a state of great collapse; he was suffering acute pain, and bleeding profusely from a deep penetrating wound on the upper and left side of the abdomen, just beneath the last two ribs—his wounds were dressed, and he was sent to bed—about 11 o'clock he vomited blood, and became so alarmingly ill that I communicated with the police, and a Magistrate came and took his deposition—this would have been a very likely knife to inflict such a wound—I do not see any blood on it now—he was in great danger for a week, but</p>

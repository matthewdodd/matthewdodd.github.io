            . I keep the Bull's Head, public-house, in Leadenhall-street. On the 25th of November the prisoner came in between twelve and one o'clock, and asked for half-a-pint of porter - she gave me a sixpence, which I said was a bad one; she gave me another, and I gave her 41/2d.; I saw she had a number of halfpence - I should think 1s. worth; I kept the had sixpence by me - I let her go, having seen her before. I am confident she is the person. She came again two days afterwards, and offered a bad sixpence to my wife, who tapped at the window and called me.</p>

            . On the 27th of November the prisoner came to me for half a pint of porter, for which she gave me sixpence, and I saw in her hand some halfpence; I went to my husband for change, knowing it to be bad - I had seen the prisoner on the Friday before; the first sixpence my husband rubbed on the bearth-stone, and it was quite coppery - the second seemed like it; we sent for the officer, and gave her in charge - she had 1s. 3d. in copper, about her.</p>

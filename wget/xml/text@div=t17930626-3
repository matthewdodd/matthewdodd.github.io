               <p>I am a constable of the parish of Hillingdon; this young man Cox asked me to take the prisoner at the bar into custody, immediately he gave me the shilling which had a mark on it. (Produced and deposed to.) I took the prisoner, I found him in the yard at the Red Lyon, there was nothing passed only the boy charged him with the theft, and he said he found the money in his stocking; I took him before a magistrate, and he committed him; the prisoner said it was his own money, I asked him how he came by it in his stocking? he said he frequently put his money there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - No, never see him before; he has been at Hillingdon about a month.</p>

             came up to me, I had got some work to do for this King to mend his shoes, he came up to me to tell me to take notice of a shilling with a star on the edge if he should pay for the shoes; with that when he came he did not give me that shilling, but another, and I saw that he had but one six-pence left in his purse; he went away from me down to the Red Lyon where he lodged, there he paid three shillings for his lodging.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have got the paper to shew that a gentleman gave me to collect money, to go to this doctor to cure my eyes.</p>

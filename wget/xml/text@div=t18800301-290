                  </hi>. I live at the Steam Packet public-house, Woolwich—in December, 1876, I gave the prisoner a silver watch to repair—he was working as assistant to Mr. Warner, watch maker in Woolwich, and used to do private jobs on his own account—he came to my house a month afterwards—he had then left Woolwich, and had gone to work at Greenwich—he said nothing about my watch—I asked him for it—he said that it was not done, and he would return it as soon as it was done—I saw him next on 20th or 21st February this year at 5, Eton Road, Woolwich—I was there, and asked him if he recognised me—he said "No"—I said "You very soon will, you are aware what I come to see you about"—he said "No"—I said "You remember my giving you a [watch about three years ago to repair"—he said "Oh, yes; I remember now, I sent it back about 18 months ago"—he afterwards said "Two years ago, by a man who was</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 84). On 25th February I went with Hawks to 5, Ella Road, Plumstead, and he charged the prisoner with stealing his watch—he said "I did not steal it; I repaired it, and sent it home by a man who was at work for me"—I said "Can you furnish me with the man's name and address?"—he said "I cannot, I believe he has gone to Coventry, and I have lost sight of him for some time"—I believe he mentioned the man's name, but I forget what it was—I took him to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I did receive this watch from Mr. Hawks. I re<lb></lb>paired it. It is nearly three years back. I sent it home by a man named Frank Bonner, who worked with me for six months, and then went to Coventry. I should never have gone to work in Woolwich again if I had known that the prosecutor had not received his watch. I offered to make him another. I sent a bill for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the man brought me the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

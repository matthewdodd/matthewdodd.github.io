               <p>MATTHEW CHAMPKEN. I live with Mr. David Soames Hewson, at <placeName id="t18300218-126-crimeloc695">Bromley, near Bow</placeName>

On the 18th of January, about nine o'clock in the evening, when I did my horse up, I saw this harness safe - I missed it next morning when I went to the stable - I could see no foot-marks about - I had double locked the stable, and found the lock broken off - I afterwards saw two pairs of traces, two bridles, one with a bit, and one without, a collar, martingale, and a pair of driving reins - I have not recovered above a quarter of what was taken.</p>
               <p>LEWIS BEACHEM. I am a saddler, and live at No. 56, Whitechapel-road. - On the 21st of January, about half-past four o'clock in the evening, the prisoner brought this harness for sale in a bag; I asked him several questions about who he lived with; he said a person named Alder - we asked where he got it - he said his master was like other people, poor - we had seen a bill describing the property, and sent for an officer - he afterwards said he had it from a person named Wells - that was before the officer came - he also said in the officer's presence that he received it from Wells - he said Wells trusted him to sell it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is yours a public-shop? A. Yes - there was a bill in my shop, offering a reward for the property, but not in my window - I had seen one posted near Whitechapel-church, offering twenty guineas reward, and describing the harness - I am positive he said he had it from another person, besides Wells; my brother was in the shop, and can corroborate what I say: he did not mention any name - he said his master was poor like other people, and he had brought it for sale, being the property of his master, and said his master's name was Alder; I was examined on his trial on Thursday; but was not asked whether he said he brought it from anybody but Wells - I did not mention about his saying he was sent by his master, who was poor, like other people; the Judge asked who he said he had it from - I told him Wells; you would not let me say any thing more; when I was going to mention it, you said I might go down.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you not asked several questions after that, both by me and the Judge? A. I do not recollect any.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180059"></xptr>and took charge of the prisoner, in Beachem's shop - he told me he had come from a person, named Wells, in Mile-end-road, and that Wells was waiting for him in Mutton-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he in your presence give an account how he obtained the harness? A. No - he said this when he came out of the shop - I believe he said the same in the shop - Beachem and his brother were there, within hearing; they made no observation in answer to him - I was not in the shop two minutes; I have searched for a person named Wells, but cannot find him - a man answering his description has absconded.</p>
               <p>HENRY PARNELL. I am stable-keeper at a public-house in Mile-end-road. On the the 21st of January, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the tap-room alone: he threw a bag into the first box, in the tap-room, and soon after Wells came in - I have seen Wells once or twice before; they spoke together, what about, I do not know - I could not form an opinion what was in the bag - it seemed as if there was a good sized bundle in it - I left them in the house, opposite the bar.</p>
               <p>MATTHEW CHAMPKEN. This is the harness, this is master's crest on it; the same as is on my button; and here is the roller which I cut off, before it was lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your master circulated a bill, offering a reward for the property? A. Yes - it was found three days after the robbery - the bills were about the neighbourhood the prisoner took it to - the crest could have been taken off in a minute, if he chose; the appearance has not been altered in the least - this is rather the worst part of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was given to me, by a man named Wells, who asked if I could sell it for him - I told him I would try - I went along Whitechapel, into Beachem's shop; I told him I had it from a man named Wells, who asked me to sell it for him - I never saw the harness till I turned it out of the bag in his shop - Beachem showed me a bill, which he had in his window, and said "This is the very harness I have been looking for" - he called the street-keeper, and gave me in charge.</p>

On the 4th of April, in the evening, I lost all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) out of the shew-glass in my shop. I had seen them at six o'clock that evening. When I went to take in the watches at nine o'clock, as I commonly do, they were missing. The coffee-pot was taken out of the parlour.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I had an information against the prisoner. I went and took her up. I searched her lodging. In a caravan box I found these two watches and a coffee-pot. She lodged in Devonshire-street, at one Mrs. Romer's. They have been in my possession ever since. I have two other watches, that were delivered to me at the Rotation-office; one of them she said she had lent to her husband.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Fitzgerald, a pawnbroker, in Holborn. I have a silver watch I had of the prisoner. She came and asked me if we bought such things. She said she wanted a plain gold ring. I bought it, and gave her a plain gold ring and 12 s. for it.</p>
               <p>What is the gold ring worth? - Six shillings.</p>
               <p>To Prosecutor. What is the watch worth? - A guinea and a half at the least.</p>
               <p>Bowles. It appeared, according to my judgement, to be a very old movement.</p>
               <p>(It was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Counsel to the Prosecutor. How did you find out all these things? - By Mrs. Hamilton's directions.</p>
               <p>Had you promised her any thing? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Had not you told her, if she shewed you where the property was, you would not hurt her? - No, never in my life. The magistrate said, as some things were found upon her, she might as well confess where the property was: it might be more favourable for her. Nothing was said by me. It was my wish to be as favourable as possible.</p>
               <p>You desired to be favourable, but have been as severe as you could: you have indicted her capitally. - I desired to indict her otherwise, but was told I could not. She told us of the things at the same time.</p>
               <p>Was any thing found prior to her confession? - Nothing but what was found in her lodging.</p>
               <p>To Dixwell. The watches you found, you found by her direction? - No.</p>
               <p>Had not you said something to her? - No, nothing at all: it was late at night.</p>
               <p>Did not you go to a public-house with her? - No, not that night: we went into a public-house in the morning. I told her she had better confess, and let the man have his property again.</p>
               <p>Had you found any thing before that? - Yes, the two watches and coffee-pot.</p>

               <p>Q. In what state were these silk handkerchiefs? - A. They were both joined together in the same state as we sell them; we found the two handkerchiefs wrapped up in a piece of paper in his box; I told him they were our's; he replied they were not; I said I could swear they were taken from the house; then he acknowledged they were mine; I sent for a constable, and took him before the Alderman.</p>
               <p>- HILLIER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Copley. Q. What are you? - A. I am a constable; I was sent for, and went to the prisoner's room, up three pair of stairs, and there I found the handkerchiefs in his box; I produce them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Copley. (To Mr. Butlin.) Q. These are the goods that were found in his box? - A. I can, without the smallest doubt, say that they were made by us.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You have sold some of them? - A. A few; they are a bad pattern.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you sell by retail? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you sell two handkerchiefs? - A. Yes, we do; we seldom sell less than three.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you never sold any to the prisoner? - A. Certainly, I never did myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Who sells besides yourself? - A. We have four or five besides myself, or half a dozen.</p>

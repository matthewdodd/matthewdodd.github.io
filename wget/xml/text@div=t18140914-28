            . I was in the shop when the prisoner came into my master's shop on the morning of the 14th of July. I had just come from breakfast. There are two or three others; they were not in the shop at the time. The prisoner came for a small quantity of len muslin, and while I was ringing the bell for assistance to come into the shop. she took the shawls. I did not see her take the shawls. There was no other shopman in the shop at the time. When I returned from ringing the bell, I missed the shawls from off the counter. I advised the prisoner with having them; she said she had not got them. I still said she must have taken them off the counter. The three shawls were taken off the counter; they were concealed by part of her apron being over them. They were taken entirely from the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the price of the shawls - A. Three pounds ten shillings.</p>

            . I am an officer. I produce the shawls; they were delivered to me by the last witness. They have been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These shawls are our property. The prisoner sent a letter to us, saying, she was sorry for what she had done, and stated a great deal of contrition.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the morning of the 14th of July, I went into the shop to purchase some stuff for caps. The shopman was busy at the time. I stood with my back against the counter, with my face opposite him, waiting to be served. By some means the shawls fell off the counter; I picked them up while the shopman was putting some things by. I had been drinking two or three glasses that morning. I did not mean to take them away.</p>

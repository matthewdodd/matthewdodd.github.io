                  </hi>. I assist in the Post-office receiving house, in Regent-street, kept by my uncle. On 14th July, shortly before 3 o'clock, I remem<lb></lb>ber Miss Brook coming in with a letter which she wished registered—I called down Mr. Vesey, who was at dinner—I saw him receive a letter from Miss Brook, register it, and put it on a desk on the counter; he then left the shop—it was then approaching to 3 o'clock, which is one of the periods at which the letters are collected—I was about to begin to take the letters out of the box, when a young man came in and asked for a sheet of note paper—I served him, and he paid me and left the shop—I asked him if I should put it in a piece of paper for him—he said no, he had a piece of blotting paper himself—I believe the prisoner Thomas to be the man—after he had left, a second man came in; that man had on a white hat—I believe Hillyer to be the man—he asked the price of a match box in the window—I told him, and showed it him—he looked at it a little, and said he did not want to buy it that day—he then went out of the shop—I got the letters out of the box and took them to the desk to tie them up, and I then found that the registered letter was gone—I called Vesey down, and stated what had happened—between the time of Vesey going away after placing the letter on the desk, and my missing it, I do not believe any per<lb></lb>son had come into the shop but the two men, who I believe to be the pri<lb></lb>soners—I have no recollection whatever of any person coming in the mean-time—I should say I missed the letter from four to five minutes after the men had gone—it took me two or three minutes to take out the letters, and I immediately went with them to the desk, and missed the letter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Antelope. On 11th June I took a shilling out of my till, it was bad—the girl said that I put it in the fire, that is the way we do with bad money—I could not swear I did so with that—on the 13th I found another shilling there, I took it out and put it on the mantelpiece—I put it from there to the cash box, and I gave it to the constable on the day the prisoner was examined at Westminster—On 16th June I was called up from the cellar by the last witness, she gave me the shilling in the cellar, I went up and found the prisoner there at my bar—I said to him, "Did you pass this shilling"—he said, "Yes, is it a bad one"—I said, "Yes, and I will give you in charge"—he said, "I will give you another one for it"—I said to the witness, "Is this the person who passed the other shillings"—she said, "Yes"—I sent for a constable, and gave him in charge with the third shilling—the second one I took to Westminster, and gave it to the constable—the second shilling had been in the meantime in the cash box, which was locked—no one had been there but me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You did not give the second shilling till the 20th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; that was the day of the second hearing before the Magistrate—I marked the second shilling on the 20th—I cannot tell how long it remained on the mantelpiece before I put it in the cash box, but no one was in the bar but myself till I put it in the cash box.</p>

               <p>I live in Suffolk; on the 30th of March, I attended a meeting at the Crown and Anchor, <placeName id="t17900424-7-crimeloc42">Strand</placeName>

               <p>Court. It was not out of your pocket? - It was not quite out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Are you able to ascertain who was the person that was then drawing it out of your pocket? - He singly was drawing it out, but was in company with; two others; who were not further than an arm's length from him; he immediately struck me, with a bludgeon, on the temple, which mark I now bear.</p>
               <p>Can you be quite positive, Sir, that the handkerchief was not quite out of your pocket when you received that blow? - If it was out of my pocket it was as much as it was.</p>
               <p>You cannot be certain? - I cannot positively swear; in the vehemence of passion I swore I would not quit the prisoner; the prisoner then had the handkerchief in his hand, I had hold of the handkerchief; it was then quite out of my pocket; it was held in the prisoners's hand, with violence from me.</p>
               <p>You are sure he had it entirely out of your pocket? - I am sure of it; I said I would not quit him, and he dropped the handkerchief at his feet; in stooping to regain the handkerchief, to pick it up, I saw the prisoner levelling a blow at my head; I had the presence of mind to raise this arm, to save that blow; and from one of the other two, I positively swear, I received a violent blow at the back of my head; by this time a crowd began to gather round, and my friend cried out, for God's sake, will no man assist in taking this thief; I then, by main force, dragged him across the way, and he was secured; I never lost hold of him.</p>

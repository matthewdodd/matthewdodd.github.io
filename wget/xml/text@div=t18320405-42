On the 29th of February, in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner with another young man, after five o'clock; there were two pistols, and some other things there - they pulled about the things; the other took up a pistol, and walked away with it; the prisoner followed him - I went after him, and they ran; there is a field at the back of the house; I saw the prisoner in the field with a pistol in his hand - I called Stop thief! they ran off, and the prisoner was taken near the reservoir.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Where were you standing? A. In the road, not above two yards from my master's stall - I lost sight of them, but I am quite sure the prisoner was with the other man when the pistol was taken, but the other man pulled the things about; the other get away - the pistol was on the stall.</p>

I saw the prisoner and another man, near Camberland-market, about fifty yards from the field, behind Frederick-place; I saw them turn a corner - I went down another street to meet them; they got a head of me, and went on to Cumberland-market - they there dropped a pistol, but I cannot say which it was, as they were close together; I called Stop thief! and my brother officer took him.</p>

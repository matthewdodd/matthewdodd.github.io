My. sister gave me a bad shilling, and in consequence of what she said, I saw a good shilling marked, and placed it on a shelf at the back of the bar, on Monday, 1st June, on which day the prisoners came, and Reeves asked for a quartern of gin and a pot of porter; after I had drawn the porter, she begged my pardon, and wanted a pint—they brought a bottle and a mug—Reeves tendered me a good half crown, and I gave her two old sixpences, the marked shilling, which my sister brought from the other side of the bar on purpose, and a halfpenny—I purposely turned round, and on turning round again, I saw a counterfeit shilling of George IV. lying on the counter—Reeves</p>

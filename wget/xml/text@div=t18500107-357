I am stabbed by that fellow there!"—the prisoner said, "I have done it! I have done it!" and he walked four paces back and leaned against the public-house—the prisoner had his hand lifted up, but I could not see whether anything was in it—Matthams bent down, and said he was stabbed—I ran round the corner, and called "Police!"—I said, "You had better knock him down; he will stab some of you"—I fetched the stretcher, and assisted in taking the policeman to the hospital.</p>

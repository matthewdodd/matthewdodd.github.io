            . I am servant to Mr. Matthews, he keeps his harness in Maidenhead-yard; on Sunday the 28th of April I put it in the stable about five o'clock in the evening, I saw it again at nine o'clock the same evening, when I fastened one of the doors with a cross bar inside, and put a stone against the other door; it was not locked. I went again at five o'clock in the morning, and found both doors open, and the horse gone; it could not have got out without the cross bar being taken down; the yard has two gates, which are frequently left open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Do not many bad characters come into the yard to sleep - A. Yes; I frequently find people there; I generally keep a dog there, but I did not on this night.</p>
               <p>Q. If any one found the door open they might turn the horse out to sleep in the stable themselves - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was on duty on Monday morning the 29th of April, and saw the prisoner in company with another man about half-past two o'clock, the prisoner was leading a grey gelding by the mane without bridle or saddle - he was in Broad-street, leading to St. Giles's; I stopped him close by St. Giles's church. When he saw me he said,</p>
               <p>"Do you know whose horse this is?" I said,</p>
               <p>"You must know." I asked where he got it - he said he found it, and that he was taking it to St. James's Green-yard; he was going in that direction - I said he should have given it to a watchman or taken it to our own Green-yard - he knew where it was for he is known about the neighbourhood. He made no resistance.</p>

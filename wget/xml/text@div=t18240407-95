               <p>Q. Can you say which boy it was - A. It was the prisoner; I had a full view of him by the moon-light as he came up to me, I am certain of him - it was moon-light, there was a lamp within a few yards of us; I do not think that it was a gas one.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner ran against you what happened - A. The man ran up to me immediately, and snatched my watch from my pocket; my seals hung out, but the chain was hardly to be seen. He ran away immediately that he got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your watch come out of your pocket without any force - A. Yes, it came right out. I caught it in my hand, but had no power to hold it, he got it; from the blow I received I had hardly power to protect it - I could hardly keep myself on my legs.</p>
               <p>Q. The man ran away, what became of the boys - A. They all ran together a considerable way, and then separated. I pursued them, and called Stop thief! I did not lose sight of one, but lost sight of the two who separated; they threw the watch under my feet when I had pursued about ten yards; I do not know which threw it down; it was the man, who took it out of my pocket when the prisoner had shoved me; I could not see which threw it down, as I was running very swift - I never lost sight of the prisoner at all I am certain, for when I stooped to pick up the watch, I kept him in view, and finding the others had escaped, I kept following him; he ran two or three hundred yards before he was taken by the witness - I am certain of him. I have the watch here.</p>

            . I am a jeweller. I had been visiting a friend, and was coming home with my family, and about ten or twenty yards before me, I heard a noise, and a cry of Stop thief! A man and two boys immediately ran by me towards town, and I was going towards town; I caught at the man - Mrs. Lister pulled me back, saying that it was only a parcel of boys. After that I left her arm, and ran after them; the man ran down a dark court, and dropped his hat at the corner; I did not choose to follow him; the prisoner ran towards the turnpike; I followed him, and in two minutes he was brought back; a lad like him had passed me, but I cannot swear to him; Jones immediately said he would swear to his being one; he was coming from Jones; the prisoner said it was not him; I asked why he ran away then - he said he was running out of the way of the people.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been looking for work - I was coming home, and met three patrols in the road, who asked where I was going; I said, home, or I should get locked out, and just as I got to the turnpike this man stopped me, and asked where I was going.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Steven's-mews, Rathbone-place, and am a stable-keeper—the prisoner was in my service—I lost the articles stated in this indictment, and charged him with stealing them—he said he knew no<lb></lb>thing about them, but if I thought he stole them, or knew anything about them, I was at liberty to go home with him as he was going home to breakfast, and to examine his apartment—I went home with him—I found part of the harness there—he said, "There is your breeching, that is part of your har<lb></lb>ness"—he said, "The whole of this harness belongs to you."</p>

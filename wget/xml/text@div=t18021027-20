             sworn. - I was left in care of the shop; on the 22d of September, I came into the shop and found a little girl and the prisoner in the shop; there were two yards of ribbon lying on the counter; the prisoner asked for some patterns to shew his aunt, which the little girl gave him; he gave me half a guinea to change, and said he would call again for the change; he went away and staid about a quarter of an hour; he then came back, and said his aunt said he might have what ribbon he liked; he asked to see some silk handkerchiefs; the little girl shewed him one; he then asked to see another; while the little girl turned round, I saw him put his hand in the ribbon box, which laid on the counter, and then put his hand to his left hand breeches pocket; I cannot say what he took out; I then went up stairs and called a gentleman, who came down; I asked the prisoner to step in the parlour; I then told him to turn out his pockets; he said, if I dared to search him I should get a constable; I left him in charge with the gentleman, and got a constable, who searched him, and found four rolls of ribbon in his pocket; he said they were not ours, he had bought them of a Jew, in Rag-fair, for 4s. 6d.(The constable produced the property, which was identified by Mrs. Pussord.)</p>

               <p>Q. What do you value them at? - Somewhere about fifteen shillings, I would wish to lay them at as low a rate as I can. Elizabeth Spiers had lived <rs id="t17950916-30-deflabel165" type="occupation">servant</rs>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160082"></xptr>Q. Did you ever find any of this property again? - Yes, at her niece's apartment. Sarah Rote; in consequence of a search warrant I attended with an officer, and a man servant of mine; I found at Sarah Rote's apartments in Bethnal green, two duplicates, one of the duplicates was for a silver tea spoon at one pawnbroker's, and the other for a waistcoat at anothers; I found at Mrs. Rote's also the ivory box, a tin snuff box and a napkin.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon after the time that you lost these things, did you find the duplicates? - I believe it was the day following, as soon as the magistrate had granted a search warrant, I went with the constable and man servant so Mr. Richard's in Brick-lane, where I found a silver tea spoon, which I can safely swear to be my property; the waistcoat I found at Mr. Manger's, it was pawned for four shillings, Mr. Manger produced it, and supposing from the size, and its being pledged by the same person that it was mine, which I had not missed, but I can safely say it is my waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe the prisoner that lived with you stands in relation of aunt to the other prisoner? - Yes, as I have a ways understood.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Rote knew nothing of you, nor you of Rote? - I do not recollect seeing her much, she has been at my house occasionally.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any reason to know, that Spiers, the eldest prisoner, ever lodged at the prisoner Rote's? - Yes, certainly, by Mrs. Rote's account and her's, only they differ as to time; she left my service on the 6th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. She was not married then I suppose? - Yes, I believe many years before.</p>

             told me that the house had been robbed, it was a very strange thing who could have done it; I have nothing more to say with respect to that day; I went with my master on the 22d of August, to Kensington, to endeavour to find the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Spiers was not at your house at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did her husband live at Kensington? - No, but we knew that she had a brother that lived there; we did not find her at her brother's, we found her at the back of Kensington-square, after looking for her a long while; the moment I see the prisoner, I asked her where she had been, that she did not come to her brother's? she said they had met her in the field, and told her there were two men looking for her; I told her that these two men that were looking for her, were myself and my master; she said she thought it was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160083"></xptr>runners looking for her for the old affair, and said she was afraid to come; I told her no. There was nothing more said that time, till she was in the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. You then took her and got a coach? - Yes, but not directly, because we could not get a coach at Kensington; I asked her in the coach what she had done with all my master's table spoons? she said she knew nothing of them; I told her I was sorry for her niece, Sarah Rote, because I thought that she had brought herself into a very disagreeable situation; I told her that we had found an ivory box, which her niece had said she had given to her on Saturday last, or Sunday morning early; she said no, she had not stolen it then, she took it away with her when she left my master's service, in her work bag, or work basket, I cannot exactly say which; I said she could not have done that, because the box had been seen several times in the house, after she had left my master's service, and had been seen particularly on the Saturday before the robbery was committed, by Ann Carroll.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You only represented to Spiers that you was sorry for the niece, because as you apprehended, finding some of the things there, it might draw the niece into a scrape? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She said that she gave the ivory box to the niece's child for a play thing, I believe? - She did.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to Bow-street. On Friday, the 21st of August I went with a search warrant to the apartment of Sarah Rote, in Hare-street, Bethnalgreen; I enquired for Mrs. Spiers, I understood that she lodged there; she told me that she was there the day before; I told her that I had a warrant to search the apartment, the lower apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lived there? - Rote; and I searched the place, and found a napkin, which Mr. Haynes believed to be his property, and two duplicates; I asked her how she came by them? she said she did not know that they were in the house; then this ivory box was found; Mr. Haynes mentioned something about a box, she immediately went to a drawer and shewed this box, Mr. Haynes said immediately it was his box.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This undoubtedly is my box, and the contents that are in it is mine, the key of the pembroke table drawer, it was in my house the Saturday preceding the time of the robbery, which was on Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you suppose that these things were taken out of your house? - We have a tarrier dog, which would have made a barking if it had been any strange person, and there is a very easy method for any person who knows the house to get into every room on the first floor, and by knowing her conduct before, I was well convinced it was somebody that was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160084"></xptr>very well acquainted with the house, and with a dog, for I never heard the dog bark all night.</p>
               <p>Q. It was the prisoner Spiers that lived with you? - Yes. Here is a napkin found at Sarah Rote's, that is mine, it is marked rather in an unusual manner, with pen and ink, by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. To Rivett. You found that the prisoner Spiers had been at Rote's that day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you spoke about the ivory box, she immediately said that she had got it, that her aunt had given it her the day before? - She did.</p>

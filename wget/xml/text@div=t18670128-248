                  </hi>. I am a coal merchant, and reside at 7, Loampit Vale, Lewisham—the prisoner has been in my service as carman for about a month or five weeks—on the 28th of December I sent him with a van and horse to the Great Northern Railway, for two and a half tons of coals, and gave him twenty-five empty sacks to put them in—he was to take them to Mr. Tomkins, a customer of mine, at Varney House—I went on to Mr. Tom<lb></lb>kins, and was there when the prisoner arrived with the coals—I asked what he had got in the van—he said twenty-two sacks, and three riders—the gardener counted them, and he found only one at the top instead of three; there were only twenty-three altogether—the prisoner then said, "Oh! I forgot, I shot two sacks over the weigh-bridge at King's Cross, as I had two sacks over weight"—I said that was a palpable falsehood, and insisted on having every sack weighed; he had delivered one—each sack should weigh 2241b.—they weighed the regular weight—the prisoner said the twenty-three sacks was the full complement of the two and a half tons—the two empty sacks were there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What was there to prevent the two and a half tons being put in twenty-three sacks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never knew such a thing—the prisoner continued in my employ till the following week—I paid him his wages, 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on the first Saturday, and when he came on the next Satur<lb></lb>day I gave him in charge—I sent a regular delivery note with the coals, specifying so many sacks, containing 2241b. each—I did not give him in charge at once, because I was in hopes he would have admitted his guilt—I did not tell him I should stop his week's wages to compensate myself for the coals.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal porter at the Great Northern Railway, King's Cross—I remember the prisoner coming there for some coals on the Friday; the ticket was directed for two and a half tons—I gave him twenty-five sacks; each sack would contain 2001b., or a little over; we generally give over the weight—some sacks weigh heavier than others; some weigh fourteen pounds, and some only four—I weighed the coals at the wharf or bays, where he loaded, and then he would go on to the weigh-bridge, where Toynton is clerk—I am not aware that I ever knew as much as a hundred pounds overweight in twenty-five sacks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is it not the custom to allow so much for falling out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; we give a few pounds in excess—if a man is turned back from the weigh-bridge for having his sacks too full, he would shoot them at the bays where he loaded—I have seen them take some off the top at the weigh-bridge when they have had overweight—I did not see that done in this case.</p>

               <p>prisoner's van came up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he did not tell me he weighed 3 1/2 cwt. too much—I put down 3 tons 14 cwt. 1 qr. in the book, that leaves half a hundredweight excess; that was not too much excess for me to let him pass—I said nothing to him; we allow one quarter excess to a ton—there is always coal lying about there—when the waggons are too heavy they sometimes throw some out of a sack there—I never saw them empty a sack there—I could see if it was done; if he had a hundredweight over he would have to throw some off at the side of the bridge.</p>

I beg your pardon, I made a mistake, I had to shoot two sacks at the weigh-bridge because I was overloaded"—I said, "I never heard of such a thing," and I and his master said we would have them all weighed—they all weighed legal weight—he had shot one already—twenty-three sacks were delivered.</p>

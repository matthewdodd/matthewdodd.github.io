I was in Prince's street, at a quarter before one o'clock in the afternoon of the 16th of Aug., and saw the prisoner Penny standing at the corner of George-court, in Prince's street—he had a light jacket and a cap cn, and this leaden pipe, which I have produced, was standing by his side—I watched him, and after a short time I saw the prisoner Garrett come up to him—the lead pipe was put on his shoulder, and</p>

               <p>he walked up George-court into Rupert-street with it—Penny walked down another way, in a contrary direction, which caused my suspicion—I saw a horse and cart standing in Upper Rupert-street, where Garrett keeps a marine store shop—he came up Rupert-street, down Richmond-street, into Rupert-street again, and the lead pipe was put into the cart, which was standing nearly opposite his own house—I asked him where he had got it from—he said he had brought it out of his own cellar—I asked whether he had brought it direct from his cellar to the cart—he said, "Yes," and he would take me down stairs and show me where he had brought it from, that he had a cistern there—I went down with him, he had a cistern there—I told him I should take him into custody, on suspicion of the lead being stolen—he said it was all right, would I have a drop of something to drink—I refused, and said I should take him to the station-house, and charge him.</p>

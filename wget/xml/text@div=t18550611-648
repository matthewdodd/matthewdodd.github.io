                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother, Frederick William Stevens; we reside at Matlock, in Derbyshire—we there carry on business as barites-manufacturers, which is an article used by colour-makers. On the 29th of March I received this letter, (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>); in a few days afterward this other letter was, I believe, received at our house of business—I was not at the works that day—in consequence of these letters my brother supplied a quantity of barytes—in April I came to London, and in consequence of the receipt of a third letter I went to Rose Wharf, Pritchard's-road, Hackney—I did not find the colour works of Morris Brothers, and Company—I went the next morning, and then I saw the prisoners; I saw Samuel first, and John a few minutes afterwards—I had the two last letters in my hand; I showed them to them—I told Samuel my name, and I said, "I suppose you are the persons we have been doing business with;" he said, "We are; this is my signature"—these are the letters he saw on that occasion—(read: "Rose Wharf, April 17th, 1855. Gentlemen,—We</p>

               <p>duly received the barytes, with invoice; the first quality suits us best. we shall require five tons of the same at your earliest convenience. As the distance from the station is so considerable, we shall prefer having them as before." "March 30th. Gentlemen,—We are in receipt of yours of yesterday, and will thank you to send three tons of barytes at 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., two ditto, at 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to be left till called for, as we generally like to draw our own goods by our own carts.")—In compliance with the first order, that quantity of barytes was supplied from our works—the value was 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I had never seen Morris Brothers, and Co.—I should not have suppllie that quantity if I had not believed there were such persons, and that they were those persons, certainly not—we believed they were carrying on the business of colour manufacturers in a large way, otherwise we would not have parted with the property—the second order we did not execute; we received it on the 18th of April, and I came up on the 1st of May—I went on the 2nd, and did not see them—I went the next morning with an officer—we were just inside the gates of Rose Wharf—I suppose that is a wharf occupied by wharfingers—I did not see the prisoners in any part of the building; they did not appear to have been on the premises, but they came in at the gate—I did not see the name of Morris Brothers, and Co. on the premises—I said I had not executed the second order till I had made inquiries, and I presented the bill—when the second brother came up, the first brother introduced him to me as his brother, his brother John, I believe—my conversation was then directed to both of them—I asked for payment of the bill; they both said something, the result was they promised to pay in a fortnight—I said my time was precious in town, I should like to be paid before I left, and after some time they said, "We will pay in a week"—I went over the premises with a view to ascertain if there were I any colour works—I saw no symptoms whatever of colour works there nor near it—I saw a heap of cinders and ashes, an old pair of rollers, and something which appeared to be like guano—I said, "You have not taken then premises, nor commenced your work, what did you do with the goods we supplied?"—they said, "We exchanged them for dry goods and colour with Mr. Morgan, of Pomeroy-street, New Cross"—I asked what reference they could give me as to their respectability, and they gave me the name of Mr. H. Cockburn, 22, Bedford-terrace, Old Ford-road—they said he was A chemist, and a friend of theirs; I said, as they had not taken those pro<lb></lb>mises, I wished to know their previous residence; they said their private residence was in Church-lane, Upper Clapton—I asked for the number, they Raid there was not any number on it; but it was the sixth house down, or the sixth house from the top—I asked who had introduced us to them; they said a young man from Croydon had mentioned our names to them; they said they had only recently come to London—they did not tell me from what part of the country—I went out and made a communication to the officer, and opened my pocket book, and showed him the reference—the officer took them into custody in a few minutes afterwards—I did notes See them taken—I went back to the wharf, and they were gone; I returned and told the officer—he told me to stop there, and in a few minutes he brought them—I have been to Pomeroy-street, but was not able to find Mr. Morgan or the barytes—it is gone.</p>

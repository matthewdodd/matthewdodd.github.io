I was foreman employed in that house at the time of the explosion—I was there about 18 months—Madame Coton employed me—theprisoner paid me—they lived together as man and wife—I have been in the firework-making trade all my life—I know of Madame Coton having occupied that house for a number of years—I believe she married the prisoner—I was at the house on the day of the fire, but not at the time of the fire—I had left about three-quarters of an hour before the fire—I know the front kitchen—I saw some red and some green fire in the front kitchen on the day of the explosion—that was used for filling the cases for Vauxhall-gardens and Cremorne-gardcns—this fire makes the coloured lights in the revolving wheels—it is not used in manufacturing rockets—it is used as coloured fire—it was made every day from potash, sulphur, and oxide of copper—the green fire was made from sulphur, charcoal, and oxide of copper—Madame Coton herself was in the habit of making it, in the front kitchen—five or six pounds of it was used per day for filling the coloured cases for the gardens—they consisted of red and green fire—the cases were made in the back kitchen—nothing was done to those cases after they were filled with the fire—I don't know whether the prisoner took away any fireworks from the house—there was a shop where fireworks were exhibited for sale—the prisoner had a horse and cart—I know he took away oases with the horse and cart to Peckham, where he kept all his stock—after the cases left the house in the Westminster-road, they were filled with composition at Peckham—thecases containing the red fire are filled with a rammer and a little mallet, and if it is struck too hard it will cause an explosion—after the red fire was made, it was put in a canister, and kept in a cupboard in the yard—Ican't say whether it was placed before any fire previously to its being deposited in the canister—I have seen it in the kitchen with Madame Coton—Inever saw it dried before it was put in the canister—if the canister were to fall off the shelf, that would not cause an explosion—the cases were hollow—therammer was to ram the composition down, and the mallet to strike it—the little boys were employed to do that work—I have never seen any fireworks taken away by the prisoner in the horse and cart—I know of his having a contract with Cremorne-gardens and Vauxhall—he has taken fire<lb></lb>works from the house in the evening, fireworks ready to be let off—fireworks were brought to the house in Westminster-road every day from the factory by the prisoner in the horse and cart—they were placed just inside the door in the back room—when I left the house on the day of the explosion I left Mr. Harrison in the back room—he was putting the little heads on the rockets for making the stars—there was nothing to be done to those rockets after they had been operated upon by Harrison—there was composition in them—they were made in Charles-street—there were five or six dozen made day by day as they were wanted for the gardens—it was Harrison's duty to put little heads on them to hold the stare—there might have been six or seven dozen there that day—I did not observe any barrels in any room on that day—the small rockets were made in Charles-street, Westminster-road, at Mr. Sunter's—the general supply was made at Peckham and was brought to the house and remained there about two hours—I think Mr. Sunter's premises were six or seven doors down the street—there was no way of</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, L</hi> 110). I was on duty on that Monday evening in Charles-street—I heard a report about 10 minutes past 6 o'clock—I went to the shop known as Madame Coton's—I saw a woman rush out of the next shop all on fire, and smoke was issuing from the back part of the house—a short time afterwards I heard another report, and the place blew up—the roof was blown off, and the shop-front was blown out—a great many fireworks came from the place—there was one continued report I should say at least 5 to 7 minutes—the fireworks went off in all directions—I saw the little girl Caroline Bridges—she was about fifty yards from Madame Coton's house, in the arms of Pike, another constable.</p>

I was not on duty on the evening of 12th July; I was merely passing—at a few minutes before six I saw smoke issuing from the side window of Madame Coton's—I ran to the station and gave information that Madame Coton's was on fire—I went back and found the last witness at the door—some time after that the explosion took place—I saw rockets and combustibles flying about—I saw one rocket go through Mr. Gibson's window over the doorway on the opposite side, and some time afterwards that house was on fire also—there were several reports—thefront of Madame Coton's was blown out—I saw the bricks fly about.</p>

I was on duty at the fire at Madame Coton's on the night of 12th July—I saw the child Caroline Bridges on the ground opposite Mr. Gibson's—I picked her up—she was all on fire—I gave her to Cattell—I afterwards saw that child at St. George's Hospital; she was dead—that was the child I picked up opposite the shop of Madame Coton.</p>

On the 8th of February, about half-past three o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the shop with two children - I had not known her before; she took down a shirt hanging by the side of the shop, and gave it to her eldest daughter, who was outside the door, and gave it to the other girl - I ran after them, and took the youngest, and gave her to a boy; I then ran after the prisoner, who had gone in a different direction, and got about two hundred yards - I brought her back; she said she had never seen the shirt, and never took it down - I can swear she took it down, and it was inside the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I ever in the shop, (say it upon your conscience,) till I went to inquire what the child had done? A. Yes, you were.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. No; I never was; there was a woman in the shop pawning something, and she said she would declare she saw the child pick something up outside the door, and you said you did not know how the child got it, but you supposed my eldest daughter gave it her. Witness. No, I did not - the little girl had got about twelve yards from the shop when I took her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you always said you saw her take it? A. Yes; I could see her through the glass door - she did not ask me the price, but took it down, and instantly gave it to her eldest daughter, who gave it to the other; I was attending to other customers - the prisoner just came in; the girls did not - when I came back with the little girl, the mother and the other girl had run off in different directions; I passed them at the door when I went after the little girl.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) On Tuesday, the 8th of this month, I was walking towards home, and met with my eldest daughter; she, pointing, said, "Mother, there goes the man that made my sister's shoes." I accosted him, and spoke to him about them; my daughter (the youngest) walked in; at this moment a mob was gathered round the child, as we stood looking towards the pawnbroker's; my eldest daughter said,"Mother, a man is taking my sister into the pawnbrokers;" when I attempted to go in, the prosecutor turned round, and asked me if the little girl belonged to me; I answered Yes, and enquired what she had done; he said, "You know what she has done;" I replied that I did not; the prosecutor said she had stolen a shirt, and had said that either her mother or sister had given it to her. Prisoner declares that she never saw the shirt until it was upon the pawnbroker's counter.</p>

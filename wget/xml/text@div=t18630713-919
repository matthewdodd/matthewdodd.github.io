                  </hi>. I live at 24, Foster's-buildings, St. Luke's, and am an errand-boy in the service of Mr. Lucas—on this Saturday afternoon I was walking a little way behind my master, and I saw the prisoner with a gold watch in his hand, and my master's chain hanging down—the prisoner, and a woman who was with him, ran up Golden-lane, and I saw him give the watch to the woman—I was about three or four yards from him when I saw the watch—they both got away—I next saw the prisoner at the station-house on the Monday morning—I described him to Baker, the constable—he was amongst a lot of others, and I picked him out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you not tell your master on Saturday night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, there was a crowd round him, and I did not like to—I told him on Monday morning—it was about a quarter past 5 on Saturday that this happened—I went home up Whiteley-street, and my master went down Barbican—you gave the watch to the woman as you were running away—you were about fifteen yards from me then, I should think—I could see you distinctly give it to her—it was in the middle of the road.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-detective</hi>). I had a description of the prisoner from the last witness, in consequence of which he was apprehended by 126 G—I fetched the lad to the station, put the prisoner in the yard with about eight or ten other persons, and told him a lad had come to identify him, and he could stand where he pleased—when they were all in a row I took the lad in, and, pointing to the prisoner, he said, "That is the man who had the watch in his hand."</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Miss Rebecca Godfrey, of No. 103, Strand—Mr. White occupies the shop and parlour—the prisoner was in his service, and was in the habit of opening the shop-window of a morning—on Friday morning, the 29th of October, about nine o'clock, I let the prisoner in as usual—he went to his master's room, took the key, and went into the shop—afterwards knocked at the door, and asked me if I would mind the shop for him while he went to fetch a bundle of wood—I watched the shop for half-an-hour—the prisoner did not return, and I called his master—no one had been in the shop from the time he left till I called his master.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I received a description of the pri<lb></lb>soner, and went in search of him—I found him at the Grapes public-house, in Old Compton-street, Soho—I asked if he knew any person named White, who kept a tobacconist's shop in the Strand—he said "No"—I re<lb></lb>peated the question—he still denied knowing any such person—I then told him I believed him to be the person I was in search of, and he was my prisoner—I searched him, and found on him this cigar-case, one sove<lb></lb>reign, and seven shillings in silver, one penny, and two halfpence.</p>

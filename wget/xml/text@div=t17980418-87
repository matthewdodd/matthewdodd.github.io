            , and William Turtle, come from the Bushey Park in Flower's own boat, with several bags, they rowed under Mr. Wade's, the block-maker's wharf; I put my sculls into my boat, and, as if I was going to work, I went into my boat, and rowed round the tiers, and staid there sometime, to the amount of half an hour; I saw Flowers, Lediard, and Turtle, go out of Flowers's boat, that they had the sugar the first time in Turtle's boat; then they went to the Bushey Park again along side the starboard quarter, Flowers went out of the boat, Lediard and Turtle staid in her; then Flowers came out of the Bushey Park over the lighter into his boat, and there he received the bags of sugar from the others as they handed them out; then they rowed round Mr. Wade's wharf as far as they could, they took a bench out Charley Faulkner's boat and put it on the mud for them to walk upon, and carried the bags up upon their backs to Mr. Wade's wharf again. Then I rowed my boat to Mr. Forrester's, a boat-builder, and made her fast to the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from Mr. Wade's and Coulthurst's? - A. I suppose about thirty or forty yards; Mr. Coulthurst's is about seven or eight yards from Mr. Wade's, just across the way. While I was standing at Mr. Forrester's, I saw nothing, I only heard doors open and shut; I then walked up towards the watchman's box and back again, and then I saw, to the best of my knowledge, young Marshall open Mr. Wade's door; as soon as Mr. Wade's door was open, Mr. Coulthurst came and opened his own door, I knew him perfectly well; I saw Lediard come out with a bag of sugar, and Turtle followed with another; then I walked back as far as Wapping New-Stairs again; as I was coming, I met Wilkie, a watchman. In about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour I saw the same happen again, Lediard and Turtle, each of them, took a bag of sugar into Coulthurst's house: in about ten minutes I saw Flowers, with a brown jacket on, go into Coulthurst's.</p>
               <p>Q.Had he any bag? - A. No. Then I looked through the key-hole and saw them weighing sugar. About seven o'clock in the morning, Turtle was washing one of his boats, and I was washing mine, I went up to Flowers's own boat, the boat he came first ashore in, and in Flowers's boat I took up almost a handful of sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of sugar do you think there might be? - A. I suppose about three quarters of a hundred in each bag; I suppose about two tons altogether.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. You heard all that was stated by the Counsel to the Jury? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear him desire you to go out, I dare say? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180083"></xptr>Q. You say this was about the 30th? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after you had had a quarrel with Flowers? - A. I had not had a quarrel with Flowers for eight or nine years to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a thing you cannot have forgot; to the best of your recollection, you have had no quarrel with Flowers for eight or nine years? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before the 30th of October had any misfortune happened to your boat? - A. My boat was stove in December.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you a member of the boat club? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any application to the club to make good your loss upon your boat being stove? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Flowers and others object to that? - A. I do not know but what he might.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he or did he not? - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Upon your oath, in consequence of his objecting, did not the club refuse to reimburse your loss, upon the ground that it was wilfully done? - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you claim? - A. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you expect? - A.Nothing; I expected the boat-builder was to be paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Be cautious how you answer my next question-upon your oath, upon that refusal of the club, at the desire of Flowers, the prisoner, did not you state that you would be revenged of him for that act? - A. No such thing; I know Flowers to be a very bad man.</p>
               <p>Q. You never expressed any resentment against him for advising the club not to make good your loss? - A. I never did to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it positively? - A. I will.</p>
               <p>Q. You never made use of any expression of resentment at him, on account of the club's refusing you? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is Coulthurst's to the watchman? - A. About that distance that you could shoot a marble into it.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him, doubtless, what was going forward, and desired him to watch these people? - A. No, we had no conversation at all, only how do you do, and how do you do.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew all these people perfectly well, not only by sight, but by name? - A.Very few of them but what I have taken goods for.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this 30th of October, had you any occasion to go to Mr. Staples's office? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of a week? - A. I cannot say, it might be the 2d of November, I dare say it was somewhere thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you believe you gave any information at Mr. Staples's office on the 2d of November? - A. I went as soon as I acquainted the West-India merchants of it.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at these gentlemen, and tell me, upon your oath, if you gave any information in any part of the month of November? - A. I gave information at Mr. Staples's as soon as ever I spoke to my friends, and Mr. Coome came about it; I did not retain such matters as them.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you give any information even in the month of December? - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you gave any information even before Christmas? - A. Yes, I think I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you did before Christmas? - A. These are matters I cannot answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I must strike out before Christmas? - A. I do not know about striking out.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you believe you gave any information before New-year's day? - A. Yes, I do, I made no memorandum of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did? - A. No, I will not.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you believe you did? - A. To the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear positively that you did before the 13th of January? - A. I will, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Take your time and consider? - A. I cannot consider.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, will you venture to swear, that during any part of the month of January, you gave information? - A. I think I did, the 2d of January, and they were apprehended on the 22d of January.</p>

               <p>Q. Before the Magistrate? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it, or was it not, more than a fortnight, or about three weeks after you had seen Flowers at Mr. Colquhoun's, and conversed with him there, before you inserted his name in any information before any Magistrate? - A. It was not. I told it to the West-India merchants.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you communicate Flowers's name, as the person that you had seen stealing sugar, to the West-India merchants? - A. About a fortnight or three weeks after it happened; on the 30th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Give me the name of any of the West-India merchants to whom you communicated Flowers's name, as the man you had seen stealing sugar from the Bushey Park, in a fortnight or three weeks after the 30th of October? - A. Mr. Batchelor, who sits there.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you saw him at the office, after the 30th of October, how often might you see him at large? - A.Very seldom.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180085"></xptr>Q. Once a week? - A. Once a day, or so.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. From the 30th of October, till the 2d of January? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Both before and after you had communicated all you knew to the West-India merchants? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the West India merchants attend the examinations before the Magistrate? - A. Some of them did.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen him at the common plying-place daily? - A. I have seen him daily.</p>
               <p>Q. At the plying-place? - A. Yes; but I never saw him at work.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you make application to the club for the repairing of your boat? - A. The first Tuesday of the quarter before last.</p>
               <p>Q. The first Tuesday in December? - A. No; the first Tuesday after Christmas-day.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a Custom-house officer, are you not? - A. I am not now.</p>

               <p>Q. You were tired of it, and resigned, I suppose? - A. No; I was dismissed.</p>
               <p>Q. If it is not an impertinent question, may I ask what it was you were turned out for? - A. I was turned out for another officer and me having a few words together.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps it might be this, for charging a man with a felony that he was not guilty of? - A. I do not know what I charged him with; I never charged him with any thing; I seized a bag of sugar, and a bag of coffee, and because I laid him before the Board, he laid me before the Board for bad language.</p>

               <p>Flowers's defence.

When I came out of the room, he held up his fist, and said, d-n your eyes, I will be revenged of you. The premises that he says the sugar came through, were locked up for a month before; he is a very bad man.</p>

Flowers was steward at that time. He brought an affidavit, signifying that his boat was taken away maliciously; he was ordered out of the room till the people consulted the articles, and he was called in again; Flowers was to tell<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180086"></xptr>him that they had all agreed not to pay him a half-penny.

               <p>Q. Mostly plying at these Stairs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the curiosity ever to look at this boat that was stove? - A. No; I had no right.</p>

               <p>Q. Did it ever happen that Branham seized a boat of a son of your's? - A. Yes; he was an apprentice of mine.</p>

               <p>Q. And the boat was seized? - A. Yes; but I lost nothing by it, the captain paid me.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there other officers on board with you? - A. Yes, two Excise, and three Customs.</p>
               <p>Q. It was your duty to take care that the property was not taken away? - A. Undoubtedly.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. On the 30th of October, was there any sugar carried away in bags? - A. I can<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180087"></xptr>not swear to a particular day, but I am sure there was none taken away but some that was seized.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the captain on board during this time? - A. Captain Lowry was, mostly all the time the ship was delivering.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. When you say, mostly, what time do you speak of? - A. From the morning till the lumpers went.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any bags seized on board the ship by you, or other officers? - A. None by me; some officers came on board rummaging the ship; for these men, the lumpers, are very apt to stow away little bags till they can get an opportunity of taking them out of the ship without our seeing them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Flowers on board the ship all the time? - A. Never; nor in a boat.</p>

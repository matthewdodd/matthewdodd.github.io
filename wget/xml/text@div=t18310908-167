               <p>COURT to MR. DANES. Q. To whom was the money due in the first instance? A. To myself - I considered it a partnership account; the prisoner was clerk to the firm, and he was liable to my partner as well as myself - he has received money on my private account; he might have brought it either to me or Mr. Outhwaite.</p>

                  </hi>. I was horse-keeper to William Chaplin, I am now a labourer, and live in a cottage in the stable-yard belonging to him, near Whetstone, Middlesex, and look after the premises—I missed some lead from the gutter between the spars of the roof of the stable, and about the 26th of March (<hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi>), I went into the loft, looked through the sky-light on the roof, and saw some lead lying in the gutter, close by the sky-light—it was William Chaplin's stable.</p>

On Saturday, the 26th of March, I beard a noise in the stable, and saw the prisoner outside on the roof, through the sky-light—I said, "What are you after there"—he came down and said he wanted George Dover—he went away, and when my husband came home I told him what I had seen—he found some lead torn off the roof, and called in the policeman.</p>

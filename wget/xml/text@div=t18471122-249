                  </hi> I am a deputy corn-meter, at John-street, Horsleydown. On Monday, 4th Oct., I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Tennant</hi>—I was employed to deliver 330 quarters of oats, 260 into a barge called the <hi rend="italic">Eclipse</hi>, and 70 to another barge—Hopkins acted as lighterman in taking the oats and stacking them in the <hi rend="italic">Eclipse</hi>—he was convicted on this indictment last Sessions—he was in the service of Mr. Dudin—when I came up on deck, I saw a skiff under the bow of the vessel, and noticed seven or eight sacks in the skiff—I addressed myself to Hopkins—the prisoner might be then about three or four yards off—he was within hearing of what I said—I asked Hopkins whether Wheeler worked for Mr. Dudin—he said, Yes, he did, it was all right—Hopkins and Wheeler had some conversation—I saw Wheeler take the skiff away, and row it towards Prince's-stairs—I did not count the quan<lb></lb>tity in the skiff—there were seven or eight sacks in it when I came on deck.</p>

                  </hi> I am a fellowship-porter—I was employed in delivering the oats—I saw the skiff come with three bundles of empty sacks—Hopkins and the prisoner were in it—the prisoner assisted Hopkins in passing the sacks out of the skiff into the barge—I saw the prisoner take two sacks from the side of the <hi rend="italic">Tennant</hi>, and lay them down in the skiff—I called to Adcock, and told him what I had noticed—the prisoner took the skiff away—there ap<lb></lb>peared to be about five quarters in it, but we did not take notice—Hopkins said that Wheeler worked for Mr. Dudin, and it was all right—I should think the prisoner heard that—he stood on the barge—a boy came in the skiff, but he had been sent on shore—the prisoner rowed the skiff away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi> I am a master-lighterman—Hopkins was in my employ; the prisoner was not—I did not authorize Hopkins to employ him—I found the skiff that has been mentioned at ten o'clock that night, with no oats in it—it had been in my charge that day—I had directed Hopkins to deliver the oats at Whiting's-wharf—I have been charged with the difference of the quantity that should have been delivered—I searched for the prisoner—I did not see him again till last Friday—such search has been made for him that I think the Thames police-officers would have found him had he been in the way—I have looked for him.</p>

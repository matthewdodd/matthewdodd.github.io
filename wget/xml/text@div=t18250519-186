On the 2d of May his employ was to take off the wooden covers of the chests of tea; there is a lining of lead under that; he was sitting on one of the chests about nine o'clock, and I saw him put his hand in and take out some tea, and put it into his bosom; I mentioned it to Mr. Farmer and he was taken into the counting-house.</p>

            . I am assistant elder. I gave the prisoner in charge to a constable, and saw him searched - he had a pair of very loose trowsers, and a smock frock on, and a pair of drawers, tied tight at the knee, and the tea was round about his knee; I compared it with the chest he took it out of, and it was the very same; it is the duty of the labourers to open the wood of the chests, and then a regular officer opens the lead - there was a hole in the lead of this chest, forced in by the hand.</p>

I was in attendance on the deceased as day nurse for six weeks, and left through illness about four weeks before her death—the prisoner attended her—I have seen him administer several things to her; he did the emetics himself—she was sick about twice in the week—she also took powders; it was a kind of mixture which was kept by itself in a paper: the attended to that herself—she was able to get up in the middle of the day while I was with her; she sometimes seemed better, and sometimes worse—after being sick she seemed to breathe freer, and to receive ease from it—the prisoner attended her every day, to the best of my recollection.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 22, Arbour-place, Kingsland-road On 11th Feb. I was called in to examine the body of the deceased—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the lungs exhibited evidences of long-standing inflammation—the stomach was inflamed throughout its surface, and there were traces of incipient ulceration—the state of the lungs was certainly not the cause of the ulceration in the stomach—the ulceration proceeded, in my opinion, from some acrid substance being taken into the stomach—there was a fluid in the stomach at the time I examined it, amounting to three ounces, and of an olive green colour—that fluid was saved, and was afterwards gives to Dr. Letheby to be analyzed—my opinion is that the proximate cause of death was disease of the lungs and stomach; there was disease enough in the lungs to account for death—there was an effusion of something like sixteen ounces of fluid in the cavity of the chest, the result of inflammation of the lungs—seeing how the woman was, I should say lobelia was not a proper thing to be given; it would be likely to hasten death—cayenne pepper was not a good thing to administer to a person in that state—lobelia, cayenne pepper, and stimulants of that nature, would be apt to hasten the death of a person diseased as she appears to have been.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are cayenne pepper and lobelia stimulants of the same sort? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not of the same character; cayenne pepper is a powerful stimulant; lobelia is used in medicine in some diseases; it is of the tobacco tribe—it is not like stramonium exactly—the tribe is not called <hi rend="italic">datura</hi>; it belongs to the tribe lobelia—when I said it was of the tobacco tribe, I meant having similar effects on the constitution.</p>

               <p>have heard that there is a person practising, but I am not aware whether he is doing any business or much business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you know that these gentlemen, who give something much more innocent than you do, do business more cheaply than you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I have heard of Dr. Coffin; it is an ugly name—I do not trouble myself about the number of patients he and his followers have—it was the Coroner that sent for Dr. Letheby; I did not suggest it—I have never been a witness in any of these cases before—lobelia is a plant found in the United States—I have never seen the shrub; I have seen it in powder and in the leaf—I have seen the seeds once, and the leaf several times—I have known a considerable number of instances of lobelia being administered—I have administered it as a sedative, in the shape of tincture, not as an emetic—it will act as an emetic—should not give emetics in cases of inflammation of the lungs—under some circumstances, I should give an emetic to get rid of phlegm—phlegm is generally in the air passage—there were no tubercles in the deceased's lungs—there was adhesion of the lungs to the chest—the sign of athma, on poet <hi rend="italic">mortem</hi> examination, is inflammation of the air passages, but not of the surface of the lungs—there was inflammation of the air passages, but not enough to account for a very serious state of asthma—she had not asthma seriously—I know that her breathing was bad; I attribute that to the disease of the structure of the lungs, and not to asthma.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is lobelia given for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is given for asthma in small doses—there is always a sign of asthma upon dissection; you have thickening as the result of inflammation, and the passages filled with mucus, which has been thrown out of those passages; unless that was the case, the patient could not have had asthma—if a patient had spasmodic asthma, and died suddenly, there would be symptoms found, a thickening and mucus—I never saw a person in a fit of spasmodic asthma which stopped suddenly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> is there an opinion among scientific persons that there is such a thing as spasmodic asthma arising from disease of the nerves? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It has been called such, and thought so—there is an opinion that there is a nervous asthma, which hinders a man from breathing, spasmodically, and then he breathes on again—I have never opened the body of a person afflicted with that kind of asthma; it would not leave traces on dissection; it would be a disease of the nerves—the respiratory nerves ate the eighth pair—you cannot detect disease of the eighth pair of nerves on cutting a man up—that particular species of asthma leaves no trace discernible on dissection—lobelia was given a good deal for asthma; I think I recollect it being given fifteen or sixteen years ago; since that it has been in vogue, and some people trust it more than others—it is a disadvantage to me not to have had the opportunity of seeing the person alive during the time of the treatment.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of No. 61, High-street, Hoxton. I was called on to assist Mr. Clarke, and examined the deceased with him—I agree with him perfectly as far as facts go, but do not pledge myself to his opinions—the lungs were extensively diseased, seeing which, I should decidedly say that lobelia was not a proper drug to administer; I think it would tend to hasten death—I have not had considerable experience in giving lobelia; I have given it two or three times in cases of asthma, but it has not relieved in my hands—I administered fifteen or twenty drops of the tincture—the tincture is made by macerating the leaves in spirits of wine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How did you intend the lobelia to act? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I depend upon it chiefly as an anti-spasmodic—I attribute the asthma to the nerves; it sometimes arises from the nerves, and sometimes from other causes.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280040"></xptr>
               <p>and from mixed causes—I gave it in cases of asthma arising from the nerves. and producing spasmodic breathing—that is a sort of breathing which goes on a little time and then stops, and the person breathes properly again—I cannot say where I got my lobelia from; I know that that makes a difference with every medicine, as also does the quality of the spirit in which it is made up—I do not pledge myself to agree with the last witness in some things—I am not aware that there is a great difference in the medical profession about the exhibition of lobelia; as with all other medicines, it requires some knowledge of the quantity to be applied to render it at all efficient—when I applied it, I found it did not act on the nerves.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq., M. D. I am a professor of chemistry and toxicology, at the London Hospital. I have received certain bottles from the last witness and some powder, also the contents of a stomach from Mr. Clarke—I have analysed the powder—it does not contain anything of a very deleterious nature; cayenne pepper is the only thing—this pbial (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) contains lobelia—I analysed the contents of the stomach, and found 110 grains of the seeds of lobelia—that quantity is quite sufficient to kill; I have known less than that kill, considerably less—I have heard from the medical gentlemen the state the lungs were in—lobelia was a highly improper drug to administer to a person whose lungs were diseased as this woman's were—in my opinion, lobelia given to a person so diseased would hasten death—I found more than enough to kill in the stomach—larger doses than that have been given with impunity certainly, because it is very irritating, and the stomach discharges itself of it by reason of the vomiting it occasions; but when it remains on the stomach, one third of that quantity kills—it is not used by medical practitioners at all as an emetic, because of its danger—I examined the other bottles; one contains a quantity of Cayenne pepper alone, and the others demulcient medicine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> In what state was the digestion of the woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know nothing at all of the condition of the woman; I did not see the stomach, only its contents, which the constable brought me—I found a small quantity of cayenne pepper in the stomach, but it was only on searching very rigorously; it was not more than a person might take in some article of food—a great portion of the active principle of the lobelia had been taken out, but the structure of the seed was there—no doubt the active principle was gone into the stomach of the woman, but the powder remained—this would not kill anybody, it is inert now—this is the husk, or, in other words, the woody matter of the seed, the active principle being dissolved—it would be very difficult to digest it, or to get rid of it at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the woman's bowels were not active, it would not pass off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Digestion does not depend upon that; if the bowels were not active, it would pass out of the stomach into the bowels just the same—the whole system is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280041"></xptr>
               <p>not always weakened immediately before death; sometimes persons are killed in a moment, when the whole system is in a state of activity—in the case of a woman dying gradually in six weeks, her system would be very much weakened—I have had a great many cases of lobelia—I was a witness here against a gentleman who I afterwards heard through the public papers was acquitted, and I have seen him out since.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you got some lobelia there, which has not been in the deceased's stomach? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the powder at the bottom of this bottle—I have added spirits of wine to it to make a tincture of it in order to test it—when a person gets tincture of lobelia, he does not get powder in it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How much pure lobelia could you extract out of this quantity, supposing it had not got into the stomach? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Allow me to calculate: the quantity of powder there is equal to two ounces of tincture of lobelia—110 grains; but the actual essence is obtained with great difficulty, and there has been no per centage arrived at—about one third of the seed is soluble in spirit—this is not soluble at all—this quantity of husk is equal to 147 grains of the seed; the active principle contained in that would have been thirty-seven grains, equal to 147 grains of the former seed, or two ounces of tincture, put it in which way you like.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you a doctor of medicine? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am a bachelor of medicine, of the London University, and practice medicine at the hospital—I know that lobelia is given by medical persons, and in cases of asthma—it is given is cases which I think imprudent, unless the system has become accustomed to it, there is not then so much harm done—this 110 grains is a sort of husk of the wood, like the grains of malt, which has had all the goodness or badness taken out of it, and is not digestible in a weak stomach—such a thing night happen as its remaining in the stomach from day to day, or it might pass out into the alimentary canal—I cannot say how long it would take, as such a difference of opinion exists—all the quality has been got out of it in the stomach by maceration; that is, assuming that none of the quality had been got out of it before it got into the stomach, which I cannot tell—I found a mere inert matter, not capable of digestion in a weak stomach—if it went into the stomach in an active state, it most have remained there long enough for the liquid to dissolve all the active principle in it—the question how long that would take, has matter of scientific opinion involved in it; some physicians believe digestion to take three or four hours, and others believe that there are circumstances existing under which it has not taken place under twenty-four hours, and you have all kinds of opinions between the four and the twenty-four—I will not venture to offer an opinion at all; if the stomach is weak, it may still have the power of dissolving vegetable matter—sometimes a weak stomach would dissolve the seed quicker than a strong one—I should think that this was a very weak stomach—such a thing might happen, that the stomach of a person just going to die would dissolve anything much quicker than that of a robust one—I have known digestion take place after death—this is the seed of lobelia; the plant has been raised in this country; it is grown as a common plant in our gardens; it has a little blue flower, and is cultivated for its beauty in almost every garden—it is a natural family—Linnaeus would have called it a class; a genus is a subdivision of a natural family—tobacco is not of that family—here are some seeds from the stomach (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the plant itself has much less smell than the seeds usually have—the seeds contain more of the active principle than the leaves, although they have not a smell—lobelia, in combination with an acid has no smell, it keeps its odour down—the active principle of this plant is an alkali, and until</p>

               <p>the alkali is set free by another acid, you cannot smell the lobelia—tincture of lobelia has a smell, the acid sets the smell free—some doctors fancy the ethereal tincture of lobelia; I like it, and give a good deal of it—I think lobelia a very excellent medicine in its proper place—I should give from five to twenty drops, made with ether or spirits; we make both of the same strength.</p>

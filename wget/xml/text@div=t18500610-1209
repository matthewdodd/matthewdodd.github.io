                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at 28, Great Union-street, Southwark. On Monday morning, 20th May, between one and two, I was going home—a female was with me, not my wife—the prisoner came up, and asked me for money—I had no small change, and I went into a public-house to get change, and gave him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he then asked me to give him some beer—I gave him a pint of porter, and left the house, and I was surprised to find myself quickly followed by the prisoner, who demanded more money of me, saying that he wanted to pay for his lodging, and it would come to 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he had just come into town off the road, and he was very tired, and had</p>

               <p>no other means—I told him I could not give him any more, I was but a working man myself, and I had nothing else but two half-crowns in my pocket—I told him to go about his business, or I would give him in charge—he still followed me from the Obelisk in Black friars'-road all the way round Union-street, till I got opposite my own door, when he attacked me, and struck me—I struggled with him, and called for the police, who came to my assistance, or no doubt I should have been robbed—I found my watch hanging from my pocket by the guard-chain—I was perfectly sober.</p>

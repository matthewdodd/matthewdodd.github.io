I saw the deceased strike him, or whether the curb stones tripped him up; I went and picked him up, and said, come away home, you will get stabbed; the deceased and I went as far as the place called George-yard, about thirty yards from the place where Da Costa fell. Soon after, the two prisoners and two or three more Portuguese came after us with knives in their hands, that might be the space of three or four minutes, I cannot say; there was five in all, they had all knives, there was these two prisoners and three more, we continued to stand at the George-yard, we had not the time to go any farther they came so close after us, then the tall one asked the deceased, why he struck the little man, and why he did not give him his hat; the deceased said, he had not his hat, where was his; immediately after he said that, the deceased run away and they after him; I cannot say that I saw them stab him.</p>

               <p>Did you see whether Pinto had any knife in his hand at that time? - Yes, he had one in his hand down by his side, it was in his hand, I could only just see his hand and part of the blade of the knife.</p>
               <p>Court. How far did you see the deceased run? - I suppose it might be an hundred yards, I do not know where he went to afterwards, he went out of my sight, and when the prisoners came back they run up to a young man that is here; I went into a chandler's shop and there I bought a broom-stick, or else I should have shared the same fate; when they saw me take up a broom-stick they then run away immediately, I run down after them into a bawdy house, and they came back immediately, I went with this young fellow and his wife towards home; I went to his house where the deceased lodged, I did not see the deceased; in about a minute or two after he was brought to the door, I cannot tell by whom, and set down upon the step of the door; when he was sat there he said to the landlord, Swinney, dear Swinney, I am a dead man, I shall not trouble any one long; I said, the man looks as if he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230005"></xptr> was stabbed, and turned his jacket over one side and unbuttoned his waistcoat, and on his left side over his trowsers, his bowels hung out, he was lifted in, and they applied to Doctor

               <p>Prisoner. That was because he called me a Portuguese dog.</p>
               <p>The deceased staid as if he was considering whether he would strike or not, or whether he would take the affront; Da Costa stood up, and the rest of the Portuguese came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230007"></xptr> round him and told him not to quarrel, and told him that if the little man was not in liquor he would not quarrel; they got the little one out at the door, and attempted to keep him out, but he made an attempt to strike the deceased in the passage; the deceased said, for why did he want to rump me?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. That is a bye-word in the country, meaning to beat.</p>
               <p>They got the man out a second time, and persuaded the deceased to go out quietly, and told him if he would go they would guard him that the little one should not hurt him; just as he came out of the door this little one jumped at him and struck him, the deceased struck the little man twice in return to the blow he struck him; at the second blow Da Costa fell to the ground upon his face and groaned very much, the alarm for him was pick him up, I heard the words pick him up, Da Costa run from one side of the way to the other, and the Portuguese run after him, the others made their escape and were coming home, the two Portuguese in company followed the deceased, as if watching to see where the deceased was going to, they were neither of the prisoners, they followed him to the corner of George-yard, and in about half a minute two men came up and asked the deceased about the hat, they were neither of the prisoners, immediately there came up three more Portuguese that had been in company, they had been away and came with knives, the little one says to the deceased, why you took my hat, and called him a very bad name, called him a bloody thief, and said he had stole his hat, the prisoners are two of the men, the deceased said I have no hat, where is mine? I looked towards the side of the little man, and I thought I saw by his hands moving something of a knife, I made myself sure and looked a second time, I saw him trying to hide the weapon behind my apron, I cried out immediately they had got knives, I had no sooner spoke the words but the deceased was stabbed; I did not see him stabbed.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the tall one near you at the same time? - Yes Sir, whilst I was looking at the dagger that the little one had, the tall one stabbed him, I was standing between the deceased and the little man, and the tall man was facing him, the weapon the little man had seemed to be the point of a dagger, and I halloo'd out they have got knives, the deceased run as soon as he was stabbed to a very great degree, I attempted to run after him, but I lost sight of the deceased in a very little time, as I was coming back the Portuguese were returned, I met the little one with the dagger in his hand, I went to see if I could find the deceased at his lodgings, but he was not come home, in the mean time the deceased came up and walked very solid, as if unhurt, I stood at the door and said, thank God here is the young man coming unhurt, as he came up to me me I said,

               <p>I was standing at my own door, I heard some people come out of the Ship and Star crying out give it him, give it him, and I saw them kick a man about for the space of eight or ten yards, which I believe was Da Costa, and he roared out very much, from that the little man run over the way into White's-yard and he fell against a post, all the crowd followed him, and the deceased fell kicking him again, and then left him, the little man got up and I followed the deceased, I saw no more of him.</p>

            , a Portuguese, sworn.</p>
               <p>The little man lodged at my house between<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230008"></xptr> six and seven weeks since he came to England, always behaved very quiet and decent, I never saw him otherwise, neither this voyage nor the last, I know the other tall man a little, he did not lodge with me.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, The first of the transaction seems to have been when the deceased spoke to Da Costa in the alehouse, and according to the account gave by Wyatt, the deceased accosted him in a civil way; this is very material; after the deceased had gone across the road with Hardy, some of them tell you that there was a conversation between the Portuguese in their own language, then the Portuguese came across the road with knives in their hands; that evidence is given by two witnesses; now with respect to the Prisoner Da Costa, very much will depend on what is your opinion of the transactions of that moment, for at first he does not appear to have had the possession of any weapon till he came across the street, and it is clear that he gave no blow; so that as to this unless you should be satisfied that at the time of that conversation which passed between the Portuguese, and immediately after, when they all crossed with knives in their hands; unless you are satisfied that at that time they all went across the street, with one common design of stabbing the deceased, there will be no ground to impute the crime of murder to the prisoner Da Costa. It is clear that the deceased got his death by the wounds which he received from the hand of Pinto; he was the person that actually stabbed him, the other was present, and if he was acting on the same design, and crossed the road with the same view, he and every person acting with that design, are as guilty as the man that gave the blow; therefore it is extremely nenecessary for you to be satisfied whether he was actually engaged in that design or no: with respect to the other prisoner, his case stands on very different grounds, the boxing was over, but even if it had continued, it is a very violent conduct taking out a knife and stabbing a man, but especially by a man that had not been struck himself; the deceased had crossed the street, and left the Portuguese without any apparent intention or design of returning to them again; the Portuguese crossed the street with knives, and it is material to see how they conducted themselves when they did so cross, for all of them came with their knives and weapons secreted as much as they could: The first prisoner Pinto is proved to have had his hand down by his side, and the weapon in a great degree hid; one witness says he saw only just the point of it; then when he comes over, what is his conversation to the deceased; here had been no fresh quarrel, no violent heat, but Pinto accosts him by asking where is the little man's hat; this is a cool remonstrance, and if you think made use of to watch the opportunity of that purpose which he intended, shews that it was done with a malicious view, and his conduct shews that he could not do it with any other view. If you should be of opinion that the other went over the street with the same design, he is then guilty of the same offence; he went over with the weapon in his hand, and had it secreted, and endeavoured to hide it under the woman's apron: You must observe also the conduct of the deceased, for I cannot help feeling myself for the generosity of an English sailor, even in the hour of death; at that moment he seems to be extremely anxious to distinguish between the two prisoners, and peculiarly so that the prisoner Da Costa should not suffer; he said Da Costa had fought him fairly, and that he was not at all accessary to his death. This is evidence out of the mouth of the deceased, and besides that it is perfectly clear he did not give any blow, whatever was his intention: therefore, unless you are of opinion that he crossed the street with the same intention that the other prisoner did, you will distinguish in the verdict that you give between the men.</p>
               <p>Jury. We beg to ask the Surgeon whether he thinks the other wounds were given with the same instrument with which the wound was given that was the occasion of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230009"></xptr> the death? - It is impossible to distinguish, they were so very slight they might have been given with the point of a knife.</p>

            ; in the course of your trial, the Court and the Jury have conducted themselves with anxiety to reach guilt on the one hand, and to protect innocence on the other; and this has been particularly displayed in your condemnation and the acquittal of your associate: Under whatever religion you have been bred and educated, you must be sensible that the crime with which you are charged, is equally a violation of the laws of God and man, and that in every community it meets with the punishment of death; you have not therefore the plea that is usual to foreigners, that you have been guilty of a crime peculiar to this country alone, nor can you in any respect suffer from your ignorance of the laws of this country; you must likewise be sensible that the crime is of such a nature as to encourage no expectation of mercy, but from God alone, and that his mercy is to be obtained by sincere repentance and contrition; you will be attended by those that will awaken your mind to a due sense of your guilt, and will endeavour to confirm in you those dispositions which through the divine goodness of God may obtain you mercy: It is necessary likewise to inform you, that in abhorrence of your crime and to awe others who are maliciously disposed from the commission of a crime of the like nature of the law has allowed a shorter interval between the conviction and the execution of the sentence than in other felonies. Nothing therefore remains for me, but to advise you to make the best use of this short interval, and to pronounce the sentence of the law; which is, that this Court doth adjudge, that you

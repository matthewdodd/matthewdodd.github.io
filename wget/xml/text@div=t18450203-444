                  </hi>. I am clerk to Robert William Kennard, an iron merchant. On the 22nd of Jan., about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was at the front counting-house, when the prisoner presented this order to me—he said nothing—we made no remark to him, but detained him while we sent a clerk in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to ascertain whether the order was genuine or not—he returned about a quarter to five o'clock—we detained the prisoner by waiting on others before him—he waited—on the clerk's return I said to the prisoner, "My lad, you are iu a very awkward predicament, this order proves to be a forgery"—he said it was given to him by a lad who was waiting outside—I then determined on putting some metal into a truck for him to take, and see if we could capture the other party—the prisoner will<lb></lb>ingly drew the truck, and I and an officer in plain clothes followed him as far as Bridge-street, Blackfriars; and in the dark part of Bridge-street, near where Mr. Alderman Waithman used to reside, I saw a lad, of the same description the prisoner had given us of the person who gave him the order, come up to the truck—I immediately hastened across the road, but be vanished in an instant—he had got near enough to the truck just to speak to the prisoner, who was drawing it—we then went on the whole distance, but no one joined us till we got up to Seven Dials, where the things were to go to—then seven or eight lads, from nine to thirteen years old, surrounded the truck, but the other lad kept out of the way—the prisoner gave us the name of the boy—my impression is that the prisoner had been made the dupe of some designing person—I believe he has never been in trouble before, and I regret he should have been placed in this situation—he will<lb></lb>ingly rendered every assistance.</p>

            . On the 19th of October I was coming home in the evening, and stood looking at the fire in <placeName id="t18181028-89-crimeloc520">Fleet-market</placeName>

I looked round, and saw nobody near me but the prisoner. I collared him - He struck me three times<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280039"></xptr>and asked me what I wanted? I said I wanted my hat-he took off his own, and said, "Is this your's?" He tried to get away - I held him fast; a fireman took him. I have never found it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BECK. I was at the fire, and saw the prisoner take the prosecutor's hat off, and put it on another boy's head. The prosecutor turned round, and took the prisoner-a fireman took him from the prosecutor. He struck the prosecutor three times-the blood ran down his face.</p>
               <p>JAMES LINES. I am a beadle. I took the prisoner in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 69, Arundel-square, Islington—about 3 o'clock in the morning on 29th October, my wife awoke me—I got up, and spoke to a policeman out of the window—in consequence of what my wife said, I let him in by the back door—I searched the house, and in the drawing-room I found the prisoner lying behind the couch—the only remark he made was, "Don't disarrange me"—I saw how he had got into the house—my house is next to an iron church, and he had got over the wall across the garden on to a dust-bin, from thereon to the cistern to the staircase window; he then broke a square of glass, and had to put his arm through fourteen inches to undo the fastening of the window; he had then lifted the window up, and gently put it down—at that time my wife awoke me, and I heard footsteps go down stairs—all was quite safe the night before when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How large was the pane of glass that was broken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Twelve inches by four—it made a noise that awoke my wife—nothing was removed but a cushion from the couch to the ottoman to enable you to step over the couch to lay behind it—you had not opened a door, you had not time—you were about half an hour from the time you began to get in till you were taken by the policeman—I heard your footsteps, and you must have heard mine, because I walked heavily on the floor above you—you could not have made your escape by the front door very well, because I was coming down stairs—I don't think you could have got away, as the police-sergeant was in front of the house, nor have got out of the house, you would have had bolts and locks to undo—I don't know that you had attempted it—my son sleeps on the same floor—you looked very dirty—I should think you were sober; a drunken man could not have got in as you did—I thought at the Police-court that you did not know what you were doing, because you had such a dirty appearance, as if you had been drinking.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife—I was awoke by the breaking of the glass—I heard the bolt of the window unfastened—I then awoke my husband—I heard the window raised and closed, and heard foot-steps go down the stairs—my husband rose and dressed—we considered what we had best do, and I proposed his opening the window and calling a police<lb></lb>man, as I was reluctant for him to go down, as he was not armed—the stair<lb></lb>case window opens on to the landing, about six steps from our bedroom door—my husband went down after, perhaps, the lapse of a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you think I had an opportunity to leave the house before your husband went down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, because the sergeant was in front of the house—I don't think you made the attempt—you did not go into any other room—the drawing-room is on the same floor as the street door—you would not have had far to go, but you would have had a chain, and bolts, and lock to unfasten—I thought at the time that you were mad; you looked very dirty, and twenty years older than you do now.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 163). I was called in by the prosecutor, and found the prisoner under the sofa in the drawing-room—I asked what he was doing there—he made a sort of sneer—I got him out, and again asked him—he said something about disarranging his clothes—I asked him a third time—he said, "You have got me now, and I am in your hands; that is quite sufficient," or something of that sort—he did not smell of drink—he was in a very dirty state.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you find any implements of any description upon me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, nor any lucifers—I found your hat in the churchyard at the back of the premises, very carefully placed down under the fence—you identified it at once—you were not drunk—the inspector took off your scarf and collar at the station; we generally do; we thought it had been stolen from somewhere else—you gave a false address—you appeared as rational as you do now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The only thing I can say is that I was so drunk I really do not know anything at all about it, but I think you will see from the evidence that it was not the action of a burglar; I did not try to get into the house stealthily, and after breaking the window I must have opened it, got in. and shut it down again, leaving my hat in the churchyard; they could hear me go down stairs, and I must have made a great noise, and have remained a quarter of an hour in the drawing-room without any light, and without making the least attempt to escape; I can assure you that though I was guilty of the sin of drunkenness, I had no intention of com<lb></lb>mitting a burglary.</p>

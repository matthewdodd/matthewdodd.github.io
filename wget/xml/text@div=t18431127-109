                  </hi>. I am potman at the Plough at Kensington. The pri<lb></lb>soner was in my master's employ—I left this watch and chain safe in the drawer a week before the 27th of Oct.—I did not miss it till the 30th—I found the prisoner in little Grove-street—I said I wanted to speak to her, and, as we were walking, she said, "What do you want?"—I said, "You know"—she said, was it the watch I wanted—I said that was just what I did want—she said she would fetch it—I would not allow her, and it was brought to me, by her direction, by another woman, whom she sent for.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He lent me the watch. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It is false—I never lent it her in my life—I did not know that she knew where it was.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that the prosecutor had behaved improperly to her, in consequence if which she left; and on her refusing to meet him, he had charged her with stealing the watch, which he had lent her.</hi>)</p>

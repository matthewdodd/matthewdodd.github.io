            . I loaded the prosecutor's waggon in Broad St. Giles's, on the first of November, with 24 sacks of soot; the waggon was then drawn on to the <placeName id="t17501205-1-crimeloc4">Angel Inn by the church</placeName>

Next morning I saw the sore part of the tilt was thrown up; my fellow-servant got up in her, and said there were three sacks missing. I went the same morning into Plumtree street, where the prisoners lived, and found them; there lay the soot in the yard loose, and Blake looking at it. Williams had hid himself in the necessary house. I asked Blake what they had done with the sacks; he said they had slung them away at St. Giles's stocks; we went there, but could not find them.

            . I was one that loaded the waggon. He confirmed the testimony of the former.</p>
               <p>- Smith. I am the man that sold the soot to the person, of whom the prosecutor bought it; these two witnesses came to me; I went and look'd at the soot as it lay, and found it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you know it by?</p>
               <p>Smith. I had swept a smith's chimney, and that is quite different soot from others; and also there was some dust of a corkcutter. By what I saw of these, I can swear it is the same soot. I went to the prisoners in the Roundhouse, and Blake there said, after I gave-them some gin, that he was as deep in it as Williams, for he rolled the sacks out of the waggon upon Williams's back. The prisoners denied knowing any thing of the affair.</p>

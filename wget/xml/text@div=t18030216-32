            : All that I know is that I was sent for to go to Guildhall, to identify the property, which I did.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PUCKERIDGE sworn. - I am a carver and gilder: On the 26th of January, I was standing at my door in Hosier-lane, Smithfield, I saw the two prisoners following a cart; four doors above our's, I saw the prisoner, Hokeway, jump into the cart, take a parcel up, and give it to the other prisoner; I gave the alarm of stop thief! they were pursued into Smithfield, and I saw the prisoner, Stokes, drop the parcel; I did not lose sight of them, only as they turned the corner, till he dropped it; I took up the parcel, and carried it to the carman; they were pursued by others; they were brought back in the course of five minutes, Stokes to the George-inn, Smithfield, and the other to the Compter; I saw them both, and knew them to be the men.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BRENT sworn. - I am carman to Messrs. Hansons, in Holborn: On Tuesday, the 25th of January, about twelve o'clock, I had several chests of tea in a cart, nine or ten, I believe, and a truss in a bag; I was going with it from Messrs.

               <p>Q. Did you see either of them near your cart?- A. No, not till they were brought back to me. The property was brought to the George, and delivered to me by Puckeridge; I gave it to the officer, Chalice; it was in the same state as when I lost it.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure they were the persons you had seen before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the parcel if you were to see it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CHALICE sworn. - I am the patrol belonging to St. Sepulchre's; I produce the wrapper; I had it from the carman; I have kept it from that time to this: On the 25th of January, about twelve o'clock, I was at the top of Giltspur-street, going into Smithfield; I heard the last witness give the alarm of stop thief after the two prisoners; they went through the Hospital-yard; I was near the gate when they went in; I followed across the yard and Little Britain into Bartholomew-close; they were taken in Bartholomewclose; I took Hokeway myself, and took him to the Computer; I saw the other taken; he was carried to the George, in Smithfield.</p>
               <p> - GRAHAM sworn. - I was sent for to take charge of the prisoners.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Chalice.) Did you take that wrapper to the Alderman? - A. Yes; Mr. Hanson saw it there, and opened it.</p>
               <p>Stokes's defence. I know nothing of the business whatever: there were a parcel of people running in Smithfield; I ran as well as they.</p>
               <p>Hokeway's defence. I heard the cry of, stop thief; a gentleman stopped Stokes, and said he was one of them; another person stopped me, and said I was one; I asked him what he had against me; he said he did not know.</p>

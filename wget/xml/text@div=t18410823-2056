                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop in Middlesex-street, Somers'-town. About twenty minutes after four o'clock, on the 22nd of July, the prisoner called at my house to inquire if there was a tap-room—he was told not—he went away, and soon after two other persons called in, and one of them let in the prisoner—I heard somebody going up stairs—the other two were going to run away when I came from my parlour to see what was the mat<lb></lb>ter—I seized them—my wife went and found the prisoner on the stairs—I seized him and gave him in charge—I saw the policeman take this watch</p>

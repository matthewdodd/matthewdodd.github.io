            . I am an officer of St. Sepulchre's. On the 7th of October I was coming down the City-road with Keys, just as Westley's chapel was over. I heard a noise made, which is a signal among thieves. I looked across and saw seven or eight lads running after a gentleman - the prisoners were two of them. I had noticed Hendley two or three times before - he was always at the head of the boys. He tried a gentleman's pocket, the gentleman felt it, and followed them up and down the pavement to watch them. I saw them attempt several pockets, and by Chiswell-street the prisoners parted from the rest, and followed a lady and gentleman down <placeName id="t18211024-75-crimeloc436">Finsbury-place</placeName>

I saw Foxon receive a handkerchief from Hendley, and put it into his jacket pocket. I went up and took it out of his hand; it was this handkerchief - I am sure it is what they took from the gentleman's pocket, for I did not lose sight of it. They crossed and went down by Lackington's, and each stood up in a different doorway, I took Foxon and Keys took Hendley. I could not find the gentleman, or I should have lost the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. You could have called out - A. I was afraid of losing them, they had got two or three hundred yards before we took them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You could not see what was taken from the pocket - A. Not till I saw the handkerchief go from one to the other. There were a great many people in the street. I am a constable of St. Sepulchre's - I was here two nights ago as a witness. Keys and I had been to Islington.</p>

               <p>HENDLEY'S Defence. I was crossing the road - this lad took out his handkerchief to use it - I went to a door for a necessary purpose - They came and took me. Foxon said the handkerchief was his own.</p>
               <p>FOXON'S Defence. I was using my handkerchief, they took hold of me, and said "What have you got?" and called out "Chio! lay hold of the little one."</p>

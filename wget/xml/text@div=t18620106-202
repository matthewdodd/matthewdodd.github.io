                  </hi>. I live at 51, Union-row, Horsemonger-lane, and am a publican, but have retired from the business at present—on 26th December I was at the public-house of a friend at St. Andrew's-road, Newington—the prisoner and another man were there when I returned from the kitchen where I had been—they were using very bad language before the bar—the landlord was not in the way—the landlady called upon them to be quiet—they used worse language, and I walked away into, the parlour—the language was so bad that I went back, and said, "Pay a little respect to the females, the landlord is away"—they said, "If the landlord was here what would he do I" and asked me if I was landlord what I would do—I said, "I should turn you out"—the prisoner rushed at me, and struck me—I laid hold of his collar and shoved him out; and a gentleman pushed the other two out, and then one of the others rushed in and struck me—I went out after him and he went away—I did not pursue him—I said, "I do not mind my hat being broken, I will forego that to keep quiet"—I did not touch him; but as I returned to the house, another one, not the prisoner, rushed at me to stirke me; but I caught his head under my arm, and while I had him so the prisoner, who was in the middle of the road, rushed at me—I did not know he had a knife, because it was dark, it was half-past 6—he <hi rend="italic">dabbed</hi> at me twice; but I did not know I was stabbed—he did not hit me hard, because I did not feel the blow—it was not hard enough to bleed my nose—I was within two or three yards of a lamp—I afterwards found blood streaming from the side of my nose, and from a wound under my neck—I went into the kitchen and bathed it; but could not stop it for some time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Dr. Evan of High-street, Borough—I saw the last witness—off the night of 26th November at Stone's-end police-station—I found two wounds, one on his nose and the other in his throat by the jaw-bone—they were not bleeding then—they were clear cut wounds, apparently inflicted by some sharp instrument—I was shown a knife with blood upon it—tire wound on the nose was about two inches long and about an inch deep, penetrating nearly to the other side of the angle—it went through the cartilaginous part—his nose is an inch wide—I put the probe through it—I saw him at twenty minuses to 8—the wounds were very likely to have been inflicted by the knife I saw.</p>

I am a broker living at St. Andrew's-road—on the night of 26th December between 6 and 7 o'clock, I saw the prisoner and two other men kicking up a noise in the middle of the street—there was a lot of people round them, and I went out and tried to get the away, knowing Storey—when I get them down a street, I heard them say that they had given it to Mr. Powell; that they had pricked him—I do not know which it was; it was one of the three—I afterwards went to the William the Fourth public-house, and there saw Mr. Powell, standing before the bar, bleeding.</p>

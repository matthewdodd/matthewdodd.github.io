                  </hi> I keep the Queen Bess beer-shop, at 15 Harrow-road in the parish of Paddington. I know the prisoners—on Saturday night, 27th Nov., they were in my skittle-ground—they left about half-past eleven—I shut up at twelve—the skittle-ground adjoins part of my house—it is roofed in—there is a window opening from it to the yard of the next home, No. 16—that window was closed that night by myself, and all the does were closed—I was the last person up—I was alarmed by the police between two and three o'clock in the morning—I came down, and found a square of glass had been taken out of the bar-window, which separates that bar from the tap room, and placed on the tap-room table; and work-box, which had been looked and standing on the side-board, just inside, within reach of the window, was in the tap-room, broken open.</p>

I was on duty in Harrow-road, about twenty minutes before three o'clock on Sunday morning, 28th Nov.—I saw a light over the door of the prosecutor's beer-shop—I crossed to the door—it has a large key-hole, I could put my three fingers in it—saw three persons pass the key-hole, and I heard a noise of a door open and some persons run down the skittle-ground—I knocked at the door, and sprang my rattle—I went</p>

               <p>to the corner of White Lion-place and heard three persons drop from the win<lb></lb>dow, one after another—part of the yard of 16 comes to the back of 15—I could not see the yard of 15, the wall is too high—I went to Vine-passage, and sprang my rattle all the way—when I got there, I was getting over the fence of 19, and Smith got out from under the fence, and got to 18—it is a wooden fence, between 18 and 19, about four feet six inches high—I searched the yard of 19, and found Brannan and Baver-stock close crouched by the water-butt—I drew my staff, and said, "If either of you move I will knock you down"—two other officers came up and took them—Smith had gone to 18—I searched that and the other yards, but in my hurry I missed Smith—I went into the beer-shop—I could not find him there—I found this work-box and this square of glass on the tap-room table—I came back and found Smith crouched down against the kitchen-window in the yard of 18—there is only one square of glass and a small hole to give light, and there he was crouched down, with a dirty white slop on—I called to him to came out—he said if there were only two of us he would nor go—I took him—I found on Baverstock this knife, with some putty on the end of it, which exactly corresponds in colour with the putty round this square of glass—I found on Smith this medal—he said, "Be careful, it is a half-so<lb></lb>vereign"—I thought it was so by the gas-light, but as I put it down on the table I found it was a medal—I came back to the premises and saw the ser<lb></lb>jeant pick up a shilling, a half-crown, and a sixpence, not a yard from where the prisoners had first been, in the yard of 19, Vine-passage—the money was on the other side the fence, between where Smith was crouching and the water-butt.</p>

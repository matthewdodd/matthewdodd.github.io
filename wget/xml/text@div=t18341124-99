                  </hi>. I am a hair-dresser. I keep fowls in a mews—on Sunday, the 9th of November, I found my shed broken open, and missed one fowl—I then tied up the shed, and intended to destroy my other fowls in the evening; but in the evening they were gone—I was telling my suspicions to a man in the mews, and he said that Baker had been asking him for some corn—the next morning I saw Baker and two other boys come out of the mews—I went and asked Mrs. Baker to let me look at the fowls which were in her cellar—I then went down and saw my cock, which had its head cut off, and was picked clean—I then found my hen and the other fowls—I got the officer, who came and took the fowls and the prisoner—he came over to me, began to cry, and said a boy gave him the fowls in Cumberland-street, that he did not know it was my cock, but he knew it was my hen—his mother came out and whispered to him, and he said no more.</p>

On the 12th of October, or the morning of the 13th, two barrels were taken from the wharf; when I came in the morning a notice was given that the Police had stopped a person with two barrels - I went and saw them; they had the same marks on them, and I believe were the same that were missed from the wharf.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was going round at half-past one o'clock on the morning of the 13th of October; I saw the prisoner on Messrs. Price's wharf - he put a barrel of tar into a boat; I went and told him to bring his boat too, but he pushed off - I sprang my rattle; he hung down his head, and pulled off till he got one-third across the river - he then let the boat that had the tar in it drift against a lighter; the Police-boat came up - I said, "Go, and take that boat;" they went and took the prisoner, and then brought Mr. Dawson's boat, which had the tar in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you spoken to the man? A. No - I could not know his voice; I had seen him on my beat - I saw his face when he was putting the barrel into the boat; it was very moonlight - I did not see any other boats moving.</p>

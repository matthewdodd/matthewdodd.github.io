                  </hi>. I am a detective officer—on 10th November I went to 5, Sidney-street, Goswell-road, occupied by Miss Harriet Morton—in consequence of instructions I had received, I searched the first floor front room, and found some ostrich-feathers—I took possession of them—I put them into this box, marked D (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Miss Morton saw me find them in a drawer, and take the property away—on the same evening I went to Mr. De Pinna's premises in Little Britain, where the prisoner is employed—I told the prisoner that I had a party of the name of Morton in custody for robbing his master (<hi rend="italic">seepage</hi> 100)—I said, "On searching Morton's house I found a quantity of feathers, those which I show you. Miss Morton told me that you had brought them there"—he said, "I have taken feathers there, and I bought them"—he did not say of whom, but he added, "And here is the receipt"—he then produced this paper, which he took out of a port<lb></lb>monnaie—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "London, October 16th, 1863.

I live at No. 3, Sidney-street, Goswell-road, with my aunt—my cousin, George Morton, lived there—he was in the service of Mr. De Pinna, of Fore-street—I know the young man at the bar—he was in the service of Joshua De Pinna, of Little Britain—I remember the officer coming and finding the feathers in that box marked D—George Stratford brought those feathers in a raw state to Sidney-street—I cannot tell exactly how long ago—it may be about three weeks before the officer came—some of them have been since dyed—he dyed a part at our house, and took home part and dyed at his own house, and then he brought others—he did not bring them all at once—he brought them at separate times; but those that were in a raw state he brought together.</p>

I am a feather-manufacturer, carrying on business at No. 80, Little Britain—the lad at the bar has been in my employment about eighteen months—I don't know his age exactly; I never inquired—about 10th November, the officer Moleyneux brought to me that box of feathers marked D—I have since examined those feathers—there are two kinds of feathers in that box, vulture feathers and ostrich feathers—these are small ostrich feathers, and those are vulture feathers—they are all dyed—I identify both, the vulture and the ostrich feathers, as my property—I</p>

               <p>saw them at my own place about three or four weeks previous to the 10th November, I should say—when they were brought to me I knew they were my own feathers—when I last saw them at my own place, previous to the officer bringing them to me, they were not dyed—they have been dyed since—when they were taken from my place of business some of them were sewn, and some of them were curled.</p>

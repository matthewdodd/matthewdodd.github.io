This copper was safely fixed in my cellar floor on the 9th of April, at night, and about seven o'clock next evening a gentleman gave me information - I found it was gone; I found it in the officer's possession next morning, and saw it fitted to the place - my door is kept shut, but opens by a drop latch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q.What sort of a copper was it? A. It had a particular roughness on the edge.</p>
               <p>JAMES GLIBBERY. I am a Policeman. On the 10th of April, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I apprehended the prisoner in the Old Bailey, with this copper, wrapped in green baize; I asked what he had got there - he said, a copper, which some man had given him to carry, and he was to meet the man in Goswell-street; I took him to the Compter, and then he said he did not know where he was carrying it to, nor where he got it - I found out Woodbridge, and compared the copper at her place; it fitted the brickwork exactly - I am convinced it came from there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was walking along - I suppose? A. Yes; I suspected him from his manner.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HERITAGE. I am an assistant-clerk at Worship-street. On the 10th of April, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was passing the prosecutrix's shop; I observed the prisoner, with another man, come out of the private door - the prisoner had something on his shoulder in green baize; the other shut the door very quietly, which caused my suspicion, as he crossed, and the prisoner kept on the same side - I followed them to the Old Bailey, and gave Glibbery information; the prisoner said a man, who he met in the street, gave him 6d. to carry it: I said I had seen him bring it out of a house; he said he had not been in any house.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH BODY. I lodge at the prosecutrix's - I have used this copper for eight years; I am positive of it - I heard no noise in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are there more lodgers? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was accosted by a man in Fleet-lane, who asked me to carry the copper to Percival-street, to a Mr. Wright - I showed the Policeman the man, who stood at the corner of the court for three minutes, and then walked away.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You are sure you saw Gauntlett? A. Yes: I saw his face - the other man had his hat over his eyes, and I am certain sure it was a shorter man - it was about a quarter before six o'clock.</p>

             and the prisoner in Mr. Gee's yard - they had a quantity of quartering in their arms, and carried it to an open space between two buildings, and threw it over a wall where two gardens adjoin - I was in Gee's employ, and the prisoner was in his employ the day before, and I did not know that he had left - it was a few minutes before, or rather after six o'clock - I should say it was thrown into the prisoner's ground - because his garden adjoins Gee's premises I have been looking out for the prisoner since that time - I have since seen him at Kingston, which is just across the Thames - they both had their arms full of boarding.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to give information? A. I did not wish to hurt any poor man like myself - if they had left off where they began, it would not have mattered; but the prosecutor complained of losing property from time to time - and in about three weeks I gave information, as master had constantly complained to me, and that morning in particular, he said he had been robbed of new deals - he insinuated that I might know something about it - he asked where Keach was - he was absent.</p>

            . I was with Wilson and Keach on the morning of the 30th of October - I saw Edward Sawford and William Gauntlett coming from the building (the saw-pit,) with a bundle of quartering under each arm - I cannot say whether they put it down by the wall or threw it over - they then went back and brought some weatherboarding - I went into the carpenter's shop and saw no more, as I went to get some tools - I mentioned it in about three weeks - I was not charged with stealing anything.</p>

            . Tilts was not likely to see the property thrown over the wall - I am altering some sheds into a small house; these men were assisting me, and pulled down the quartering - on the following day I missed the quartering and did not find it - Tilts could not see it thrown over the wall where he was, as he was in the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of Messrs. Baker, of Newgate-market, On 24th May I was taken into custody for stealing meat from them—the prisoner was their foreman—on the morning of 3d May I was in the shop, boneing a brisket of beef—the prisoner told me to put that aside, and to bone another one which he wanted for himself—I boned that, and he put it on one side with some more meat for himself, and when Mr. Baker was gone, he put it amongst some meat going to the Model Prison—he did not weigh it—the meat for the Model Prison had been weighed and set aside before that—he hid this beef away under some meat—I saw him get into the cart and drive away—it was his duty to take meat every morning to the Model Prison.</p>

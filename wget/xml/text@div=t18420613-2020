                  </hi>. I live in Little Canterbury-place, Lambeth. On the 3rd of June the prisoner came to my house with a cask of wine and some fur<lb></lb>niture—he charged 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the carriage—we had a dispute about its being more than it ought to be—I paid him the 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said I should give him a</p>

               <p>note to say that it was too much—he said he would take the things back—he threw the money on the table—I wrote the memorandum in his book, and during that time he took up the 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and two half crowns, two shillings, and a sixpence besides, which laid on the table—there was no pretence for saying that was part of his moneys—he only demanded 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was finishing a letter—there were letters on the table—I said to my servant, "Is the man gone?"—she looked through the window and said, "He is gone"—I am sure the two half-crowns and two shilling, and sixpence had been on the table—the money I gave the prisoner was a half-sovereign, a five-shilling-piece, and two half-crowns—that was a my left hand, and the other money on my right hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Pickfords. I remember Elisabeth Smith coming to the wharf on the evening in question—she told me her brother had paid 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. instead of 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by mistake, and she wished to see the prisoner, in order that she might arrange it with him—I said he was not there then, and told her at what time he would be there——she said," I suppose I must depend on the man"; honesty and recollec<lb></lb>tion for the purpose of repaying the money"—I said, "No; if we are satisfied he has received more than he ought, I will take care the matter shall beset right"—I did not in any way endeavour to secrete the prisoner, or get him out of the way—the firm would not sanction any thing of the kind—he has been three years and a half in their employ, and is a man of honesty and merit, and has given satisfaction in every way.</p>

               <p>Are you married or a single man? - A single man. I was coming home from my work on this day sen'night at night between<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220019"></xptr> ten and eleven o'clock. I went to a publick-house, the George, at the top of St. John's-street, which is a house I generally use. I left the George a little after ten o'clock. I was coming home, I met the prisoner in the street, near Hicks's-hall; she laid hold of me by the arm and asked me if I would take a walk and see her safe home.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - No; I was a little in liquor; I said I would go and see her safe home. I was rather in liquor, but was not drunk.</p>
               <p>Where did you carry her to? - She carried me to her apartments in <placeName id="t17810222-11-crimeloc57">Moffet's-court, Turnbull-street</placeName>

               <p>Was there a candle lighted? - Yes; there was a candle upon the table in the room when we went in.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay there? - Between three and four minutes. I did nothing to her. I sat down by her side upon the bed; she saw the chain of my watch she gave a pull at it and pulled my watch out and ran down stairs.</p>
               <p>You felt that? - Yes; I ran after her but could not catch her.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner was the girl? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you particularly observed her face? - Yes I had.</p>
               <p>You was sitting down upon the bed by her? - I was.</p>
               <p>When did you see her again? - Not till she was taken, which was three or four days after. Another girl her partner took my handkerchief off my neck and ran down the court with it; that girl was at the door, and she took off my handkerchief as I was going up with the prisoner; the prisoner said, I know the girl, I will get you your handkerchief again.</p>
               <p>So they robbed you as you was going in of your handkerchief, and when you got in of your watch? - Yes; the prisoner had not been gone above five minutes before a man came up and said he was her husband. He was a drover in Smithfield; he banged me about; I could not get hold of him, if I could I would have secured him. I said to myself, this is very good fun to be beat and lose my watch too.</p>
               <p>Where did you first see the prisoner again? - I took two of Justice Blackborough's runners with me, and we found her in the same apartments. This was the 9th I took her on the 15th.</p>
               <p>Have you recovered your watch again? - No; I have not got a halfpenny worth.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>He took up another girl instead of me, and swore at the justice's that she had got his watch and his two handkerchiefs; the girl came up for another hearing, he did not come up to appear against her so the girl was cleared; then he took me up I never set eyes on him.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. Did you charge another girl with it? - Only the girl who took my handkerchief; I charged her with taking the handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Are you sure you never charged the other girl with taking the watch? - No; only the handkerchief?</p>

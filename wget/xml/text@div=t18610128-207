                  </hi>. On the night of Christmas-day last, I was a servant at Mr. Thomas' coffee-house, in Woolwich—I left last Saturday—about 10 o'clock that night three marines, and Patrick O'Brien, a sailor, came into our shop—I can only swear to Smith and Jones, of the three marines—I did not see a fourth marine in the coffee-house—I did when I went to put the shutters up—they had supper, and the sailor paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I did. not see him have any other money—I did not receive the money from him to pay for it—I did not see it pass at all—I saw my master take the money to my <hi rend="italic">missus</hi>, and she said that it was not enough, that it was only 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he took it back to the man and asked him for another 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—no one asked for change for a half-sovereign—I did not see a half-sovereign, or any half-crowns—nothing was said about a half-crown—they all went out together about half-past 10 or a quarter to 11, as near as I can guess—I saw altogether four marines and the sailor—I was examined before the Magistrate—I do not recollect anything about a half-sovereign, more than the sailor gave my <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> a half-sovereign to make up 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and she said, "Have you no less than this to give me?"—upon that, Smith said, "You need not frighten yourself missus; I don't suppose it is the first half-sovereign the man has had."</p>

                  </hi>, I am a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Cumberland</hi>—I was at Sheerness on the night of 24th December—on the morning of Christmas-day I was in Woolwich—I came there on the 24th, and slept there at the house of a man named Jones, a civilian—I had my breakfast in the morning, not with Jones—there were two people in the house—I know the prisoner Jones—the first time that I met Smith on the Christmas-day, was early in the afternoon—I first met Jones at night; it must have been about 8 or 9 o'clock, at the Waterman's-hall, I believe they call it—he asked me to have a game at twenty-fives—we played a game, and I won—I cannot tell who was present then—there were two Jones's—I left that house—Smith and Hudson went with me—they locked arms with me going out—Jones was not, to my knowledge, the first marine there—he was in the house, but whether he was at this time, I cannot say—three left the house, but those two are the only two I can swear to—I changed a sovereign in the Water-man' shall—Smith told me to put the half-sovereign away, and not to put it in my pocket with the rest of the money—I had no quarrel in that public-house—I remember going to the coffee-shop of Mr. Thomas, and having supper—I cannot say what o'clock that was—I think it must have been past 10—three marines went there with me—I firmly believe that Hudson and Smith never let go of me—we went into another house before this coffee-shop—I do not know the third one that went into Thomas's, another man, joined us, and went backwards and forwards while we were having our supper—something was said about a crack, in the first part of the afternoon, when I met Smith—Smith and I left Jones and went together into a house called the Punch Bowl—Jones came out very soon after—he went for a glass of beer—while he was gone for it, Smith whispered to me, "I don't like what that fellow says; 'he whispered in my ear to give you a crack "—I said, "I am very doubtful of that, for I have known Jones a good while and have always found him a manly sort of chap"—I believe there were four of them when we came out of the coffee-shop, and I felt jaded—I said, "I can't get back to Sheerness to-night, and I should like you to show me a lodging as close to the railway as possible;" and they said, "All right"—we went a little further, and I found that two were holding me, but I cannot say which they were—they were feeling about my pocket—I said, "What do you mean, men?"—Smith got his hand into my pocket—I said to him, "After my treatment, is that how you are going to serve me?" and, to the best of my knowledge, he said, "Yes"—then we had a scuffle and they knocked me down—I do not know which knocked me down—there were four present at the time—I recognize Hudson smith, nobody else—I was in good sense—one of them said, "Hold his head up;" and then I expected a blow, and I shut my eyes—I received the blow, and then some-one said, "That's done him;" or "done for him"—I cannot swear to the words—when I recovered a little I lifted my head, and they were coming towards me—I recognised Smith—I said, "Smith, you villain, you nearly murdered me"—I did not know who was taking me to the hospital—the next thing I knew was I found myself in the hospital—I was not quite certain the next day, where I was—I am sure I had a half-sovereign in my pocket while I was at the cook-shop—I am quite sure of that, because when the Magistrate came to me he asked the question, when I changed the sovereign, did I have any gold—I said that I changed a sovereign and had a half-sovereign in gold, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and some coppers—I gave a half-sovereign to the woman at the cook-shop—she gave me four half-crowns for it, and I paid for the supper with one of the half-crowns—when I came out of the</p>

I am the brother of the last witness, and live at 25, Montgrant-square—on the night of Christmas-day last, I was having my supper at a little after 11 o'clock, and I heard very heavy screams of "Murder!"—I hastened from the table without cap or coat, and went to see what was the matter—when I got out I saw those marines beating the sailor O'Brien—the sailor lay down, and I saw Smith take some money in his hand, put it in his pocket, and then get up and strike the man with his fist—the sailor fell, and after that Smith gave him a kick—after that, Wren kicked the man, and said, "Come on, he's done"—I got away from the ground, not having a coat or cap, and went up to where I lived, for fear of being locked up myself—I stood at the top of the square—Smith and Wren came up against me, and Smith said to Wren, "Come on, you by fool, I have got it f he also said, "I think he's done—there were two carts in the square, and a lot of shells and stones lying in the square—Wren stooped down and picked up one—I cannot say whether it was a stone or a shell—I hastened in-doors—I am sure it was Wren—I had known him before, I cannot say how long, but he has been drinking in my company before.</p>

The prosecutor does not swear to me; he states that he was sober, and if so, he must be able to swear to me; then the other witnesses cannot swear that they saw me in his company; the next witness swears that, at the time of the assault being committed, he was sitting in his own house, which be says was about two hundred yards off; that he ran to the place, and saw two men in the act of kicking the man; he says that I am one of the party, that he knows me well, through being in my company in some public-house; when I asked him how long it was since he saw me before, he said before Christmas, and he cannot tell me whether it was a week, two months, three months, or six months; if he was in my company so often as he swears he was, he must be able to tell the truth; the other witness states that there-were four marines, and he stated at the Greenwich police-court that there were only two; then the woman</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186101280086"></xptr>
               <p>says she saw four marines run past her house, and identifies one of them; how can she swear that I am one of them? there is a Mr. Thomas that swears I was in his eating-house about 10 o'clock, and the landlord of Uncle Tom's Cabin swears that I came into his house about that time; it is for you to judge whether I could be in the two houses at the same time; the man that keeps the eating-house says that I had a hat and tunic on;' the sergeant can prove that I was never served out with a tunic; between all the witnesses they swear that there were four different men that kicked the man; if so, there must have been four different marks, but the doctor states there was only one cut, over the eye; you will find that not one witness corresponds with the others, and I hope and trust you will do justice between me and them, as I am innocent of the charge laid against me.</p>

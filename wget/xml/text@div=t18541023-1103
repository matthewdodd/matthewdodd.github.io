                  </hi>. I am single.

                  </hi>. I am colour sergeant, in the service of the East India Company. About a quarter before 12 o'clock, on 25th Sept, I was on the City side of London-bridge; I saw some persons looking at some por<lb></lb>traits, and some coppers fell at my feet—I saw the prisoner by the side of the lady, and the handkerchief was in his hand; the coppers fell to the ground—he ran off; I followed and took him—he struck me violently, and kicked me in the groin and legs, I feel it now, and he called me all manner of names—I said I would keep him till a policeman came.</p>

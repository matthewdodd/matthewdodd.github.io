               <p>Skinner-street—on the afternoon of 17th May, the prisoner came and called for half a quartern of gin and some hot water—I served him and be put down a bad shilling—I tried it and bent it double—I told him it was bad, and asked him if he had got any more—he then seemed to be very drunk, and I went round to him and said to him "Have you got any more?—he gave me another shilling; I gave it to my wife, she tried it and it was bad—I asked the prisoner if he had any more and he pulled out a good sixpence—my wife gave him 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I gave him both the shil<lb></lb>lings back—I went out and got a policeman—the prisoner was then outside the door going away—I followed him to the station, and at the station two bad shillings were produced—I could not swear that they were the same that he had offered to me; they were very much like them.</p>

I lent some money to a young man; I pressed him for payment, and he paid me—I suppose it might be bad; I don't know how the coins came in my hat.</p>

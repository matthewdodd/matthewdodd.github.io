               <p>Q. What time was it. - About a quarter past six in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in the house. - Yes, some Lodgers; he broke in through the windows with some iron crow.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he broke in. - Because I saw the windows were smashed all to pieces, it was a back window which was nailed up.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people live in your house. - Four or five.</p>
               <p>Q. It was after dark? - Yes, it had been dark an hour and half; he came out of the window, the door was locked; I was close to him just at the door; I do not know the Prisoner, the passage he was coming out of, goes into the Court; he had got the rug under his arm, he set off running and threw the rug down in the street; I ran after him, overtook him immediately; I had him by the collar, and took up the rug.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing missing? - Nothing but these articles, a bolster, sheet, blanket, and rug, he had only the rug, the others have not been found; I had been in the room half an hour before, and all the things were then there.</p>

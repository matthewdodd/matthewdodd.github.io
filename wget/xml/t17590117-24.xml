               <p>Q. Was you asleep or awake when he went to bed?</p>
               <p>Holding. I was asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how do you know what time he went to bed.</p>
               <p>Holding. That I had from our boy; I went up stairs, and said, Who has play'd the rogue with the buckles? the boy said, Samuel has taken the buckles out of Mistress's shoes, and said, Samuel said he was not going to steal them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you and your mistress drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Holding. We were all very sober.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you both to fall asleep?</p>
               <p>Holding. We fell asleep being tired.</p>

               <p>Q. to Carter. Did you take that liberty with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Carter. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he laugh, and say afterwards, it way only a joke.</p>
               <p>Carter. He did, and he intended to give me them again.</p>

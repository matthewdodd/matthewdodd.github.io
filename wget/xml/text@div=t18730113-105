I keep a general shop in Broadway, Westminster—the prisoner was in the habit of dealing with me—he came on 8th December, about 8 o'clock in the evening—he asked for a halfpenny candle, and a halfpenny worth of tea and gave me a sovereign in payment—he said "It is a good one"—I gave him the change and put the sovereign in a little wooden bowl by itself when he left—I kept it by itself till the next morning—I then looked at it and found it was bad—I gave it to the constable at the station in Clinch's presence—I went to the Feathers public-house with Clinch and pointed out the prisoner—I gave the prisoner 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper in change for the sovereign—they were all good—he had been a customer about three weeks.</p>

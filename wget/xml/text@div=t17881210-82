               <p>On the 1st of November, about seven o'clock in the evening, I and my man were in the shop, the door was then shut, and upon the latch; the prisoner, Bockerah, came, and he then put his hand in at the door, after having unlatched it, he and two or more persons rushed in and took away a piece of velveteen; there were, I believe, two more of them; I only saw their hats; I am sure Bockerah was one; he held the door quite open with his hand, and seemed to stand between me and the velveteen, so as to keep me from seeing him; he asked for a halfpenny worth of thread; he put his hand in his pocket and rattled some halfpence, and said he did not know whether he had enough to pay for what he wanted; then they took the velveteen and ran away; I did not see which way; Bockerah shut the door, and I could not get round the counter fast enough, before they went out; we took Bockerah into custody; Bockerah stood between the other men and me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat, prisoner's counsel. How far was you from the door at the time? - About four yards.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the door was latched? - Yes, I am sure, because it goes with a spring.</p>
               <p>Did you look particularly at the door yourself? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. When Bockerah came in, did you perceive him open the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. What did he say he wanted when he came in? - He said a halfpenny worth of brown thread.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing to the other two? - No.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Then after the other two went out, he staid to get his thread? - I believe he staid to keep me in.</p>
               <p>You told me this moment he shut himself in; how long did he take to shut the door? - Not long, he could not get out himself, I followed him so close.</p>

               <p>I was servant to Mr. Pinkinton: between seven and eight, the first of November, the prisoner came in with the view of the purchase of a small commodity; the door was upon the latch; he opened the latch.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Positive of that.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body else so as to know them again? - No, I could not; I stopped Bockerah immediately.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the other prisoner, to your own knowledge? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Did you observe whether the person that went out last, shut the door? - Yes, I am positive it was shut; I was behind the counter, and took particular notice of it.</p>
               <p>Was your eye upon the door the moment the latch was lifted, if opened at all? - Certainly; the door was upon the latch when he opened it.</p>
               <p>Was your eye upon the latch when the latch rose, if it rose at all? - It was upon the door.</p>
               <p>Was it upon the latch? - Certainly it was, at the closure of the door.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the latch lift? - I heard the door open; it was opened as soon as possible.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the latch lift? - I did not positively hear it, because he opened it softly.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that the door was latched at the time he came? - I am positive of it, upon my oath.</p>

On 2nd March, about 1.15 a.m., I was on duty in Victoria Street—I heard cries of "Stop thief!" and saw the prisoner running and a soldier running after him—they ran down New Pye Street into Old Pye Street, where he was stopped by the soldier—a boy who was dressed in a kind of blue flannel shirt and a pair of light trousers with a stripe, and his shirt sleeves turned up, was running with the soldier—the soldier gave the prisoner in charge to me—the prisoner said that he did not see why the soldier should hold him when I had got him in custody—I told him to let go, and he then turned on the boy—I had got him by the left hand, and he struck the boy with his right on the side of his head—I could not exactly see whereabouts—he staggered, but I cannot say whether he fell, because the prisoner commenced kicking me—he kicked me twice or three times on my legs, and made three or four kicks at my groin—it took four of us besides myself to take him to the station, and he threw two constables down—we had great difficulty, and had to carry him face downwards.</p>

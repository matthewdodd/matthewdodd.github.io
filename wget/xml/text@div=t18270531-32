On the 21st of May both the prisoners came into the shop, at a quarter-past 8 o'clock in the morning; I did not know them before - they asked to look at some cotton braces, which I showed them - they objected to the first parcel, but selected a pair from the second which I showed them - there were no handkerchiefs within their reach - they then asked to look at some stockings - I showed them some which were too large - I turned round to look for some others, and saw George Wilson pulling aside the glass sash, which protects the goods in the window - he was then near enough to reach the handkerchiefs - I watched him - Thompson stood close by him - I turned round, and saw another sash was drawn aside - there are three sash slides which separate the goods in the window from the shop- I then perceived that the handkerchiefs were gone - a boy had followed the prisoners into the shop almost immediately they came in, and before I observed the slides drawn aside - the boy did not speak to them, but went away before I missed the handkerchiefs - I did not know him - the handkerchiefs were tied up in a bundle - when I perceived that they were gone, I accused the prisoners of being concerned with that boy - they denied it - I am certain George Wilson drew the slide aside - I had not perceived it drawn aside before the boy came in - he stood behind the prisoners, and could not have drawn the handkerchiefs out himself - he was not tall enough to reach them - he could have drawn the glass partition aside, but could not reach the handkerchiefs out - I did not see him attempt to touch it, but I saw Wilson doing it - the handkerchiefs have never been found - they are worth about 5l. - I detained the prisoners, and sent for a constable - I gave them in charge - they only said that they were innocent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Were you the only person in the shop? A. Yes; they did not attempt to go away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did your mistress come down directly after? A. Just as I missed the handkerchiefs; I asked her, in a hurried manner, if she had taken the handkerchiefs away, as I was confounded at missing them - I had seem them just before the prisoners came in, but I was much flurried on missing them; there was a chair between the prisoners and the window, and the counter parted me from the prisoners - it is not a yard wide - the handkerchiefs being taken would make no difference in the shade of light, as they did not hang up, but laid in a corner of the window, in a bundle - my back must have been turned when they took them - I asked mistress, in a hurried manner, if she had taken them- I was sure she had not, for they were there the minute before, and I missed them before she came down - Thompson bought a pair of braces, which I think came to 1s. 6d.; he put the money down just as I missed the handkerchiefs; I did not take it up; the other boy leaned over the counter, and did not speak; he did not appear connected with the prisoners.</p>
               <p>ELIZA GARTON. I am in partnership with Ann Garton- we rent this house jointly, and both inhabit it - it is No. 97, Cheapside - I was not present when the prisoners came in; when I came into the shop, I observed the two prisoners standing there, and noticed two cases standing open, which contained handkerchiefs and other things - I went to pick up a ticket, which laid on the floor; it had been attached to some Angola hose - I was going round to put the ticket on the counter, when Latimer passed me, and in a very hurried manner, asked if I had taken some silk handkerchiefs out of the window (the boy had left the shop before I came down) I had not taken them, and said so - he accused the prisoner Wilson of moving the case; the handkerchiefs could not be got without moving the case - Wilson said he had not moved it; Latimer then said he was positive they were both connected, and that they were connected with the boy who had gone out of the shop; he accused them both of being concerned in taking the handkerchiefs - they denied it, and a constable was sent for; I had not been in the shop that morning before - I had left the shop at twelve o'clock on Saturday night; this bundle of handkerchiefs was then in the window, with the glass slide secure; I did not particularly notice them, but every thing in the window was even and smooth.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You did not particularly notice the handkerchiefs? A. Yes, I did - my sister is not here; she occasionally serves in the shop; nobody else does, besides Latimer; we both took the house together; nobody is engaged in business with us; it was between eight and nine o'clock - I sent my maid servant for a constable, who came in a very few minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. There was nobody in the shop but your young man? A. No; they heard me send for a constable, but remained quietly till he came; when Latimer spoke to them about the slides, he had come round the counter between them and the door - one constable came first, and said he would send for Smith, another constable; he asked what I knew of it - I said the young man missed a bundle of handkerchiefs from the window, and accused Wilson of moving the slide, and he was positive they were connected with the boy; Thompson asked me if I belonged to the business; I told him I did; they were in the shop three, four, or perhaps five minutes before the constable came.</p>

            . I am a constable, and was sent for. I found the prisoners standing in the shop, Latimer was between them and the door; they were charged with opening the window case, and a third person had come in and stolen the handkerchiefs; I found 35s. on one of them, and 15s. on the other; I took them before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>THOMPSON's Defence. I was coming from my house, in Marsh-place, to go to Whitechapel; and in Cheapside I bought a pair of stockings and braces; I put the money on the counter, and was going out; he asked if any thing else was wanted; I said No; he said, "Here are some good stockings;" and I bought a pair and put the money down; I was accused of the robbery.</p>
               <p>WILSON's Defence. I had been from Mile-end to the West end of the town, and received 12s. 6d.; on returning I went into this shop to buy some shoe-ribbon, but waited for the prisoner to be served; I was accused of pushing the casement back, which I denied.</p>
               <p>J. LATIMER re-examined. They did not ask to look at the handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not usual for persons sometimes to look at a piece of handkerchiefs? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When he drew back the slide, did he say,"I want to look at the handkerchiefs?" A. No; I observed Thompson point out something to Wilson; they came into the shop together.</p>
               <p>One witness gave Wilson a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and reside at No. 3, Bruton-street. The prisoner was in my employ—he came on the 2nd of January, 1837—he was authorised to receive money on my account, and was to pay it over to me on his return—on the 18th of November I sent him to Mr. Rose, of Aylesbury, with clothes—I told him he might as well take the hill—Mr. Rose was generally kind enough to pay his bill when it was sent—it was at Gray's-Inn Coffee-house—he took the bill with the clothes—if he has received the amount he has never paid me—the bill was 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the discount was 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which would make it 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when he came back he said Mr. Rose was busily engaged in preparing to leave town—he had been some time from home, and did not know how his account stood at his banker's—I inferred he had not paid the money—I did not receive the money—I sent another bill on the 2nd of January, and received a letter from Mr. Rose, saying he had paid it—I had a customer of the name of Goodhall—if the prisoner has received any money from him, he has not paid it to me—I had a customer of the name of Smith, about the 4th of October—if he has received 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from him, he has not paid me that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 18, North-street, Sloane-street. The prisoner lived next door to me—I have been in the habit of receiving some money from Newark towards the support of my child, by Post Office orders—I have asked the prisoner to write several letters for me, but on this occasion she wrote on her own behalf—shortly</p>

West; it stated that she had not one penny left, and that her brother was going to send a gentleman down to summon Andrews, for the child's sake</hi>)—I immediately sent for her into my aunt's house, and said, "This is not the letter you wrote; that was thanking for money I have received;" she said, "Yes it is, I have only said a little more, as you are always so easy"—my aunt said, "No, you have done quite enough"—I saw her afterwards, and she said, "Well, Mrs. West, what do you mean to do? I will pay you 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at a time"—I said, "No, I have spoken to those I cannot trifle with"—about the second day after I found it out, the prisoner gave me this letter (<hi rend="italic">This, being read, contained the following</hi>: "Mrs. West, if you knew how wretched I am, you would forgive me, as you know I have not had one night's rest since I so cruelly used you; but pray forgive me; it never happened before, and never shall again. You shall have every penny back again. Edgill has got the promise of work next week, and you shall have 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week till I pay you all Do not say a word to Edgill; for if he knows it, he will nearly kill me")—I did not receive this Post Office order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I signed nothing of this kind—I did not tell the prisoner to sign it for me, I never saw it.</p>

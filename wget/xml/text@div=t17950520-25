            When did you first hire him? - On the 7th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a character with him? - Yes, a twelve month's character, of a Mr. Moggridge, at Turnbridge.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you missed your property, was he still in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you make the discovery of the loss? - On Friday, the 1st of May, the prisoner at the bar and I slept together in the pantry, and I got up a quarter before seven; and the prisoner intreated me to take a walk up the road, as, being May-day, there were many people walking. I went walking with the prisoner; I returned about eight o'clock. The prisoner and I went together in the kitchen, on our return; and after I had returned to my pantry, and cleaned my plates, and the prisoner at the bar assisted me, after that I washed my hands, and set the tea things, and put five tea spoons in a slop bason, and a silver tea strainer, and went to the pantry to cut a slice of bread and butter, the prisoner was in the kitchen the while, I came back to the kitchen, to take the things up into the parlour, and immediately missed the tea spoons from the tea board, from the bason in the parlour; I came down and asked him why he took them out of the bason, to make me come down again for them? (he had before that hid some plate, which I supposed he did it on purpose to vex me) He said he had not. I went up again, to be satisfied I had not overlooked them; and while I was in the parlour, he brought me up eleven tea spoons, and a pair of silver sugar tongs, wrapped up a paper, and said, here are the tea spoons, where you put them yourself, why did you make a noise to me? I said to him, these are not the spoons, John, you know that as well as me.</p>
               <p>Q. You perceived that they were not your mistress's spoons? - Yes, they were my mistress's spoons, but not the same that were missing.</p>
               <p>Q. If I understand you right, you placed these spoons there just before you went into the kitchen, and therefore you are positive that the spoons that he brought you back, were not the same? - Yes, I am positive of it. I returned to the pantry, and opened my closet door, and immediately missed the rest of my things from my tray that I had set them in.</p>
               <p>Q. I see in the indictment that there are six silver spoons, tea spoons? - I missed five out of the bason, and a pair of sugar tongs, and one tea spoon from a cup and and saucer.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned to the pantry, what else did you miss? - Five table spoons, five desert spoons, a gravy spoon, two sauce ladles, and a marrow spoon. When I missed these other spoons, I begged to know what he had done with them; he still denied knowing any thing about them; that he had never touched them; I went up stairs to acquaint my mistress, but she was not up, and I came down again and still intreated to know what he had done with them, not thinking he had stole them, but thinking he had done it to vex me. When my mistress came down she asked him what he had done with the plate? I then sent for a constable and took the prisoner into custody; the constable searched the prisoner, and searched every part of the lower part of the house, and could not find any thing; he was in the house for two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he find any thing about the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any of this property been found? - No, it has not been found.</p>

Accordingly he did, and the constable ordered me to aid and assist, to go along with him to the watch-house, As we were going down to the watch-house, we called at a public house and had a pot of ale and a pot of porter among us; the prisoner he drank two small glasses of ale, and once out of the porter,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200048"></xptr>and then we went down to the watch-house.

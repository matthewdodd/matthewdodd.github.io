               <p>Where were you to take them to? - I was to take them to different places according to the directions.</p>
               <p>You pitched for case, I presume? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Somebody came up and spoke to you for a considerable time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Asked you several questions? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Will you swear positively you never put your hand off during the time the man was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220051"></xptr>talking to you? - Yes, I am sure I had my hand upon them when the man knocked me down.</p>
               <p>How long did the conversation last? - It might be three minutes.</p>
               <p>During the time the conversation took place, was your hand ever off the pitching-block? - No, it was not; when I pitched it down I had my hand on my load, and so it was when I was knocked down.</p>

               <p>You cannot tell who knocked you down? - No.</p>
               <p>Have not you said before the magistrate who knocked you down? - No.</p>
               <p>Have not you said, you thought it was a tall stout man? - Yes, the man to appearance was a tall stout man.</p>
               <p>Have you kept in that opinion down to the present time? - Yes, it was the same man that spoke to me at first.</p>

               <p>You said Mr. Bolton particularly carries on the inn? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a carpenter; I was walking in Fleet-street, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening, on Tuesday the 17th of March, all of a sudden I heard a man halloo out he had lost his load, that very instant a man came up to him, and directed him towards the bar, and told him it was gone that way; I did not know who that man was; and I heard another voice say, he has not gone towards the Bar, he is gone the other way; I knew the voice of the man that said that, and I immediately went that way, and took down Fleet-street; I looked at every window, and in Serjeant's Inn; I then went up Red-lion Court, and through West-harding-street into Fetter-lane, and opposite Roll's Buildings I saw a man carrying a load; I looked at the load, and it appeared to me to be different parcels from an inn, or something of that sort, game; I thought I would be cautions, and I did not speak to the man, but I followed him, I believe for 50 yards; in following him, some man passed me in the highway, and joined this man that had the load.</p>
               <p>Who was the man that had the load, was it the prisoner? - No, Sir, a taller man, I dare say by a head; he joined him, and went up the lane, and went down Plough-court; I called for assistance, and three or four boys going by, I told them, and asked them to go with me; as we were going down they were coming up, and the prisoner at the bar had the load on his head; I seized him by the collar, and he threw it down, immediately some people came, and presently after the constable came and took him into custody.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220052"></xptr>Mr. Knapp. So you followed a tall stout man up Fetter-lane, did you? - I said nothing about a stout man, a tall man, he had a load on his head.</p>
               <p>Then you followed him down Plough-court, and then the bundle was changed? - I suppose so, I did not see it changed, but by the appearance of the size of the man; I look upon it, it was changed down the court, I have no doubt it was the same bundle, it was changed, it must be changed.</p>
               <p>Then it was put upon somebody else's shoulder? - Yes, I took the person that had it on his head.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen that person before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did you see that person on that day before? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You did not see him as he followed the tall man up Fetter-lane? - No, I saw several people follow me, but I could not swear to any of them.</p>
               <p>Supposing this tall man had the parcels on his head, when you took the other man, should you have known his face? - No, I should not, the tall man was out of my sight, and I never saw the other man till he came up from the court; I cannot swear this man was in the lane when they went down the court.</p>
               <p>Supposing there had been no parcels at all on the shoulders of the prisoner, should you then be able to describe him? - No, Sir, I should not, he was a tall man, and when he went down the court he had the bundle on his head; and coming up the short man had the load.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. This is a bill delivered to the porter of the inn with the parcels; and it says,</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Monk, Mount-street," one parcel.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see it taken out of that very parcel that was taken from the prisoner? - I did, two gowns.</p>
               <p>When? - The 18th I delivered the parcel into the porter's hands myself; this parcel was directed to</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Monk, in Mount-street, Grosvenor-square."</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to Basham. You know nothing at all what was contained in these parcels when you received them at the Inn? - No.</p>
               <p>(The paper that had the gowns in handed to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to speak for myself; I wish first of all, if it be agreeable to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220053"></xptr>Court, to have all the witnesses out but the porter.</p>
               <p>(The following questions were handed from the prisoner to Mr. Knapp.)</p>
               <p>To the Porter. How long after the conversation took place was you knocked down? - I cannot justly say, a very little time, indeed.</p>
               <p>How soon did you go home after that time? - I suppose it might be two hours after I went home.</p>
               <p>Why did not you go home direct? - I did not like to go home; I was afraid to go home to my master.</p>
               <p>What sort of a day had this been? - It was a darkish day.</p>
               <p>The streets vastly clean, I suppose? - Not very clean, middling, a dry day.</p>
               <p>Who did you see when you went home? - I went to the publick-house just by our house, and I sent to our ostler, he is not here; then I went home, and my master sent for me.</p>
               <p>Was you hurt by your fall? - No, not stunned, but frightned; I told my master, Mr. Bolton, I had lost all my load.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you? - He seemed to be very little concerned about it.</p>
               <p>He did not blame you? - No great matter.</p>
               <p>You was afraid of losing your place? - Yes, that was more than any thing else.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolton. I saw the porter when he came home, the ostler brought him to me; he was very much flurried; he was afraid to come home.</p>

               <p>His clothes were very dirty? - No, Sir, I do not recollect they were, I took but little notice of him; I immediately set off to No. 3 or 4, a coachman said they were in Duke's Place.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lords, and Gentlemen of the Jury, impressed with the highest sense of candour of your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury; I hope you will not be prejudiced against me because I have stood at this bar once before; I hope that the voice of slander against me will do me no hurt: I was returning from Westminster, and went up Fetter-lane to go towards Moorfields; on my way home I saw some persons turn down a court, it was rather dirty and dark, I mistook it for Bartlett's Buildings; a tall person threw a load down within a few yards of the court; I caught hold of the load, and immediately Mr. Stapleton collared me; I expostulated with him in a manner that I was not the person; he insisted on stopping me 'till he went for a constable; the boys likewise came along; I asked the young men, if they did not see him throw the load down? they said, no; if I must speak, it was a tall man that threw it down; I told the magistrate so the next day; when the porter came before the magistrate, he said, the blow that was given him stunned him, and that he did not see the person; I throw myself on the mercy of the Court; my life is now at stake; I have no witnesses.</p>

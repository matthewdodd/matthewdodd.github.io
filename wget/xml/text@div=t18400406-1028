                  </hi>. I am a sailor. I have been acquainted with Caroline Tully eight years, and was with her on the 13th of March—I first met her about six o'clock in the evening, we both had something to drink—I was not the worse for liquor—she sat down and went to sleep after I left her in Crown-court, Wapping—she asked me to give her my watch to take care of, and I did so—I came back to Crown-court, she was there, and asked me to go and see if her father was come home—I went, and could see no light—I came down the court again and found her and two policemen—I said, <hi rend="italic">"Carry,</hi> give me the watch, I think I am more able to take care of it than you"—the prisoner was one of the policemen—I asked Tully where the watch was, she said she did not know—the other policeman asked the prisoner if he knew any thing about the watch, he said no, he had not</p>

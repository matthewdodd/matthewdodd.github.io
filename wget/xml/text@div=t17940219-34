               <p>I live in Maze-pond, Southwark, I have lived there for some years (I am a schoolmaster,) in the course of that business I have a great many petitions, and things of that kind brought to write; this will is my hand writing, I can have no doubt; I think, as near as I can recollect, I wrote it in the latter end of the year 1791.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take on yourself to swear that it has not been wrote four years back? - I cannot take on myself to say to a month or two, but to the best of my recollection this is a transcript of a paper which was brought to me to copy, about that time, some time in the latter end of the year 1792, I had a paper to write this from, a person brought a paper for me to copy, and he was to have it in such a time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you paid for the copying of it? - About two shillings; no more than for my honest labour.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person that brought it? - I believe I should know him if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take on yourself to say that will is your hand writing? - I think it is my hand writing, but I think also that I could not copy two sides of a paper without likewise knowing something of its purport.</p>
               <p>Q.Let the witness see Thomas Borthwick? - This is the very person that brought the officers to me, when I was taken to Bow-street, and this is the very person that brought the paper to copy, I have not a doubt of it in my own mind, the least in the world. This will is from a paper that I absolutely copied, and it is my hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. The paper that was brought to you, you copied correctly? - I did, as correctly as any man could, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. That young man, Thomas Borthwick, was the young man that brought the officers from Bow-street, in order to carry you before the magistrate? - He was, and I believe he was the man that brought the will to copy.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190090"></xptr>Q.What was the officers brought to you from Bow-street for? - He came to setch me by an order of Lord Kenyon; I believe it was when this thing came out at the King's Bench; I was taken up to Bow-street as the copier of the will; when the officer came to me I knew nothing of the parties, I was excessive ill, the officer asked me if I remembered such and such a time, having wrote such a writing? I said, yes, perfectly well, and he said then that the whole had turned out a very bad piece of business; I said the parties are utter strangers to me; I was paid for my honest labour, and no more than I ought to have been.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the officer's name that came for you? - Townsend.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to his house with any officer? - The officer took me, I told them at Bow-street, that I did not know the house where I took the paper to. In the year 1792, I lived along with Mr. Innis, as his servant; one day Mr. Innis came to me and said, that I must write a copy of a will for him, accordingly I did, he was not satisfied with my doing it, he said I must take it to a schoolmaster, as he wished to have a good copy of it; I took it to a school-master in the Maze, and agreed to give him two shillings for the copying of it, and afterwards I had it again from the schoolmaster, and gave it to Mr. Innis. I wrote it first from an original one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Mr. Innis do any thing with it afterwards? - No, I see that on the will that I brought home, I see a little boy write the name of Thomas Gardiner.</p>
               <p>Q. To that will that you brought and delivered to Mr. Innis, you see the little boy write something; what was it? - It was Gardiner, I think, Thomas.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that boy's writing? - I cannot pretend to swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him write often? - I have seen him write sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Shew him that will? - I do not believe that name,

               <p>Petit. No, my Lord. The first Man that went by me bid me good Night; as soon as ever he was gone by two Men came up to me and clapp'd a Couple of Pistols to my Face and bid me deliver my Money. They took from me a Silver Watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Faces of any of the three?</p>

               <p>Q. Did they take the Watch?</p>
               <p>Petit. I took the Watch out of my Pocket and clapp'd it into my Breast; but they saw it and said they would have it; and they rifled my Pockets.</p>

               <p>Petit. I ask'd for the Stick again; they said, go about your Business, you are well off, you might have fallen into worse Hands.</p>

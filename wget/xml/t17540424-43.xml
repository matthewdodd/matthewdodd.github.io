On the 20th of December was two years I miss'd a pair of stone shoe-buckles and a pair of knee-buckles. I suspected the prisoner, and going to Justice Fielding's took out two search warrants, one against Mr. Pain of Golden-Lane, the other against Mr. Warner of St. John's-street. I went to Golden-lane and found some part of the goods, the buckles, which I miss'd the night before, and several other things which I had missed, but could not charge upon any particular person before. There was a ring, three pair of studs, one hat-buckle, and a shoe and knee-buckle, which I miss'd the night before. The others I found at Mr. Warner's, the other pawnbroker; there were five silver seal stocks, a pair of garnet earrings set in gold, a stone stock-buckle set in silver, and a silver hairpiece. The constable took them in his possession, and has had them ever since. The buckles were in possession of the prisoner the day before I missed them, and when I found the goods his name was upon all the tickets.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Can you swear that I took them out of your shop and pawned them ?</p>
               <p>Maynard. I cannot swear that he did. I can only swear they are my goods, and that I found them at the pawnbroker's in his name.</p>

            . I served my time, and work journey-work with the last witness; last Christmas was two years my master missed these goods, and I went to see after the prisoner, but could not find him. My master had some intelligence that the prisoner had pawned the goods. As I was going along in order to see after them, I met him; he told me of the two pawnbrokers. Barnes (who is since dead, and whose widow is married to one Pain) was one, and Warner the other. He said the shoe-buckles were at Barnes's, but did not mention what was at Warner's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you how they came there?</p>
               <p>Musgrave. He told me he had left the shoe and knee-buckles at Barnes's, but did not mention where the rest were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say he pawned them by direction of his master?</p>
               <p>Musgrave. He never mentioned a word about it, but only said he had left them there.</p>

               <p>Maynard. He has been gone down to Birmingham for these two years past. I made enquiry after him, some told me he was gone to Ireland, some one place and some another, so that I never met with him till within about five weeks.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Pain. On the 22d of August in the year 51 the prisoner brought a ring to me, and I lent him 5 s. upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a ring was this?</p>
               <p>Smith. I do not remember: I think to the best of my knowledge it was a mourning ring. On the 16th of Sept. following he brought me a buckle, I think it was a hat-buckle, or a girdle-buckle; on the 9th of December he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175404240024"></xptr> brought me three pair of cypher studs, I lent him three shillings upon them; on the 20th of December he brought a pair of buckle-rims, I lent him fifteen shillings upon them; they were all the goods he brought to our house. On the 21st the prosecutor and the constable came and served a warrant upon my master, he produced the goods, and Mr. Maynard swore to them.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the goods?</p>
               <p>Smith. They were delivered into the constable's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the goods, and see whether they are the same that were delivered to the constable?</p>
               <p>Smith. I am positive the buckle-rims are part of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the goods that were delivered to the constable, brought by the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Smith. They were; I have known him three years before.</p>
               <p>Q. to Maynard. Are these the goods you lost?</p>
               <p>Maynard. They are what I lost, they are my property.</p>
               <p>Nathanael Warner. I am a pawnbroker, I know the prisoner very well: On the 30th of August, 1751, he brought to my house one stock-buckle, I lent him three shillings upon it; on the 4th of December he brought me five seal-stocks, I lent him two shillings upon them; on the 21st of December the search-warrant came from justice Fielding, brought by Mr. Maynard and the constable; I told them whatever their demands were I would give them without trouble; they demanded the five seal-stocks and the stock-buckle; I told them I thought I had something more in my house that they should have; I found a pair of garnet ear-rings, which came on the 10th of August, I lent him two shillings upon them; there was also one single hair-piece, which is here present, worth about fourteen-pence, that was pawned the 20th of December, I lent him six-pence upon that; I shewed them to Mr. Maynard, he said they were his property; then said I, take them, for I desire to have no man's property in my house: he swore to them before justice Fielding, and they were delivered to the constable; am sure they are the goods that were brought to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. to Maynard. Are these your property?</p>
               <p>Maynard. They are my property.</p>

               <p>I had an execution out against me at the Court of Conscience for missing payment, and I never was before a justice. When I met Musgrave he told me, my master was going to have a warrant for me, I said, for what? he said, for such and such things; I was frightened, and went into the country; I came back about six weeks ago, and surrendered myself to my master, knowing myself innocent.</p>
               <p>Q. to Maynard. Did he surrender himself voluntarily?</p>
               <p>Maynard. Five or six weeks ago I believe he came to surrender himself; he had worked for me six years before, and always was a very honest servant, and was able to get his twenty-seven and thirty shillings, I have paid him thirty-six shillings a week very often; I am very sorry I must appear against him now; I have intrusted him to melt gold for me to a considerable sum, and never missed one grain of it.</p>

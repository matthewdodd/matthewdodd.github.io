            , of Dean-street, Soho - it is partly let out in lodgings by me. I received the rents, lived and slept there, and do so now. I know the prisoner - in March last, he applied to me to let him have one room on the first floor, to place articles of his own trade in it - he is a <rs id="t18240916-139-deflabel758" type="occupation">builder, carpenter, and bricklayer</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18240916-139-defend1185 t18240916-139-deflabel758"></join>; he afterwards occupied the back-room on the third floor instead of the other; and had had that room about five months - he was not to sleep in the house; there was a common lock on the door; he put a padlock on himself, and had the exclusive use of the room. I saw some goods in the room four or months ago; there was woollen clothes and wearing apparel; and articles of his own trade, and carpenters tools. I think myself that all the property in the room then was worth 100 l., or a little more; this was about five months back. I had not seen the room for four months before the fire happened; I then saw these things in it - the fire happened on Saturday, the 14th of August, about ten o'clock at night. On the Thursday previous to that, I told him I wished to have the room to sleep in myself, and he must move his things to another apartment, or take them to his own lodgings. I said I should want it, and wished him to move his things on the Saturday; he said he could not take them to his lodgings. I said I had spare closets in the house, and he might put them there; he said the woollen cloths and things which he had would take up more room than I had, and the moths would get into them. It was at last settled that he should move them into some of the closets; he did not move any. This conversation took place at the Obelisk, in Surry, not on the premises. On Saturday evening, the 14th, I was at home, and saw him there. I went out about a quarter to ten o'clock, and left him there; he had been backwards and forwards for three or four hours in the middle of the day. He had been in the house one or two hours, when I went out at a quarter to ten o'clock. I returned about a quarter past ten: and in consequence of an alarm, went up to his room, and in the recess by the fire-place, was a jean coat on fire, and a sack on fire; the shelves, in the recess, were on fire, and the room full of smoke; one or two fireman, and others, were in the room. I assisted in extinguishing it, by throwing water on it, which people brought; I threw some into the recess near the fire-place. I observed the chimney jam, which is a partition of wood, close to the recess, and forms part of the room; that was burnt; the jean coat hung on a nail on the left hand side of the recess. I saw a sack on the chimney jam; that was nearly consumed; it was suspended from the jam by a bradawl. There were some oil and turpentine cans in the recess; nothing was in them, but I had used some turpentine sometime before, and knew that one was a turpentine can. There was a stone bottle, which appeared to have a mixture of oil and turpentine in the same recess with the cans. The room is about fifteen feet by twelve. I looked into the cupboard, which is in the cross corner, to the fireplace, and found a hat-box there, with smoke in it, and then I saw a waistcoat laying on the shelf, almost entirly consumed by fire; it had burnt the edge of the shelf. There was a loose board reared up from the floor to the edge of the shelf; that board was burnt, by being attached to the wainscoat, and the edge of the shelf. An oil cask was in the cupboard; it appeared to contain oil and turpentine - perhaps about a quart of it. The cupboard floor was covered with pieces of wood, shavings, and pieces of letters and papers, steeped in oil; there were a great many shavings and wood. I saw an apron in the cupboard about half-burnt; a sheet of brown paper was hung at the back of the apron, and partly behind, a pair of fustian trowsers, which hung up; the trowsers appeared to have been dipped in turpentine. The cupboard is on the side of the room near the staircase, and a crack in it was filled up with rag: if that had been left open any person could have seen a light in the cupboard if there had been one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe anything on the floor of the room - A. A pair of mahogany doors, which lay on the same side of the room, as the cupboard was scorched with rags, which had been laid on it, dipped in turpentine. There had been fire in the recess on the mahogany door, and the door of the room was blistered all over, but had no fire on it. There was also fire in the cupboard, and on the chimney jam. The four places where I observed fire were completly distinct from each other; a hole was boared in the ceiling of the room, four or five inches wide each way, and the laths exposed: there was a hole in the plaister in the side of the room, about the same size as the other, and the laths exposed.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the room - A. A saw, a few planes, locks, and nails; the mahogany door, one pair of nankeen breeches, and a coat; the value of the whole is about 5 l. That is all that was in the room. Part of the floor was burnt in the recess.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You yourself formerly lived in the Strand - Yes; I was unfortunate, and took the benefit of the Insolvent Act, and lived in the Rules of the Bench. I ceased to reside in the Strand in January. I was liberated in March, and then still lived at No. 97, Strand. This was about five months before the fire. I occupied all the upper part of the house. Wilkinson and Co., who were glass dealers, occupied the lower part of the kitchen; they continued there after I came back, till about two months before the fire. The prisoner did not reside with us; he had no other room, except that the fire was in.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner had bought the lease of the house and the fixtures for you, had he not - A. No; I stated to my assignees that I had parted with the lease for 50 l.; it is returned in my schedule; it is held for 50 l., but with no assignment.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not sold the fixtures to the prisoner for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160055"></xptr>25 l. - A. No. I had not parted with my interest in the fixtures.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this receipt - A. It is not my writing; there had been an execution put into my house, Mr. Eddes was the broker employed; he sold the goods under the execution, and the fixtures; that was about five months before the fire. Mr. 
               <persName id="t18240916-139-person1208">Preston</persName>
             the landlord did not live in the house. There might be 100 l. worth of goods in the prisoner's room in March.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a builder, and without improper motives he would be in possession of oil-cans - A. They were in his possession for that purpose, and had been so for a considerable time.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. You took the benefit of the act in March, and returned to No. 97, Strand directly - A. Yes, and it was after that time I had conversation with the prisoner about the room; I have lived there, and received the rents from the lodgers ever since.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did not Ball give the receipts for the rent - A. Never; I always gave them. Wilkinson and Co. were to pay 130 l. a year, but never paid anything.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not understood that they were to pay it to the prisoner - A. Yes; because I employed him when I could not act myself to let that apartment to them; he was my agent, and was to receive the money from them if they had paid. Preston was the landlord.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BOND. I now live in Plumbtree-street, Bloomsbury. I work for Mr. Fearn, as a tailor. On the 14th of August I was working for him at No. 97, Strand, in the room over that in which the fire was; I had worked there a fortnight. The prisoner had the back room under where we work, and Miss Davis had the front. I saw the prisoner three times on the afternoon of the fire; he kept his room padlocked; I saw him first about two o'clock in the afternoon; he came up for a pair of pantaloons: he came up again about five o'clock, and staid with us half an hour each time; I cannot say whether he went into his room. He came up into the workshop again about eight, and said,</p>
               <p>"Well you are hard at it;" he had no light with him - I asked him to go down and ask Mr. Fearn for some calico - he said he would, and I gave him a bit of brown paper lighted, as he said he must have a light to go down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask for the light before or after you desired him to go down - A. After; the paper was about six inches long; he went to the top of the stairs, returned, and said he must have another light, as that had gone out; I then gave him a strip of white breeches cord, about a foot long and two inches wide, twisted it round, and drew it through the candle, to make a sort of candle of it - I lighted it, and gave it to him - he went away, and I saw no more of him that night; he did not return with the calico. When he was gone we heard a rattling on the landing-place below; it was like a chain rattling; I remained at work till nearly twelve o'clock. About half-past ten my shopmate and I were very drowsy; I laid down on the board, and smelt fire and burnt wood - I got off, and looked under the board, thinking the fire was there, but it was not; I wrapped up my work, and was going down stairs: I saw Mr. Wood prizing the prisoner's room door open; I ran and brought up a pail of water: the door was then open. I did not go in, but ran and fetched another pail, handed it up to Wood or Skeel, and saw fire thrown out of the recess by some one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. At what time did he come up for the pantaloons - A. About two o'clock. He asked for a light when I desired him to go down; that was a little after eight; I asked him to go. Half a pail of water put out all the fire that was in the room when I was there, but I had brought up two full pails before, and Skeel fetched two, and the watchman some. I stumbled and spilled half of my third pail.</p>

            . In August last I lived in the front room third floor of Mr. Fearn's house; the prisoner's room was on the same floor - I have lodged there nearly two years. The door of his room was kept padlocked on the outside. About ten o'clock on this night there was a smell of fire; I opened my door, and saw a light underneath the prisoner's door, and gave an alarm. Wood came up, and tried to break it open with a poker in two or three places before he succeeded; he went down for a pair of pinchers - Skeel came up, and at last they got it open; there was a deal of smoke. The people came up and put it out.</p>

            . I lived at Mr. Fearn's at the time of the fire. I am a sculptor, and am Fearn's cousin. I came home about nine o'clock, and about twenty minutes past nine Ball came into Fearn's room, where I was - Mrs. Fearn was there; he spoke to her, and then came in and sat down near to her; she observed what a smell there was of turpentine; he said he had been cleaning his coat, but it was some hours since, and he thought she would not have smelt it; he remained in the room about twenty-five minutes altogether; Fearn came in when he had been there about twenty minutes, and said,</p>
               <p>"Aye Ball, are you here non; at this time of night?" he said he had been to the coffee-shop five or six times that day, and had stepped in. Mr. and Mrs. Fearn went out of the room; he remained there, and said he wished he was where I had come from, meaning the Borough, where I work; he then went on the landing-place, and called to Mrs. Fearn to know if Mr. Fearn was gone out - she said he was, but he would return very shortly; he waited on the landing-place a few minutes, and then went up stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. Would that lead to his room - A. Yes. He came down in six or seven minutes; I saw him pass the door of the room I was in: he went down stairs. I did not see him again till about two o'clock in the morning. An alarm of fire was given about ten, by Miss Davis; he had then been gone a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes - I went up to his room, and saw a light under the door, which was padlocked; I got on my knees to look into the room to see if he was there, and saw fire in the room, and smoke came out. I got a poker from one of the lodgers, and broke it into three pieces in trying to open the door: I went down got some pinchers, and opened it - the two Mr. Skeel's came up with me. On opening the door I saw fire in the corner, and immediately got water up as fast as I could; the smoke was very great indeed. I carried up three or four pails of water myself, and Skeel brought up more; several persons were carrying water. We put the fire out. I perceived that the recess next the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160056"></xptr>chimney on the left side had been on fire, and several turpentine cans and oil jars there - the jam of the chimney and cupboard were burnt. When I opened the door I saw the jam, and the corner blazing. I saw a tub in the cupboard with a mixture of oil and turpentine; one corner of a wainscot was under the tub, and the other part hung down, and was completely burned. Some paper was in the cupboard dipped in oil, and a bonnet box was smoked in the inside, and appeared to have been washed in turpentine - it was a band-box, made of thin wood and paper. I saw an apron on the left-hand side of the cupboard; the edge of it was burnt, and a pair of trowsers in the cupboard appeared to have been steeped in turpentine. A large piece of wood stood up edgeways in the cupboard - it was burnt, if it set fire to at the bottom, it would lead to the shelf; some rag was found, steeped in turpentine. The property in the room was worth about 6 l.; there was a mahogany door, a saw, planes, and locks - there was no furniture, nor any woollen cloth or clothes, except an old coat. The cupboard shelf was burnt at the edge.</p>

I was in Mr. Fearne's house on this night - an alarm was given; I went up stairs, and broke open the door - the room was full of smoke; some water was brought to Wood; I took it from him, and threw it in, as I could see the chimney jam a light, though I could not enter the room for smoke; I threw it on the jam. I saw apparently a bundle of rags, or something nailed or hung on something against the wall, by the jam; they were a light also. I threw in one or two pails of water; the smoke then cleared away a little; we went in, and threw more water, and put the fire out. I looked into the closet; there was no fire in there then, but several marks of fire having been there - the cupboard door was shut - I saw some shavings; a painting brush was in the tub. I observed the room door - some of the stuff out of this tub appeared to have been smeared over it with the brush; I felt it, and it was quite wet, and came off on my hand.</p>

I saw the floor of the room in the recess; two boards of it were burnt; here is one of them - there had been fire in the cupboard; one place could not have set fire to the other; they were quite distinct. The things in the room were worth 4 l. or 5 l. Here are the remains of the trowsers, coat, and waistcoat; they were quite wet with turpentine, as if they had been put into it.

             re-examined. I lodge in the house, and sleep with my brother William, who occupies the lower part of the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, it is unfortunate for any one to be accused of such a charge, even if found innocent, and if found guilty I am aware of the consequences, and therefore hope you will give the utmost consideration to the circumstances in which I am placed. The articles found in my room are articles used in my business; oil-cans and paint pots are common to every one who gets their living as I do - I brought nothing into the house clandestinely; what goods<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160057"></xptr>I took out I took openly. It is not likely a man should insure six or eight months ago, and the goods of that nature, that keeping them would lessen their value - that I should keep them four months, and go to the office, and say,</p>
               <p>"Such a place is burnt, and I have so much goods in it;" the first question would be,</p>
               <p>"Where is a voucher - did you sell none of them?" would any office believe I could keep them six months, and never sell any. Mr. Fearn says I had 100 l. worth of goods, but I paid pawnbrokers 120 l. for these goods, and I sold them. The business I then intended to follow did not suit me, and when I had sold them I declined it. Now, about the things being sprinkled with turpentine; there were pots, jars, and all things; it was a lumber room, and it was not likely I should put broad cloth and clothes there when once moved out - but when they were moved, I put these things on; the reason I moved my goods from the premises was, that on the first night Mr. Fearn occupied the house I lost a cloth measuring fifteen yards; I sold the rest for fear I should lose more; I think the suspicion attached to their removal will be worn out in a great measure by the time I had them; I never pretended to have more - and therefore should never be such a fool as to attempt to impose on the Company, by saying I had such goods; the fire was discovered to have happened near the fire-place, and of all parts of the house that was the most unlikely to succeed; it is built of brick, and there is a small nook containing ironmongery, and this it is said I set on fire, when the other parts were timber; I was not in the room for two hours before it broke out, and the article described to be entirely consumed is a sack - is that a likely thing to be used for such a purpose? then a jean jacket is partly burnt - that paper was dipped in oil and mixed with shavings, and brown paper hung up; is it likely the waistscoat should be nearly consumed, and the paper at the back of it not touched, nor at all singed. Now it remains for me to account why the articles in the closet were burnt. - I built two houses in Bermondsey - and one evening a few shavings caught fire on the floor - to put it out I threw what first came in my way on it, and among other things, this apron and some other woollen things; a board is brought here from the closet - is it likely that it should be so much burnt, and the oil and paper among it not destroyed? - the fact is, they were brought from this house, and put into the closet; the oil and shavings, which are so easily ignited, are not burnt, and yet other things not so easily set fire to, are almost wholly burnt: I know nothing of the hole in the cupboard being stuffed up; the light was seen under the door, and any carpenter knows how to stop up the space under a door; although so careful in stopping the hole with rag, yet it seems I was so negligent as to leave the door where every one must see unstopped: when I got the light I went openly to the men who were going up and down stairs - I did not get a phosphorous box; they say they heard a chain jingle - when the asp of the padlock drops it will chink; I have been afflicted with rheumatism, and having left my stick in the room, I went in with this light for my stick: I blowed the candle out, and threw it towards the fire-place; if I had stooped to put it down, it would have inconvenienced me; in the fire-place were bits of cloth, which I had used to clean my clothes with, by rubbing them with turpentine: I used to sweep the pieces of cloth in, and seldom cleaned the fireplace - they being there, the fire might have ignited them, and the jam being only half a foot off, it could easily catch fire, and then set fire to the nook; but I positively state I had no such intention. As to the door beeing splashed, I had been in the habit of rubbing my paint brushes against it to get the oil off, when I wanted to clean them; the door and walls were rubbed in this way, and the brick work too - there was no wood work affixed to the jam, so that if it had burnt, the house could not have burnt; I now submit my case to your consideration, and declaring my innocence, I rely on your verdict.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in New-court, Strand; I have known the prisoner nine months - I have seen him with cloth and wearing apparel at No. 97, Strand - there was one hundred and sixty yards of cloth and camblet, and a considerable quantity of wearing apparel taken out of pledge - he paid about 80 l. to get them out - they were worth considerably more.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. What is he - A. A carpenter and builder - I saw the property there in March - I worked with Mr. Fearn in the house till April - I never saw any property there after March.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he had pawned them or bought the duplicates of them. - A. I cannot tell.</p>

            . I am a pawn-broker, and live in Clare-street, Clare-market. On the evening of the 24th of March, the prisoner redeemed some property at our house - I believe he had bought the tickets - he paid 38 l. 9 s 6 d; on the following day he redeemed property to the amount of 2 l. 2 s, making 40 l. 1 ls 6 d with interest; he took out one end of cloth for 7 l.; I should think it worth 14 l. or 15 l.; they were pawned in the name of Matthews, the last witness; he is the man who pawned them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the prisoner had bought the duplicates - A. I suppose so; I cannot state from memory what the transactions were, and I have not got my book here - I recollect his redeeming a large quantity of property - wearing apparel and cloth.</p>
               <p>- VAUGHN. I am a pawn-broker, and live in St. Martin's-lane; I do not know the prisoner; I delivered some goods to Matthews on the 25th of March.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you let these lodgings with his consent and approbation? - A. Yes; I let a ready-furnished lodging to the prisoner at three shillings a week; I cannot say exactly when I let her the lodgings, it was some time last summer; she lodged with me four or five months; she ran away from me, and left the key with my next door neighbour, who gave me the key; I then missed the things in the indictment; they were afterwards found at the pawnbroker's.(A pawnbroker produced a sheet and three flat-irons, six clouts, a gown, and a pillow, which were deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. There was a man lived with her in the lodgings; they took the lodgings as man and wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you make the contract with? - A.With her; she took the lodgings, and gave earnest for it herself.</p>

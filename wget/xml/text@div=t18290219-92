            . I live in Blisset-street, and have the care of Mr. Owen's houses. I went to No. 37, and saw the prisoner collecting bricks and bats, and putting them into his basket; I asked what brought him there - he said he was only collecting a few bricks and bats; I said I had the care of those houses, and I should give him into custody - he began to give me some very ill language; the bricks had been lying about the yard and on the wall - he had a cart and donkey with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you brought the bricks here? A. No - I did not think there was any occasion; it was not because I did not wish the Jury to see what they were - I went for an officer; he drove his cart, and I went with him - the officer did not tell me, now I had got the bricks to let the man alone; he picked up from sixteen to twenty bats in my presence - it was day-light.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What is the value of twenty bats? A. Threepence or fourpence.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many bricks did you see him take? A. We were ordered to count them, and there were about a hundred.</p>

            . I am a labourer in the East India Company's service - I saw the prisoner behind these premises, picking up bats, putting them into a basket, and then into a cart; I went to Mahoney, and told him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was this in broad day-light? A. Yes, it was a quarter-past four o'clock - you might call it rubbish, but it was what I call of value; they were bats- I did not see him take one brick; I believe there were no bricks there - there were bricks on the wall, which were loose from its being knocked about.</p>

            . On Friday, the 30th of January, I was in my garden, which is some distance from Mr. Owen's yard - I heard a noise at the back of my garden, opened the yard door, and saw the prisoner picking up some pieces of old bricks; I said, "What are you going to do with them?" he said, "To make a floor;" I said,"They are not fit for that" - he said, "I shall lay some boards over them, and they will make a good floor;" I said,"Very well, you may take off the whole if you like, and I will give you 1s." - what he had of me were much better than those he got at Blisset-street; I went to look at them - they were nothing but rubbish; I never saw such a delapidated place in my life.</p>

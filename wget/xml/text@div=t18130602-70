               <p>Q. On the 13th of May had you any parcel for mangling - A. Yes, of linen. It laid in the shop on the basket by itself; I saw it there at twelve. While I was cutting some bread and butter for my children's dinner a girl knocked at the door, and informed me that a man had taken my bundle away. I ran to the door, and saw the man with the bundle. I ran after him; he was stopped by somebody else. I saw the prisoner drop the bundle; a witness picked it up. I have got all the things safe in the bundle. The bundle contained all the things in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person that took the prisoner - A. A carter in the road.</p>

            . I live facing Mrs. Freeman. A little after twelve I was cleaning the parlour in my mistress's house; I saw the prisoner go in Mrs. Freeman's house, and take the bundle out. When he came out of the shop he had the bundle under his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020046"></xptr>arm; he walked away. I went and told Mrs. Freeman that a man had taken her bundle away.</p>

            . On the day stated I was in Mile-end-road. I heard the alarm of stop thief. I laid hold of the prisoner; he dropped a bundle directly. I took the bundle up, Mrs. Freeman had it afterwards. I am sure the prisoner is the man that dropped the bundle; he ran away from me. A carter in the road stopped him; he was taken to the Fountain public-house.</p>

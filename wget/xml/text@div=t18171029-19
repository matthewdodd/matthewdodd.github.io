               <p>MR. JOSEPH JACOBS. I am a gentleman, and live at Michael's-grove, Brompton. On Sunday, the 28th of September, about eleven o'clock, in the morning, I took my family to church, leaving

On my return, I found her wounded in both hands, and blood upon her, and about the house. The surgeon attended her for about a fortnight - He is not here-the wounds were not very dangerous; one of the cuts was very bad, and would have been dangerous if it had been deeper.</p>
               <p>MARIA HERN. I am servant to Mr. Jacobs. On the 28th of September, the family went to church - I was alone in the house. I was in the bed-room on the second floor, and heard a noise down stairs; I went down to my master's dressing-room on the one pair of stairs, and saw the prisoner stooping at my master's portmanteau. I screamed out "Oh!" and instantly went up to him, and said," You villain, how came you in this house?' - He made no reply. He stood still for a minute or two, then came up to me, and took hold of both my arms - I screamed out murder! and immediately said, "Spare my life, spare my life-what is it you want?" He said, "By G-d, if you make any more alarm I will kill you." He said, if I would stop in that room, and not move, he would spare my life. He swore again that if I moved from the room he would kill me. I told him I would stop in the room if he would spare my life. He went out, leaving me in the room - I found he was locking me in; I went to the door, and pulled it from him with both hands, he pulling it from me. I saw a knife open in his hand when I entered the room, he instantly raised it up, and cut both my hands across with it to make me quit the door. In the scuffle I got past him - He cut me quite across both hands - I lost a great deal of blood from each of them; I was under the surgeon's care about a fortnight. Having received these cuts I got out of the room - I went to the front drawing-room on the same floor, and screamed out "Murder! for God's sake come to my assistance!" Mr. Holliday came out from church<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290012"></xptr>at the time, and seeing me at the window, came in-Mr. Blower also came in, and they secured the prisoner. I saw the knife in the prisoner's hand when I first entered the room - We both had hold of the door.</p>
               <p>Q.Could he not have cut you by accident - A. No; I saw his hand directed against me, and felt the cut - He did it designedly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How near was I to the door when you first saw me - A. At the further end of the room.</p>

            . I am a clerk in one of the public offices. On Sunday, the 28th of September, a little before one o'clock, I was passing Mr. Jacobs's house, I was nearly opposite the street - door, and suddenly heard the window on the first floor thrown open, and the last witness call out, "Murder! there is a villain in the house!" I endeavoured to force the street - door, in company with a friend who was with me, but could not. I got over the rails, broke a pane of glass, and pulled the sash-fastening of the window back, opened the sash, and got in. I went towards the stairs-on the landing-place I saw the prisoner without his shoes, and secured him. Mr. Blower came up - I desired the prisoner to put his shoes on. He asked for his hat, which he said he had left up stairs. I took him to Knightsbridge watch-house. In going along, he voluntarily acknowledged that his object was to rob the house. I asked him where the knife was with which he cut the last witness's hands - He said, behind the drawers in the dressing-room - I went back to the house, and found it there-the prosecutrix's hands had been dressed.</p>

            . I was near the house a little before one o'clock, on the 28th of September, and heard the prosecutrix at the window crying murder! I got over the railing with the last witness; we got in, and saw the prisoner on the landing-place, without shoes or hat - He called for his hat, which he said he had left up stairs. I asked him what he had been doing with the servant? he said he had done nothing to her, and that it was her own fault that her hands were cut - We took him out. I sent for a surgeon. Both her hands were cut, and a great deal of blood were on her apron and on the floor.</p>
               <p>MR. HOLLIDAY re-examined. I saw the prosecutrix's hands cut. If I were to judge from the blood, I should conclude that the cuts were very deep-there was a great quantity of blood on her apron and on the floor. The prisoner made no resistance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Inhuman barbarity, and the arrogance of pampered expectation has induced the prosecutrix to come forward. I was confused at her finding me there. I allowed her to call out. I said I would kill her if she raised an alarm. I was going away - She changed colour, and seemed determined that I should not go. I begged of her to keep quiet, and keep in the room. I took hold of the key-the knife was open in my hand. She darted at the door, and said she would not be locked in. I seized the key with my left-hand, and held the door with the other hand, in which was the knife - She grasped the key with both hands and cut them with the knife - She got out. I determined to surrender myself. She has sworn falsely - I had no malice against her; I might have escaped if I chose.</p>

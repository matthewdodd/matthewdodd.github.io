               <p>MARY MORRISH. I am eleven years of age. I received the bundle, and was going to take it to Mrs. Mackenzie, to be washed; she lives at No. 3, Lee's-buildings - when I got to the bottom of Long-lane, Donoghue came and said,"Little girl go over the way, for a halfpenny-worth of tobacco;" he held my bundle, and when I came back he gave me a halfpenny worth of cherries, and gave me the bundle, told me to sit down on a step, and see that it that it was all right - I told him I did not know what was in it. I then went on to the bottom of Long-lane, and he came to me again, and said, "Go over the way, and get two pipes." I left my bundle and went; and when I returned, the prisoner Edwards had run away with it - I asked Donoghue where the bundle was, and he said a boy had run away with it; I had seen Edwards following us before, but not close to us - Donoghue said, "Wait there, and I will run after him." I have not seen the bundle since - I am quite sure it was Donoghue who spoke to me; I did not take particular notice of Edwards, but I believe he is the person.</p>

I did; she was to pay me three shillings a week, it was furnished; she took the lodging in the name of Jackson; I went up to Marlborough-street, and had advice first; they said I must take a witness, and open the door, and on breaking open the door, the first thing I discovered was, that there were only about three pounds of feathers left in my bed and bolster, and a very good bed it was when I let her the room; the remaining part of the feathers were gone; I missed a pair of sheets, two pillowcases, a blanket, and one blanket cut in two; she had not left me half, only a bit; she had taken all the articles mentioned in the indictment.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: I have four duplicates which the prosecutrix delivered to me; she and I went round to the pawnbrokers, and found this property, which I produce. (The property identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To the prosecutrix.) Q. Mrs. Calverley, did not you know that these things were in pawn before you broke open the door; I hope you will not take a false oath; she knew at the time the things were pledged? - A. I did not; if I had known it, I would not have suffered you to have taken them out of the house; I am a poor woman, I have a lame husband to support.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. At the time this happened I had two children to support; I had a friend of the name of Jackson, who paid the rent for a considerable time; he went away, and left me with the children; I worked for Mr. Rose, in Bishopsgate-street, and the work was very slack, I could not get any work to support my children; she gave me leave to pledge the things, provided, when I received the money from my brother in the country, I took them out; she said, get them out as soon as you can; the very night that I pledged the blanket she said so. Mr. Rose is out of town, or he would have come and spoke for me; my husband died at the time he worked for Mr. Rose; Mrs. Calverley said, if I would pay her four pounds, she would not prosecute me, otherwise she would punish me, - if it was possible to have me transported she would, without I gave her four pounds; my friends told her they would pay the money for me as far as the things were worth; it was not in my power to raise four pounds; she made answer they would not take less than four pounds, as they had brought it so far; I have got three small children.</p>

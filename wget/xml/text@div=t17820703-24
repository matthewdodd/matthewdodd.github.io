I took the note; and upon the strength of this note, Mr. Smith and Mr. Kinnersley trusted him with 30 l. more. Some little time before that, about a fortnight, I believe, I went to enquire at Messrs. Drummond's, whether the note was good or not. They said, they knew nothing of any such person.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know that to be the same note you received? - I saw the prisoner indorse his name upon the back of it. (The note read.)</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say he knew this Jones? - Yes, he said, Cook belonged to the limekilns, at Dartford; that Jones was his agent; that he dealt with him for 3 or 400 l. a year in breeze.</p>

               <p>Has not Mr. Smith commenced an action against the prisoner, for the balance of his account? - He has commenced an action for his debt.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether this note is included in that demand against him in the Common Pleas? - I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Did you make out that bill? - I did; it was 50 l.</p>

               <p>Was this note part of that account - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is the action upon the note, or goods sold? - Upon goods sold.</p>
               <p>Did he say, at any time, that he knew Jones, and that he was frequently in town? - Yes, he said, he dealt largely with him; very largely: he often came to his house, and he had been there the day before I called last time, to let him know where the note was.</p>

               <p>Court. Where did you intend to reside? - I meant to go down to Dartford, to keep school.</p>
               <p>Look at that note. - That is my handwriting.</p>
               <p>You write very differently to-day, to what you did then.</p>
               <p>(The jury inspected the name he had just wrote, with the signature on the note, and the hands appeared to be very different.)</p>

               <p>Do you ever draw bills upon any person? - No.</p>
               <p>You said just now, the note you gave the prisoner was not directed to any banker at all? - Yes it was.</p>
               <p>How came you to say just now, before you saw it, that it was not? - I do not re- recollect that.</p>
               <p>Yes, you did; the Counsel asked you the question, before he shewed you the bill. Who was it directed to? - Mr. Drummond; I intended to have had the cash there before the note was due. They arrested the man for the note, before it was due; and, not content with that, they now try to take away his life.</p>
               <p>You told the Counsel you never kept cash there in your life? - I intended to have paid it in there.</p>
               <p>Are you acquainted with them? - I know them.</p>
               <p>Is there any body here will say, from Mr. Drummond's shop, that they know you? - I don't know that there is.</p>
               <p>Where did you live at this time? - In Tottenham-Court Road.</p>
               <p>Did you date your note from Tottenham-Court Road? - No, I intended to go and live down at Dartford, to keep school there.</p>

             sworn. - Q.What are you? - A. One of the conductors of the patrol belonging to Bow-street: On the 14th of March, I received an information that a drover had been struck, and a beast forcibly taken from him: I took Shearing, one of the witnesses, to a house, where I knew these sort of men frequent, and he pointed out the man that struck the drover, and I took him into custody; that was about eight o'clock in the evening; I never saw the bullock.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner there? - A. I cannot say; there were several of them that I had seen before following bullocks.</p>

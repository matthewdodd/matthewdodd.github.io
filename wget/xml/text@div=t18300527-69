On the 2nd of May, about two o'clock, I was called up into his sleeping room, to search his box, which had been opened about two minutes before I got up, by a key belonging to the house; he was not at home - I found seven different handkerchiefs in his box; they had never been used - I knew four by different marks on them - only one had our private mark; that was in my own writing; I had been in the country some time, and do not know when it had been safe - I knew the other six by their having passed through my hands so frequently, and by the pattern and folds; he never purchased goods of us, nor applied to purchase any - he came home in about two hours, and I told him I wanted to look into his box; he said certainly - I took him up stairs, and showed him the handkerchiefs, which were taken out and thrown on the bed; I told him I had discovered them in his box - he asserted most positively that he had never seen them there before, and repeated that several times; on my turning round, and saying I should fetch an officer, he took hold of my brother's arm, and said, "Mr. Smith, I wish to speak to you;" my brother said, "What you have to say speak loud;" he then said, "Well, if I die for it, I put them there;" he had 20l. a year, board and lodging - my brother's wife had opened the box in the first instance; nobody else slept in the room - they are worth 18s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are the handkerchiefs modern, or old shopkeepers? A. Some of them are old, and by that I know them; one or two are modern - I cannot say that he was alarmed at first; he became much so after having said if he was hung for it he had done it; he said he had taken them to send to his friends in Wales, and afterwards said, "No, I took them to sell to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270035"></xptr>my friends in London;" if he had paid for them I should not have approved of his taking them without leave - I had a very good character with him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he intended to account for the value of them? A. He said he intended to take them to his sister, or some friend to approve of, before he sent them into Wales.</p>

            's. When we came there, some of us went to the front door, and I and another went to the back door of the house, where they were supposed to be. There were three houses together, but there was only one entrance to them all; for the other two doors were nailed up: these houses belonged to Fretwell. When we came there, the man who placed himself at the front door, made a noise; upon that, Chapman came to the back door, and Knowles got out of a window at the back of the house. Upon that, I and the person that was with us got in at the back door Chapman had opened; and in one of the lower rooms, we found meat upon the table, where persons seemed to have been at dinner, and Causam was sitting at the table.</p>
               <p>The people that were with me, brought in two, Fretwell and Hipwell in custody, and Chapman and Knowles also were taken: We secured them all. I found upon Chapman four counterfeit half-pence in one pocket, and seven in another; and they all appeared to come from a Die that was then fixed in a press in the house. upon Fretwell I found a shilling and eight penny worth of half-pence in one pocket, and in another I found ten pennyworth of half-pence. Upon Knowles I found two shillings and six pence worth of halfpence. and upon Hipwell five pence in halfpence. They all appeared to be new struck from that die. In the same room there was a quantity of counterfeit half-pence, some in papers, and others loose. In the fore parlour there were other quantities; some in papers, and other loose: all that were wrapped up in paper were to the amount of six shillings worth in each paper; there were some papers with twelve shillings worth, and some with twenty-four shillings worth; they were sixshilling papers tied together. They found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310050"></xptr> twenty-four shillings worth of half pence in Fretwell's bed chamber in a paper, in a draper: We went to the work shop, which is at the end of the three houses; there is a way broke through up-stairs out of one house into the other: There we found a large press, fixed, and a pair of dies in it, (producing them.) and between the two dies a counterfeit half-penny, (producing it.) There is a defect in the die, which is the same in the half-penny; we also found a cutting out press, and some plates of Copper whole, and some others which had the blanks cut, out from them. On the Wednesday following, the 24th of May, we went to the lodgings of Robins, and apprehending him, upon an information given by Causam we found him with a die before him which was warm; he appeared to be in the act of making it. I told him, be had better produce what dies he had, that it would be to no purpose to conceal them; and accordingly he delivered up several other dies to me, which were finished.</p>

            . Chapman and I went to Birmingham the week after Christmas, to bespeak the two presses, one of which is that produced in court; the other is too large to be brought. In the Easter week afterwards, they were accordingly brought to the Bell, in Smithfield, and were conveyed from thence to Fretwell's house, and there they were fixed up. Chapman, Hipwell, Fretwell, Knowles and myself, began to work upon the week after. We were all employed some way or other in making the halfpence. Hipwell only cut out the blanks; Chapman and Fretwell pulled at the fly; Chapman left that work about a week after we began; and Knowles took his place, and pulled at the fly with Fretwell afterwards; but Chapman came back again the Friday before we were apprehended. We made about twelve pounds worth in a day. I was there when Clarke apprehended them all at Fretwell's. Chapman and Siddall, who is absconded, were the master-workmen, and the others were the journeymen. Siddall paid us our wages. Robins made all the dies; I received one pair from his hands, and he told me he made the other pair I received, I paid him two guineas for: I paid that money for Chapman and Siddal. We carried all the dies to Robin's in order to have them engraved; there was one pair carried by my wife, which Robins brought back to me again. My own business was to seed the press. The last pair of dies Robins brought, were in work when the prisoners and I were apprehended. We had no dies but what were made by Robins.</p>
               <p>Q. from Chapman. Whether he thought me in circumstances to carry on such a partnership.</p>

               <p>Chapman's defence.</p>

               <p>Knowles, Fretwell, and Hipwell, in their defence said, that they were employed by Siddall.</p>

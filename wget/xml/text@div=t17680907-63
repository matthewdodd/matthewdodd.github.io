            . The prisoner came into my house the second of August; she asked me to go and get a guinea upon a watch for her, she said it was her her husband's; I pawned it for her in Denmark-street.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Give an account of what you come here about?</p>
               <p>Morris. I was going out of Oxford to <placeName id="t17680907-63-crimeloc340">Tyburn-road</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17680907-63-crimeloc340" type="placeName" value="Tyburn-road"></interp>

               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Morris. This was about nine at night, or a quarter after, I can't tell to a minute, on the 30th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a woman there?</p>
               <p>Morris. No, I did not to my knowledge, not till after I came to myself again; then I saw several men and women; I was bruised so that I could not feel any thing at all, nor could I cry out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Morris. I had had a pennyworth of bread and cheese and two pints of beer, and an acquaintance had part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now can you tell where you live?</p>
               <p>Morris. I live in Charles-street, Soho, near Brownlow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Morris. I never saw her till after she was taken up.</p>
               <p>- Jays. I am a pawnbroker; this watch was pawned to me by the prisoner for a guinea on the 2d of August, (produced in court and deposed to by prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I saw the watch and an old hat lying in Hanover-square, I took it up; I get my bread by chairing.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you lose your hat that time?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I did not.</p>

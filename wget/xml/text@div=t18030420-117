               <p>Q. When did you see the mill? - A. On the 13th of March, on Sunday, at four o'clock in the afternoon, I had eleven sacks of wheat in my mill then; I locked the mill-door after me, at four o'clock in the afternoon, and went home; I did not return to the mill till Tuesday morning, ten o'clock; I found the mill-door open, and seven sacks of wheat were missing out of eleven; apparently no violence had been used to the lock; seemingly it must have been opened by some key, or picklock of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did the prisoner live? - A. He lived in Silver-street, Edmonton, to the best of my knowledge, near a quarter of a mile from the mill; the prisoner is a corn-chandler; he was acquainted with the mill; I let the mill to him myself; he quitted it at Christmas last; he had a cart at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of cart? - A. It was a yellow cart and narrow wheels, and two side ladders standing up on the sides; a very particular cart.</p>
               <p>Q.When had you first any information respecting this? - A. It gave me suspicion seeing the door opened not by forcible appearance; it struck me that somebody must have gone in that knew the mill.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon had you any information respecting it? - A. It was on the Friday evening following, and I think the Wednesday in the next week I got a search warrant; I found nothing but the cart; I sold him the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he appear before the Justice? - A. On the Saturday following, in the same week.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you before the justice when he was examined? - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what he said? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what he said taken in writing? - A. Yes, it was; Mr. Morris, the Justice, wrote it down; the prisoner signed it; I saw him sign it with a cross.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this it which you saw the Magistrate write, and the prisoner put his mark to? - (Shews him the paper.) - A. Yes, it is, and signed by the constable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This cannot be received as evidence.</p>
               <p>Court. I think this is not evidence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You had had a dispute about the mill? - A. Yes, we had some difference.</p>
               <p>Q. He brought an action against you? - A. No, he did not; I brought an action against him; I never have found my corn since.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know of the house being searched yourself? - A. I heard of it, but I did not see it, I was not there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to the house of the prisoner? - A. I only proposed he would suffer his house to be searched without any particular notice, and I went with a constable in a very private manner on the Wednesday week, and found nothing there.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Saturday was he permitted to go home from the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not go to make the search till the Wednesday week? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The prisoner went voluntarily? - A. He went in consequence of a summons.</p>

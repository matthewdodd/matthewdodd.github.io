               <p>RICHARD PAYZE. I live at Laytonstone. I came to town on the 4th of January, and went to Drury-lane with my daughter - I had a box with a muff and tippet in it in my cart, and a sack covered over it; I returned to <placeName id="t18300114-154-crimeloc834">Bow</placeName>

            . I was with my father on that Monday - I know the muff and box were safe; when we got home the muff was gone - I saw it at Worship-street on the Saturday.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM DAVIS. I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 4th of January I was about half a mile on this side Bow, at a quarter before six o'clock - I met the prisoner coming towards town, carrying this muff tied up in a handkerchief, doubled up in his right hand; as he passed he shifted it to his left hand, and brought it before him - I stepped back, and asked where he got it - he said it belonged to his aunt; I did not believe him, and took him into custody.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A young woman asked me if I was going to town; I said Yes, and she asked me to carry the parcel for her - I did not say it was my aunt's.</p>

I took him into custody—on the way to the station he again said that he should like to see Mr. John Penn—he said "The fact of it is I have received a sovereign or two from Porter; I met him when I was in straitened circumstances, and he has sent me money for more iron than—I could get, over what was booked to him; for the lot for which you have got me, Porter sent me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; this is what I want to tell Mr. John Peun, with a good deal more."

Fennell also said "I arranged with Clark that the weights in the receiving house should show as usual," and that he had done that because Porter had asked him to get the iron in—he said "Now I suppose he wants me to suffer for the lot, but I shall tell the Magistrate in open court all about it." I told Clarke who I was—Sergeant Andrews was there—the warrant was read over, and Mr. Notley ex<lb></lb>plained what the charge was against him—I afterwards assisted in appre<lb></lb>hending Porter.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Dectective Sergeant</hi>). On the 16th July I was at Messrs. Penn's works—-Clarke was brought into the office—the charge was read to him, and he said "All I know about it is Porter said it was a dirty lot, and he must have some allowance for dirt; that he had some overweight always allowed him for dirt, 2 or 3 cwt., I think he said." I took him to the station, and the same evening about 11 o'clock I went to Porter's house, 5, St. George's Terrace, Lewisham—I posted four men round the house—I had great difficulty in getting in—I searched the house, and Porter was found in a cupboard in the scullery by Sergeant Marshall on my presence—he was very violent, and I put handcuffs on him—I was about to read tthe warrant to him—he said "Do not do that, I know all about it: I knew at 11 o'clock to-day that the warrant was out against me, and that Penn's man and Douglas were in custody," or were locked up—I told him he was all on the spiring to steal and with stealing—he said "Well they may talk about conspiracy, I shall be able to prove that the difference—they will have to prove it, and if they say that I gave Peun's men money they will have to prove that too, and it will take you and them all your time. I should have given myself up to you, but I did not want to be locked up all night. I went over the garden wall to my mother's house at the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187710220270"></xptr>
               <p>back, and you would not have had me now if it had not been for the policeman you placed under the wall." He got on top of the policeman's back, I believe, as he slipped down—he also said "I cannot under<lb></lb>stand what Douglas is in custody for, he did not buy the iron, he only had part of the profit, which I gave him." His brother was charged with assaulting me, and referring to that he said "I am sorry my brother struck you, he did it out of love for me, I hope you will not be too hard upon him." He was then taken to the station—on the same day, about 10 o'clock, I took Douglas at Green Bank, Lewisham—he was in bed, but dressed—I told him who I was, and that I was going to arrest him on a warrant for stealing a quan<lb></lb>tity of iron in April last belonging to Messrs. Penn—I took out the warrant to read to him—he said "Pray don't do that, I know all about it, and have been expecting these proceedings, and I am sur<lb></lb>prised that Messrs. Penn should take the steps they have for a sum of about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I know the Penn family, and we are to a certain extent intimate." He offered every facility to my searching—his brother came in, and being surprised to see two detectives there, asked me what it meant—I said that I was there to arrest his brother, and he said "Now, Thomas, if there is anything you can tell the officers about this business do so." Thomas said "Well, all I know about it is this: I bid for Peiin's iron, and Porter heard of it. Porter saw me, and said 'What do you want to bid for Porter's iron for, I have had it so long; let me have it this time, I can get some overweight and you shall have part, or half of what I make,' and he afterwards gave me some money, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I don't know which. I do not think there was anything wrong about taking that money, as I advanced him part of the money to pay for the iron, and, of course, I ran a certain risk." He said that he was not fit to be removed—I saw his medical man, and he was left there with an officer in charge of him.</p>

I believe Douglas is a wharfinger—I believe other officers have been to his wharf to make in<lb></lb>quiries—I only went to his house—he might have learnt that proceedings were going on—there were four or five remands—I was present at all—ths Magistrate did not say on the last remand that there was no case against Douglas—he did not intimate his intention to discharge Douglas or any<lb></lb>thing to that effect—I think it was on the last hearing that Whitling was produced—the Magistrate had given an intimation about Douglas case on the previous hearing, and then Wickling was produced for the first time, but not in consequence of what the Magistrate said—he was going to be a witness, that was understood, and he was there at each hearing, but his evidence was not given until the Magistrate had given an intimation—he had sworn information.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in partnership with Mr. Whitling—I was manager to the Phoenix Iron Works at that time—prior to April I knew Porter, and had been in the habit of buying scrap iron of him—on 21st April he said he had a cargo coming from Messrs. Penn's, consisting of lump iron, cast iron, iron borings, and wrought iron turnings—on the evening of 19th April he brought a barge, called the Andrew, alongside with the metal as I had arranged—we commenced unloading on the 21st—many men were engaged in it under Verrall's superintendence—a man named Andrews was in Douglas's employ, and was present at the unload<lb></lb>ing—it was Verrall's duty to see the cargo as it came from the barge and enter it in the landing-book—I observed a conversation going on between Verrall and Andrews, and afterwards saw Porter come to the wharf—I had a conversation with him, and he gave me this invoice. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 24th April</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">charging iron of different kinds and amounts, making a total of</hi> 104<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. less 10 <hi rend="italic">per cent.</hi>, 103<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., credit 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., balance 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">by the large, Andrew, settled by cash</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">H.

I afterwards got the landing-book from Mr. Verrall, compared the weights, and found that they corresponded—I only paid 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account when the invoice was given me, on account of my suspicion about the weights, but he said that those were the weights which he had already charged—I told him the weight was considerably less than was in the barge, but he said the full weight was there—I said that I should require to see Penn's invoice before I paid the balance, and he said he would bring it the next morning, which he did, and turned down a portion of it where it should be receipted—after he left me I went to the Phoenix Wharf and had the load of iron reweighed, and found out that the weights came out in correspondence with this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then paid the balance, and on, I think, the 2nd of May I wrote a letter to Porter—I wrote three or four letters to him, and about May 7th he called upon me, and I saw him—I also saw him at the works on 15th May—I said there were 12 tons 18 cwt. short in that barge—he said "The weight is all right; you have got the full weight," and I believe he said "You have made the overweight at Penn's"—he then asked if I would take a bill for the difference, 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said that I had paid him cash, and he must refund the money, which he promised to do next day—he came the</p>

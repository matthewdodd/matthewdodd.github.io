On the morning of the 2d of November I was on duty, and about five minutes before two o'clock I heard something - I went up against the houses which are building by Mr. Simmons, I heard a chopping of lead on the top of the house, and something falling at the back of the premises - I got some other watchmen, we surrounded the house; I proceeded to the back, where I saw three or four men standing over this lead, folding it up, some of them were stooping down - I caught Perrin, who was one of them - he staid with me a quarter of an hour, and then made a great resistance to getaway, but another watchman came up and he was secured, all the rest got away - two or three of them went inside the building; I was not able to discern who they were; I afterwards saw Johnson and Turner brought out of the house in custody; I have compared this lead with the roof, and it fitted exactly to the width of the gutter - I saw the end of the gutter the day before, but I did not go on the roof; I did not go up again till the 5th of November, and then I fitted the lead - there are five pieces of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You compared the width of the lead? A. Yes; these houses were building by Mr. Simmons or Mr. Brooks, I cannot tell which - I believe Turner has been employed in the buildings; I never saw the other two; Perrin said they were taking away the lead by Mr. Simmons' order -I had seen the prisoner at a public-house at eleven o'clock; they asked a boy, who was with me, to go in and drink.</p>

            . I have lately been building some houses on Mr. Brooks' ground; there were lead gutters upon two of them - Mr. Hancock supplied the lead, and I paid for it; the prisoners were all in my employ - I remember the Saturday night when this occurred; I have reasons for it: the men applied to me for their wages - I had just paid the money out of my pocket for the lead, and I went to Mr. Brooks for money to pay my men, according to a verbal agreement, but he refused to give it me; I told the prisoners to get down this lead, and I would make money of it on the Monday morning - they went a little too late.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. Q. Are you of opinion they went a little too late? A. Yes - they had a right to have gone when I ordered them, and then they might have got the money on the Saturday night; I did not know when they went till now.</p>

               <p>MR. SMITH. Q. Do you know that he could not get money? A. Yes; I was in the counting-house when he asked for it and could not get it - I could not hear what was said, there was such a noise; but I was outside when Simmons came out and said he could get no money.

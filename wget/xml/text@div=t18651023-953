I am servant at 5, Newcastle-court—the prisoner is a servant in that house—on 11th October, between 12 and 1 o'clock, she was beating another woman in the kitchen—I was cleaning the rooms, and my mistress asked mo to come and help to turn the prisoner out of the kitchen—I asked her very civilly to go out, but she would not—as I went up the kitchen stairs she came after me, took me by my hair at the foot of the stairs, and we both fell together—I was uppermost—I felt something very sharp go through my eyebrow, the wound is still here—I bled very much—she said that she would go out and give me in custody because I had stabbed her—I told my mistress that it was I who was stabbed—I did not stab the prisoner—I fainted, and was very bad for a week; I was taken to the hospital—just before this, I heard the prisoner ask an old lady for a knife to stab Tom, who she lives with, but I saw nothing in her hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I and my husband keep this lodging-house—I saw the prisoner beating another woman in the kitchen, and asked the last witness to assist in getting her away—Broderick left the kitchen, and the prisoner took her by the head at the bottom of the stairs, dragged her down, and gave her a blow on the head—I saw no knife, but blood flowed directly, and she called out that she was stabbed—the prisoner said, "The young woman has stabbed me"—I would not let her go—I saw a white-handled knife in the prisoner's hand five or ten minutes before, but I did not see her use it—it was something like this (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

I am a lodger in the same house—on this afternoon the prisoner had lent an old woman a knife—she asked her for it back, and got it two or three minutes before this happened—she put her hand in her pocket, pulled out the knife, and opened it—at that time the servant came into the kitchen, and said, "Go up stairs"—she said,' I will go up stairs if you will give me my bonnet and shawl"—the servant was just going up stairs and the prisoner got hold of her, using bad language, and they fell down—I saw the knife in the prisoner's hand at that time, but did not see her use it—I have not said before that I saw her strike her—immediately after they got up I</p>

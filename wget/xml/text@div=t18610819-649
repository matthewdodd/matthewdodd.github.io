                  </hi>. I live at 23, St. James's-terrace, Whitechapel. On Saturday night, 13th July, about 10 o'clock, I was coming home from the City towards St. James's-terrace—I had had a little to drink, but was not tipsy—I had been with a friend during the day—when I came to White-chapel Church a heavy storm of rain came on, and I went into a public-house and called for some refreshment—I pulled out a bag which contained some silver, and took out 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay for the beer, and put the bag into my pocket again—there were several people in the house—I saw the prisoner there—he spoke to me and asked me to drink—I did drink with him—he seemed a respectable young man—there was another young man in his company—I left 'the house and they followed me across the street, and the prisoner said, "We will see you safe home, father"—I went up Union-street, and at the corner of Mountford-street I bad occasion to do what. nature required, and while I was doing so the prisoner hooked his arm sharply round my neck very tightly, and I was nearly throttled by him—he nearly strangled me, and with his other hand he pulled the bag out of my pocket—his companion hit me a tremendous blow on the head which knocked me down, and there I lay insensible for a short period—they both ran away—as soon as I could I picked myself up again, but I could not catch them—Mountford-street is no thoroughfare, and they turned back again towards Whitechapel—they were gone when I went back—I had never seen either of them before—I saw the prisoner again that same night in the station-house,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter and joiner, living at 7, Mountford-street, Whitechapel—I saw the prosecutor in Mountford-street at the time he was making water—the prisoner and another man were with him—the prisoner seized him by the throat with one hand against the wall, and put his other hand into the prosecutor's right-hand trousers' pocket—his companion said to him, "Have you got it?"—he replied, "All right, Jack"—I saw him pull something out of his pocket, but I did not know what it was—the other man struck the prosecutor at the back of the head and knocked him down, and then they both ran up Mountford-street, finding there was no thorough fare they had to run back again—the prosecutor ran after them and fell down—the prisoner said to his companion, "Jack, will you look after father, and I will go and get a cab"—he ran down Union-street as hard as he could and I after him—he caught his foot against the kerb and fell, and I came up with him and gave him into custody—in going along he tried to pass his hand into his right pocket—the constable opened his hand and took from it this bag—at the station he pretended to be drunk.</p>

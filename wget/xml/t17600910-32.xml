               <p>Q. How do you think it was opened?</p>
               <p>Reynolds. I believe it was opened by a false key; I heard a noise in the night, but I did not get up, I thought it was my horses.</p>

               <p>Woodman. This was on the 7th of July, about 2 o'clock in the morning; he made off as fast as he could; I went up to him and said, what have you got here? he said only a girl; a comical girl, said I, let me see what you have got; he dropp'd it down, and I pick'd it up; he got ground of me, having too great share of heels; I describ'd him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he drop?</p>
               <p>Woodman. A hat, a cap, and a furtout coat; there was a woman with him, she had the coat, but she deliver'd that to him before he dropp'd them, in order to run away; I took and secur'd her.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the prisoner taken?</p>

               <p>Jos. Higgens. I happen'd to be at a public house, the goat and 3 tuns, in Bunhill row, about 8 o'clock to-morrow will be 3 weeks, the prisoner challeng'd me with putting a dark lanthorn into his pocket; I took him by the collar, and ask'd him what reason he had for that, and sent for a constable; when the constable was sent for, he said, can't this affair be made up before the constable comes; I said no, then the people would think I was guilty of what you charge me with; then he pull'd out five keys, and held them to the landlord, and said, take these till I ask for them; the landlord would not take them; then the prisoner dropp'd them under the table; the constable came, and ask'd what I gave him charge of that man for; I said, for charging me with putting a dark lanthorn into his pocket. Said the man of the house, there are some keys dropp'd under the table; the constable took them up, and said, these are picklock keys.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Raltheober, who keeps a shoemaker's shop in Monmouth-street. On the 18th of September, at half past seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner take these boots from our door—they were on the pavement, exposed for sale—he did not ask the price of them, but took them away—I had only just got out of bed, and was half undressed, so that I could not follow him—I did not catch him till next day—I am quite sure he is the person, and when he was taken he said he would pay me for them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at home with my parents in that neighbourhood—I know the prisoner. On the 18th of September I saw him take the boots from the prosecutor's kitchen area—I am quite sure he is the person—heput them under his coat, and walked a few steps, and then ran—I have seen him two or three times about Seven Dials, and am quite sure of him.</p>

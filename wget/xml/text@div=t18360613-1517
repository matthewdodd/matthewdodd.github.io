                  </hi>. I live at East Ham. I was with my cart on the 19th of May, at twelve o'clock at night, at the Plough Inn, Mile<lb></lb>end-road—I left it in charge of the ostler—I was about three-quarters of an hour in the house—I had a hearth-rug and some carpeting in the cart—I did not miss any thing till I got home, and then I missed this hearth-rug.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an ostler. The cart was left with me, I took it under the shed—I saw the prisoner standing there a long time before that—I saw him close to the cart, and saw him take a paper of fish out—I went to him, and asked what he was going to do with them—he said, to take them home, he thought they would do him good—I said he should not—I took them from him, and put them into the cart again—he used to live ostler there before I went.</p>

I was called to take the prisoner—Clear said, "You detain this man, while I go and call my mas<lb></lb>ter"—I did not see the rug at that time—the master then came—he gave me possession of the rug; and, in taking the prisoner down, he said, "I will not be handled by any body"—I said I would not handle him, but go he should—he made a stop for a particular purpose, and took advantage of it, and away he ran—I sprang my rattle, and followed him—another officer stopped him—we then secured him.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside with my father and mother, they keep a shop. On Saturday, 30th Jan., the prisoner came, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening, for a bunch of greens—I served her, she gave me a shilling, I gave it to my mother, and she handed me 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, which I gave to the prisoner, and she left—about an hour afterwards I saw the shilling, and found it was bad—I knew it to be the same, as there was a particular mark on it—I saw my mother throw that shilling into the fire; it was bent, and I observed a nick on the edge of it—on Saturday night, 6th Feb., after the shop was closed, I heard a knock at the door, about twenty minutes before 12 o'clock—I opened the private door and saw the prisoner; she asked if we had any cabbages, I said, "Yes, we have, but none but 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ones"—she said she would have one—I told her to walk through the passage to the back room, where there was a light—I knew her directly, and saw her to be the same woman who had come on the previous Saturday—my father served her, and she put a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece into his hand—I said to him, "Just look at what you have got there;" and he handed it to me, he, being very old, could not tell a good one from a bad one—I bit a piece clean out of it, and found it was bad—I showed it to my mother, and she said to the prisoner, "This is a pretty thing to bring at this time of night"—I went out and fetched a constable, and gave the prisoner in charge—the prisoner said a woman sent her to purchase a cabbage.</p>

On 30th Jan., my son gave me a shilling—I put it in my pocket with one other shilling—in about half an hour, I took the two shillings from my pocket, and gave to a particular friend to buy something—she came back immediately, and said one shilling was bad—I showed that one said to be bad to my son—he saw it when it was in the shop, in my friend's hand—I put it in the fire, and saw no more of it.</p>

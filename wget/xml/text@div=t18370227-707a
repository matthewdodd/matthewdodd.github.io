                  </hi>. I am steward to Mr. Stephen Morgan, who lives at Hare-field-grove. or Saturday night, the 11th of February, he had ninety-seven sheep in a field in the parish of Rickmansworth—thirty-three of then were ewes with lamb, and one ewe was not in lamb—I counted them on Sunday, and could only find thirty-three ewes, including the one not in lamb—oneewe which was in lamb was missing—in the course of that morning I raw the skin of a ewe hanging in a cart-shed on the premises, and observed two dead lambs by the skin—I knew it was the skin of one of my master's ewes—I had been dressing some sheep with ointment for the scrub, and it had the ruddle mark, and also the mark of the ointment on it—the two Iambs had not been dropped from the ewe naturally, but had been taken from the body—the skin appeared to have been taken off in an unbutcherly manner—on the 23rd of February, (eleven days after,) I saw some mutton compared with the skin; and I should say that that mutton had once been covered with that skin—part of the sinew of the left leg was left in the skin, and I found the corresponding part of the sinew on the mutton—there was a small portion of skin left on the thigh of the mutton, which corresponded with the deficiency on the skin itself—that was the inner skin, not the part which has wool on it—I only compared a small portion of the thigh with the skin—there might be two pounds—there was no wool left on the meat—the prisoner lived nearly nine months in Mr. Morgan's employ about seventeen months before this.</p>

On Sunday morning, between ten and eleven o'clock, I saw Michael Fox, and in consequence of what he said I went to Bishop's-wood, near the turnip field where the sheep were feeding—I there found the skin of a ewe, and two lambs—I took them up, and put them into the cart-shed—it was the skin of master's ewe, but I could not say it was so till I had counted the sheep—the mere sight of it did not satisfy me on the the subject.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher at Uxbridge. I compared the skin with the mutton last Friday, and saw where they had cut the leg off—the sinew rises up, and forms a slant—I matched them together, and they cor-responded—I firmly believe one had formed part of the other—part of the toner skin was left on the thigh of the mutton, and there was a corresponding deficiency on the inner skin—when matched it corresponded in size and shape with the deficiency—the sheep had been slaughtered very clumsily—I could not judge whether the ewe had been in lamb.</p>

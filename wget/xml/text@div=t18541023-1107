                  </hi>. I was cook on board that vessel. I remember on a Friday evening, at the latter end of July, seeing the prisoner and Audsley at the forecastle—the prisoner was sitting on the edge of the bucket eating his supper—there were other sailors close to him; I was close to him—I ob<lb></lb>served that the prisoner's trowsers were torn in front—some of the men, and amongst them Audsley, joked the prisoner about the state of his trowsers—I did not see Audsley lay his hands on the prisoner, but I believe he did—I said to the prisoner, "Never mind, boy"—Audsley teazed him very much—the prisoner had a knife in his hand, eating his meat—I saw the knife in his hand; I did not see him do anything with it—I did not leave the fore<lb></lb>castle—I heard Audsley scream out; I ran along the deck, got hold of him, and found him bleeding from the thigh—I did not see where the knife was at that moment—the prisoner was sitting on the bucket, the same place where he was before—Audsley ran about the deck, and said, "Master, mas<lb></lb>ter, I am stabbed!"—the prisoner went down below immediately after, and went to bed—he was not put under arrest—he was not taken on shore that day; he was very soon afterwards, but I do not know on what charge—I was examined before the Consul, on board the ship—I cannot say whether the charge was made against the prisoner, that he had stabbed Audsley—I was on the forecastle when he was stabbed, but I did not see it—I believe Audsley and the prisoner were on very good terms—the prisoner was very much provoked before the wound was inflicted.</p>

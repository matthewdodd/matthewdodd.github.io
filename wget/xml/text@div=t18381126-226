                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Taylor, an upholsterer in Dover-road. On the 26th of October, in the afternoon, I hung my coat across the horse in my master's van—I was taking a sofa into Mr. Holt's house, and when I came out my coat was gone off the horse—the gloves were in the pocket.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 164.) On the 26th of October I was on duty about half-past six o'clock, and was informed that a coat was concealed under some leaves on the top of, Croom's-hill—I concealed myself in a garden, and about twenty minutes before eight o'clock the prisoner came in company with another one—he came direct to the spot, turned the leaves off, laid hold of the coat, and threw it over his arm—I jumped out and collared him, and the moment I collared him a pair of high shoes fell from him—I asked how he knew the coat was there—he said he did not know it was there, he saw it as he was passing, but he could not have seen it, it was quite covered with leaves—I took up the shoes—the other man made his escape—there was a donkey just by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was taken a quarter of an hour before the boots were produced—I know nothing of it whatever—I was walking across the park, there was a donkey before me and a young man—he said, "Look at that donkey"—I passed it, and it stumbled over the coat and turned the tail up—the constable came up and charged me with stealing it—he went there afterwards and found the boots.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. The donkey did not disturb the leaves—I was concealed there an hour before he came—there was six inches of leaves over the coat, and it was three yards out of the path—the donkey did not tread near the leaves.</p>

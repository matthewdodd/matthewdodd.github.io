The prisoner was in my employ for ten weeks—he was to make himself generally useful, clean the boots and shoes, run errands, and do anything that I required—I did not pay him any wages, but found him in board and lodging—I employed him to take bills to customers, to get the money, he was to receipt the bills in my name, and account to me directly he came back—on 4th June I sent him with a letter to Mr. Bethune, on board the <hi rend="italic">Defence</hi> hulk—it was sealed, and in an envelope—I told him that I believed Mr. Bethune would give him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my account, and he was to make all possible speed back—I did not see him again till Saturday morning, the 6th, when he came to my house in a state of intoxication—I said, "You scoundrel, what have you done with my money?"—he said, "I have got a penny, do as you like with me"—he wished me to write to his friends at Windsor, and they would make it all right for him—I declined to do so, and gave him into custody.</p>

I was on duty at a quarter to eight o'clock, on the 18th of February, in Phoenix-street—I heard a noise at No. 11, and found the back first-floor window open—I got in at the window, and found the prisoner in another back room appa<lb></lb>rently asleep—I asked him what he was doing there—he said he had seen two men the night before, taking away some glass, and he thought he might as well have some himself—I found a glazier's diamond, a putty knife, pincers, two screw drivers, and some glass in his pocket, and a box of lucifer matches—I called in another officer—I then found two leaden casements, which bad been taken out, and a hundred and thirty squares of glass, tied up in a bag, and in a handkerchief that he had by his side—a number of squares of glass had been taken out of different windows, where the casements were not taken out—these casements fitted into the window-frames.</p>

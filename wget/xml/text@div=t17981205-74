             sworn. - I am a currier: I manufacture for Messrs. Newmans, in Giltspur-street, Mr. Alderman Newman and Sons; the prisoner is an apprentice of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What are their names? - A. William Newman, Esq. John Newman, and Henry Newman, On Tuesday, the 6th of November, I had some information that our premises had been robbed; I then missed two pieces of leather, which the prisoner had to dress, marked S2; I immediately gave information to Mr. Newman, that I had missed them; I then had orders, when he came to work, to apprehend him, which I should have done, but he did not come to work. (Looks at the leather), Here is the prisoner's mark, with copperas water, S No. 2, and here is Mr. Newman's mark, with ink, a V and a strait stroke, in the hand-writing of Mr. Newman.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179812050075"></xptr>Q. Had you examined them during the time your apprentice was at work upon them? - A. Yes, I have, they had gone through my hands once.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you, from that observation, swear to them? - A. I can.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are employed by Messrs. Newmans, as a person to manufacture their leather? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is leather sold in Giltspur-street by any body? - A. No; but when a customer comes to Mr. Newman's shop, and they have not an article that suits them, they come to me, and pick out what they want, and they are sent to the shop, but then those are always manufactured, and this is not.</p>
               <p>Q. What does it want? - A. To be scowered and rubbed with a stone, then it is hung up in a shed like a tanner's shed to dry, and then oil is put upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a great deal of process before it becomes leather? - A. Yes, it is the middle of the hide.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, you do not call it leather till the hide has gone through the process, and becomes fit for sale? - A. Yes, it is leather now, but not curried leather.</p>
               <p>Q. It has had a very little part of the process that is to be applied to it? - A. Only about one-fourth part of it.</p>

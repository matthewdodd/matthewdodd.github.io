                  </hi>. I am the widow of the late Professor Spooner, of the Veterinary College, Camden Town—he died in 1871—in 1872 Professor Pritchard called, introduced the prisoner to me, and left him with me—the prisoner offered to make any investment I wished free, out of respect to my late husband, and he made several investments for me, up to November, all of which were correct, and I expended 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on November 12th he held of mine over 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I had entrusted to him to get "Water Works "with—the signature to this letter of November 12 is his writing—(<hi rend="italic">This enclosed an "Amended Scheme of Investment" amounting to</hi> 1, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">which would produce</hi> 89<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per annum, which he advised Mrs. Spooner to adopt at the then low quotations.

                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that there was no evidence to support the indictment. Firstly, with regard to the Counts for false pretences, it was necessary that a false pretence should have some effect on the mind of the person to whom it was made, otherwise it was how offence: that although the defendant wrote to tlie prosecutrix, saying</hi>, "<hi rend="italic">The three shares were offered to me in vne lot, and I thought myself fortunate in securing them for you, and I have no doubt you will ratify what I have done, "that did not appear to have had any effect upon her mind to induce her to part with her money, because she said</hi> "<hi rend="italic">The reason I sent the extra money was because I believed he had purchased three Bonds instead of two, and I was satisfied if he thought it was for my advantage;" therefore the false pretence was not sustained in any one particular. Second y; the indictment was framed under</hi> 24 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 25 <hi rend="italic">Vic., c.</hi> 96, <hi rend="italic">sec.</hi> 75, <hi rend="italic">which enacted that</hi> "<hi rend="italic">Whoever is entrusted as a broker, or attorney, or other agent, with a direction in writing to apply, pay, or deliver such security, or the proceeds, or part of the proceeds, due, and shall, in violation of good faith, and contrary to the terms of such direction, convert the same to his own use and benefit, Sec, shall be guilty of a misdemeanour?' The "direction in writing" must specify the use that the defendant was to put the money to, and this the prosecutrix's letter did not do, her cheque was drawn to Mr. Y. Christian, or order, and if there was any direction at all, it was to pay himself for the shares purchased by him; and there was a further argument with respect to the cheque for 2891., which did not represent any particular transaction, but was only drawn to balance the account between the prosecutrix and the defendant.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MEAD</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">contended that as the defendant's letter stated that he had been offered three Bonds in one lot, and that persons had refused to sell him two, both which statements were untrue, both those were false pretences; and that, as to the cheque for 2891., that was to be added to Use balance in the defendant's hands to liquidate his claims upon the prosecutrix, and that the defendant had not applied that cheque to liquidate his claims upon her, because he had not delivered the Bonds to her which she intended the cheque to pay for, and that as a proof that he was acting as the prosecutrix's agent, he stated that the Bonds were for a widow lady, although no name was mentioned.</hi>

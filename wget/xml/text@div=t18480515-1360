                  </hi> I am a basket-maker, in Crispin-street, Spitalfields. I re<lb></lb>ceived directions, and on 24th March called at 14, Duke-street, and saw the two female prisoners—they ordered a hamper to pack some goods in, to send to Mrs. Piper, at Greenwich—I afterwards took it, and delivered it to the two female prisoners—they said they should be likely to want another, they did not know whether one would be sufficient—Webb came afterwards, and ordered another, and a clothes and market basket, and asked for the bill—she said Mr. Piper was gone to Brighton, but would be home next day, and most likely she or Mr. Piper would called on me—I have never been paid.</p>

I was sent with goods one Saturday to 14, Duke-street, and saw the two female prisoners—they took them of me—I went next afternoon with two beer-taps—they took them in—I went again on Monday, and took two lamps, and other goods—they received them—I left the bill—they said their mistress would be in town on Wednesday, and she would call—they ordered a bottle-jack—the mistress never called—we have never been paid.</p>

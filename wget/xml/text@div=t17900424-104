            : I was at home: he said, I want a chimney-bar; I asked, who it was for? He said, it was for Mr. Poynder, a master bricklayer, who lives opposite the London-tavern in Bishopsgate-street, about a quarter of a mile from my house.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know him? - No. He said it was to go to the Red-cross in Barbican; there is a large building carrying on there: I told him I did not work for Mr. Poynder, and that Mr. Poynder did not do the brick-work for the Red-cross: he said he did the work for the next house, which was lately burnt down: I asked him, who had done the iron-work before? He said his master and the smith had fell out, and therefore he had sent him to me for a chimney-bar: one of my men made the bar, and he had it at the time; the value of it is five shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to let him have it? - I thought it was safe, as I knew Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240110"></xptr>Poynder lived in credit; and therefore I let him have it on that account. On the next day, he came again for another bar, in the name of Mr. Pindar, a stone-mason. I asked him, what Mr. Pindar it was? He said, he lived in the New Road, the other side of Moorfields; and he said I was to go and take a jack down. I made the bar whilst he staid, and I delivered it to him; Mr. Pindar I had known some time, and had done some business for him; and on that account I delivered it. He said he would go with my man, and shew him where the house was. When he came the second day, he said there was a mistake about the iron bar; it was not for Mr. Poynder, it was for Mr. Pindar. He had a hasp and two round staples; he said it was to fasten up a door. I let him have the bar, and hasp and staples, on account that I knew Mr. Pindar.</p>

            . I had known the prisoner about a month before this; I became acquainted with him in the street - he paid his addresses to me as a single man, and a servant to Lord Dundas. On the 18th of April he came, and my aunt left the room - he asked me to take a walk to St. John's-wood; I quitted the room to get my bonnet and shawl, leaving him alone in the room - I know the watch was there; he wished me to wait at the end of Lisson-grove, about twenty minutes, till he returned - I waited above an hour, but he did not return; he never called afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not leave a little boy in the room while you went for your bonnet? A. Yes: he is eight years old - he was at tea; the prisoner said he had to go to St. John's-wood for his master - I had seen him three times, but did not promise to marry him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What name did he go by? A.

            . I am a journeyman shoemaker. I had seen the prisoner in the house the first time he called; I heard of this loss, and saw him in Oxford-market - I asked how he did; he said, "Oh, how do you do? When did you see Mrs. Owen?" I said, "Not since the Sunday I saw you there;" we walked as far as far as Foley-place - he said he was going to call on a gentleman, and he should get some money, and if I would wait he would treat me; I said I could stand a glass if he would come in - he would not; I collared him, and asked where the watch was - he tore himself form me, and said, "Oh, come with me," and away he ran; I followed and caught hold of his coat - the pocket came off; he then said it was all right, that the pocket was full of duplicates, and he would give me the ticket and make it all right - I secured him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you first mention about his saying he would give you the ticket? A. At the office - he never mentioned the watch: I do not live with my father - he did not turn me out of doors: he quarrelled with me for keeping idle company - I left his house; he did not say I should live at home - I dropped the skirt of the prisoner's coat; I did not examine to see if there were duplicates in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing whatever of what I am accused of - I declare I never said there were duplicates in my pocket, or that I would settle it; I told him I was known in the neighbourhood, and would go before a Magistrate with him, if he had any thing against me, but he pulled me about, and tore my coat - I ran because I should not be exposed; I went into my house, and told my wife, then came out, and went to the office - three parts of the evidence is false: when I met her in the street she asked if my name was Brown, and if I did not live with Lord Dundas - having lived with him at Lisbon, I said Yes; as to going to St. John's-wood, I was going for some work for my wife - I returned to the spot in about twenty minutes, and she was gone; being married, I thought it best to decline further visits; they thought I had a good situation, as I freely spent money with them - the first evening I went there Mrs. Owen said her husband lived on the Continent - people who live in the house can, prove no watch was ever seen on the mantel-piece - the first Sunday I went to tea there, this witness came out of Mrs. Owen's bed-room in his shirt-sleeves, and he was in: the bed-room on the first floor the same day; the evening the watch was taken there was a man in the bed-room, for there was a hat and coat there - this young woman took cups and saucers into the bed-room for two persons.</p>
               <p>MRS. OWEN. My husband is butler in a nobleman's family; there was not a soul in my place - I was sitting in a chair and laying on the bed, being ill, but the watch was in the front room - there was no hat or coat in the room; I have lodgers, but they are respectable.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HOBBS. The prisoner escaped from me.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not go into a house and come out again? A. I followed him in close - he said he would go before a Magistrate, but he would not leave the house till a Policeman was fetched to take him.</p>

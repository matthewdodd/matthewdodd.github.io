I secured the house perfectly—I fastened the shutters with the bolts, and the front kitchen door—I locked and placed a table before it—I then went out about half-past ten o'clock, and returned about one, or rather before—I opened the door with a latch-key, and got into the house—I proceeded towards a small room which I call the store-room, and, as I opened the door, I fancied there was a slight push as I opened it—I then went down into the I kitchen—I found the table removed, and the door wide open—I went iuto I the area, and gave an alarm—the policeman came and brought a light I—I then found a bundle tied up in the passage, at the foot of the stairs—the trunks and boxes in the store-room were all in confusion—the constable could not at first find anybody on the premises—there was a square of glass smashed in the front kitchen window, and by that means they got their hand in and pushed down the shutter-bolt, and that would enable a person to get in—I was not quite satisfied as to whether any person was in the house, and I went to the station—I saw what was in the bundles—they were articles of mine, which I had left safe when I went out,</p>

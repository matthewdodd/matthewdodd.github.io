               <p>I live in Jeffry-square, St. Mary Axe. I was returning from Colney-hatch, on Sunday, the 17th of October, in Mr. Paisley's carriage; we set out from Mr. Paisley's house; at Colney-hatch, about a quarter after six; we got a little way on <placeName id="t17901027-4-crimeloc13">Finchley Common</placeName>

               <p>What time do you think this transaction took up? - I think they could not be less than five minutes, from the time they came up, to the time they went away.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of observing the person of the man whom you suppose to be the prisoner? - Yes, I had; he had his face some time in the carriage.</p>
               <p>Was you under any alarm at the time? - Yes, I was; but not under so great an alarm as when I got out.</p>
               <p>Were you under considerable alarm when they first came? - No, Sir, not so as to prevent my observing any man's face; he had a round hat on.</p>
               <p>From the opportunity you had of observing him, from the light there was, and the length of time, can you conscientiously take upon yourself to say that he was present at the commission of that robbery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt of it? - I have not the smallest doubt in my own mind.</p>
               <p>Did you afterwards give any alarm of this matter? - Yes; but there is one circumstance I mentioned when the prisoner was going off; I called out loudly that I should know the man with the cutlass, upon which he turned round, and threatened with oaths to murder me, or words to the same meaning.</p>
               <p>Had you any opportunity of seeing him? - No, Sir, not enough to swear to him.</p>
               <p>How long was it before they were taken? - On Monday, the 25th; that was the Monday week following.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of observing the other? - There was another man taken with the prisoner, whom I believe to be the man, from the appearance; but I could not observe enough to swear to him; I had not the same opportunity of observing the other as this man; I have no doubt of the prisoner: mine was a metal watch, with double metal cases.</p>
               <p>Court. When the man's face was in the chariot, was the moon then shining upon him, or was the moon on his back? - The carriage was perfectly clear: I could see the man's face: the moon shone into the carriage.</p>
               <p>Did it shine in the man's face? - I really cannot say that: it was perfectly light in the carriage, enough to observe the man's face; he had his hair about his ears, and was dressed in dark clothes: I gave a description to Dawson, the officer; I said with respect to the man with the cutlass; I said, I should have it in my power to swear to him, and described him as a thin man, shorter than myself, with a thin face, and a large nose, rather bent, and dressed in dark clothes, a round hat, with his hair about his ears, and I described the cutlass as a large one, with a cut and thrust. Mr. Paisley will not be able to get out for some time, from the wounds he has received.</p>

               <p>Court to Dawson. Did Mr. Briggs tell you so? - Yes, my lord.</p>
               <p>What did you go out of the coach for? - Mr. Briggs lives at Mr. Paislays, in Jeffery-square: when I came the mother fainted away; and I said, we had only a warrant: when we came to the end of the square, I desired Mr. Briggs to go and look into the coach, to see if he knew any body there; that was all I said to him; he said, that was the man that held the cutlass.</p>

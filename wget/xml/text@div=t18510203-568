                  </hi>. I live at 22, Pelham-street. Mr. Waters entrusted me with some silk for my son to make, who lives with me—there was what we call a cane, and some silk on bobbins—on Friday, 17th Jan., I went out between ten and eleven o'clock—my ton was weaving the silk—part of it was on the roll—about fifty yards of it was finished, ready to go home—when the whole was finished there would have been about 100 yards—I returned home about five in the afternoon, and found my son was gone out—I then missed the fifty yards of ready-made silk, and eleven bobbins of shute—my son was permitted to work on that silk with me by permission of my masters—I saw my son again on the San day night following at the Ben Jonson public-house—he had received 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the work which he had made, and he would have received more when it was finished—he is twenty-three years old—the value of the fifty yards stolen was about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Isaac Chamberlain; I live with him at 22, Pelham-street. I remember a quantity of silk coming from Mr. Waters—I don't remember the day of the month—it was to be woven—I was at work on it on the morning of 17th Jan—I remember my father going out at eleven o'clock—I left my work about twelve, and went round to the prisoner's house, which is about five minutes walk—I told him I bad left my home—he said, "You will get three months for leaving your work"—I said, "No, I shan't"—we stood talking a good while, and he said, "If you will cut the work off, I will sell it for you, you will only get three months then"—I said I would not cut the work to injure my father—we then went to take a walk, and he kept saying, if I would cut the work off he would sell it fur me—we returned home to my place together, between three and four—I went to the Ben Jonson, to my father, to get the key to go up-stairs—the prisoner went home with me—he went about half the way up the stairs, and told me to leave the door open, and take the key back to my father, which I did—when I returned, the prisoner was standing at the corner of Spital-street—I went up-stairs a second time, cut the work off, wrapped it in a coarse towel and my jacket, and took that and eleven bobbins of shute down to the street—I saw the prisoner at the corner, on the other side—I joined him, and we went to his house—I carried the bundle, and he carried the shute—he then took the silk out of what I bad it wrapped in and put it in a bed-quilt—he took the shute and the silk under his arm, and we went out together to Brick-lane—he then told me to meet him at Shoreditch Church—he came to me there, and told me he had not got the money for the silk, he had to call at six o'clock—he had eleven bobbins of shute in his pocket—he said he was going to sell the shute—I walked with him—he went into a place, and when he came out he said he had got 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the shute, and he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when the silk was sold, he told me he got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—he gave me a sovereign, and I kept it—he said he sold the silk at Monk's—we went and took a walk—I bought a pair of shoes, and got change for the sovereign, and he was measured for a pair.</p>

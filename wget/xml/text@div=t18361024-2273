                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Charterhouse-square, in the parish of St. Sepulchre. On Thursday evening between seven and eight o'clock. I was in the drawing-room, up one pair of stairs—one of my servants brought me a message, that a Mr. May had sent for his pattern-book—I knew nothing about May or his pattern-book—I suspected something wrong, and went down stairs—as I went our of the drawing-room the I hard the street door closed—I ran down, and miss some clock from the hall—I opened the door, ran out, and called "Stop thief" I saw a man running about twenty yards before me—I pursued him, call<lb></lb>ing out—I lost sight of him by persons staring between me and him to</p>

On Thursday, the 22nd of September, I was standing at my shop door, and saw a man running from the square in a direction from Mr. Complin's house, with a parcel of something—he passed my shop window, and I saw him throw it down—I saw Mr. Complin coming through the gate, calling "Stop thief "—I clapped my hand and called "Stop thief"—he threw the cloaks down right against my door, and I took them up—Mr. Complin claimed them—I don't profess to speak to the prisoner as the man.</p>

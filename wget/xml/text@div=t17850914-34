               <p>In the evening before I had been with an acquaintance of mine as far as Westminster, and was drinking till late; coming home I found it was too late to get into my lodging, and I was coming by this place, and I saw it was an empty place, and I went in to rest myself out of the way of the watch; I lay there two hours, or two hours and a half, and in the morning I awoke and found it was break of day.</p>

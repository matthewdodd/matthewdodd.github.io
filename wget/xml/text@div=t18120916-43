I saw them strike each other. I crossed the road, and laid hold of the deceased. They struck at each other, while I held the deceased; I parted them. I said what are you fighting about. A woman made answer, that man has been ill used, speaking of the deceased. I went up to the prisoner, and said, what do you mean by kicking up a row, you rascal; you are an officer, instead of making peace you break it. I gave him a shove, and when he recovered himself, he started and run from the deceased. I laid hold of the deceased; I said, you go this way, the contrary way, this is your way home; he said, no, this is my way, that man has ill used me; and if I can overtake him, I will give him a wapping. I held him until the prisoner had got fifty yards, and then he went after the prisoner, and he turned the corner; they were both out of my sight. I heard a noise. I walked on until I came to the corner, and then I heard a great noise near the Globe; when I came within twenty yards of the mob, there was the deceased. I found the deceased falling against some pales. I went up to him, knowing him to be the person that caused this row; I said, it is of no use your shamming drunk, I have seen enough of your sort. I laid hold of him, and put him on his back.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did this man die - A. About a quarter of an hour, or half an hour after, he dropped. We carried him from that place to the Globe public-house, and there the surgeon came. I was not five yards from him until the surgeon came.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were there, did you see the prisoner that night - A. I saw the prisoner come to the Globe steps. After we had taken the deceased to the Globe steps, the prisoner came up; he said, I have got into a pretty rig. I said, it serves you right, if you have done this; the man is dead. I had got hold of the captain then.</p>

            . Q. On the night in question, were you in Poplar High-street - A. I came out of the Globe public-house; the deceased came running by me as I was coming out. He cried, stop thief. I ran immediately a-head, and the deceased ran a-head of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any person before you running - A. No, I saw no person until I came up to captain Williamson. The prisoner was behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. You, I believe, laid hold of captain Williamson - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You were engaged in a conflict two or three minutes with captain Williamson - A. Yes, I was down, and when I got up again, captain Williamson knocked me down; and when I got up, I looked round, and saw the deceased had fell down; he never rose again. Seabrook was with me.</p>

I do not know which; he said, is that you Joe. He said he had been in a row by the New Road, and he had escaped by jumping over pales and ditches; and he had pulled his hat and jacket off, and laid them upon Mrs. Cardell's bench: and there was, he also said, a noise at the Globe; did I hear it.

            . I am a watchman. I went to the prisoner's house that night, and took him into custody. I told him he must come to the watch-house. He said what for. I said here is a man murdered. He said what good can I do. I said it would look much better, as he was an officer, to come without fetching. I took him to the watch-house. Going along, he said tomorrow I suppose, I shall be hanged.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. All this conversation passed between you and him, before that he had been to see the deceased with the last witness - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>- PRESTON. I produce the knife. It is duller now than it was then; it had the appearance of being fresh rubbed upon a stone or something of that kind.</p>

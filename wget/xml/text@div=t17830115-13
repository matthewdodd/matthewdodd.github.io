               <p>On the 24th of last December I had been out as assistant patrol belonging to Sir Sampson Wright, and coming down Tottenham-court road, near Chapel-street, I met a man with a sack on his back, about ten minutes after twelve, I was going home off duty; I asked what he had got, he said apples; I felt on them, and thought they were apples, onions, or potatoes, I asked him where he brought them from, he hesitated a little, and I ordered him to lay them down; he did so, and I collared him and called the watchman: then up came a woman, I think it was the prisoner, but I cannot be positive to her, she was in a great flurry, and she asked if I had seen a child go past without a hat, I said no, I suspected the woman belonged to the man; she went past, and the man called out, Sister! sister! she came back, and I let go the man, for fear I should have to encounter with them both, and he ran away: the watch was not come all this time, I called to him again to take care of the sack; I followed the man and retook him, and carried him to the watch-house.</p>

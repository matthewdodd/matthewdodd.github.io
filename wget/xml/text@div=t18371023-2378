                  </hi>. I belong to the North of Ireland, but have been latterly in America, in the cloth business. I arrived in this country on the 6th of October—I was living at No. 20, King-street, Tower-hill—on the evening of the 12th I was standing at St. Katharine's Docks for nearly two hours—I had been drinking at three public-houses—I believe I met with the prisoners about eight o'clock that night—I saw Donahoo first opposite St. Katharine Dock gate—I knew nothing of him before—he said he was a sailor formerly, and was one at that time, but had been out of employment—he spoke to me first—he said he was in need on some trifling assistance, and said, "Will you be so kind as to treat me?"—I said, "Yes, I never saw a sailor who I was not willing to treat or assist"—the prisoner Kellett was quite <hi rend="italic">handy</hi> while I was talking to him, and he came forwards—I cannot say whether I spoke to him first, or he to me, but he was on my right band, and I said there was no sailor or soldier who I would not willingly treat—(he is a soldier)—they walked with me into a public-house opposite the Dock gate, but before that the female prisoner came up, and Donahoo introduced her as his wife, and said, would I be willing to treat his wife?—I said, "Yes, I will"s—we all went into a public-house opposite, and had something to drink, which I paid for—we staid there two hours, to the best of my knowledge, and then went to another public-house in the same street—we all went in, and had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183710230168"></xptr>
               <p>something to drink, which I paid for, and remained there nearly two hours to the best of my knowledge—we then went to a third public-house not far off—all the prisoners were in company with me—I treated them again there, and remained there, I dare say, nearly two hours—after that we came out, and I proposed to go to my residence—Donahoo said, as I was so kind to them he wished me to go and take a cup of tea with him and his wife, and invited the soldier also—I begged to be excused, saying I had a coffee-house where I boarded, but he insisted that I should follow, and with great reluctance I consented, and we all four walked away together—it was then about half-past four o'clock in the morning—when I first met the prisoners I was neither drunk nor sober—I had taken some ale and porter—I was capable of understanding what I was about—I consider I was more sober at half-past four o'clock, when I agreed to go home to tea with them, than I was before—as capable of knowing myself as when I met with them—I did not drink much at the three public-houses—Donahoo did not say where he lived—he said it was convenient—I went with them into Angel-alley, Whitechapel—it is a lonely place—there was a wall on the left side—when I got within three feet of the further end of the alley, Donahoo took hold of me by the collar with both hands, and put me down on my back by the collar, against the wall of the alley—he put me com<lb></lb>pletely down on the flags, with my hat right up against the wall—he did not say any thing at that time—the prisoner Kellett was standing within two paces of us, and the woman within three paces—neither of them said a word—Donahoo put both his knees on my chest, put his fingers or thumb on each side of my neck, and squeezed my throat, so that I could not speak—he took one of his hands away, and then I had liberty to speak, and said, "Gentlemen, for God's sake, save my life, and take all I have"—Donahoo said nothing to that, but held me by the neck with one hand, and put his other to my fob—I caught hold of my seal and held it fast, and he tore the fob away and took my watch—here is the tear it made—the fob was torn out—the ribbon broke, I held the seal and ring, and he got the watch—he then put his hand to my vest—I cannot say whether it was the right or left hand—I cannot say whether it was the same hand as he took the watch with—his hand did not depart from it throat till the watch was taken from my pocket, and the money from it vest—I am positive of that—he took a snuff-box from my vest, which had fifty-two sovereigns in it—I had also two sovereigns in a purse, besides, at the time I first met them—I changed one sovereign at the first public house, as my silver was expended—when I was in the first public-house I took my box out, took the lid off, and closed it again, and pot it into my pocket, but took no money out of it—I turned my back to ray company at the bar, as I did not wish them to know what I had in it—I know it had spent none of that money—I cannot say whether the prisoners saw the box at that time—I only looked at it, shut it, and put it into my pocket again—I had my back to them, therefore I thought they did not see it—I did not take the box out after that at all—after Donahoo took the box out of my pocket, he liberated me—he got off me, and as soon as I got on my feet, I got away as quick as I could, leaving them all three together behind me—I cannot say how long exactly T was in the alley—the other prisoners did not say or do any thing to me while Donahoo was taking the money—when he first seized hold of me, the other two were standing close by, and I saw them within a few inches of the same ground when I went away—as soon as I got into the street, I saw three or four men, and went</p>

               <p>right forward among them, and told them I had been robbed—one of them called a policeman, who came, and I told him what had happened—about two or three hours after, I went to the station-house, and saw the three prisoners there in custody, and identified them as the persons who had been with me—I saw my watch at the office the same morning, but I have serer found my sovereigns.</p>

Last Friday week I landed at the St. Katha<lb></lb>rine's Docks, from America—I met the prisoner Kellett, the soldier, Bear the gate of St. Katharine's Docks yesterday morning about half past four o'clock—I treated him at three different public-houses—the sailor prisoner I saw about twenty minutes after I saw the soldier—the tailor represented the woman prisoner as his wife—I treated them then—then walked in company with them some distance—they brought me into an alley or lane—the sailor put me up against the wall in this alley, and then he put me down and put his knee on my chest—he put hit thumbs or his fingers under my chin to choke me—I had a watch in my pocket at the same time, and he put his hand in and tore my fob out, the best part of it, and took the watch out of it—then he put his hand into my waistcoat pocket and took out a snuff-box containing fifty-two sovereigns in gold—I said, "Gentlemen, save my life and take all I have"—the soldier was within two paces of the sailor, and the woman about three, standing by at the same time—the soldier did not put hands to me in no way—I then ran out of the alley as quick as I could—I do not know where the sailor and the other went to—I saw the consta<lb></lb>ble now present (Richard Thompson) soon after I got out of the alley—I know I had my money safe not twenty minutes before 1 was robbed—my waistcoat pocket was torn as well as my fob—that was done by the sailor in taking my snuff box.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty, in Whitechapel, on the morning of the 13th—about twenty minutes before six o'clock I was informed of the robbery, and went into Essex-street—I met Donahoo, coining out of a court in Essex-street, four or five hundred yards from Angel-alley, seven or eight minutes after I heard of the robbery—I asked him if he had been drinking with a soldier and sailor—he said, "Yes," and I took him into custody—he said he knew nothing of the man at all—I found nothing on him relating to the robbery.</p>

About nine o'clock, on the morn<lb></lb>ing of the 13th, I met the prisoner Picton in Cable-street—I followed her to Mr. Ramsden's, the pawnbroker's, and asked her if she had pawned her husband's watch—she said, "Yes"—I said, "Where?"—she said, "In Ratcliffe-highway"—I asked her for the duplicate—she said, "Why, to tell you the truth, I have not pawned it at all, I have sold it right out, for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—she took me to Findley's shop, in Ratc<lb></lb>liffe-highway, and said, "Come with me, I will show you; I don't we, it is my husband's watch"—I asked her where her husband was—she said he was drinking at a house in East Smithfield—I did not ask his name—she took me to Findley's. and I saw the watch there—she saw it, and said, "There is the watch"—I took her to the sta<lb></lb>tion-house—she gave up 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said she had lent 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to another woman, who was at the station-house, aid that woman gave up 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

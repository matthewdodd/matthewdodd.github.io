                  </hi>. I am a constable of the London Docks; the prisoner was an extra labourer there. On the 28th of November, about one o'clock in the day, he passed me on the north quay, coming direct from the indigo warehouses—his hat was unsteady on his head, I followed, stopped him, and asked if he had any thing in his hat—he said, "Nothing"—I asked him to take it off, he refused, and I took it off for him, and found in it this indigo, which I produce—I asked how he came by it—he at first said,</p>

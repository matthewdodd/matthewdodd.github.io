                  </hi>. I am a gas-fitter, of No. 7, Snow-hill. I have seen the prisoner two or three times; he is a smith and bell-hanger—on the evening of 16th April he came to my place, and said he had got a job for a gentleman in the country, one of his customers, to fit up his house with a lot of gas-fittings—he went into the shop with me, and pointed out a double-jointed bracket—I had done one little job before for him, to the amount of about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., three or four months before—he said he should want nine of them, and one three-light, to the amount of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 300 feet of 5-8th inch tin pipe, and a meter—he wanted to know the price, because he said he had to tell the gentleman the price before he gave him the job—I went into the counting-house—one of my clerks summed up the price, and I told him it would be 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he would let me know next morning, as soon as he had seen the gentleman—next morning I received these two letters from him (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not see him afterwards about them—(<hi rend="italic">the policeman, Moss, deposed to the letters being in the prisoner's writing: read</hi>—"Sir,—I have seen the gentleman this morning concerning the gaswork which I waited on you yesterday; and as I have got the same at a very little more than I shall have to pay you, shall require a short credit; and the order must be com<lb></lb>pleted on Wednesday evening next, without fail, as the same must be sent into the country by rail on Thursday morning")—upon that, I put the goods in hand immediately, and sent them by three lads, with my porter, on Wed<lb></lb>nesday, 21st April—about four days afterwards I sent my clerk for the money; after which I received the second letter—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"23, Old Fish-street, April 30th. Mr. Meacock,—I am extremely sorry I could not settle you're account, owing to being disappointed myself. I must beg of you to wait till about three weeks, and then I am promised cash; or, if it will suit you better to draw a bill for two months from the date of my order, I will accept it; it will suit me much better. And I require, to complete my order, one more chandelier, the same pattern; 100 feet of pipe, and four more brackets; and as soon as I have completed the above I can draw. Awaiting your reply, &amp;c, H. <hi rend="smallCaps">LEE</hi>.")—on 3rd May I went to Whatmore's, in Cow-cross, who deals in iron pipe and gas fittings—the first thing I saw was the meter I had supplied to the prisoner—I knew it by the number—we number every one of them—the goods I sold the prisoner were worth 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Whatmore is not here—he showed me a receipt—he was bound over by the Magistrate, but has not appeared since—I went with a policeman in plain clothes to the</p>

               <p>prisoner's shop, and saw a female—I afterwards saw the prisoner, and said, "By your letter, I understand you want some more goods"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "What is it you want?"—he went into the counting-house, turned over a book, and said, "I remember now; I want four more double-jointed brackets, 100 feet of pipe, and one more chandelier"—I said, "Have you fixed the others?"—he said, "Yes"—I asked him who the gentleman was he had got the order from—he said he did not think that concerned me—I said I thought it did—he said, "Then I shan't tell you"—I said, "Well, if you won't tell me, you will tell somebody else perhaps, for this party standing beside me is a policeman"—I gave him into custody—he said, could not I stop—I said, "No"—when parties have a job, and have not got the money to get goods, they come to me, and I trust them till the job is finished, and then they pay me—it was on that representation I parted with these goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 28, Cow Cross-street. I know the prisoner—on Saturday 17th April, he brought me two old taps, which I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for—he asked me if I bought any brass fittings—I said, "No," and he asked if I could recommend him anybody to purchase them—I said I could recommend Mr. Whatmore, on the opposite side of the way—he said he had lost a job which he had in the country, and therefore wanted to sell the things, and they would arrive from the country on Wednesday, at 4 o'clock—I called on him on Wednesday, and took Mr. Whatmore with me—the prisoner was not at home, we went again in three quarters of an hour, and he opened the door for us—it was then a quarter to 5—he said, "Come in, they are inside the shop"—I went in, and saw a lot of brass gas fittings, a meter, several brackets, and a roll of pewter pipe—he asked 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—Mr. Whatmore said he would give 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but what he gave ultimately I do not know, as I was not there when he paid the money—he wanted a stamped receipt, and we all went to a public house—he wrote something on the receipt, and the prisoner had it in his hand until Whatmore paid him, which was not until he had got a cart and put the goods in it—I do not know where he is now—I have not seen him for above a week—he was an opposite neighbour—he gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my trouble.</p>

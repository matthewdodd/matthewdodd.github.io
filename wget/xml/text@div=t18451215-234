                  </hi>. Iam servant at the White Hart, in the Strand. On the 5th of Nov. I was leaving a situation at No. 65, Fetter-lane—I just took my wages, and was walking down Leather-lane—there was a Guy Fawkes and some fire-works—while I was there the prisoner Hore came up to me, and I felt his hand in my pocket—I took hold of it, and he made his escape and ran away—I looked at his face when I took hold of his hand—I am sure he is the person—when he ran away I ran after him—I had in my pocket five sovereigns, and twelve shillings and sixpence, and he took it all—I had not a penny-piece more than he took—it was what I had earned for my wages while I was in service—I caught Hore, and charged him with robbing me—I had not been showing my money to anybody, and do not know how he knew I had it—when I caught the prisoner there was no policeman by—there was a postman standing by, and a young woman, who is here—they said I should not part with Hore till they saw a policeman—the prisoner Pocock then came up—he said that Hore had none of my money, he scratched my hands, and I was obliged to let Hore go—I did not see Pocock at the time Hore took my money—it was in a silk glove, inside a leather glove, in my pocket, which was inside two of my pet<lb></lb>ticoats—the money and the gloves were gone, and none of them have been found since.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the prosecutrix on that day, and I saw Hore—I had seen him once before with a gang of boys on Saffron-hill—I saw him draw something white up the prosecutrix's gown, and put it into his own pocket—I looked round to see where the Guy Fawkes was—I then saw Hore run, and he called three boys after him—when he got half-way down the street there is a turning on the left-hand side, and I there saw him give 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a piece to each of the three boys—he then said, 'Here comes the <hi rend="italic">mall,"</hi> and they ran on to New-street—the postman then came up, and I said Hore was one—Galvia then came up and said, "Oh dear, oh dear, you have robbed me; if you don't give me the money I will hold you till the policeman comes"—Pocock then came up, gave the postman a thump on the back, and went and scratched the prosecutrix on her fingers—he got Hore away, and took him to a wall, where he jumped down to get into Sbarp's-alley—I saw Hore give something; and I think it was a glove and some silver, to a boy in a white flannel jacket, and he said, "Halve that between Pocock and Hill"—directly they saw the woman coming they ran off—Pocock stopped—I cried, "Stop thief!"—Po<lb></lb>cock put his leg before me, and threw me down on my nose.</p>

I remember seeing Hore and three more boys coming out of Saffron-hill to New-street—Galvin and Connor were running after him—the postman said, "Is this one?"—Galvin said, "Yes," and she caught hold of him first, and then the postman—in three or four minutes Pocock came up and said, "Let the boy go, he has done nothing"—he then hit the postman hard on the back, and scratched the prosecutrix's hand—she said, "Oh dear, oh dear, you have robbed me"—Pocock said, "I will hold him, if you let him go, till the policeman comes"—Pocock then let him go, and Hore jumped down, ran, and dropped a sixpence or a shilling, and a boy, with a white flannel jacket on, got it—I ran and got before Hore, and stopped him.</p>

On the 12th of November, I went to bed about eleven o'clock; I was the last person that was up, the doors were locked, and the windows were fastened. I left the key of the outer door on the ledge of the window, under the shutters, in order that my son (who was out), might let himself in; I had left it there before, but not often. The prisoner knew that I sometimes left it there for my son, for he has sometimes come home and slept with him. My husband got up at a little before seven o'clock the next morning; I got up soon after him; when I got up I missed the articles which are mentioned in the indictment. I have seen them all since; they ar  in possession of the officer.</p>

               <p>THOMAS PARKER. I am the son of the last witness. On the night of the 11th of November, I was in company with the prisoner, at a public house in the Minories, till about twelve o'clock; I then left him and went towards home; on my way home, I went to a ball at the Auction Mart. I remained there till about four o'clock. When I got home I found the key in the door. I used to find it in the window. The prisoner has slept with me twice, when I have found the key in the window. I went in and went to bed directly; I took the key in with me, I locked the door; I got up after my father and mother in the morning. Several things were gone; none of the windows were unfastened, so that the person must have entered at the door, and with a key. When I went in, I took the key inside, and found it inside the next morning.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SUMMERS. I am headborough of St. George's; I found the pelisse, work-bag, and tea-caddy upon the prisoner, about three o'clock in the morning, he was in Ratcliff-highway, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's house, I was waiting there for him, as I had information that a man had engaged a bed at the Bunch of Grapes public-house; I went there, and asked him what he had done with the bundle, as I understood he had one. He brought down the pelisse, tea-caddy, sheet, gown, two waiters, and a work-bag, they have been in my possession ever since - He said they were his property. I was taking him to the watch-house, when we had got a little way in he wished me good morning, and set off with the bundle, I pursued him, took him, and locked him up.</p>
               <p>LAMMAS CAREY. I am a patrole in the Commercial-road; on the morning of the 12th, the prisoner passed me with a bundle, I called to him to know what he had got - He ran off; I called out stop thief; it was about twenty minutes before three o'clock; he had a box tied up in a white cloth, he flung it down, and said you may take it, I do not know what is in it; he got away, I did not see him again until he was taken. It was moon-light. I only saw one side of his face, he had a blue coat on; I had never seen him before.</p>
               <p>Court. How then can you swear to his being the same man - A. I charged him with it the next morning, and he never said a word, either one way or the other; I opened the box, and found a parrot in it, alive, and a bason of soup, which appeard to be victuals for the bird. He was coming from Batty-place way.</p>
               <p>MRS. PARKER. The things were safe the night before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been with Thomas Parker; I was looking about for a night's lodging, and as I was going in I found the things by the step of the door.</p>

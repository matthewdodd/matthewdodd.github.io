On the 21st of March, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was washing myself in the corner of my shop, and when I had done, I went into my back parlour to get a towel; I was standing against the door, and heard something - I saw the prisoner, with a box out of the till in the counter, in his hand; I went up, and missed from the box a half-crown and three shillings, which I had seen in it a few minutes before - I detained the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. On which side of the counter was I? A. On the side next the door; you had the box out of the till, and your left hand was in your pocket - you asked what was in the box; I told you; you pulled the money out of your pocket, and said, "It is my own money" - there had been 5s. 6d. in silver, and another sixpence among the copper; there was 8s. or 10s. more in the till; I took you by the collar, but did not take the money from your pocket - you produced it yourself; the till was half shut - the box had been in the middle of the till, in the back part; there was no other money in the box - the box was on the counter; one of his hands was in the box, and one in his pocket.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was called in, and took the prisoner - this half-crown and 3s. were given me by the prosecutor's wife; I did not see any other money; she said a sixpence dropped among the half-pence when this was taken from the till.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did she not take this out of the till? A. It was in the box, and I did not see any other money but the sixpence; this is the box.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was said? A. It was said that he had robbed the till of this money, which he said was his own - he said it was the remainder of 2l. which he had when he left Liverpool.</p>

On the Saturday fortnight I came up from Liverpool; I had two sovereigns when I started; I happened to go into that shop; the prosecutor seized me by the throat, and said, "If you do not give up the money, I will make you; "he put his hand into my pocket, and took out this money, which he gave his wife, who put it into the till.</p>
               <p>MR. MACKEY. I cannot be mistaken in what I say - I am certain he had the box in his possession, and his hand in it - the box had before been in the till to keep the silver away from the halfpence; a sharp pointed pair of scissors were found on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 66, Margaret Street, Cavendish Square—I am a single woman—on the evening of 10th February, about 8 o'clock, I was in Judd Street, Euston Road—I went to a coffee-house to leave some percels, and then met the prisoners Willett and Harper, at the corner of the Eustonton Road—it was a very cold night; they were standing disconsolate, and I said to them, "Will you come and have something to drink to warm you?"—we went into a public-house—they had a quartern of gin, and I had 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of brandy and water, warm—we were there about three-quarters of an hour—a guard, belonging to the Midland Railway, was in one of the compartments, and I asked him what time the train left for Victoria—I did not distinctly understand what he said, and I went from my compartment to his, and he told me if I would come across the road he would tell me the correct time—I was followed into the other compartment first by Willett and Harper, and Lountain came in afterwards—the barman told the guard to be careful, for he saw the prisoners watching me, and he had better get me away; he said that in the prisoners' hearing—the guard said to me, "You had better come away from here, I don't think it is quite right," and as I was making my way to go with him, Harper said, "Don't let her go with those rings on her finger; give her a blow"—I turned round and said, "I think it is very unkind of you, I have treated you in a lady-like manner, and I think you might have returned it in the same way"—Harper then struck me on the forehead and chest, and knocked me down before the bar, and then they were all three down on the top of me at once, and Lountain put her hand into my bosom and took my purse and my pocket-handkerchief, which was with it—I had no pocket in my dress—I knew I had lost it in the house, but I said nothing till I got outside; I then directly said I lost my purse—there were two plain-clothes men standing there—I did not know they were policemen—a constable in uniform came up, and I told him I had lost my purse—Harper and Lountain went away, and changed their hats for bonnets—Willett stayed there a little time till she saw the constable come, then she ran away; the constable brought her back, and I said, "That is one"—he said, "Do you charge her with being connected in the robbery of your purse?" and I said, "Yes"—she had my pocket-handkerchief in her pocket; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was quite sober, and so were the prisoners—I had taken out my purse to pay for the drink—I was about to change a sovereign, but the barman told me not to do that, and I put it back again, and paid with a shilling—my purse con<lb></lb>tained three sovereigns, a half-sovereign, a half-crown, a two shilling piece, and a sixpence.</p>

I am a watchman in the employ of the Midland Rail<lb></lb>way Company, at St. Pancras—I was at the Euston Tavern, in Judd Street, on this night, about 11 o'clock—I saw the prosecutrix there with the three prisoners—I did not see them come in; they were standing at the bar when I went in—I was in uniform—the prosecutrix made some inquiry about what time the train left King's Cross for Victoria—I told her I did not know, but if she would come over to the station I would tell her, as I had the time tables there—she came round to my compartment—Willett and Harper came round almost at the same time, and Lountain very shortly after—the prosecutrix said she had left her luggage at a coffee-house opposite; she wanted to go to Southampton by the first train, would I be so kind as to tell her—I said if she came over to the station I would—I was leaving the bar to go over to the station, and turned round to see if she was following me, with the door in my hand, and I saw Harper strike her, and the other two pushed on the top of her, hustled her—directly the prosecutrix got outside the door, she said, "I have lost my purse, it is stolen," or words to that effect—they all came out of the door together—Harper and Lountain immediately ran away, Willett remained—I had seen the prosecutrix with a purse in her hand when she paid for the liquor—she was perfectly sober, and the prisoners also, to the best of my opinion.</p>

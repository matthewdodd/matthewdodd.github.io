               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How long have you been watch there? - Three years.</p>

               <p>Court to Watchman. How many pieces of beef were there? - I saw three come through the bars, but there were more? there were four carried to Guild-hall.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It may happen that you may swear this to be your property; by what marks do you understand it? - There is a method we have in trimming beef for salting to go abroad, a different method from any other beef that is salted, and the larger piece is what we call a veiny piece, it was of my own putting into salt on the Saturday in the evening; it is a rule to lay it in salt on Saturday, and to resalt it on Monday; I know these pieces of beef to be my putting in salt; I will swear to the whole of them, from the mode we chop them, and trim them.</p>
               <p>But knowing that you are in a considerable way of business, you do not chop and trim a great deal? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Do you swear these were your own chopping and trimming? - I swear that the largest piece was mine.</p>
               <p>I wish we could have seen them as they were salted? - They are not here.</p>
               <p>I suppose that in that part of the world, there are some butchers who salt for shipping besides yourself? - Numbers; there is one person in that neighbourhood, that now and then does a little matter; I mean to swear that I know all the pieces of beef, which were four, to be mine.</p>
               <p>You talked of six just now? - That was a mistake of mine.</p>
               <p>That proves that you are mortal, that proves that you are fallible? - We are all fallible sometimes.</p>
               <p>Might not you forget the number of ribs, and the size of the piece, and the manner of trimming it? - There is but one mode of chopping.</p>
               <p>Then there was a veiny piece, and you remember putting a veiny piece into pickle some days before? - Yes, Sir, but I do not verily believe, because I wish that to be out of the question; I swear directly to that veiny piece of beef, to be a piece of beef of my own trimming, and on the Saturday night having salted it.</p>
               <p>Now will you swear another thing as directly; that is, that it had not been sold? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many people sell in your shop? - Four or five.</p>
               <p>You are not always at home? - I am much at home.</p>
               <p>Then these four or five people might have sold this, if it had been applied for? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Were the two prisoners in the number of those that might have sold for you? - They were.</p>
               <p>And there were three other persons that had the same right? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long had your shop been shut up that evening? - It had not been shut up.</p>
               <p>Court. Were those pieces all salted beef? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you happen to have in your slaughter-house at that time, any salted beef that you had borrowed, that was not your own? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long had these people lived with you? - Woodward six months, the other about five weeks.</p>

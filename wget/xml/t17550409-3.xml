I went to the house of one Larkin, where they lived, in Drury-lane, and there found the prisoner in the cellar, with part of the goods in his pocket, and we found part under his bed betwixt that and the sacking; we found all the goods except two table-spoons and five teaspoons. We took the prisoner before the justice, he said there, he saw a man break open the shutter of my house, and he chucked the things into his apron, and bid him go about his business, and he never saw the man before in his life. I made a remark before the justice, that the glass of the window was bloody, the justice ordered us to look at the prisoner's hands, I found two scratches on them that seemed to be quite fresh done; the justice committed him to New-prison.</p>
               <p>Henry Green. I live at the White-hart-inn in Long-acre; I am constable; the prosecutor brought a warrant to me to search the house of Larkin; I went and met with the woman that the prisoner called his wife, she seemed to be startled, and said she did not belong to the house. I asked her where she lived? she said, in the cellar. I went down into it, there I found the prisoner; I searched his pockets, and found a large table-spoon. I took him to justice Fielding's, and found these spoons and salt-shovels by searching him there; he owned to the justice he was at the prosecutor's shop, and another man chucked the things into his apron; this he said was in St. Martin's-lane where the prosecutor lives. I went to his cellar again, there I found these other things, (producing them in the two parcels, and deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing of his holding his apron in order to have the things chucked in?</p>

            . I live with Mr. Tripp's father. The morning the shop was broke open, I went out, in order to have the things stopt, if I could meet with them. At one place I got information the prisoner's wife had offered a pair of tea-tongs to sale, and by that means I found the prisoner out. I went with the prosecutor and constable to the cellar where he lives; I saw him come out of the corner of the room. He strove to hide himself; I stopt him, and took out of his pocket a silver table-spoon, the prosecutor's property. They took him to the justice. I staid behind, and searched about for other things, and between the bed and bedding I found these other spoons tied up in a handkerchief. I carried them to justice Fielding, and as there were more spoons missing, the constable went again with me; we found no more, but by turning up the bed, found a saw and a gimblet. We asked the prisoner, before Mr. Fielding, how he came by the things? He said, as he was coming along to go to Charing-cross, a man chucked these things into his apron, and bid him be hush and say nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he held out his apron for that purpose?</p>
               <p>Underwood. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before that?</p>
               <p>Underwood. No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you know him before?</p>

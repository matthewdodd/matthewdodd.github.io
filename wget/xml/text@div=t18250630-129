I lost a silver watch from my fob - I saw it on Wednesday, when the prisoner was stopped.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Bradley. pawnbroker, of Brown's-lane, Spitalfields. On the 31st of May, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner pawned a watch with me for 30 s. - I am sure of his person. I asked where he got it - he said it was his own. I swear positively that he is the man; I never saw him before; he came again next day, and I gave him in charge: Smith saw the watch and claimed it.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw the prosecutor till I was at the watch-house. I got the property from a person unknown to me, at a public-house in Whitechapel; he exposed it for sale in the tap-room - 2 l. was asked for it; he entreated me to pawn it; the man asked how I got it - I said</p>
               <p>"A young man outside sent me with it;" I came out and the man sold me the duplicate - I went next day to borrow more on it and was detained.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John James, of Brunswick-square—the prisoner was my cook for six months. On the night of the 2nd of March I found her in a state of intoxication, and I discharged her—she left about nine or half-past nine the same evening—this towel has my name on it in my own handwriting—these other things I have no doubt are mine—they were kept in my store-room, the key of which was kept in a closet in the dining-room—I think the prisoner could not have access to the key that day—on the Thursday following she returned for her clothes, and was given in charge—these articles were discovered on the Saturday night.</p>

On the 2nd of March, at a quarter past nine o'clock at night, the prisoner came to our area-gate, rang the bell, and said to me, "Give me my basket, which I threw over into your garden"—(she could throw a basket there from Mr. James's)—I went into our garden and saw a basket containing soap and candles, and there were some candles out of the basket in the garden—I went back to the prisoner, and told her it was more than I dared to do, to give it her—she said, "Don't get me into trouble"—she went away—a policeman came and took the basket—this is it.</p>

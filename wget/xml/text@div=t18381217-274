                  </hi>. I am post-boy at the George, at Hounslow. On the 5th of September I was on the road—I took the prisoners up in my post-chaise, and drove them to the One Ton, at Brentford—I set them down there—I lost my whip from the chaise—I had seen it safe when I put it in the chaise, at Piccadilly—nobody but them had been in the chaise since then—I went back to the One Ton, and the prisoners were gone—they were afterwards found at Lee's lodging-house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">James Watts. Q.</hi> What o'clock did you leave London? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two o'clock, and got to Hounslow between four and five o'clock—there was one person outside the chaise—you were taken into custody about ten minutes after I missed the whip—the landlord assisted you and your wife out at Brentford—I took up the man that was outside, at Kew-bridge, and put him down at Hounslow—he was not inside the chaise at all—we went into the One Ton, and had a glass of gin at the bar—your wife had a bundle then—I will take my oath nobody but you had access to the chaise from London to Hounslow.</p>

On the afternoon of the 5th of December I received information from Haynes, and went with him to several lodging-houses—we found the prisoners at Lee's lodging-house about five o'clock—I asked the male prisoner if he had a bundle—he said he had—Lee fetched it out of another room—I opened it, and found the whip in it—he said the bundle was his before it was opened, and that be knew nothing about the whip.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoners put in a written defence, stating that they found the whip on the top of their bundle after the prosecutor was gone; that James Watts went after him, and not being able to find him they put it into the bundle, intending to give it to him next day.</hi>)</p>

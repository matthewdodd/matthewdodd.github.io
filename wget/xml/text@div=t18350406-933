                  </hi>. I am the son of Hallows Hatfield, a silk manufacturer, of Wheler-street, Spitalfields. On Saturday, the 7th of March, I was at the top of the stairs of the house—I saw the prisoner come and open the side door, which was fastened with a catch, which springs out from the lock, and holds the door when it is too—I cannot push the door open—the side door opens into a passage, under a gateway—it is the door of the house—he opened it, walked in, took the scraper and clogs, and walked away with them immediately—I pursued, and came up with him about three or four doors off—I told him to take them back to Where he brought them from—he walked back, put them in their places, and I gave him in charge—I am sure the door was shut too—it opens from the outside with a handle and latch—if the latch had not caught, it might be opened by being pushed.</p>

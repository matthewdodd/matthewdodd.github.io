             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was supervisor of the excise at Lewes, in Sussex. On the 24th of January, my being a supervisor, I had been to a little town called <placeName id="t17940917-7-crimeloc35">Huckford</placeName>

I do not recollect that he made me any answer what was in the cask; on which I perceived one of them, not the prisoner, drawing round behind me, and I had a small sword in my hand, and with which I struck on one of the casks, in order to stave it, to satisfy myself perfectly what liquor was in it, and could not the first time, and I saw then a peg in one of the casks, which had been bored, I suppose in order that they might drink a little, to refresh themselves by the way; on my stopping down to pull out the peg out of this cask, in order to prove the quality of the liquor, to make the seizure, they immediately struck me with both their hands with these large sticks on my head; I was obliged to strike the cask the second time before I could stave it, and the li<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170046"></xptr>quor rushed out in a very violent manner, by the time I had done this I had received several violent blows on my head, and across my arm, on which I said to the prisoner, do you mean to murder me? and I attempted to run, and fell to the ground, and they continued beating me in that manner across the head, and I put my arms over my head laying on the ground, I attempted to get up three times, and did get up on my feet three times, and I was scarcely up but what I received blows that I fell to the ground again; on which I entreated them not to murder me, in the most supplicating manner I could, and I thought they said, when I was laying on the ground, d-mn him, it is too good for him, and they continued beating me till I was quite senseless, and I laid some time in that manner, and when I came to myself I began to get up, I put my hand up to my eyes and found the blood, and I had two or three cuts in my head, cuts three or four inches; it is impossible for me to describe what I suffered on that occasion, I attempted to rise, and I perceived the prisoners at a distance, I thought they were turning towards me, on which I got on my feet, and made the best of my way to a little house, not far from the place, where a Mrs. French resides, on which I prayed the woman to let me in, for the door was fast, she looked out of the window, and said, who are you? - I told her my name was Collings, that I was a supervisor, and how I had been used, and she admitted me into the house, which I was like to saint going in, and had liked to fall against the wall when the woman opened the door; when she let me in to the best of my recollection, she first got a chair for me, and afterwards she got a bed down, and threw it on the floor, and I laid on that bed the remainder of that evening, when I was carried up stairs by two or three gentlemen farmers in the neighbourhood, I was quite unable to move my hand, or stand upon my feet; I was in that situation, suffering most excruciating pain for four days, before the doctor would permit me to be removed home to my own house, at Lewes; my arms were dreadfully bruised indeed, so that I have not the use of this hand to this day, a bone was broke in this hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you got to Lewis before you was capable of pursuing your business? - Upwards of nine weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the man? - I have not the least doubt but that is the man, if I was to die to morrow; when I arrested him it was at a little cottage, at his own house, and the man seemed very much alarmed, and screamed exceedingly, I said to him, Mich, how could you think of using a fellow creature as you did me; on which he said, I am very sorry for it, I have had no peace of mind ever since, the other began first, or else I should not have done it, you know I was running away.</p>
               <p>Jury. You say you fell, was the prisoner at the bar the man that struck you after that? - A great many times, I had so many blows that I cannot remember, I was black entirely from head to foot, I was all over bruises.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am very sorry for what I have done.</p>

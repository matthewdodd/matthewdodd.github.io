On the night of the 10th of April the prisoner came into the shop, and asked for half-an-ounce of snuff—I commenced weighing it—I looked at him very hard, because he stood by some cigars, and I saw him take a box of cigars off the counter, and run out of the shop—I called to a lad who stood at the bottom of the shop to follow him, which he did—this is the box which I saw him take—it was full at the time.</p>

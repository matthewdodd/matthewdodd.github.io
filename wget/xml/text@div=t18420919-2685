               <p>of the house—I returned on the 27th of July, and observed a white bed curtain had been taken from a press in another part of the house, and had been put up—I spoke to her about it—she said she had pushed the wardrobe open, and got it—she left the following day of her own accord—I searched, and missed different things—among them was a scarf and a pair of trowsers—the scarf was kept in a drawer, which was locked when I left—she had no right to go to that drawer—the trowsers were on a chair by the side of the bed—when I came home I found the drawer shut, but the lock had been forced—this is the scarf.</p>

About half-past ten o'clock on a Wednesday, (I do not know what day of the month) I received a parcel from my sister—it contained an old scarf and an old pair of trowsers—the prosecutor came to our house and took them away—there was a little old frock with one sleeve out and a few old rags.</p>

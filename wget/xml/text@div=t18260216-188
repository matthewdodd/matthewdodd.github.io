On the 28th of January, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon I saw the prisoner inside the gate, and two others outside - the handle of the gate was broken - I pushed the gate in and collared the prisoner - he dropped one of the knobs of the gate, and the constable found some of the brass on him; the gate is a part of Mr. Grenough's premises.</p>

            . I am a constable. Mr. Conway gave me charge of the prisoner. I took from him this part of the brass handle and knob, which appeared to have been on the gate; it might be worth 1s. 6d. when new; some other knobs were found on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Gentlemen. I went on Saturday to see a funeral, but I could not get in; as I passed this door, I saw the knob rolling from the door; my hat fell off, and while I was stooping to pick it up, I dropped 1d. out of my hand; while I stooped for that, a boy came and threw something down, which appeared to be this knob.</p>
               <p>JURY to CONWAY. Q. What did the other boys do? A. They ran away when they saw me coming - they had not time to give the prisoner any thing - he was inside the gate and did not speak a word.</p>

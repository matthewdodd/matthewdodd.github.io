            . I am a Police-constable. On<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050042"></xptr>the morning of the 23rd of March, between two and three o'clock, I was near the prosecutor's premises, in Kensington-gravel-pits; I heard a step, and then heard some person say, "Lay still" - I saw a cart near the wall; I went to it, and found in it two sacks of kitchen stuff, and saw some person laying down; I said,"What are you doing there?" - Clark got up and ran, and I after him, about one hundred yards, but I took him without losing sight of him; I went back, and saw Watts about three hundred yards from the prosecutor's, coming home- I took him, and asked who he had been with; he said,"With Clark and Avile" - I asked him to show me where Avile lived; he told me, and I went, but I could not find him - I examined a shed which had been broken open, and the padlock was broken all to pieces.</p>

            . The cart belonged to a cowkeeper, and had discharged some grains the day before - there was no horse in it; there were marks of grease on the side of the door, as if the sacks had been lifted up; there were 126lbs. of kitchen stuff in the sacks - Clark's jacket looked greasy.</p>

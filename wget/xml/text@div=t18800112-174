                  </hi>. I was barman to Sarah Cakebread. at the Green Man, Bethnal Green—a partition divides the bur into two compartments. But when my face was towards them I could see every one in the bar—on 11th December, about 6 p.m., the prisoner came into the private compartment, And at the same time a man who is not in custody come in on the other Side, opposite where the gold is kept—there was a half-sovereign on the Shelf and some silver—I served the other man first with two of gin—he I saw two constables standing at the corner of the square, and I gave gin—he threw down a halfpenny, and said "That will not pay for it, will it?—I said "No," and went to serve the prisoner—he had two of whisky and cold water—I took his money, and then went back to the man who had</p>

               <p>put down the halfpenny and took his money—I then sat down on a stool, and the prisoner said "Have you got nice cigars?"—I took him a box of threepenny cigare—he said "These are not good enough; give me a beeter one'—I tetched the fourpeuny cigars—he turned them over, and said "What makes these spot?"—I said "I don't know," and began to get out of temper with him—he kept turning them over, and bought one—I then sat down close by the gold—he said "Give me another, these are so nice," and gave me a sovereign—he kept turning the eigars over, and said "What makes them so big at the top!"—I changed the sovereign—he kept on drawing my attention, and his eyes kept looking across to the other side of the ber—I would not turn my head because I thought he wanted to take two of three cigars instead of one—Mrs. Cakebread then came in, and said to the other man in the prisoner's hearing "What are you doing with that stick? Robert, do you see him?"—he said "What?" and rushed towards the door—I said "What, is there any gold gone?—she said "Yes, half a sovereign"—prisoner rushed out also, and they both left their grog on the counter, and when I got outside the door they were both running together—I halloaed to them—they could see me with my apron on, but they would not stop—I lost sight of the other one behind a waggon—I followed the prisoner and spoke to a constable; we both ran after him; he fell just as we got to him—the constable said "Where are you going?"—he said "To catch the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>," but there was no <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> in sight—gave him in custody.</p>

I keep the Green Man, Bethnal Green—on 11th December, about 6 p.m., I was sitting in the bar parlour, which has a glass Door frosted, and saw the shadow of a stick across the glass—I went into The bar and saw a man with a stick—he seemed to draw it over, and he Shut it up like a telescope—it made a faint clicking noise—I said "What are you doing?" and he rushed out of the house instantly without finishing His drink—I then spoke to the larman, and missed a half-sovereign—I saw the prisoner in the bar they both rushed out together—a person in the private bar can see a person in the other compartment.</p>

I was running to catch the omnibus"—I said "You could not be running to catch the omnibue, for I saw one pass during the time; I shall take you to the station for stealing half a sovereign"—I searched him at the station, and found two pounds worth of silver on him, but no gold—he was charged with stealing a half sovereign with a pers'n not arrested—he made no answe—I said "Whare do you live?—he said "I refuse my address."</p>

            . I am guard of the Balloon Birmingham coach. On the 12th of December, 1822, about twelve o'clock, I received a parcel from Messrs. Hanbury to take to Messrs. Taylor and Lloyd, at Birmingham. I put it into my pocket handkerchief, and carried it in my hand, to the Magpie and Pewter-platter public-house, where I lodge, and gave it into the care of Graves the landlord, to lock up, while I went to bed, and when I got up he gave it to me in the same state as before. I carried it in my handkerchief to the Swan and Two-necks, Lad-lane, and put it in the bottom of the coach, between the seats, on the floor of the coach. I then assisted in loading the coach, and went into the office for a few things, and on going to the coach in two or three minutes it was gone. I went and gave information at the bankers.</p>

            , No. 23, Edmund-street, Battle-bridge. I said it was not regular to take country notes of strangers, and if he would leave it, I would send him his parcel and change down, he said there was no occasion for that, he would get it changed in Covent-garden, where he was known; and while he was speaking he took the note off the counter, before I was aware of it; he seemed very much embarrassed, and began asking for patterns of furniture, and said he should be glad to have them sent down in the parcel; he went out of the shop in five or ten minutes, and did not go towards Covent-garden, so I followed him; he saw me when he had gone about twenty yards, and then went in another direction; he was going in quite a contrary direction. I followed him to Portland-place; he saw me there again, and crossed over in a crowd, to avoid me, and altered his direction again. Mr. Corder, jun., was with me; we went up and told him he must come back with us; he seemed very much frightened; he had a piece of paper in his hand, and was squezing it up, he put it into his mouth, and appeared to swallow it, we endeavoured to take him; but he fell back, and ran away about fifty yards; we followed, and took him to the shop, and kept him two hours, till master came home; while he was in the shop he said,</p>
               <p>"You have made me loose the note, you knocked it out of my hand." I said,</p>
               <p>"You know where the note is gone." he said nothing more, but that he had just found it in the New-road, that he was a poor man, and was willing to leave his coat if I would let him go.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The first witness stated that he hardly ever saw me, or that he did not know who passed the note, and yet he swears positively to me. I think I can prove that I was not there, if he will state the time; if I had time I could bring witnesses to swear that every person but one must have taken a false oath. At my second examination Tyers came and asked if I knew him; I said I did not; he said</p>

I said it was on the 23d; supposing so; I had not the book with me in which I entered the date, not being aware that I was going to be examined; the Magistrate said it did not matter, as I could refer to my book when I got home; at the second examination the prisoner heard me say that it was the 22d.</p>

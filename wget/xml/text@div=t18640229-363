Locks-field's—the prosecutor and his wife were stopping at my house for a few days; they were going out of town—on Thursday, 4th February, about a quarter or half-past 5 in the evening, the prisoner came to the house—I was in the front parlour with my husband, the pro<lb></lb>secutor, and his wife, and two friends—when the prisoner came in I said to him, "Now, I will have no row here; I don't wish you to come to my place"—I ordered Mrs. Harper up stairs, and she went—the prisoner said he bad come for no row—Harper said, "No, there is going to be no row in the house, but were we in the street or a public-house, we would see which was the best man"—the prisoner jumped up and said, "I am ready for you flow"—a scuffle took place; my table was over-turned, and the paraffin lamp knocked over, and I tried to pick it up, being afraid of an explosion—he scuffle did not last above three minutes—Harper cried out, "I am stabbed all over"—I saw no knife or anything, I was picking up my lamp—the prisoner was drunk—I found that Harper was stabbed all over.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, and live at 5, Little Chatham<lb></lb>place, Lock's-fields—I came out of prison on 30th January—on Wednesday night, 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> February, I found my wife in the street, and took her to Mrs. Edwards's—she was alone, just coming out of a public-house in Blackfriars-road—I afterwards went to a place where the prisoner had taken her to lodge and took some goods of mine away—that was on the Thursday, the day this happened—I removed the things to Mrs. Edwards's in a cab—I did not see the prisoner till he came to Mrs. Edwards's between 5 and 6—Mrs. Edwards ordered my wife up stairs, and told the prisoner she hoped he was not come there to have any disturbance—he said he was not—I said, "I suppose you have come after this woman (pointing towards my wife who was then on the stairs), if you are, I wish it was in a public-house or some other place, that we could see the result of it, for what you have done for me"—he jumped up off his seat, and said, "I am ready for you now, you b——,"—the table was in the middle of the room, and as he rushed towards me, my wife was on my left hand, and I met him, and he struck at me—I thought it was a blow from the hand, but I found it was a blow from a knife, through my lip—the next thing I found was a stab in the abdomen, and the next was across between the stomach and the heart—J cried out, "I am stabbed, I am stabbed the is letting my belly out"—I closed with him and took the knife from him, and it ran into my thumb—I saw the knife from the first time, after he drew his hand back, when he cut it through my lip; I saw the blade of the knife glitter in his hand—it was a small pen<lb></lb>knife—when I found I could not get the knife from him, I threw my arms round him, and threw him down, and held him there for half an hour, till the constable came and took him out of my hands—while I had him down on the floor, I saw him make an attempt to convey the knife away, by throw<lb></lb>ing his arms towards the grate—I called out to the doctor's son, young Mr. Dry, "He is conveying the knife away now; it is somewhere about the fire-place"—I was afterwards taken in a cab to St. Thomas's Hospital—I remained there nine days—I have no medical attendance now.</p>

On the 30th of May I missed the articles stated, from my room—the prisoner was in the habit of visiting me—when I leave my room I put my key into a knife-box which hangs outside the door—sometimes under the mat, and sometimes in another place—when I left it on that day, at six o'clock in the morning, it was in the knife-box—I came home at twelve—when I re<lb></lb>turned I had some suspicions, and went after the prisoner, and found her in John-street, St. Marylebone—two days after, I went into the prisoner's room—I told her a sister of hers had come from Liverpool, and if she would come to Kensington, she would see her at my room—the prisoner said she did not think her sister was there—I said she was—she said again she did not think she was, that she knew what brought me there, that she took the things, or stole them, I cannot say which, and burnt the duplicates—she took 31<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from her pocket, and said it was part of the produce of my pro<lb></lb>perty—most of my things had been in the drawers, which were not locked.</p>

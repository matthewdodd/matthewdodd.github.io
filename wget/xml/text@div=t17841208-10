               <p>Court. Was it day break at that time? - When I had the information, but the apprentice got up at six, and a large dog of great value, which I highly esteemed, was poisoned, and my shed, which is over my shop, and my shop were broke open and robbed, there is a stair case from my shed to my shop, and there is no communication from the shed but that; I was also informed that the back door of the shop was broke open, which I perceived was bolted the night before, the door goes into a little yard we have, which yard adjoins to a stone mason's yard; when I went into the shop I found three dozen of calf skins, worth about 12 l. 18 s. I have estimated them moderately, and three dozen of seal skins, worth 12 l. and some leather shoulders, worth about 7 l. 10 s. I imagined they carried the goods out by the back door, because we found a considerable part of the goods left in the stone mason's yard the next morning, this leather was half curried, that is, not finished or dressed, the back door was broke open by the middle bolt of the door being wrenched entirely open, and the door forced; I advertised some of the property which I did not get, and put a reward of five guineas.</p>

               <p>On the 16th of November I was at the Hind in Redcross-street, about twelve at night, and the two prisoners and another man there, I knew them a good bit before, I was drinking at the same time, and I heard these two men ask another man, whether he would go into Blue Anchor-alley, Bunhill-row, they said they knew a place that would come to about forty or fifty pounds, they said it was to nabb some skins at a Currier's.</p>
               <p>How came they to say that, so as you could hear it? - They said it at the house, and there was a large dog, and they had got some poison to poison him.</p>
               <p>Court. I should think you was part of the gang? - No, Sir, I was not, I followed them, they did not see me, I stood at the fore-part of Mr. Powell's house, they did not see me at all, and I saw the prisoner Ellis pulling down something, and the dog barked, I heard a great noise, I was by the fore part of the house by Blue Anchor alley, there is a chandler's shop right facing Mr. Powell's house.</p>
               <p>What did you do upon this, did you cry out thieves, or what did you do? - I was afraid they poisoned the dog first.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - Because they said they would, I heard one of these men say to the other, damn my eyes, a bit of butter will make it slip down easy, I cannot tell which it was that said it.</p>
               <p>Court. How long did you stay in the front of the house? - When they said that word, they said let us leave the place for place for two hours, for they said the dog will not be dead a good while, the y had not enough stuff.</p>
               <p>What time of night was this? - Half an hour after twelve, I stayed all the time, my cousin used to live in that alley.</p>
               <p>Is your cousin a male or female? - A female.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080047"></xptr>So you went to your female cousin? - They came back in an hour and a half, I staid there all the time, when they came back I heard a great noise, I cannot tell what it was, nor who it was that did it.</p>
               <p>Did you see these two men when they came back? - Yes, I did, and another.</p>
               <p>How near might you be to them then.? - About ten or fifteen yards off, I could not tell how far they were off.</p>
               <p>How came you to stay in November to watch these people? - Because they said so; I heard Mr. Pool the constable had found the skin, and Mr. Pool is a barber and constable, and he said he had found so and so in that young man's lodgings, Towley Scraggs, Astill we call him now, then I discovered this to Mr. Pool a few days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Did you see them remove the skins into the man's yard? - No, I heard something tumble, I cannot tell what it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Astill. Upon examination at Justice Wilmot's, he said he could positively swear to Ellis's giving the dog poison.</p>
               <p>Alvey. I heard one of them say, damn my eyes, if I had old Dr. Stone here, I would stick the knife into him, because he has not given us stuff enough to kill the dog.</p>
               <p>Court. Who Dr. Stone is, I cannot tell? - He comes to the Hind in Redcross-street; the next morning after the robbery was done, I was at the Hind, and they came into the Hind, I was there a sitting by myself about eleven.</p>
               <p>You had not been in bed all that night? - Yes, about half after two, I live in Grubb-street, the other man came in just after, they then asked if old Dr. Stone had been there, and the man of the house said no, and they said, damn my eyes if we had had him last night, if we should not have killed him, we would have been damned, for not giving poison enough to poison the dog; he came in about half an hour after, and they hit him a spank of the head, and they told him so.</p>
               <p>Who is Dr. Stone? - He is a horse farrier.</p>
               <p>Court. These seem to be a pretty set; how came you there? - I used to be drinking along with my uncle, he is a porter; they said, you gallows old thief you did not give us poison enough to poison the dog.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the man's name that keeps this remarkable house? - Casey.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. How long had you been in this house this evening? - I went at six, and staid from six to twelve.</p>
               <p>There was no company? - No.</p>
               <p>Quite at leisure? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you observed these people to talk about this business, were there no honest people in the house? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Was your father there? - No.</p>
               <p>You said no words to them? - No.</p>
               <p>You had no thoughts of joining with them? - No.</p>
               <p>You went to the front of the house? - Yes, they talked very loud about the poison, and they wished for a bit of butter.</p>
               <p>You heard that? - I was just at the corner of the turning.</p>
               <p>Did not you know there was a reward for taking people for burglaries? - No Sir, Mr. Pool told me it was in the papers.</p>
               <p>You do not know there is a reward? - No Sir, I do not.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear there was forty pounds reward? - No Sir, I heard there was forty pounds for hanging a man, I never was told that only since they have been in trouble.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear it in Newgate? - No Sir, I heard for highway robberies, or for hanging a man.</p>
               <p>How long did they wait the first time? - About a quarter of on hour.</p>
               <p>Then you walked down to your relations? - Yes, I waited in the alley above two hours, when I came up the alley again they were gone.</p>

               <p>What did you wait two hours for? - Because they said they were coming back again, I saw them when they came back again, but they did not see me.</p>
               <p>Were there no watchmen? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you alarm the family? - No.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080048"></xptr>How came you not to do this? - For fear of their hurting me.</p>
               <p>What did you wait the two hours for, was it with intention of being an evidence? - It was with intention of telling somebody or other.</p>
               <p>Did you the next day tell any body? - Yes, I believe it was the next day I told Mr. Pool, that there was another robbery done in Golden-lane.</p>
               <p>Did you go to Mr. Powell's house that had been robbed? - No, because I thought it was best to tell Mr. Newman.</p>
               <p>You thought Mr. Newman could put you in a better way of getting the forty pounds? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>And this conversation happened publickly in the tap room? - There was only them three and me.</p>
               <p>It is a wonder they were not afraid of you? - They were not.</p>
               <p>They never spoke a word to you? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Willes. How long is it since you have been out of Newgate? - Two years, a man may be bad one time, but he must not always remain such.</p>
               <p>Court. It is no proof of your amendment to frequent the Hind; so the next morning they talked about the dog? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Publickly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Ellis. Do you know any thing of robbing the tenter ground, at the back of the Shepherd and Shepherdess three months ago.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, I was at the searching of Astill's lodgings when the leather was found.</p>
               <p>When was it that you had first any conversation with the last witness? - I believe it was after the skin was found, I know nothing of Newman, but he was with me when I searched, I believe it was the same day the skin was found, that was the 18th.</p>
               <p>How did you pick up Alvey? - I believe it was in the street, as we was going along with the skin, I did not know him before, Newman met him and said we had found a skin in such a place, he said he had read the advertisement, and thought it belonged to Mr. Powell.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him at that time there was any money offered for discovering the people? - No, he said there was a large dog poisoned at the same time.</p>
               <p>Court to Newman. Did Alvey tell you the same story? - I saw him at Guildhall, and he said, what have you found a skin; and he said he knew the people that went to do a robbery in Blue Anchor Alley, he told me, that they gave the dog poison, and one Stone gave it them.</p>
               <p>Did he give you the same account of his going to watch them? - I did not give any heed to it, he said he watched them, I have seen him about our parish.</p>
               <p>What is he? - I do not know, I believe nothing of a particular character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. It was the 18th that you found the skin? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Nobody was by but Pool and you? - No, I carried it from Noble-street to Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Had you no conversation with Alvey in Noble-street? - I never saw him in Noble-street, I had no conversation with him till I came to Guildhall, I never saw him that day till I had been to Mr. Powell's, then I saw him at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>What was he doing at Guildhall? - He made a discovery of another burglary.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did you not mention to him then, that there was a reward for the apprehending the people that robbed Mr. Powell's house, and shew him the newspaper? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did not you tell him there was a great dog killed? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not you read the advertisement? - Yes, but it was not in the papers.</p>
               <p>Did you shew him the newspaper; - I had not the newspaper.</p>
               <p>Did you not tell him it was in the newspaper, there was a reward? - No.</p>
               <p>Why he said so, did not you tell him there was five guineas reward? - No, I did not, we took him up to Justice<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080049"></xptr> Wilmot's, and Justice Wilmot bound him over.</p>
               <p>Court to Pool. I think you met this Alvey first in the street? - It was after he had been to Mr. Powell's, it might be at Guildhall.</p>

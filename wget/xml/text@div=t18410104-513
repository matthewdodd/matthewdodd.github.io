                  </hi>. I keep the Red Lion public-house, and am proprietor of some houses in Well-street, Poplar. Santree rented one of them of me, and Sullivan lived with him—about five or six months ago I went and found the flooring-boards taken up, and used for building pig-sties—Sullivan was present—I told Santree he must replace them, or else I should be obliged to take him before a Magistrate—none of the joists had been re<lb></lb>moved—I went again, about three weeks ago, and found no joists, no floor, and two courses of bricks were taken out, to get the bond-timber out, and a piece of timber was put up, to keep the roof from falling in—I told him the ground landlord had been to me, and there was a piece of work about it—he after that removed to No. 14, Ann-street, Bromley—I went there in search of my property, which had then been removed altogether from my premises—when I went Sullivan opened the door—I asked her about some wood that the pig-sties had been made of—she said, if I took them away I must put them up again—she claimed the wood—I knew the boards the pig-stye was made of, they came from Well-street, the house they had occupied of me—there were one or two pieces at Ann-street which were not in the pig-stye at Well-street—when I went the second time, I said there had been a <hi rend="italic">bother</hi> about these premises, and</p>

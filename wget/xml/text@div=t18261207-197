            . I am the wife of John Savage. On the 9th of November, about a quarter to three o'clock, my landlord came for my rent; the prisoner had taken a shop of me in New Compton-street; I took out my pocket-book and paid Ellis, the landlord; I had 9 sovereigns and 13s. left; I laid the book on the table in the lower-room, and missed it the next day when my husband asked for it; I have never seen it since; I went to the prisoner, and told him my child had seen him take it - he said it was no such thing - I asked where he had changed a 10l. note - he said he would tell me - he went into the parlour, then came out, and said he would not tell me; he was taken in charge, and no sovereigns found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not you occupy the shop before the prisoner? A. Yes; I had not the pocket-book in my hand after Ellis left; the Magistrate discharged the prisoner on his own recognizance.</p>

            . I know the prisoner. I saw the pocket-book in my mother's hands, when Mr. Ellis<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070080"></xptr>and the prisoner were there; and while my mother went for the pen and ink, the prisoner took it off the table, and put it under his coat; Ellis wrote a receipt; I did not tell my mother of it till next day - I was afraid she would beat me; it was a dark red pocket-book; I told her next day when she missed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How often have you and your mother talked about this? A. Not many times; she said she would not have beaten me if I had told her; he went out directly -

             was not in the room - my mother did not tell me what to say to-day - she paid Mr. Ellis some money; the prisoner was in the shop; I saw my mother put some gold and silver into the pocket-book - I saw her put six sovereigns into it; and there were nine on the counter; my father took it up and gave it to my mother.</p>
               <p>JOHN SAVAGE. The prisoner had taken this shop, and paid me three sovereigns, and then was to pay seven, but he only gave me 6l. 13s., and said he should keep the rest for good-luck; this was about noon on the 9th of November - next morning I wanted the money - I said to my wife, "Have you got your money all right?" and the child said, "Oh, mother! Mr. Anderson took it" - she took the child to him, and after this I went to him with the child - he said it was all false, and he said he had changed a 10l. note the night before, as he had no silver; he had asked me to lend him 6d. - I found he had changed a note at a grocer's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. I have driven a cabriolet, but do nothing since I lost my money - I let this shop in order to get two horses to drive the cabriolet.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I engaged to give 10l. for this shop; when I went there, I met Mr. Ellis coming out at the door - my wife said, "This is the landlord; Mr. Savage has been paying some rent, and you must pay him 4s. 6d. on Monday" - I talked with him, but we did not go in, and I never saw the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH PARRY. I am out of place, and live with the prisoner - when Mrs. Savage was paying Ellis some rent, the prisoner came in and met Ellis at the door; after they were both gone, I saw a very dark-coloured pocket-book - I saw the book in her hand, while Ellis was writing a receipt.</p>
               <p>- ELLIS. I am the landlord - Savage paid me the rent - I met the prisoner at the door as I went out; we just stopped and talked about some repairs at a coal-shed; I went home - I think Anderson went just before me; I had settled with Savage before the prisoner came; I did not notice the little girl there; I saw no pocket-book.</p>

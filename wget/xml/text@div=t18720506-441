I am a master carman of Richmond—on Thursday night, 18th April, I went home about 12 o'clock, and found the door wide open—the dog began to bark—I could not see anybody about the place, I bolted the door and got into bed—I have to go through a hay-loft to the place—a pane of glass is taken out of the door, for us to let ourselves in, and the last who is in puts a board over it—I learned in the morn<lb></lb>ing that my brother had been robbed—I examined the door to see if anybody had been in after me, and found they had not—I informed a detective, and about 9.10 that morning I met the prisoner in the Kew Road, and saw him go into the Tam O'Shanter public-house—I did not see him come out, the next I saw of him was in Kew Foot Lane, near the Queen's Laundry, sitting down examining some money—he wrapped some of it up in a handkerchief, and the rest he put in another pocket and sat</p>

               <p>Down and went to sleep, he was drunk—I waited till Pearson came up and assisted in taking him to the station—I have frequently employed the prisoner and given him leave to sleep in the hay-loft, so that he could see us go up to the room—after the prisoner was taken, I went with Pearson to Mr. Cottam's garden, adjoining our premises, and compared the prisoner's boots with some marks there, and they exactly corresponded, part of the iron tip on the heel was worn away, and the middle part of the sole was worn away.</p>

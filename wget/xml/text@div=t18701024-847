I am waiter at the Hoop and Grapes, Great George Street—on a Saturday night, at the beginning of September, about 11.57, the prisoner and two others came in for some gin—the prisoner tendered a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he was told that it was not sufficient; he used bad language, and I said that he must go out, as I wanted to close the house—he said that he would not—I attempted to get him out, and he went away—I had hold of one of the others to try to get him out, and the prisoner stabbed me in the side—it bled a great deal—I was laid up three weeks, and feel it still.</p>

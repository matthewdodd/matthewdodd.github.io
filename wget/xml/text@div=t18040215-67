             went down to the stable, I suppose between eight and nine o'clock; previous to his going down, he went down to the warehouse which is under the shop where I was; he was down in the warehouse a considerable time, about a quarter of an hour; he came up with a sack on his back, which I supposed to contain straw, which he was in the habit of taking down to the stable in a sack; he went out, and I have no doubt but he went down to the stable.</p>

               <p>Q. Why have you no doubt? - A. Because it was his usual custom to go at that hour; about nine or ten, the other servant of my father told me he wished to speak to me; in consequence of what he told me, I went down to the stable with him, and went in the hay-lost; there I saw the cheese and the hams charged in the indictment, concealed under the hay; I returned, and left them as I found them; I thought it was the best way, wishing to find the person out that had concealed it; I acquainted my father with it, and he sent me to Bow-street; I consulted with the officers there; they advised me what to do; I shewed them the situation of the place; they agreed to come at eight o'clock in the evening; the prisoner went down to the stable about two or three o'clock, which he usually did every day; on his return he never hung the key of the stable up; it was his custom to hang it up behind the street door, which made me suppose he intended to take away the goods shortly; we kept him at home all the afternoon; my father purposed to keep him at home that he should not have an opportunity of going to the stable; about half-past six we sent him out, I went out previous to his going out; I went down near the stable, that I might have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150051"></xptr>an opportunity, if he did go there, to see him; I continued in ambush for about ten minutes, and nobody came; I returned home, and after a short time I sent our other man nearly to the same place where I had been before, while I looked after the officers; he had appointed to meet me at a place opposite our house; I could not find him there; I went down to the place where our man was, and I had not been there many minutes before the officer came; we were altogether not more than forty minutes before the prisoner, Burn, came down to the stable-door; the other prisoner, Conner, came another way, and met him at the stable-door; Conner unlocked the stable-door, and they both went in and shut the stable-door after them; they remained in for the space of five minutes, and the prisoner, Burn, came out with a load on his shoulder; they both came out together, and they both went back the same way the prisoner Conner came; we followed them a little way, though at a proper distance; when they got up a street, called Beaufort-buildings, they parted. Burn continued up these buildings, and Conner went immediately home the contrary way; I and the officer continued to follow the prisoner Burn with the load on his shoulder, till he came to No. 35, Wilmot-street, where he went in, and we close after him. The officer asked him what he had got there; he said, two hams and one cheese; he said he brought it from Beaufort-buildings for Mr. Dollond's young man; we took him in custody, and secured him in the watch-house; then we went and secured the other prisoner, he was still at our house; on searching him, there was a book in his pocket, in which was a memorandum, a cash-account, for money received, with the signature of Burn; that is the other prisoner's name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He came up with the sack that you supposed was filled with straw? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go with him? - A. It is not my usual custom to go with the sack of straw to the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he went to two or three places before he went to the stable, you cannot say? - A. There are people that can say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The other man is quite a stranger to you? - A. He is.</p>

             sworn. - I am Mr. Dollond's servant: On Thursday morning, between seven and eight o'clock, as I was hanging my master's hams up, I missed two of them; I said to Connor, there are two hams deficient, where are they; he said he did not know any thing of them, for he put them up the night before; I hung two more out in their stead; I went into the warehouse below stairs to clean some knives, as I usually do; there I saw a heap of straw, and under that heap of straw I found one large ham; I covered it up as I found it, and up in the shop I run; my master sent me out with some butter; when I came home, I went down into the warehouse, where I found the straw and the sack gone, and the ham likewise; when I came up in the shop again, my master told me to come to breakfast; the prisoner Conner told me there was some sawdust wanted; I asked him for the sack, and he told me the sack was at the stable; I took the key, and went down to the stable for the sack; I found the sack across the shafts of the chaise, empty, and some straw under the shafts, which I supposed to be the straw he had taken out of the cellar; I had some suspicion that the ham was among the straw; in searching the straw, I could not find any ham there; I went up in the hay-lost, and the very first thing I put my foot against, was a large Cheshire cheese; I lifted up a truss of hay, and there I found a large ham and a little one; I left the cheese and hams as I found them, and took the sack, and went up to my master's house, and there I saw my young master; I told him I wanted to speak to him; he and I went both down to the stable, and there he found the goods under the hay and straw, as I have related before.</p>
               <p>- TOWNSEND sworn. - I am one of the patrols: On Thursday last, I received information from young Mr. Dollond. I went into the street to watch about eight o'clock and the two prisoners at the bar came down; they both went into the stable together in the dark; after they had been both together for about five minutes, they both came out together, and went up a slight of steps leading to Beaufort-buildings, the prisoner Burn with a load on his back; they went up together about half way up Beaufort-buildings, where the prisoner Conner parted with the prisoner Burn; I followed the prisoner Burn to No. 35, Wilmot-street; he went into an old iron-shop, and I and another took him into custody, with the property on him; I asked him whose it was, and he told me he was the master of it.</p>
               <p>Q. He keeps the old iron-shop? - A. Yes, he said it was his house; I asked him what he had got in the sack; he told me some ham and cheese; I asked him where he got it from; he told me in Beaufort-buildings, and that he had brought it for Mr. Dollond's young man; I then took him to the watch-house, and went to Mr. Dollond's shop, and there I took Conner in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. At the place where you saw him take it from - where was it? - A. It is the bottom of Carter-lane; he took it from the stable; on searching the prisoner, Conner, in his outside coat pocket, I found two guineas, and in his breeches pocket I found one bad shilling and a good one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. He told you he got it at Beaufort-buildings? - A. I asked him where; he would not say any more than that, and then he added afterwards, that he brought it for Mr. Dollond's young man.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a flight of steps that leads up to Beaufort-buildings? -</p>
               <p>Court. There is a communication from one to the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him if he had been into the stable? - A. I asked him if he had any acquaintance in town that would give any account whatever how he came by them, and he said, no.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to go and enquire of him? - A. I was informed of it before.</p>
               <p>Court. He was on the watch, and saw them part, and one went the other way.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - A. Half past eight o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I am an officer of Bow-street; I know no more than has been related; I was with Townsend and Mr. Dollond's son; I assisted in taking the prisoners.</p>
               <p>(The cheese and hams produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150052"></xptr>Mr. Dollond, Sen. There is B and D, which is my mark, a circular mark; the B is inside of the D on the cheese.</p>
               <p>Q. Any mark on the ham? - A. The weight of this I can swear to; I marked it myself, and my son can own the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Any body can tell they are hams if they taste them - are you sure you have not sold these hams? - A. To be sure I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take out the marks when you sell them? - A. We do not; we sell them at a proportionate price, and let the marks remain.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The gentleman asks you this question, whether this identical ham has been sold? - A. I have sold many hams.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dollond, Jun. I cannot swear that they were never sold, but I believe the witness Dawson can.</p>
               <p>Dawson. I can swear to this ham; this is the ham I believe was in the cellar, but I cannot swear to the other.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have they your mark on them? - A. They have my master's mark on them.</p>
               <p>Conner's defence. There was a young man called upon me, and left these hams and cheese in my care, so I employed Mr. Burn, and paid him, and got him to remove them, for fear my master should suspect me if he saw them there.</p>
               <p>Burn's defence. Conner came in my place, and asked me to take a load a little distance; I agreed to have a shilling or eighteen-pence to carry it by day, but I would not go at that time of night unless I had two shillings and sixpence; he took me to Beaufort-buildings, he told me he would come the day after for them; after I returned home, I was taken by these two officers.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Burn, called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

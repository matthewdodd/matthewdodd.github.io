The prisoner was an acquaintance of ours; he called on the 4th of June; I had a silver watch on my mantel-piece when he called, and I missed it about half a minute after he left; I caused him to be apprehended, and have since seen the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. On your oath, can you swear you did not give it me to go and pawn? A. Safely.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not ask you if you had got any money, you said not, but there was the watch, and I might take and pawn it? A. I did not; we were not to have gone out together that evening, while my husband was at work.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was your husband there when he called? A. No; he was going out with his horse and cart - the prisoner saw him and spoke to him, and asked him what time he would be at home - he said about half-past eight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040074"></xptr>o'clock; he said, "I will stay till eight, and if you don't come till then, I must go;" this was about half-past three o'clock - he has many times paid me as long a visit in my husband's absence; my husband is a carman to a chemist and druggist - nothing but friendship made the prisoner's visit so long - he stopped about ten minutes after my husband left, which was about a quarter to four o'clock - he did not stay as he had said till eight o'clock; I did not employ him to pawn the watch; I did not allow him to take it - nothing was mentioned about a watch; I missed it about half a minute after he left - it is worth about 2l. - nothing has passed, to lead him to think he might use the watch, or take it away - the watch was in my use - it laid on the mantle-piece.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you not on similar occasions when we were going to the play, gone out and pawned articles to raise money? A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you ever gone out with the prisoner in your husbands absence? A. Only once - I think about Christmas - I went with him to the Haymarket Theatre- my husband knew I was going.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She has been several times to my barracks, and called and got me out of the barracks, and got me drunk, and kept me away from my regiment? Witness. I only went to his barracks once, and that was in company with another young woman who went to see a friend of her's, and while I was there I called on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why did you call? A. Because he was a friend of ours - I went into no room - it was not at the barracks - it was a public house I saw him in - I drank with him - I staid about ten minutes - the young woman went to see another soldier, and she came away when I did - we had a pot of ale - the prisoner paid for it - the other woman was single.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What she has said is quite false - she came to me at half-past one o'clock on Sunday, and staid till the sergeant was obliged to turn her out of the barracks - we had about 10s. worth of drink among us. Witness. It is perfectly false - he is a false fellow - a wicked young man- I have not been out with him scores of times - only once - I was not with him at Bartholomew-fair - my husband was there likewise - we were altogether - I was never with him on Saffron-hill - I never went to a brothel with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what passed between you and me after Mr. Box went away with the cart? A. I don't exactly recollect the words; I don't think I spoke half a dozen words to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say when we went towards the window by the bed-side, and I put my arm round your neck, did not you say, "Don't they will see us through the window, wait until towards evening?" A. No - he took no liberties with me at all.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You charge the man with felony - on the solemn oath that you have taken, did you by any encouragement you gave him, lead him to suppose he might take the watch? A. No, there was never any familiarity between us.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not last December encourage me when I was four days absent from my regiment, to come and visit you while your husband was at work? and what took place while I was there? A. I never had any criminal intercourse with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I can prove there is a mark on her naked person; I leave it to you to judge. Witness. It is false; no further than what I told him - he asked me if I had once been bit by a dog; I told him yes; that was all that passed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have cohabited with her since 1826; she is nothing but a common prostitute.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you, either before your marriage or since, have any improper connection with him? A. Once before I was married, and not since - I have known him eight years - I told my husband the watch was gone directly he came home - I did not know how it had gone at that time; I suspected the prisoner had taken it - I had had no quarrel with him - I told my husband who I suspected had taken it, and he was apprehended on Thursday morning - I missed it on Tuesday - I had not seen him in the interval.</p>

The prosecutrix applied to me and stated she had been robbed by a soldier in the Tower - I went there and found he was absent - I went again on Thursday and found him and took him to the Compter, and took him before the Magistrate - I received information, and heard the watch was deposited in somebody's hands; and found it at the sign of the Horse and Cart, Upper Thames-street; Young is the landlord - I produce the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is my husband's, and the watch I lost just after the prisoner went; nobody but him had an opportunity of taking it.</p>

            . I keep a public-house in Thames-street. On the 4th of June, the prisoner came to my house and asked for half a pint of rum, which he had - he had a watch swinging about when he came in; he was neither sober nor in liquor - he swore he would knock the watches brains out - I said "Don't knock the watch about, because hereafter you may want it again" - he said, "This watch has been with me into a great many countries, and I am determined to knock it to pieces" - he left it with me for the half-pint of rum - he then came up to me and borrowed 5s. - I said I have no wish to lend money on the watch - Mrs. Young said he might get into trouble, and I had better let him have the money - I lent him the 5s. to get himself some clean clothes to go into the regiment again respectably - he said he could not appear in the regiment in the state he was in; his trousers were dirty - he went away with a soldier who was there; I believe he was a horse-soldier - they went away together - they took a boat and went across the water - the soldier who was with him fell overboard; the prisoner was going to hold him, and says he had the money in his hand, and in catching the man from falling over, he let the money out of his hand; he came and said to me, "I have not been to my regiment, I want now 5s. more, will you lend me that on it"- I said no - my wife said, "You had better lend it him, he will get into trouble," and I lent him the money and he went away - he came back again next morning and wanted more money; I said I would not lend him any more - he begged very hard indeed, and I lent him 10s. more, making 20s. altogether - I gave the watch to the officer who came to me.(Witness for the Defence.)</p>

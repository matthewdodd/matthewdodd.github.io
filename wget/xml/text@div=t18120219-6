On Monday the 3d of February, I lost the watch between ten and eleven o'clock in the forenoon, the prisoner at the bar came to my shop to look at some gold watches for his brother in Scotland he said; I shewed him several, and he fixed upon one for twenty-five guineas, a gold seal at two guineas, and a gold chain at four guineas and a half, and desired me to have them ready, and he would call the next day and take them with him; he left the shop, and within five minutes after we missed a gold watch, value seventeen pounds, suspicion immediately attached to the prisoner, and no man had been the shop from the time he left it to the time the watch was missed; I sent two of my young men after him to endeavour to bring him back, but without success. On Tuesday, between two and three o'clock, the prisoner came again to my shop, saying, he could not receive his pay till the latter end of the month, when he would come and take the watch, I expressed some disappointment, and kept him in talk till one of my young men came in; I then took him in the passage behind the shop, and told him what my suspicions were, he denied having it, I told him I must be further satisfied that he had not taken it, he said he was going further, and he would call in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. I told him that I could not suffer him to go without first being satisfied that the watch was not stolen, he went to the door of the shop, wishing to leave, I told him I could not let him go, and he walked a part of the way to the Minories, saying he had an appointment in East Smithfield, at five minutes after three. I took him into my uncle's house, and into their back room I left him while I went for a constable. The constable and myself, and one of my young men, went with him to his lodgings at St. Mary's Hill, Tower-street, where the constable said he must then search him; proceeding to do so, he let his handkerchief and his gloves fall out of his pocket, and laid them upon the table. The constable went immediately to take hold of the hankerchief and gloves, but he took hold of them himself, and put his hands behind him. While the constable proceeded to search his person, I told the constable he did not search the glove in the gentlemen's other hand, the constable went to take it, whereupon the prisoner tendered a watch to me, and said, there is your watch Mr. Wortner. It was the watch which I had missed, and which I can swear to.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Tuesday the 4th of March I was sent for by Mr. Wortner, it was Mr. Wortner's wish for me to go to his lodgings immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you examine first. - A. Because it was Mr. Wortner's wish for me to go to his lodgings. As I was searching him, Mr. Wortner noticed his hand, and said he had got something in his hand, and he presented the watch to Mr. Wortner and said, Mr. Wortner, here is your watch, he produced the gold watch, and begged pardon, and hoped that he would forgive him, at the same time I pulled out a gold seal that Mr. Wortner never missed. This is the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my watch that I missed. He bought a watch of me some years ago, and he has been in the habit of coming to the shop for nineteen years. He is a lieutenant in the navy. He has left it about six month ago, as I understand, it is not the first thing that we have lost.</p>

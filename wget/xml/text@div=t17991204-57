             sworn. - I shall be thirteen years old next May; my father is dead; my mother lives at No. 53, Leather-lane, and takes in washing: I was robbed last Monday; I was going through Windmill-court into Giltspur-street, to the flatting-mills; there were three of us together; I had six pair of silver watch-cases that I had fetched from Goldsmiths' Hall; I am errand-boy to Mr. Johnson, No. 38. Islington-road, a watch-case maker; the prisoner at the bar came behind us, and took me by the shoulder, and chucked me over his leg.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, and say whether he is the person? - A. Yes, that is the man; he held me by the shoulder while another man took six pair of silver watch-cases from me, and ran away with them; they were in a white ticking bag; it was between four and five o'clock; it was not quite dark, it was light enough to distinguish a man's countenance; the prisoner ran across the square into Little Britain; the other ran a different way, and I did not see any more of him; then this man called out stop thief, himself; and I ran after him, and he was stopped.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. How long might you and the prisoner be together, before he chucked you over his leg? - A. I had observed him for a little time before that, behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you remark him before he threw you down? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any particular reason for remarking him? - A. Yes; he had a striped waistcoat on, and a black coat with a black velvet collar.</p>

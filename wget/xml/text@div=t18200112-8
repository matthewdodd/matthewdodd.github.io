I was at the Red Lion, public-house, on Wednesday, the 5th of January, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon; the prisoner came in with his foraging cap and great coat on, and said he had been walking all night. He went up stairs, then came down in about a quarter of an hour with his great coat off, and a bundle wrapped up in it. I asked him for a piece of leather? He left the bundle on the table, went up stairs, and brought a piece down. He went up again, came down, and went out with the bundle.</p>

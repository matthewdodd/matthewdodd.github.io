               <p>Q. You speak of Sutton and Lawson, were the other two men present at the time you received the blows on the head? A. I cannot say; there were several persons present - the woman and Sutton I am positive were there; I have some faint recollection of my foot being jammed with the door, but I was stunned and stupified with the blows - I cannot say whether I fell when the blows were struck, for I was nearly stunned; the next thing I recollect of myself is, that I found myself standing near the door, and my head bleeding - I then saw Sutton come out of the door; I jumped upon him, for the purpose of securing him - he then commenced beating me again on the head with the iron bar; I then found myself become so weak I could not strike him on the head with my truncheon, and brought him to the ground on the top of me - I was down in a stooping position, keeping my head close to him to save it, and I being undermost, he fell on the top of me; after we had fallen, I heard the iron he had been beating me with ring against the stones at some distance from me, as if thrown away -I got up again, and finding myself so weak from the blows I had received, I held him with both hands, and left off beating him; during that time I was repeatedly struck by him and others - I cannot tell who they were; we again fell down, and on getting up I found myself alone with the prisoner Sutton, the rest were gone, and after a little struggle, Brooks, my brother officer, came to my assistance, with Green; Sutton was then secured - I was taken from there to the station-house by two officers; Sutton was afterwards brought there - I was taken from there to Mr. Mears', a surgeon, in Brick-lane, and am still under his care; I was taken home and went to bed - I was not exactly confined to my bed; I got up next morning; I saw no more of the other two prisoners than I have stated.</p>
               <p>Sutton. He says he was not able to spring his rattle, and yet able to hold me - I wish to ask if he did not swear at Worship-street that he never saw me. Witness. I said I could not swear to you at the beginning of the transaction - that I believed you to be the man who struck me in the street, when I was first attacked, but I could not swear it.</p>

            . I deal in haberdashery and rags, and live at No. 15, York-street, Mile-end. On the 23rd of September, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I was coming home, and heard a rattle spring very low; I made a stop, and it sprang again slow - I ran down Wentworth-street - there is a street called George-street, which turns off to the right; I then saw Davis, the Policeman, having hold of Lawson; they had hold of one another, and a mob was there - I saw Davis dragged in doors by Lawson; she caught hold of his arm - I went and called for assistance, calling out Police! I was some time before I could find a man- I left the house for that purpose; I was full ten minutes absent - I ran a good distance before the Police<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180016"></xptr>man, and found Davis holding down his head, having hold of Sutton by his legs; the three male prisoners were beating Davis with their fists - I caught hold of Jones, and hallooed out, "This is one;" I have not a doubt of his being the man I caught hold of - he had no coat on, but was in his shirt sleeves; he hallooed out, and said, "It was not me;" one of the Policemen I had fetched caught hold of me by mistake - I said, "It was not me," and they let me go; Jones went off at that time - I then saw Sutton: I am sure he was one of the men, and assisted in taking him to the watch-house; when I got hold of him he said, "You have no business with me at all;" he gave me several blows, and I expected to go to the ground - my face was cut- it was swollen for several days, and my cheek has the mark of it now - there was a gas-lamp over the way, which enabled me to see; I am sure of all the three men - I took Sutton to the station-house: the other two were present also - I saw Davis holding his head down, which was bleeding.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the woman dragging Davis into the house - was she alone, or were others dragging him in? A. Yes, she and other were dragging him in; I cannot swear that either of the male prisoners were among them - I saw blood on the hands of Kemp and Sutton, and pointed it out to the superintendent, Pearce.</p>
               <p>Sutton. Q. Where was you when the rattle began to spring? A. In Wentworth-street; I turned into George-street in consequence of hearing the rattle - I was coming from Long-alley, Moorfields; Brick-lane was my nearest way home - I was in Brick-lane when I first heard the rattle; I then went into Wentworth-street and George-street - I was rather further from the spot when I first heard the rattle than I am from here to Newgate, but not so far as I am from Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>Kemp. Q. When you came up the second time, and brought the officers, did you hear the Policeman say any thing? A. I do not remember hearing him say any thing - Brooks is the officer I fetched.</p>

            , and live at No. 52, Wentworth-street. I was up on the morning in question, and heard a woman scream out in the street, between twelve and one o'clock, or near one - I sent a girl out to see who it was, and as she did not return, I went myself, and saw Kemp, Jones, and Sutton ill-using the Policeman, beating and striking him; he was standing in the street then - they all fell together: they were beating him with their fists at that time, and trying to rescue the woman - the Policeman said, as he had been ill-treated so much, he would take her to the station-house; they then went along the street, fighting one among the other, till they got to the house where the female prisoner and Sutton lived; when they got near that house, Sutton went in doors, and the Policeman having fast hold of the woman - Sutton and the woman pulled him in sideways, till his feet and his arm got in; he then cried out "Oh! Bolton, Bolton - I am a dead man!" Jones and Kemp then ran home; they live within two doors of me - they live in different rooms in the same house; I ran home, and called my husband to come out with the rattle and spring it - we have a rattle of our own; I went back again - Kemp and Jones left their coats at their own lodging, and as I went back they ran past me, and Kemp said, "Before the Policeman shall take him, I will kill the b-gg-r;" when I got back the Policeman was against the window of the house where Sutton lived - he was leaning against the window ledge; Sutton came out with a piece of iron in his hand, about ten inches long, about as thick as my thumb, and turned up at one end; I saw him beat it about the Policeman's head - the other two men were not there at first: they came up while he was beating him with the iron, and the girl held him by the throat; they all beat him severely for some time - he could not for some time get his staff out of his pocket, but when he got it out he beat Sutton over the legs with it as hard as he could; the other two men held his hands together - two Policemen came up, and I saw Sutton throw the iron down among the crowd; there were a good many people there at that time - it fell on the stones, and made a noise.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it after Jones and Kemp came back that you saw Sutton strike him with the iron? A. Yes, during the time they were there, he struck I think eight or nine blows with the iron; and they held him the while, till he got his stick; Davis tried to spring his rattle, but he could make very little noise indeed - they still continued to ill-use him till the Policemen came; I saw him beat Sutton with his truncheon very severely about the legs, when he could raise his arm; I have known Jones and Kemp these twelve months, and have not a doubt of them; they have no business that I know of; I do not know whether they appeared in liquor - I picked up the iron, and upon that a boy, who used to be with them, came and said, "Mrs. Sheen, let me look at that iron?" I said, "You shan't have it out of my hand," but he got it from me, and ran away with it; I have seen that boy with Kemp and Jones - he is in Clerkenwell prison now.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened next? A. Sutton was in custody; Jones and Kemp ran away - I have known Lawson more than twelve months, and am sure she is the woman; I saw Davis' head - it was in a shocking state; the blood was running down his face and head - I was at the Police-office on the Monday afternoon, and saw the three male prisoners in custody, and when I was outside the office Lawson came up to me, and said, "You don't know any thing bad about me nor my young man, and I hope you will say as little as you can help.</p>
               <p>Sutton. Q. What business had you up at that time of night? A. To look after such thieves as you; when we see such company as them in the street, we are bound to be up to take care of our property; I was not sitting up for my son; when the Policeman's arm was in the door, I saw you going up towards the stairs in the passage - I stood opposite the door; it was about five minutes from the time I left till I came back - the first thing I then observed was Sutton coming out of his door, with the iron in his hand.</p>

No; when I was in the road Kemp and Jones ran by me, and I think they got to the house first - I left the first time before you did, and got back before you did - I did not see you run away at last, for I was looking for the iron.</p>

            . I live with my mother in Bennet's-court, George-street. On Sunday morning, the 23rd of Septemner, I was up early, going to gather blackberries; I was going along, and heard a great noise in George-street, near Wentworth-street - I ran down to see what was the matter, and saw Davis, the Policeman, persuading a young woman to go home; I cannot say who the woman was - there were a great many more people there; there was more than one man- I saw Sutton there; I am sure of him - I did not know him before: Davis was persuading the young woman to go home very quietly - she was obstinate, and would not, and he attempted to take her to the station-house; Sutton caught hold of him by the collar, and got him down in the gutter, and then kicked him several times in the face; then Sutton ran away - Davis got up, and ran after him - he hallooed out "Bolton, Bolton," to come to his assistance; Sutton turned back, and struck Davis with his fist, and ran off again: a young woman directly ran and clung round Davis' neck, and used a bad word to him - I cannot say whether it was Lawson or not; I do not think it was her, but it was dark - Sutton made his escape into a house, while the woman held Davis; Davis then got the young woman from the ground, and was going to take her to the station, but several others dragged him and the woman into the house; he got his foot and knee tight in the doorway, and hallooed out, "Oh, my knee!" they had pinched it in the door - I did not go into the house; Davis afterwards came out of the house, and fell against the window stone - I was close to him; his head was bleeding in a dreadful state - Sutton came out of the house with a long piece of iron in his hand; Davis laid hold of him, and said,"You are the man I want," and he took and cut Davis ever so many times on the head with the iron; he struck him eight or ten times with it, as near as I can say; I saw some Policeman come up afterwards, and lay hold of him; Davis had hit Sutton on the legs with his staff; nobody else struck him - I saw no woman there; I saw nobody there but Sutton and the Policeman at any time after they came out of the house; I staid till the iron was thrown away - he got from the Policeman after he was on the ground, and ran away; a rattle was sprung, and he turned back again and fell, and the iron fell from him - I saw it on the ground, and left it there; I do not know what became of it - I went to the station with the Policeman, who was bleeding, and then assisted him home.</p>

On the morning in question I was called to the spot in George-street, leading into Wentworth-street, and saw Davis holding Sutton; I caught hold of him - Davis was bleeding very much from the head; I said, "Davis, let go - I have got hold of him," and then he did let go; he was very weak, apparently from the loss of blood - I took Sutton to the station-house; there was blood on both his hands - there were a number of people standing by; Davis' head was cut in several places - I was not present at any of the violence.</p>

            . I am assistant to Mr. Mears, a surgeon, of Brick-lane. On the 23rd of September, about half-past one o'clock in the morning, I was called up to attend Davis; he was very much injured - he had received several wounds along the side of the head and the scalp; they were confused wounds; there was, I should think, six wounds; but they communicated one with the other, so that I could not exactly tell how many there were - from the nature of the wounds. I considered dangerous consequences might ensue; they had broken the skin, and penetrated to the cranium - I thought him in danger; he is not out of my care yet; I do not think he will be fit for duty for a month yet, or perhaps more.</p>
               <p>Sutton's Defence. I had been out all the evening, and was rather tipsy, and coming home, I heard the squalling<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180018"></xptr>of a woman; when I got there, I saw the Policeman beating a female, and called him a rascal for doing so - he struck me over my left shoulder, and immediately struck me twice again, and would have struck me over my head, but I caught the blow on my arm; he tore my coat right up my back, and I struck him, knocked him down, and was going away - he got bp to me again; I told him to leave me alone - he would not; I turned at him again, and pitched him, I believe, on his head twice - he kept hold of me till I was taken into custody; I lost my hat in the scuffle; somebody came behind me, put the Policeman's hat on my head, and said, "Now we will have him;" he was behind me - Green took me.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DAVIS. I had not said a word to him, nor struck him, till I was attacked; I was not ill - using any woman - I did tear his coat; I did not put my hat on his head.</p>

               <p>Kemp's Defence (written). On Saturday, the 22nd of September, I arrived at home, at my lodgings, No. 46, Wentworth-street, Spitalfields, between the hours of twelve and one o'clock, and, after talking with my landlord for a short time, I then went into my own room, in company with my wife - the room which I occupy is one adjoining my landlord's shop; I asked my landlord if I should fasten the street door - he replied Yes, and I accordingly did so; I then sat down with my wife, and had some beef steaks for our supper, which I cooked myself - while at supper, a knocking came to the street door, about half-past one or two o'clock; I got up and answered the door, which I opened, and three or four Policemen came in - I then asked them what they then were going away from my room, when one of them turned back, and asked me if my name was not Henry Kemp - I said it was; they told me I must come with them - I asked them what for; they said, "You will see when you come to the station-house;" they then took me to Spitalfields station-house - I again inquired on what charge I was a prisoner; the inspector said for beating one of their men - I inquired when it happened; he said a quarter of an hour before - I said I could prove my innocence; my landlord came to the station-house, but they would not hear what he had to say - I asked them if bail would be accepted; the inspector said he did not know whether the man was out of danger or not, therefore he would not take bail - I was then locked up till Sunday night, when the Policeman Davis, and some more, called me out, and after Davis had looked at me some time, he said to me, "Put your coat on;" I asked him if he knew the colour of it - he said No; I then put on my coat, and after looking at me some time, he said softly to one of the others,"He is not one;" I was then again locked up till Monday morning, when I was taken to Worship-street office, and remanded till Tuesday morning, when I was fully committed for trial - I had not seen the prisoner James Sutton since the day before I was first taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Jones's Defence. I came in about ten o'clock, and went up stairs to bed about eleven; I heard nothing more till Sunday night, when I came home about ten, and in about a quarter of an hour two Policemen came, and said they wanted me for a row, and if I came to the station I should hear all about it; they then said it was for ill-using the Policeman.</p>
               <p>Lawson's Defence. I was not there at the time, and know nothing about it; I was in bed and asleep by ten o'clock.</p>

Kemp and Jones live at our house; I cannot say whether Kemp is married; a young woman lives with him - they have lived in my house eight or nine months. On the 22nd of September he came home about twelve o'clock, on Saturday night, as near as I can guess - it was while I was shutting up; I keep a chandler's-shop; he occupies the back room adjoining my shop; when he came home he was quarrelling with his young woman for not having his supper ready, and while they were quarrelling I went to bed - I sleep in the next room, on the ground floor - there is a parlour, his room, and a little shop; my husband was in bed before me about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you hear next? A. When the young woman went to get the supper ready she had not got the frying-pan, and then they got to blows; I got out of bed, and told them to be quiet; my mother-in-law, who sleeps on the first floor, got out of bed, opened the door, and told Kemp to open the door, and go over to Mrs. Wass' for the frying-pan - I heard them sit down to supper; I then heard no more till my husband got out of bed, to go into the yard, and while he was there Bolton, the officer, came - I did not see him; I got out of bed because I heard Bolton say he wanted to get into Kemp's room; my husband, as he was coming from the yard, opened the street door to Bolton, and showed him the prisoner's room; Bolton went in, and said, "Is your name Kemp?" the prisoner said Yes, and he took him.</p>

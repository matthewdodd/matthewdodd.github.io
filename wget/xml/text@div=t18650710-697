I was in New Bridge-street on the night of the 13th June, listening to some music—I saw the prisoner there—a rush came and a violent pushing, and I heard a snap—I looked down and saw the prisoner's hands passing away from my waistcoat pocket, and my guard hanging down—I seized the prisoner by the collar, he struggled for some time, and then he said, "Look here," and I was held by some of his companions and he got away—I followed him and cried "Stop thief," and he was brought back by one of the London and Chatham men—I have got my watch—it was given to me by a person outside the Guildhall, who asked me not to prosecute—he wanted me to go to Mile-end, but I would not—the watch was worth five guineas.</p>

I am a clerk on the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway—I was in New Bridge-street on the 13th June, about half-past ten—heard a cry of "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner running—I pursued him and caught him at the top of St. Andrew's-hill—I never lost sight of him—I said, "you are charged with stealing a gentleman's watch"—he said it was not him—the prosecutor came up and gave him into custody.</p>

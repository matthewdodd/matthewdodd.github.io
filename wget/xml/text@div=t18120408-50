               <p>Q. Any person coming up stairs might get admission by turning the key - A. Yes, and by taking the padlock off. I left the work-shop about five minutes, I heard the door shut too, I looked out of the window, I saw the prisoner going out of the house; I immediately left the room and ran down stairs after him, when I got to the bottom of the stairs, my brother,

Not any thing, I found my coat in the passage of the ground floor, which I had left in the work-shop, and on going up into the work-shop I missed a plow; I am sure I left the plow in my work-shop; I put it out of my hand when I came out of the room; the plow has never been found.

From what I heard on the stairs, I went out from my tea to see if any thing was wrong, I found the padlock off, and the door a little way open, I just looked in and saw no one was there, I immediately turned my head on the stairs, and saw the prisoner stepping off the last stair; I followed him as fast as I could, I saw him drop my brother's coat, I overtook him about twelve or fourteen yards from the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish whether he was in company with any other person - A. I observed that he ran against another man when he got out of doors, as if he did it designedly; the other man ran up Vine-street, and was off. I seized the prisoner, I said I have you. The plow has never been found.</p>

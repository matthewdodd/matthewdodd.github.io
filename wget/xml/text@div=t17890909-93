             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am chase-driver; I pounded this ass once; then she had a foal with her about a year old, I believe; and afterwards, the gardener brought her to me, and desired me to take care of her; I saw her about Holy Thursday; that is the day of Bush fair.</p>
               <p>Have you seen it since it was foaled at Lady Stormont's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. I believe you can tell us this prisoner's character? - I know nothing about his roguishness, nor yet his honesty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, another Counsel for the prosecution. Come now, since that question has been asked; upon your oath, what has been his general character for honesty? - I cannot tell; you must enquire.</p>
               <p>But I will enquire it of you; and I apprize you, that to conceal the truth, is just as much perjury, as if you were flatly to tell me what is false? - I never heard any thing against the man in particular.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - I have sworn once.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, you never heard any thing about his character? now I will give you chapter and verse; nothing about a poney? - It was not a poney.</p>
               <p>Oh! you do know a little; that was not Lord Chumley's? - No; Pitham borrowed it of his fellow servant, who was then in the country; and the poney was lost, and could not be found; and his fellow servant made him pay for it; but he was not accused of stealing it that I know of.</p>
               <p>Now, about Lord Chumley's wood? - I do not know; I will say no more to you; I have nothing more to say; I know nothing against the man.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath; having once or twice said that you know nothing about character; that you know nothing of his roguish tricks; will you permit it to be taken down as your evidence, that this man bears a good character in his neighbourhood: come Mr. Chase-driver, I know something about that neighbourhood myself? - I do not know; why, you are not to hang a man for a thing seven years ago.</p>
               <p>Is his general character in his neighbourhood, a good one or a bad one? - You must go and enquire.</p>
               <p>I will make you answer it, or else you will drive no more chases, except in Newgate? - I never heard any thing amiss of the man, any otherwise than what I told you; any otherwise than what you know.</p>
               <p>Do you mean, yes or no, to say this man's character is a good one? - I know nothing at all about his character, any otherwise than what I have told you.</p>
               <p>How long have you known him? - I have lived in Edmonton parish about twenty-five or twenty-six years; he never lived in that parish; I have known him seven or eight years.</p>
               <p>Knowing him seven or eight years, you know nothing about his general reputation? - I know nothing against the man.</p>
               <p>That is not my question? - You may talk as long as you like, I shall say no more to you.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do you mean to swear you know nothing of his general reputation? - I never heard any thing amiss of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090105"></xptr>him, any otherwise than this horse, and this affair of the Alderman's.</p>
               <p>No other thing? - No.</p>
               <p>What was that seven years ago? - I know nothing at all about seven years ago.</p>
               <p>Was this man's general character a good one? - I can tell nothing about the man's character.</p>

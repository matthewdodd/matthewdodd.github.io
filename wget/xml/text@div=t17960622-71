               <p>I came out of Yorkshire, I have been married about three months to a soldier; and I was coming through London, and I met this woman, and I asked her for lodgings; I went home with her and slept with her, may be about a week, and she brought this man to the house to sleep and put him to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he very drunk? - A. I am sure I do not know; and then we went into a neighbour's house; she went up stairs for a candle, and I followed her; I met her upon the stairs with the man's breeches, and putting his watch in her bosom; I did not see the money, how much there was; she put it in her pocket; I burst out a-crying, and said, what shall I do? and she said, what a fool I was to cry, and desired me to walk with her all night; and she met a man in the morning and gave it to him or fold it to him, I don't know which; and I wanted to tell this man that she had given his watch away; and she cried and begged me not to do it.</p>

               <p>I apprehended the prisoner and the last witness; she was very violent, and made use of very bad expressions; she ran to get a knife, and swore she would not go to any gaol; I lost two or three days looking after the watch, but never found it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went into a public house to get some beer, the prosecutor was sitting there; we were both in liquor; he gave this woman a shilling and me a shilling, and this young woman made a bed upon the ground; and he waked me in the night and said his watch was gone, and the young woman was gone, and he gave me leave to go and see after her; if I had stole it I should not have gone back to the room again; the gentleman offered me four guineas to put off my trial till next Sessions.</p>

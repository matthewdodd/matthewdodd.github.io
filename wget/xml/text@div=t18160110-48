On the 1st of January, the prisoner came to my master's house, between nine and ten at night; he asked for a glass of gin; I served him; he tendered me a three-shilling token in payment; it was not a good one. I suspected him, and detained him, and sent for an officer, Mr. M'Combie; who came, and took him into custody. He said that he could not have the gin, for he had no money. I saw Mr. M'Combie search him, and he had three eighteen-penny pieces, which were good, on him, three good shillings, and tenpence in halfpence. The glass of gin was to have come to two-pence.</p>

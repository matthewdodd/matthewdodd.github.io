I was with Mary Ann Smith, in Leman-street, at a little before ten o'clock on a Monday night in last month, close by the railway arch—the two prisoners came up, and Welch used some bad language, and he pushed me about—I told them, in German, to go away and leave me alone, and Smith spoke English to them—they went a few steps and came back—there was no quarrelling, but Welch knocked me down, and when I was down they tore my trowsers and waistcoat, and took my watch, and kicked me—I only had my eye on Welch—M'Guire was close to me, and he kicked me likewise—my watch was in my trowsers pocket, and fastened to a chain round my neck—about two minutes before they came up, I had looked at the time, and it was ten minutes to ten—I had not seen them before I pulled out my watch—I have never seen my watch since—I have seen my chain—I kept hold of Welch till the policeman came, and I gave him into custody—as soon as I rose up from the ground, I did not see M'Guire.</p>

I was with the prose<lb></lb>cutor, in Lambeth-street, on 25th Nov., about a quarter to ten o'clock—the two prisoners came up as we were standing under the arch, talking—he pulled out his watch to look at it, and put it into his pocket—he was bidding me good night, and Welch came up and began to push us about—I told them to go away about their business, and Welch used bad language, and said he should not, and he would knock my eye out—the prosecutor told them to go—he said he would serve him the same—he then struck him and knocked him down—they were wrestling together; Welch was on the top of him—I saw his shirt was pulled out, and his waistcoat and trowsers were open, and the flannel under his shirt was torn open—M'Guire was a short distance from Welch—the prosecutor got up, and in a few minutes I saw Welch hold out his right hand to M'Guire—I saw the watch-guard in Welch's right hand; I snatched it with my left hand—I am not able to say whether anything passed between the prisoners, but I heard M'Guire say, "I have got enough; now I will go"—the policeman came up—I did not see M'Guire again.</p>

               <p>the prosecutor—I secured Welch, and saw in his right hand this watch-guard—Smith snatched it from his hand, and gave it to sergeant Weakford—she said the prosecutor had lost his watch, which had been dragged out of his trowsers-pocket by the prisoner—I examined his trowsers, and found they were torn down—I took Welch to the station, he did not say anything—the prosecutor did not speak English.</p>

On the 1st of June, about two o'clock in the morning, I was going home, and passed the prisoner Nicholls in Norton-falgate, about a quarter-past one o'clock - I had my recollection about me - I was not at all intoxicated; Nicholls overtook me in Shoreditch, and asked me to go home with her; I refused, and gave her a shilling to go away, but she would not; she followed me all the way down Kingsland-road; she took my arm.

I did not push her away when she spoke to me - for I was afraid, for I saw two men in Shoreditch, who I thought belonged to her; she still kept hold of my arm; the first watchman I came to I asked to see me to the next box - I did not tell him I suspected the prisoner, as I understood he was a private watchman, and could not go; she kept laying hold of my arm. I sat down on the step of a public-house to rest; she sat down on the step also. I did not see the other two men after leaving Shoreditch; I fell into a dose; I only had two or three glasses of beer and a pint of porter; when I awoke, I found it was just three o'clock; she was gone then. My watch was in my fob when I sat down at the door. I saw her again about one o'clock at the Office. I had given information. I am sure of her person. I found my watch at the pawnbroker's.</p>

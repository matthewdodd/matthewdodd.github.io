On the 28th of May I was at the Rose public-house, West Smithfield, having a pint of beer; a young woman invited me to her house to tea - I did not know her before - it was not the prisoner - the woman took me to a house in a <placeName id="t18240603-184-crimeloc971">court in West-street</placeName>

The prisoner is the one who held my legs; the other two said they would have a shilling a piece; but the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Have every farthing the b - r has got." As soon as the one had got my money she ran out, the others locked the door and kept me in; they let me out in four or five minutes - I ran to the watch-house at the bottom of Holborn-hill and got an officer, and went to Hatton garden - two officers went and searched the house, but did not find any one; I saw the prisoner in custody on this charge, at Hatton-garden, about ten o'clock the next morning (Saturday) - I knew her directly I saw her - I am sure she is the person - my purse contained a country 1 l. note, a sovereign, and about 60 s. in silver - I had within sixpence of 5 l. - it was between three or four o'clock in the afternoon when I went to the house - I did not stay half an hour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The person you took for the prisoner was not very long in the room - A. No; we had two-pints of beer at the Rose public-house between two of us, and I took part of the quartern of gin which the four of us had at the house - I was frightened when they got me down to take my money - I never saw the prisoner before; she held me by the legs.</p>
               <p>Q. She was more down on the ground than the others. A. They pushed me on the bed - I could see her when I got up, and saw her before I was frightened; I should know them all if I was to see them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where is the house - A. I do not know in what court it is. I took Limbrick there; I saw no number on the door.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor took me to a house in Brewer's-yard, West-street; there is on number to it; the City boundary is near there, but this house is in Middlesex. I know that the prisoner lived in that house. I apprehended her in West-street on Saturday - I had been to her room on the Friday about five o'clock, in consequence of information from Brown - when I took her she denied the charge; I told her I had been to her room on Friday with Thisselton; she said she was in bed in the afternoon. I said we had searched every part of the house, and she could not have been in bed; and after she was committed, on her going to prison she swore a very violent oath, that the countryman should not go into the country alive.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. After declaring her innocence, she got angry at your detaining her - A. I do not know; I am certain the house is in Middlesex.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper, living in. Britannia-terrace. On the 19th of March I was in Greenwich-park, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon—an officer came, and asked me whether I had lost any thing—I said, "No," and removed to another part of the park—he asked me' again, and I missed my handkerchief—we then followed the prisoners, and found this handkerchief in Bates's pocket—it is" mine—I had had it safe in my pocket about a quarter of an hour before—Bates did not make any remark till we got to the police-office—he then said I had thrown it to a lady, and he picked it up—I did not throw it to a lady.</p>

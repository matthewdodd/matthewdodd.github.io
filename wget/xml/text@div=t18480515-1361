                  </hi>, Esq. I am a captain in the Royal Navy, and reside at 5, Eaton-terrace, Pimlico. The prisoner was in my service for a fortnight, as cook and housemaid. On 15th May, in consequence of information, I sent for her, and asked how the soap got into her room—she said she did not know, somebody must have put it there—I said, "I suspect you"—she said she did not, she thought there was a conspiracy, or something of that sort—there was 3 1/2 lbs. of soap, it was very common, for the use of the house.</p>

                  </hi> I am housekeeper to Captain King. On the Saturday evening I found some soap in a closet in the prisoner's bed-room—I took it away, and told Lady Caroline King, who had previously missed some money—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is cut in the way in which I deliver it out for use in the house—I usually gave the prisoner one or two pieces at a time, when she asked me—I have not given her soap more than twice—I have not given her as much as this all the time she has been there—it was kept in a closet in the housekeeper's room—that was kept locked, but I left the keys in it one night.</p>

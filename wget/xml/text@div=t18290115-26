               <p>ANGELEQUE CASTERIQUE. I am the wife of Francois Casterique, of No. 30, Orchard-street. I was at the corner of <placeName id="t18290115-26-crimeloc121">Gilbert-street, Oxford-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18290115-26-crimeloc121" type="placeName" value="Gilbert-street, Oxford-street"></interp>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. What sort of purse was it? A. A long red silk purse, with money at each end; I had it on my arm when I came from home.</p>
               <p>JOHN TAYLOR. I am a baker. I was in the shop at the corner of Gilbert-street, about a quarter before four o'clock- I saw the prosecutrix pass, and saw the prisoner close to her; I saw the purse fall, but did not see from whom - the prosecutrix went on - the prisoner picked up the purse; I went and told her that I thought it belonged to the lady who had just gone on - she said it was 3d. she had got in a piece of brown paper; I did not see what it was - I could not leave my business.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not ask what had fallen? A. No; I knew what she picked up, but I did not ask her- the lady had gone on five or six yards; I had some things in my hands, and could not go - I supposed it was the lady's purse; the prisoner had a barrow near that place, but she did not stop.</p>
               <p>MARY KING. I was at the corner of the street; the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150015"></xptr>soner asked me if I knew whether Mr. Bullock was giving coals away that day - I said I did not; she then picked up what I believe was a red purse, and I saw her put it under her apron.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see what it was? A. No; she said it was three penny-pieces in a brown paper; I have known her twenty-five years - she sells things in the street, and had an honest character.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you speak to her about its being a purse? A. No; I thought it was a red purse when she picked it up, and I said "Halves if the lady don't own it;" she said it was three penny-pieces in a brown paper, which she had dropped; I had nothing more to say about it.</p>
               <p>Q. But you said before the Magistrate you said "Don't say so, it is a purse, and there is more than that in it?" A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say "There is only three half-crowns and one shilling?" A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Then that is a falsehood? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JAMES SELBY. I took the prisoner to the watch-house, and found 10s. 6d. on her, two half-crowns and five shillings in silver, and sixpence in copper; she denied having seen the purse, and I found none on her - she said the money was what she had taken in the course of the day for fish; she generally stands close by that shop - I had not been there that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My husband bought some soles, and I was selling them; Mrs. King passed, and I asked if Mr. Bullock gave out coals - I took four penny-pieces and a sixpence out of my pocket, and I dropped 3d. out of my hand; I saw nothing of the purse.</p>

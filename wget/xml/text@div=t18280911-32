On Saturday, the 12th of July, the prisoner came to me, stating that his mother was dying, and he wanted some relief for her: I said I should make inquiry, and he gave me his address, which I found was false: I saw him at twelve o'clock on the 14th of July in the lobby of my house - I was engaged with some gentlemen till about a quarter-past one o'clock, and at twenty minutes past one, I left my watch over the chimney-piece in my study, and went out to meet a gentleman at the Union hotel, Cockspur-street - it was a gold watch; I returned at two o'clock - I met the prisoner before that near the Union hotel, and asked where he was going; he appeared very much frightened when he saw me, and said he had been on a message for his master; but he had no master - I returned home at two o'clock and missed my watch; he had given me his mother's address as No. 24, Drury-lane - I immediately went to Bow-street, accompanied an officer to Drury-lane, but did not find his mother there; she called on me that evening herself - I afterwards went to where she did live; it was some place leading out of Drury-lane, but I am sure it was not where he directed me; I have not found my property - the watch cost me 40l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Did he give you the address in writing? A. No; I know I went to the address he gave me, but I now forget the number; I think it was No. 24; I paid attention to the number at the time; his mother heard she was inquired after, and then came to me - No. 24 is on the left hand side: she lives in a place on the right side, and about two hundred yards off.</p>

            . I have been five years in Mr. Roach's service; the prisoner lived there some time; he called on Sunday, the 13th of July - I opened the door to him; he said he wanted to see Miss Roach; I went up and told her- she desired me to send him up; he went up, and I did not see him again that day: next morning, about twelve o'clock, he came to the door, and wanted to see Miss Roach; she told me she would not see him - he was in the passage, and came down stairs; I had not asked him down - he stopped in the kitchen till after one o'clock, when Mr. Roach went out: I was not in the kitchen all the time, but the other servant was; he went away a little after one o'clock: after Mr. Roach went out, I saw him in the kitchen - I was in and out of the kitchen during Mr. Roach's absence, and so was the other servant; he left after one o'clock, and went out alone, as far as I know; I did not see anybody go to let him out. The family consists of my master, his two daughters, the housekeeper, cook, and myself - everybody was at home but Mr. Roach; I saw the watch at twelve o'clock that morning hanging over the mantel-piece in the study - it has usually hung there for several years; he sometimes takes it out with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not invite him down stairs? How long had he lived there? A. I believe nearly a year; I did not ask him down; there was nobody to let him out; it was rather warm weather - the outer door is left open sometimes - I will not swear it was not open that day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does the street door stand open in hot weather? A. The street door is never open - I meant the back door; nobody could come in at the back - the kitchen door opens into the area; whether it was open I cannot remember.</p>

             re-examined. I saw the watch about twelve o'clock; Mr. Roach called me about two o'clock, when he missed it; I went into the study, and it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any person come to the house from the time the prisoner left till Mr. Roach came home? A. A person called, whom the cook let in - the prisoner was in the house then - it was about the time that the prisoner came; he went away before one o'clock, but the prisoner was there after; I did not let the person out - it was a man she was buying some cloth of - she was in the kitchen with him, and went out of the kitchen with him to let him out; I did not hear the door opened for him - I know he went out before the prisoner; whether this was before Mr. Roach went out I do not know; I never saw that man before, to my knowledge - he wanted the cook and me to buy some cloth; I went out of the kitchen, but the cook bought some - I think it was between twelve and one o'clock when he left the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know anything of the man? A. No - I have seen him since; he carries cloth about: the prisoner came in while he was there, and went out after him.</p>

            . I am a goldsmith, and live in Drury-lane. I saw the prisoner one Monday in July - I think it was about the end of the month, and about two o'clock in the afternoon I saw him at Seven-dials; I was talking to a young man - he came up, and asked me to go and have something to drink - I went to a public-house- he asked me to go and take a walk with him - I did so; we went to a place, and he sold a watch, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go? A. To Temple-bar, to New Boswell-court; we knocked at the door, and went up stairs - he and the man agreed for the watch; he had told me he was going to sell a watch - he did not shew it to me. Guest lived at the house - I did not see him; I went up stairs afterwards - he went up first: when I got up I saw a tallish young fellow - I did not know his name - I never saw him before: the prisoner was there then, and showed him a watch - I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Be careful what you say - you have been examined before; what day in July did the prisoner come to you in Seven-dials? A. On a Monday - it was in Little St. Andrew-street, at the end of it - I cannot tell the date; he asked me to come and have something to drink - we went to a public-house at the corner of St. Andrew-street; there was a young man with him - nothing was said about a pair of shoes; the prisoner went and bought a pair after we went to Boswell-court - he did not ask me to go with him to buy them, before we went to Boswell-court, or say anything about them - he said he had a watch to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. I am going to ask you a question, and advise you to be careful how you answer - did he shew you the watch? A. No - he did not shew it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he did not show it to you before he went to Boswell-court? A. No; he showed it to me when he got up the court, but not in Seven-dials - we went into the house; I cannot tell the young man's name- Grant is the man who lives there, but he was not in the house - I know him by sight now, but not before this - it was not Grant who I saw in the house; the prisoner sold the watch to the man who was there - I saw the watch afterwards; I think he sold it for 8l., but am not sure; I did not see the man pay - I was not in the room when it was paid; I saw some money on the table; I cannot say how much - the room is on the first floor; I cannot tell whether the shutters were closed - I got there at half-past two or three o'clock; it was a yellow watch, and had two seals - I believe one was plain - the other was a rough looking one; the chain was yellow - I think the watch was a thin one; it had a plain white face - I did not stay there above five minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You at first said you did not see the watch? A. Yes; I saw it, but cannot tell what size it was - he showed it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give any reason for swearing that he did not show it you? A. I cannot; I saw some money on the table - I did not count it, nor see anybody take it up.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to guess the price at 8l.? A I do not know, I am sure - the money was gold; I saw more than four sovereigns. I get my living by hard work now, not at the tread-wheel - I was once a prisoner in this Court - I do not know what it was for; I cannot remember - I think it was for a coat; I was not convicted. I have been tried at Clerkenwell. for an assault, nothing else; I have been before a Magistrate once - I will not swear it was not five times; I think about four times - I was only committed once.</p>

            . I live in Blewitt's-buildings. On the 13th of March, I went into Elizabeth Carr's room, No. 4, Pheasant-buildings, Gray's Inn-lane, about a quarter before seven o'clock, to give her a light; I saw Waters there, counting over some tools; as I went into the room, he pushed the basket under the bed, and one of these tools fell out, which I knew was Mr. Adams', as I had seen him work with it so frequently; I met Mr. Adam just before eleven o'clock, and asked him if he had lost anything; he said Yes, his stocks and bits; I said if he went there he would find them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you in the habit of going to his shop? A. Yes; I go for chips, and see him at work with these tools. Waters never kept company with my sister; he did with Mr. Carr's sister - I did not say anything to Waters about the tools; the tool I saw fall out, was the same as this centre-bit, but larger and darker. I do not know that Waters is a carpenter; I only know him by his coming to Mrs. Carr's - I was in the room about five minutes; I did not take up the tool.</p>

            . I did live in Pheasant-buildings. On the 13th of March, about nine o'clock in the morning, I met the two prisoners at the end of the Buildings, they asked me to give them something to drink; I said, I did not want anything myself, but I gave them some money - Conden took a stock and bit from under his coat, and asked if it was not a shame that he could not get more than 6d. for it; he said they had broken open a house, at Camden-town, which they thought was empty, but it was not - they were disturbed, but got fourteen of these tools, which they had been offered 6d. a-piece for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He did not say at Fox-court? A. No. I have gone by the name of Hughes and White - I have been tried here, and was imprisoned three months. Hughes was my mother's name; and I took that after I got out of trouble. I never went by the name of Crutch.</p>

            . As Davis was going along Gray's Inn-lane, with Conden, on the evening of the 14th, Waters came up to see if he was in custody; and as soon as he saw us, he ran away down Laystall-street - I followed, and took him; when I got him to the watch-house, I asked him where Conden was; he said, what the h - ll was that to him. Conden was then brought to the watch-house, and I said, was it not a shame to rob the poor man of his tools; he said, "You b - r, you may want a tool, before you die."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you an officer? A. No; I am a watch-case maker - Davis asked me to assist him; the tools have not been found.</p>

               <p>Is that man here? - No, the Justice did not think him necessary; I went over to Mr. Fletcher, at Litchfield-street-office; the duplicate being numbered, Mr. Fletcher sent me to Mr. Peake, in St. Martin's-lane, a pawn-broker; there I found a pair of my shoes, but not the shoes I missed; that strengthened my suspicions of the prisoner; I went home and called him in before my father-in-law, and said, Simpson, can you tell any thing of these shoes I have just missed? he said, no; I said, I strongly suspect you have taken them; and he said, Sir, you use me very ill; I said, I have a duplicate here of a pair of shoes that you have pawned; now tell me where you have pawned them; then he turned round, and said, Sir, I have pawned one pair of shoes; this was May the 4th.</p>
               <p>Before he made that acknowledgment, had you given him any reason to hope that you would not prosecute him? - No, for my father-in-law gave me that caution; I asked him where he had pawned them; he directed me to another pawn-broker, in St. Martin's-lane; I then concluded he had pawned more; I think he mentioned two or three other places, but not the place where I had been.</p>
               <p>Did he say he had pawned other shoes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230100"></xptr>How many pair did he say he had pawned? - I cannot say, whether two or three pair.</p>
               <p>Did he say where those were pawned? - I believe he hardly mentioned any name; he mentioned the places; one place in particular, in Long-acre, but could not recollect the name; in St. Martin's-lane amongst the pawn-brokers, I found three or four pair of my shoes; at Peake's, I found two pair; at Mr. Hall's, one pair; that was all I believe, I found for that evening; he was sent to the watch-house, and examined before the Justice; on Saturday morning, that was the 5th of May, he had mentioned a place which I had not time to go to; I think it was in Wardour-street; I desired the Justice to defer the examination till Monday Morning; in the interim, I applied to other pawn-brokers, and found shoes at each; at Mr. Heather's, Longacre, one pair; at Mr. Fleming's, Drury-lane, one pair; at Mr. Lane's, Drury-lane, one or two pair, I will not positively say which; at Mr. Priestman's, one pair; at Mr. Purse's, near the New-church, in the Strand, two pair; I went to one of them, by the direction of the prisoner, and to the other, by my own inclination, to see if there was any more; the several pawnbrokers have the shoes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Leach, prisoner's counsel. You say the prisoner confessed having pawned one pair of shoes? - He did.</p>
               <p>Now are you quite sure that no promise was made him? - I am.</p>
               <p>Was there no conversation previous to his confession? - No, Sir; I told him that I was in possession of a duplicate of one pair of shoes pawned; I did not tell him that I knew where they were, but I said, now Simpson, tell us where they are.</p>
               <p>You had a man and a boy in the shop, besides the prisoner? - I had.</p>
               <p>They had equal access to the shoes as this man? - They had.</p>
               <p>I think you said you missed one pair of shoes that you did not find at the pawnbroker's? - I did.</p>
               <p>So that whoever took those shoes, does not appear to be this man? - It does not.</p>
               <p>He confessed to have pawned a pair of shoes, but you did not find them? - I did not find the shoes that I first missed.</p>

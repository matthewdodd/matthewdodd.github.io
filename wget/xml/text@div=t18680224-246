On 10th February I was on Tower Hill, and saw the prisoner with three or four others, they gave me some suspicion—I saw a party standing beside me go before some ladies and gentlemen—all at once he came to the prisoner and wanted to hand something to him, he did not take it quickly enough, and the other party put it in his pocket—I heard some one call out "Slip," and they separated—I laid hold of the prisoner and said, "Hollo, young man, you have something in your pocket that does not belong to you"—someone behind me gave me a knock in the neck—I looked round, but he ran off—I told the policeman the man must have known it was put in his pocket.</p>

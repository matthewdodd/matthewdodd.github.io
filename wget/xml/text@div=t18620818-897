                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living at Hairbrain-court, Royal Mint-street, Whitechapel—I knew the prisoner when I had my eyesight—she lives nearly opposite me, in the same court—last Saturday three weeks, I came home into the court between 9 and 10 o'clock at night—I found there was some disturbance in the court, and I walked out again—when I last came home I found the prisoner's mother and my wife having a few words—I walked in-doors and told my wife to fetch me out a chair; she did so, and I sat down and was unlacing my boots, and the prisoner's mother came over, struck me twice in the face, spat in my face, and called me a blind bastard—I shoved her away from me, and while so doing, and getting up from my chair, the prisoner threw a jug or bason, I cannot say exactly which, and struck me on the breast—I was crossing over to run after her when my wife, or some other woman, laid hold of me and detained me—during that time the prisoner, I believe, ran up stairs and fetched down another missile—she struck me over the forehead with it, and out a small gash over my eye, say<lb></lb>ing, "There, I'll blind you if I can't do nothing else"—I wrenched myself from my wife's hands, and from the other persons, and ran after the prisoner—her mother and sister were standing at the door, and they detained me from running after her; and while I was wrangling and <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi> with them, she ran down again, jumped down the steps, and gouged me in the eye with</p>

               <p>some small instrument, a key or something, I could not tell what it was—I directly cried out, "My eye is out"—two of the neighbours laid hold of me, led me in-doors, and detained me there till they fetched a police-constable; they gave the prisoner in charge, and two of the neighbours led me up to the police-station, and I gave the charge, and from there they took me to the London Hospital—I lost the sight of my right-eye three years ago last September—I did not strike the prisoner or do anything to her—I did not know at the time that she was in the court; I do not believe she was, at the time the quarrel was going on with my wife.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, White-yard, Royal Mint-street, White<lb></lb>chapel—I was in Hairbrain-court, between 12 and 1 o'clock, on this Sunday morning; and, seeing a disturbance between the prisoner's mother and Harris, I went and said, "Harris, you had better go in-doors"—I took him in-doors and he sat down for about five minutes, and then came out again—the prisoner then came and said, "I will give it you"—she ran up stairs, fetched something down, I cannot say what, and chucked it at Harris—she went up stairs again, fetched down a jug or basin, or whatever it might be, and caught him over the eye—I saw that, and saw him bleed from the eye after it—I heard something fall on the ground, as if from his face—he seemed to be quite sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You had been with him, had you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I was coming from a friendly lend in Royal Mint-street, about 12 o'clock—I did not see the commencement of the disturbance between the prisoner's mother and Harris—there was a regular Irish row going on in the court—I cannot tell what it was that the prisoner threw at the prosecutor; it was rather dark at the time—there was a gas lamp at the other end of the court—it dropped against my feet the second time; that is how I know it was either a jug or a basin—it was lighter at the other end of the court than at the end we were at.</p>

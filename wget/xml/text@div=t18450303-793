                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick Watts—we live in Southwark. On the 27th of Feb. I sent my daughter Frances, who is five years old, to school, which is less than one hundred yards off—she went by herself at half-past two o'clock, and had then a cloak and handkerchief on—at half-past four she was brought back by Mr. Jones and Mrs. Jeal—she had not got her cloak and handkerchief on then—the prisoner had once</p>

At half-past four o'clock that afternoon I saw the prisoner, who had this little child with her—in consequence of what Mrs. Jeal said to me I asked the prisoner who the child belonged to—she told me a lady gave her the child to take a walk—I asked where the lady lived—she told me to mind my own business, and what was that to me—the child showed me her way home—I delivered her to her mother, and gave the prisoner into custody—this cloak was on the prisoner's shoulder, and this handkerchief had some oranges and apples and biscuits in it, tied up.</p>

I had three bundles with me, one of them was the cloth, the other the stockings, and the third the socks; I refused to give them up. They threw me down on a bank by the side of a ditch; one of them covered my eyes, and the other told me to deliver the bundle; I gave them the socks; the stockings were taken out of my great-coat pocket, and the third bundle was in the ditch. I called out murder! A watchman came up to my assistance, when they had left me. I could not see them run away, it was so dark; I do not know which way they went. I could see that they were sailors, by the reflection of the lamp. I did not see their faces. The watchman sprung his rattlc. It was about half past eight o'clock. I only know that they were sailors. They were coming from Kentish-town. The watchman ran towards London. I called out stop thief! I ran after him; when I came up the watchman had the prisoner in custody. He asked me if the prisoner was the man; I told him he was. The persons who robbed me ran towards London. The prisoner had a sailor's jacket on. He was searched, but no part of my property was found on him. The prisoner was going towards London, when we overtook him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that the prisoner is the man who robbed you - A. Yes; because I met nobody else; and he said that he had come from Barnet.</p>

            . I am a patrol belonging to Highgate-hill. Two men in sailors dresses passed me about two hundred yards from Frances's-baru; they were going towards London. A few minutes afterwards I heard a groaning; I went and found the gentleman laying on the ground; he said he had been robbed; I sprung my rattle. I could hear footsteps before me, but could not see, it was so dark. Blundell's box was between Frances's-barn and London; he had stopped the prisoner. Mr. Knight came up without his hat; he said he was sure that he was the man, and that he could swear to his being the man who held his hands over his eyes. The prisoner said, that he had come from Barnet, and was going to Greenwich to receive prize-money; he said he had no papers to show; he said that he had slept the night before under the shambles in Fleet-market.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard the alarm. I ran about fifteen yards, and stopped the prisoner. He asked me to let him pass. He was walking gradually on towards London. He did not attempt to get away.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WHITEHAIR. I am a patrol of Sommers' Town; on the 11th of November, at about a quarter to nine o'clock, the prisoner was brought into the watch-house; I searched him; I only found a knife on him; he said he had slept in Fleet-market the night before.</p>

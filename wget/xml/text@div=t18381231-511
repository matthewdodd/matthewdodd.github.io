                  </hi>. I am in the service of Howell and Co., of Waterloo-place. On the 19th of May last, Norrington came to our shop in a phaeton, at<lb></lb>tended by a servant, who I believe was Caton, for the purpose of giving an order for a variety of goods—he ordered shirts for himself and servant, stockings, drawers, cravats, and gloves for himself and his servant—he said he had just arrived from Boulogne, and that he was about taking a house in the Regent's-park, but was in the mean time staying at the Carl ton Hotel, which is nearly opposite our house—he took some goods away, consisting of satin, crape, and satin cravats—the value of the goods he took came to 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—afterwards, on that same day, I went to the Carlton Hotel, and saw Norrington there—in the mean time something had occurred which excited my suspicion—he had not paid for any of the goods he had—I went to get the money or the goods—I saw him there—he said he could not pay for the goods, he had not the money, he had not received his remittances, but he should have them on Monday—that was on Saturday—a satin dress was part of the articles he took away—he said he had been a customer of ours the season before, and he thought it was extraordinary conduct on our part—I went to ascertain if that was the case—I went again over to him, and he then said, he could not give me the satin back again, as he had given it away—that was on the same day—he said if I would call on the Monday, he would give me a cheque for the money—in consequence of that I went on Monday, and he was gone—s month or six weeks afterwards I met him at the end of Piccadilly—I asked him if his name was Norrington—he said it was not—I said it was, and he had not paid for the things he had of me some time before—he appeared as if he suddenly recollected it, and said he had not received his remit<lb></lb>tances, when he expected them—he had given me the name of Norrington when he first came to the house—he gave me his card—he did not persist in saying that his name was not Norrington, but he said if I would call at his lodgings on Monday at Thistle-grove, Brompton, he would give me the money—I did not agree to that, and refused to leave him—we walked some distance, he then proposed that I should go to Thistle-grove with him—he walked a little way and a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was called—he told the man to go to Down-street, Piccadilly, as he thought he could <hi rend="italic">get</hi> the money nearer than by going to Thistle-grove—we got out there, and went down Brick-street; Norrington rang a bell at a stable door, and a person who stood inside said there was nobody at home—we got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> again, and Norrington gave directions to the man to drive to Thistle-grove—I was not satisfied with that, and desired the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-man to drive to my employers, Howell and James—Norrington refused to go there, and attempted to leave the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he opened the door—I took his arm, pulled him back, and threatened to give him in charge if he attempted to leave—I took him to Howell and James,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183812310073"></xptr>
               <p>and the clerk of our solicitor was sent for—we agreed that he, and I, and Norrington should go to Thistle-grove, where Norrington said he had 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was all he could pay at present—we went there, and Norrington went in—there was a back and front door—I waited at the back door, and the clerk at the front door—Norrington came out two or three times while we waited—he found us there and went in again—Sidford* came out after some time—he said Mr. Norrington had come to him, bat be could do nothing, or something to that effect—and he said he had recommended Him, as his uncle must know of the circumstances, to go to his uncle and state it to him at once—his uncle's address was men<lb></lb>tioned, as at Lower Eaton-street, Pimlico, a Mr. Chambers was mentioned—we all went to this uncle, in Lower Eaton-street, accompanied by Sid<lb></lb>ford, who went at Norrington's request—we found a young woman in the shop—Norrington had some conversation with her, which I did not hear, and then Norrington said it was very unfortunate that his uncle was not at home—he then had some further conversation with the young woman in the passage—she then came back from the passage, and Sidford asked her if Norrington had stated the business on which we were come—that at<lb></lb>tracted my attention—I rather listened, and while I was listening Norring<lb></lb>ton made his escape—he must have gone out at the back way and crawled across the yard, or I should have seen him through the window at the back of the shop—he must have crouched down—I saw Norrington about a month afterwards at the George and Blue Boar, Holborn—and I gave him into custody there—I took him to Marlborough-street, and he was dis<lb></lb>charged.</p>

On the 10th of September the pri<lb></lb>soner Keene called at my master's—he requested that 1000 bricks should be sent to his building in Bury-street, St. James's, and he would pay for them on delivery—I sent them, and, in consequence of what the carman told me when he came back, I went to Bury-street—I saw Keene there—he said he should require another 1000 of bricks to complete his building, and if I would send them, he would pay for both lots together—he said be should want about 20, 000 more, and he would give me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as earnest for the 20, 000, if I would send the second 1000—this induced me to part with the second 1000 of bricks—I have never been paid for them—he also had twelve casks of cement, which were sent the same day, or a day or two afterwards—he sent a written order to our wharf for some more—I deli<lb></lb>vered him eighteen casks of cement, which came to nearly 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he told me it was to be used on his own premises in Bury-street, where I found him—the bricks were 38<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a 1000—that made the bill somewhere about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the whole—we have not got one halfpenny.</p>

In the latter end of June the prisoner Keene came to me, and said he wanted a roof covered, in Bury-street, St. James's, and he had been recommended to me—I covered the roof, and made one large skylight—I likewise covered a small roof, and made a skylight for that—they were to be covered with the best zinc—he told me where to go to cover these roofs, and I went and examined the roofs before I did it—it was in Bury-street, St. James's, I think No. 12—he said he held the leases under the Woods and Forests, and he was a man of property—the bargain was, that I was to receive the money for these roofs as soon as the job was finished, and I was also to draw wages on Saturday nights—I think I was at work there a month altogether—it was surveyed afterwards—I asked for money for wages, but I did not get any—he represented that he was going to get a mortgage, and he gave me this bill for £20 on account—he asked me if I wanted cash for it, and said that a gentleman of the name of Captain Riley, whom he represented as a man of property, would cash it for me—I asked him what he would-charge—he said he would charge me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not like to get it cashed on such terms, and I paid it away immediately—it came back, and was noted—I never got a shilling for it—this was for wages—the job, altogether, came to somewhere about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received some lead from him, but that was for another separate job, not what I have mentioned—I also received 1250 bricks and four casks of cement of him.</p>

Pelvey and Julian—Keene wanted me to accept him as a tenant in the room of Messrs. Pelvey and Julian—I said it was no use doing that, because the lease was just as good assigned as it was to have a pair of fresh leases—I knew that at that time Keene was in possession of that house, and I said to him, "I know you have got possession of my house through my tenants"—he then told me he had been a builder in the</p>

On the 1st of Oc<lb></lb>tober I remember Norrington coming to my master's shop—in consequence of orders on the 6th of October I took a number of things to No. 6, Great Ryder-street—I received some directions with reference to the mode in which I was to conduct myself—it was not my intention to leave the goods without being paid for them—I went about half-past one o'clock, and was shown into a room on the first floor—I found Caton there, in livery—I asked him if Mr. Norrington was at home—he said he was not at home, he was gone out, but was coming home to breakfast—I waited about an hour and a half—at the end of that time Norrington came in, and said, "Oh, you have brought the things"—I opened them on the tables—he tried on the dressing-gown, and looked at the shirts—he said they would do, and asked where were the silk-handkerchiefs—none had been ordered—that threw me off my guard—in consequence of that I went home to get some silk-handkerchiefs to show him, and in my hurry left the things behind me—I told him I did not know any were ordered—he rang the bell, and Caton came up—he asked him if he had ordered the silk-handkerchiefs—Caton looked rather confused, and said he believed he had, he did not know—Norrington said he had told him to order them, and I had better go back and get a selection of silk-handkerchiefs, and he would wait my return—I went for the patterns—I should think I was gone about three-quarters of an hour—I was returning as quickly as I could, and as I passed through Trafalgar-square, I met Norrington with a gentleman—I stopped him, and told him I was going to his house with the silk-hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs—he said I need not go, he was going to the shop to select them—I went back to the shop with him, and Johnson showed him some—he selected some, and said he should be at home at seven o'clock, or half-past, that evening—in the evening I went to the place to see him, and took another bill, with the silk-handkerchiefs added, making it 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, to get the money—I did not find him at home—I waited about two hours, hut he did not come—I saw the landlady—she said she believed he was gone to Drury-lane Theatre with a friend, and very probably he would be home very late—on the Monday morning following I went again, and saw the landlady—she said Norrington had gone the day before to his mother's, at Feversham—I saw no more of him, nor the goods—about three weeks afterwards I was in the neighbourhood of Pimlico, and met Caton—I knew him again, and asked if he knew where his master was—he said no, he did not, his master had discharged him at Feversham, and he was then going after another situation—on Tuesday, the 28th of November, I received information, which led me to Brown's Hotel, Palace-yard—I</p>

               <p>found Norrington there—I waited in the coffee-room—I heard him come down stairs, and I went into the passage towards him—he had just got to the bottom of the stairs—he saw me, and immediately ran up stairs—Sid<lb></lb>ford was with him—I had got the Police Inspector with me—I went up stairs after Norrington, with the Inspector—I looked under one of the beds, and Norrington was under one—the Inspector told him to come out—in about a minute afterwards he came out, and he was taken to the station-house-Sidford was also taken—Caton was taken the same evening, at the same house.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a hosiery and outfitting warehouse, in the Quadrant. Between the 15th and 20th of September, Norrington came to my shop one evening, and said he wanted to look at some hosiery, gloves, and so on—I showed him some—he said, "Poh, poh man, don't show me such things as these, show me some fit for a gentleman to wear"—I showed him some others—he said they were not such as he wanted, he wanted something fit for a gentleman to wear—he said he wanted a quantity of goods, that he was going to India in a short time—I showed him some shirts at a guinea a-piece—he said, "These are the sort of things I want, why don't you keep other goods to correspond with them"—he wrote down his address on a card, and I was to take some the next day to Great Ryder-street—I went at four o'clock, the time he appointed—I did not see him there, but as I was coming from the house I saw him going to the house with a lady—I then returned, and showed Norrington the goods—he said, "How am I to know whether these shirts will fit, will you leave them for me to try on?"—I agreed to that, and as I was leaving he said to me, "By the bye, do you keep bandannas?"—I said, "Yes, I keep a good stock of them"—I then came away, leaving him three shirts as patterns—when I got back to my shop, I found him close at my heels, within a yard of me—he said, "I will save you the trouble of bringing the bandannas down, I will select them here"—he then selected fourteen at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, and two dozen of gloves—he said nothing about the shirts then, any more than he would try them on; but not exactly liking his manner, I sent back, and got the shirts—I did not send the handkerchiefs nor gloves—he came back the next day and said he thought I could fit him, and he ordered twelve shirts, which were to be charged 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; 2 dozen of gloves at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the fourteen bandannas—they were to be sent on Saturday evening, and the money was to be paid—I said I gave no credit, and he said he would pay for them—the same evening be came in a gig, and Caton came in and said Mr. Norrington was in the gig, and wanted some gloves, which I took out to him—he said he was going out of town—Norrington selected two pairs of gloves,</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of David Mickle, we live in Park-road, Regent's Park—my husband had a house to let at No. 33 1/2 South Bank. On the 29th of October Norrington came to me—he said he had seen the cottage, and liked it—I required a reference, and he wrote down this reference for me—(<hi rend="italic">reading</hi>)—"To Mr. Keene, 12, Bury-street, St. James's, by nine o'clock;" and in the corner is "Mr. Norrington"—he was to pay 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year rent—he told me Keene was his guardian, and he told me he was going to build a house for him, which would be ready in about twelve months—this was on a Monday, and on the Tuesday two ladies came to me for Mr. Norrington—they waited, but he did not come—I went with them to No. 33 1/2 South Bank, and found Norrington there—Norrington took the cottage, and was to come on the Wednesday at twelve o'clock—an hour or two after Norrington left, Keene came—he looked over the cottage, and approved of it for Mr. Norrington—he said Norring<lb></lb>ton could quite afford to pay the rent—Keene came again on the Thursday, the next day, and I then asked him when we were to expect Norrington—Keene said, "I am going to stay here"—I said, "What are we to do with the young people?"—Keene said, "That is not your business; that is mine"—I said, "Then perhaps you do not wish us to stay any longer"—he said, "Certainly not"—I then gave him up the inventory, and left the house—on the same day Norrington came to me between eight and nine o'clock in the evening—he had two females with him, and Caton as a servant—Norrington asked me why we had disposed of the cottage to any one else—I said there could not be any harm or any thing wrong, for it was his guardian, Mr. Keene, who had looked at it for him, to whom he had given his reference—he asked me what he should do, as they had brought the things—I said I was very sorry, and I wished I could offer him any accommodation—he asked me if he could leave his things—I said, certainly he could, and if my beds were aired, I should have been glad to have offered him the accommodation, but they had not been slept in for three weeks—he went down to the coach-door, talked a little while, and then came up again, and said he thought they would accept of the offer—the two ladies, himself and the servant, then came, and I fur<lb></lb>nished them with accommodation and board for that night—they came in a hackney-coach, and three days ago the hackney-coachman came for the fare—Norrington told me that the ladies were Mrs. Norrington and bet sister—Mrs. Norrington and Mr. Norrington went the next day to Mr. Keene, and I went and asked Mrs. Norrington what they were going to do—she said it was only a whim of Mr. Keene going to the cottage, and he would give it them the next day—on the Friday Norrington went to the</p>

Keene called on me on the 6th of November, and said he had known Mr. Mickle along time, that he had taken 33 1/2, South Bank, of him, and that he had a home it St. James's, that he did not want credit, but he came to deal with me, and he paid weekly—he gave me an order—I executed that and others—they were taken in by his housekeeper, whom he called "Old nurse"—I also sup<lb></lb>plied Caton and Norrington with goods, and did not get the money—after Norrington and Caton were gone I went after Keene—I found him in his parlour—he said, "Norrington is the cause of all this—the girl placed a chair on one side of the fire for me, and Keene sat on the other—he said he was guardian to Norrington, but not to a great amount, but he could not pay my bill without the consent of another guardian—he said I had behaved the best of any of the parties there, and had not created a dis<lb></lb>turbance, and I should be paid—he put his hand into his pocket, and I thought I was going to get the money, but be only pulled out a pencil and wrote it down, and said I should be paid when he came out of the City.</p>

               <p> I am a pawnbroker, in Portpool-lane: On Monday last, between twelve and one O'clock, the prisoner at the bar came to my shop, with a clock, and asked me to lend him five guineas upon it; it was an eight-day table clock; he then laid down the duplicate of a coat, which I had in pledge for 8s. 6d. and desired to redeem that; I interrogated him whose clock it was; he said, it was his own; that that was his name on the dial plate, Mr. Johnson; I knew Mr. Johnson's house very well, and knew that he was a very respectable man; I asked him where he lived; he said, No. 22, Great Warner-street; I asked him if he kept a house; he said, no, he was in lodgings; I asked him if he was a single man; he said, he was a married man, but had no family; I told him I knew Mr. Johnson very well, and supposed he could have no objection to my sending for Mr. Johnson, and asking him if he had sold the clock at any time. The coat was pledged in the name of Johnson, he said it was his own; I asked him what he gave for it, he made me rather an evasive answer, and said, The clock was worth 201. I called my lad on one side, and desired him to go to the Police-office in Hatton-garden, and bring an officer. I asked him some more questions; he said, he had the clock to clean of Mr. Macklin, No. 22, Berkley-street; he said, he had sold it to Mr. Macklin, and bought it again of him second-hand, this was during the boys absence; however, I judged that the prisoner conjectured where I had sent the lad, and he immediately went out of my shop; I had the clock; I then opened a private door, pursued him and took him; I brought him back to the shop where he remained, till the officer came, who conveyed him to the office; when he was at the Magistrates, he confessed that he had it from Mr. Downing's servant, and endeavoured to prejudice Mr. Downing's servant, by saying, he had been drinking with him, and that he had given him orders to come for it.(The clerk produced in Court).</p>

               <p>This clock is my property; I did not miss it till I saw it at the public-office; I saw it on the Monday morning when I came down stairs to breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given any one directions to take it away, for the purpose of cleaning? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you ever see him before? - A. I think he was a person that had been at work in my house, but I am not certain; I asked him the question, and he denied it.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the value of the clock? - A. I gave nine guineas for it; I thought I had seen him before; I sent to the principal workman that I had, and they told me it was not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you ever give the prisoner any directions to take it down to clean it? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. What particular species of clock is it? - A. An eight-day table-clock.</p>
               <p>(To Edwards). Look at that clock. - A. It has never been out of my possession since he brought it to my house.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Smith). Is that the clock you delivered to the prisoner? - A. That is the clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was taking a pint of porter in Hatton-garden, there was a servant-man there; I told him I was not capital at new work, I used in the country to clean old work; I thought it was Mr. Downing's servant; and he told me of a place where a clock was to be cleaned; I went to the house, and I did not see the man; I thought Mr. Downing had two servants, and I asked for the clock to clean, the young man gave it to me immediately; I meant to have brought the clock back, but I was distressed at the time.(The Prosecutor recommended him to his Majesty's mercy).</p>

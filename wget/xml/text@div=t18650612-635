                  </hi>. I live at 3, Canterbury-place, Millwall, and am an engineer—on the night of 16th May, I went to bed at 11 o'clock—to the best of my belief the house was then safely closed—I was awakened and heard a noise; I got out of bed, and then I heard steps run through the passage and out at the back—my bedroom is on the ground floor—I then went into the kitchen and found the window right up at the top, and the door wide open—I went out and got a policeman—he found a cap—I missed a coat, a pair of trousers, and two vests, worth about 5<hi rend="italic">i</hi>.—I had seen them safe on 16th in the drawers in the front parlour.</p>

On the morning of 17th May, at half-past 12, I saw the last witness and went to his house—we went into the back yard, where I saw this cap (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was near the back door—I know the prisoner—I saw him about 11 in the evening, he was then wearing this cap—after searching over several yards I found him in a shed in rear of his father's house—he was lying down and he had no cap on—I asked him where his cap was, he said he did not know—I told him I should take him into custody for breaking into the house, No. 3—J then took him to 3, Canterbury-place, where I had left the cap—I showed it to him and he said, "That is my cap, how did you come by it?"—I told him it was found close to the back door where the robbery was committed—I have not discovered the clothes that were lost.</p>

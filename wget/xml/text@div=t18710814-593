                  </hi>. I am relieving officer to the City of London Union—on Saturday, 8th July, I was standing on Tower Hill, looking towards the Tower Gate—a little dog I had with me began to bark at something, and I looked over my shoulder; I saw the prisoner—his chest was almost touching my right shoulder—I saw his hand pass in front of me with incredible swiftness—he gave a very violent pull at my watch guard—the guard did not break, and the next minute I saw my watch in the prisoner's hand—he examined the bow, and endeavoured to detach it from the swivel—I held out my hand, and he put the watch back in my hand—I said "You thought to rob me of my watch, but the swivel is too good for you"—I gave him into the custody of 223 <hi rend="italic">H.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The Tower clock struck 7.15 as the prisoner dashed his hand across me—I went on Tower Hill for a breath of fresh air—I had been attending to my duties all day—I am responsible at the Union night and day, and I don't get much time to myself—there was a crowd there, but I was not of the crowd or in the crowd—the volunteers were coming down—I found a policeman forty yards away—the prisoner did not attempt to run away, he had not the chance to do it—I did not hear the prisoner say to the officer "This man charges me with attempting to steal his watch"—he told me I had made a mistake—I said I could swear he took ray watch and put it in my hand afterwards—I told the constable I charged him with attempting to steal my watch, and that was all I said—the prisoner has been in custody since 8th July.</p>

The prisoner was at my house, in company with some other gentlemen, on the evening of the 13th of May. The prisoner staid about three minutes after the rest were all gone: then he came down stairs, and went out. I went up stairs directly, and missed the tankard. I had carried it up between ten and eleven o'clock. I have never seen it since it was stolen.</p>

               <p>On the 13th of May, I went to the prosecutor's, to spend the evening with some friends. We had the silver tankard before us, and drank out of it several times. We all went away together, except Mr. Keeling. The tankard was before him, when we went away. We parted company at the end of Chancery-lane. Just as we had parted, Mr. Keeling overtook me. His coat was buttoned, and he had his hand in his pocket. I did not observe that he had any thing, as I had no suspicion. I never heard any thing amiss of him before.</p>

               <p>I belong to the society at Maylin's . After the club was over, there were six of us staid. I was the last but one that left the room. Just before I went, Mr. Keeling asked me to drink some beer, which I declined. I left him with the tankard on the table before him.</p>

I was afraid she would turn us out, and so I told her my Wife had only got a Cold; but the Prisoner bid us get out, for we should not lie there; my Wife said she was not able to get up, and beg'd her for God's sake, to let her stay till Morning, tho' all she could say signified nothing, for the Prisoner would not be pacify'd till we were gone. So, with much ado, I and the Maid help'd my Wife up, and put on her Shoes and Stockings and some otherof her Clothes; and while we were doing it, the Prisoner's Husband call'd up, and said, What are you not coming yet? I'll fetch you with a Devil to you. Upon which the Prisoner hurried us, and would not give us Time to put on my Wife's Things; So the Maid and I help'd my Wife out to a Bench in the Street, and there I drest her, and before we could get to Church-lane, she drop'd down dead.

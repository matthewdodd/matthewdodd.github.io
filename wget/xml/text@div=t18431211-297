                  </hi>. I am carpenter and builder, at Beaufort-place, North Fulham. I am finishing some new houses, and on the evening of the 27th of Nov. I left with my son, leaving some tools on a bench in the front room—the front doors were locked—we returned in about twenty minutes, and found the prisoner in the back-room—I asked how he came there—he intimated that he was tipsy—I went for a policeman, got a light, and found a smooth<lb></lb>ing-plane and stock in the parlour which had been on the bench in the other room—the prisoner had worked on the premises about three weeks before.</p>

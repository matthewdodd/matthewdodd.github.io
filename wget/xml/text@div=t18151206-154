I know the prisoner at the bar; he came into my master's shop, at about seven o'clock in the evening of the 21st of November; he asked for a pair of worsted hose, the price of which was two shilings and sixpence; he tendered me payment in three single shillings; I looked at them, and they were all bad. I told my master to look at them, and he was of the same opinion. The prisoner then wanted them back, and put a three-shilling piece down. Mr. Kennyon asked him if he had any more of the same sort, and would not let him have them back. He said he had no more, and pulled some halfpence out. He swore that he had no more. Then Mr. Kennyon sent for a constable. The prisoner stood there. He was running away, when Mr. Kennyon took hold of the flap of his coat, and detained him. He then put his hand in his pocket, and pulled out a purse, which he threw behind the counter. I picked it up, and kept it until the officer came. Then he examined the purse. They had shocking hand work in keeping the prisoner down; he knocked Mr. Kennyon down, and he knocked the shopman down, and when the constable came, he knocked him down also. I escaped; I got behind.</p>

            . The account my shopman has given is not correct, with respect to my being knocked down. In other repects it is correct. I have the three shillings which he tendered in payment. (Producing them.) Here is also the purse, in which there two divisions, (producing it,) ine one of which there is good money, a dollar, a three-shilling piece, and a shilling, and in the other division there are four more bad shillings.</p>

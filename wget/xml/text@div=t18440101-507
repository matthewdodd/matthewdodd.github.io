               <p>of Dec. I was on duty in front of the prosecutor's house, in Bedford-place, Lambeth, and thought I heard footsteps at the back—I went through the front gate, and walked on the grass-plat—when I got in front of the house, I was obliged to step off the grass on to the gravel—I then distinctly heard footsteps behind the house, I ran round, and while doing so, heard a noise like a person jumping down—when I came round to the back of the house, I saw four men running, and making their escape as from the back parlour window—I secured the prisoner, who was one of them—he made considerable resistance—I sprung my rattle—Cunningham and several constables came to my assistance—I noticed the parlour window open, and the window shutters inside shoved up—no one without could have pushed it up without opening the window, and not then if they had been fastened properly—the shutter was about eighteen inches up—I did not notice the prisoner's feet then—I took him to the station, and found one of his boots unlaced, and the other partly so—I found nothing on him—I returned to the prosecutor's house—the window was then shut down—the kitchen window was open, but I believe, by no force, it was impossible for any one to get in there—it was secured by iron bars—I could not see any attempt at the bars—I had passed the back parlour window three or four times before, that night—the last time was about an hour before I apprehended the prisoner—it was safe then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Bedford-place, Clapham-road, in the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth. "On the night of the 5th Dec., I retired to bed about a quarter to eleven—I fastened the shutter of the parlour window myself—I use that room as my surgery—the proper fastening was a screw bolt, but I had dropped that in the shutter ease, and had substituted a pair of forceps for it—I pushed them in the hole and then separated the blades—about half-past two o'clock I was disturbed—I came down—the window and shutters were then both raised about a foot and a half, or two feet—a person could not open the shutter without putting his hand through the window—I am not certain that the window was shut when I fastened the shutters.</p>

I went to take my hand out of his, and he took out his staff and rapped me over the head; at the office he said nothing about the window being fastened at first till the prosecutor said he could not swear whether it was fastened or</p>

                  </hi>, I am the wife of James Spring—I carry oh the business of a laundress, at Clapham. On the 20th of Oct I saw the prisoner getting out of an omnibus—she accompanied me to her mother's residence—the policeman told her the charge we had against her, and that he must search her boxes—they were searched—I do not know how they were opened—they were in her bed-room—she had been in my service, and had left me the night before—her boxes went there from my house—these things were found in them, in the prisoner's presence—here are two pieces of common lace—the prisoner said, "They are yours, I meant to return them"—Mary Ann Howell, the prisoner's sister, was there, and I said to her, "You told me you had a bundle of handkerchiefs that she gave you, and said her husband bought at a sale"—I asked her to produce them—they were produced, and the prisoner said they were hers—these are them—I have examined them—I had had them to wash—five of them I had from Mrs. Shaw—I know them by their marks—this one is Caroline Merriman's—these two are Catharine Shaw's—this is Caroline Ward's, and this is Miss Hutton's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> We were living on those terms, that my things were as often in her boxes as hers were in mine; I do not know how that lace came into the box; I wished her to search my boxes before I left; I never noticed these handkerchiefs; they were not new when they came into ray possession,. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She did ask me to search her boxes, but I did not think I should find anything there—the lace I should not have noticed, but she gave that up herself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I several times mentioned that I had not a pair of stockings to put on; my handkerchiefs were hemmed and marked, and if they were put into the wash they never could be seen afterwards; I had nothing to do with the packing till within the last three months; she had a woman that always attended to fetching the things, and packing and unpacking the clothes; I know where she lives, and could produce her in this Court; I bought the handkerchiefs before ever I came to Mrs. Spring's, without she has changed my handkerchiefs.</p>

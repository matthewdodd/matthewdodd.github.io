                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Norris, of 94, Great Guildford Street, Southwark, a pattern maker—the two female prisoners came to my house on 30th June—I had two rooms to let—they did not take the rooms, but said they would send their husbands, and John Lucy and Charles Warner came and took the rooms—they were to have taken possession on the Saturday, but they did not come in until the following Monday—the two women came then and the man Lucy—they continued there up to the time of Lucy being taken into custody, and Rabout came backwards and forwards to the house twice.</p>

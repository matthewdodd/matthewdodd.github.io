I live at 19, Davis Street, Lambeth—on the evening of 11th August last, I was sent into Lambeth Walk—the prisoner came up, and asked me which was Lambeth Walk—I told him he was in Lambeth Walk—he said, "Can you tell me the way to the New Cut"—he followed me up the Walk to Regent Street—I went into a shop—when I came out, he was outside—he followed me back, and said, "Take the things home, and come again in five minutes, and I will give you some new clothes—I went home and told my mother—father wanted me to fetch some</p>

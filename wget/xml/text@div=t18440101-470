                  </hi>. I am a printer, and live in Earl-court, Leicester-square. Knight was my apprentice—in consequence of information, on the 18th Dec. I went with a policeman to Rich's house, in Kingsgate-street, Holborn, where be carries on the printing business—he was not at home—I went into his office, and found some type, some borders, and iron side-sticks, which I claimed—the type was by itself, laid out for regular business—each type was distri<lb></lb>buted into a case, as we always keep them—I took from the case what I claimed—these are them—I had been missing such type, and side-sticks, and borders, for the last eight or ten months, to the amount of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—when I hid selected these. Rich came in—I said, "You have property on your premise! brought here by Knight, my apprentice"—he made no reply—I said, "Tell me the founder whom you got these things from?"—he said he did not know—I afterwards produced the two side-sticks to him, and said, "These are my property"—he made no answer—Knight was outside the door at the time, is custody—I gave the type to the policeman—Rich did not say anything on that—I then gave him into custody—he and Knight were taken to the police-court—I returned'with the policeman to Rich's premises—I there found some more type and side-sticks, which I claimed—they were in cases in different parts of the office—there was a man named Napier in our company—he col<lb></lb>lected with me that portion that forms these two lots—I am positive they aw mine—there is about six or seven pounds of type altogether—neither Knight nor any one, had authority from me to lend or dispose of any articles in my business—before I went to Rich's that morning, Knight had been called down into the presence of Napier, and he had identified Knight as the person he alluded to—Knight did not make any answer—there was some type found behind the bed which belonged to me—there is a practice in the trade of one printer bor<lb></lb>rowing a line of type from another, but it would be kept together—if one printer was to borrow the words "boots and shoes" it would be kept together in that state in his office.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184401010079"></xptr>
               <p>so gradual as these—Mr. Hopkinson, the engineer, makes them—this gra<lb></lb>dual slope is my plan—it adjusts the type more accurately—these bars are type as well as the letters—there is nothing in the ban that I can identify—they are not at all uncommon—there is no slant in this"U" or "W"—I can identify them, because I have lost property of this description—other type would not be of the same colour—according to the wear and usage it hat, it loses its brightness—type used the same number of times, would have the same appearance—I do not swear to this type—it forms a complete border—I got this border from his place—neither of these borders on this card are my printing—I do not know Bell—I have seen him—I have heard that he is the person from whom Rich purchased the business—Bell gave me his direction, which I gave to my solicitor—on going to Rich's house, I had this conversation—to the best of my recollection, I am prepared to swear that this was the whole of the conversation—I swear that I first said, "You have property on your premises brought by Knight," and that I said that before I asked from what founder he bought the type—I will swear there were not twenty other questions asked before that—nor ten—nor five—the policeman was present—I only found his wife there—I merely said I was come to search for stolen goods—I did not send her into a fit—Rich came in in about five minutes—I did sot hear his wife say, "Here is a fine thing, Mr. Nichols is here searching this place for stolen goods"—it might have taken place—Rich did not sty, "What business has Mr. Nichols here?"—I do not think he knew my name—I said words to this effect," Mr. Rich, you have got a great deal of my type here"—he did not say, "No, I have not," nor say no, at all—I said, "Oh, my apprentice has told me all about it, and owned to every thing"—I did not say "You may as well assist me in the search"—the officer did not, in my pre<lb></lb>sence, caution him from saying anything—Rich did not say, "Oh, I do not care, he may search as long as he pleases, and take away what he likes"—that may be the substance of what he said, but they were not his words—I was collecting a lot of type together—he said, "You may as well say the whole office is yours"—I have been acquainted with Napier since the day he was brought into the parlour by my brother—I ascertained that he was in Bell's employ that day—I have offered to take Napier into my employ—I think that must have been on the 2nd examination—it was not on the examina<lb></lb>tion on which Napier admitted that what he had said before, was false—it waa on the third examination, he said that—it was after my offer to take him into my service—it was not because I thought him a liar that I offered to take him—it was on account of his honesty in the first instance—in fact I did not make the offer, it was suggested—my brother said, "I think this boy deserves to be taken in your place," and I said, "In all probability I may."</p>

               <p>Q. Is that document signed by the captain? - A. It is, by the captain, the boatswain, and another officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the captain's hand-writing perfectly well? - A. I have known it for years.</p>
               <p>Q. By that list does there appear to be more than one William Harper in the crew? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There is one William Harper? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you make it known that you attend there to pay prize money? - A. We advertise it in the London Gazette, agreeable to Act of Parliament.</p>

               <p>Q. Is it the course of business to require a certificate of a man that comes for prize-money? - A. I alway do, unless some officer of the ship comes with him, to vouch for him. He pulled out of his pocket this certificate, which I know to be forged.</p>
               <p>(It is read): "These are to certify that William"Harper has served on board his Majesty's ship"the Powerful, in the capture of the French India"ship the Countess of Rochmandorss, and is enti"tled to a share of any such prize-money as is due"from the said ship.

               <p>Q. Should the certificate, in the course of business, come from the purser? - A.Sometimes from others, where we know their hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the purser of the ship, at the time of the capture? - A. Mr. Stanger.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the present purser of his Majesty's ship Powerful? - A. I do not know. Upon his producing the certificate, he said, he wanted his money; I told him, I should pay him nothing, but I should take care of the certificate, for, in my opinion, it was a forgery; he said, he would not go without his money; Mr. Haydon then said, it is impossible to be right, for I have received that money long since; the prisoner made no answer to that, but still insisted that he would be paid, before he left the house; Mr. Haydon said, he would send for a constable; I believe a constable was sent for, but they could not get one; he staid upwards of three hours, till we had done our business, and went out of the room, and then he followed us; I told him, he was in a bad plight, and he had better go about his business; he said, he would not go without the money, or I should give him his certificate back; one or other he would have. When we had done our business, Mr. Haydon went out of the room; this man followed, and I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the money, due to the real William Harper, been paid? - A. Yes; I had paid it all to Mr. Haydon long ago.</p>

               <p>Q. Who were in the office when I came in? - A. Myself and Mr. Haydon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there nobody else there? - A. Not at the time when he first came in; there were two or three gentlemen came in during the time that he sat there.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did I leave the office? - A.Between five and six o'clock; after Mr. Haydon left the room, he followed me.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you present when Mr. Maddocks was paying the prize-money of the Powerful? - A. I was, at the White-lion, Wych-street, about one o'clock, on Monday, the 28th of January; the prisoner came in, and said, I believe to Mr. Maddocks, I am not sure which he addressed, we were both together; he asked if we were paying the Powerful that day; he was answered, yes, and asked what demand he had; Mr. Maddocks asked for his certificate, upon which he produced a piece of paper, which I never looked at.</p>

            , of the Powerful. I told Mr. Maddocks, he was not the man. I then addressed the man myself, and told him, this is the second time that you have come in this way, and we must now secure you; he sat down then, and said, he would stay till he got his money; I said, I would send for a constable; he stopped several hours; several gentlemen spoke to him about it; he said, he was not to be frightened out of his money; I asked him, who was the purser of the ship; he said, Mr. Burke; he was asked, if he would swear to it, and he said, he would take his oath, that Mr. Burke was the purser at the time of the capture; a great deal of that conversation passed, till near about six o'clock, when I went away, and then the prisoner followed me, and said, he would stick by me till he had got his money. When I had got upon Ludgate-hill, he was laying hold of me; I told him to be quiet; and then he cried out, robbers, and said, I had robbed him; a great number of people came round, and I asked if they knew any constable; several constables and patrols came up; I desired the constable to take charge of him, and he desired the constable to take charge of me, for that I had robbed him; the constable asked him, how I had robbed him; the prisoner said, I had forged his will and power while he was at sea, and done him out of his money.</p>
               <p>Q. You were both of you confined? - A. Yes, and kept till morning, when we were taken before the Magistrate; the Magistrate asked him, what he had to say against me; he said, nothing, and I was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. This happened before one of the Aldermen,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200059"></xptr>I believe? - A. Yes, Alderman Staines; but the charge against him being in Middlesex, he was sent to Hatton-garden, to the Police-office.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told the prisoner, when you were with Mr. Maddocks, that you had received the prize-money for the real William Harper by virtue of a power? - A. Yes; somewhere about the month of October last, the prisoner came to my apartments before, and demanded the money, saying he was the real man; I told him then, you cannot come to personate little Harper, if you do, I will send for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person of the real Harper belonging to the Powerful? - A. Yes; I dare say I have been with him a hundred times.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he at all like the William Harper who is now trying? - A. No; he is a very little man.(The prisoner was a remarkable tall stout man).</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You are positive this is not the right man? - A. I am very certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what this man said in the office at Hatton garden before Mr. Blamire? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Prisoner. Q. Who was in the office at the time I came in? - A. At the time he first came in I believe only Mr. Maddox and me; some other men or women might have been in, who came for money, I will not say positively.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Haydon.) Q.Will you tell us what the prisoner said when he was before the Magistrate, and what he did? - A.When the Magistrate questioned him whether he was the real man or not, he said, he was not, but was a relation of the real man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he produce any thing before the Magistrate? - A. The Magistrate asked him how he came to personate the man with that forged certificate; he said, he thought he should sooner get it that way than by a power of attorney that he had in his pocket from the real man; he had delivered up the power of attorney previously at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Q. That is executed by a mark? - A. Yes; I immediately said, it was a forgery, for the man can write extremely well; I have seen him write often, and have received letters from him; the Magistrate asked him how he came to lay hold of me in the street; and he said, he thought it would frighten me out of the money.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the 4th of January last, I was at Portsmouth, in company with a man of the name of John Smith; after about an hour's conversation, he told me that he had a will and power, and certificate, from a name-sake of mine, which he supposed was a relation of mine; and that he would give it to me, as I was going to London, to put it into execution, provided I would let him have a little money until such time as I received the contents of the will, and he was to allow me sufficient for my trouble; I took the power and certificate, and came to London about four days after; I went to Marsh and Creed's with the certificate and power, and they told me it was not payable till the last Thursday in the month; then I went to the White-lion, and I saw that old gentleman, and asked him if the prize-money for the Powerful was ready; he asked me what my name was; I told him I was a man that had a power to receive it for

            ; when I shewed him the certificate, he said, it was a forgery; I did not produce the power, because I thought I had better produce it before the Magistrate, or the Alderman; Mr. Haydon desired me to sit down, and gave me a glass of wine; when I took hold of Mr. Haydon, and charged him with forging the will, I did not know that mine was forged, nor I do not think it is now; I am as innocent as the child unborn; I have made a strict enquiry after this

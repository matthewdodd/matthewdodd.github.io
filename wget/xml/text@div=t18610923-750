                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Barnard Morris and Sons, Cigar manufacturers, Whitechapel—the prisoner has been employed by us for some years—in 1859, there was a difference made in the arrangement between us—we arranged to settle with him on each transaction as it arose—he was to take orders, and on collecting the money for those orders he was to be paid his commission upon them—he was to account to us imme<lb></lb>diately upon the receipt of the money for the whole of it, and then he received his commission from us on each transaction—he has not accounted to me for 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Mr. Moore; or for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mr. Burgess—he should account to me, or any member of the firm—that is my father, Mr. Barnard Morris, and my brother, William Morris, and myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The defendant is related to you, I believe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He is a first cousin—there was no special arrangement between us previous to 1859, except that was advanced him money upon the score of other business that he had done for us—he was in the habit of selling goods for us—we did not divide the profits, we paid him a commission, but with a view to a settle<lb></lb>ment at the end of the year—we paid him in advance before he collected the moneys, in anticipation of his doing so; and then, as the commission accrued, there was a debit and credit account—he did not live in the house—we called him a commission traveller—his duty was to go and collect orders of any one that he thought trustworthy; if he did not do so, the only result would he that he would have no commission—I do not know that since 1859 he was employed as a clerk to Godson and Ford, of Govent-garden—I never heard it before to-day—it may be so—I have since heard, that at the time he was taken into custody, he was carrying on business on his own account, but I did not know it at the time—it is impossible to tell without reference to the books the amount of the prisoner's trans<lb></lb>actions for us since 1859—the books are here—it would take a long time to go through them to ascertain that—we have not a separate account in the books as to his orders—we have a separate ledger—we have not any account in the ledger of the commission paid to him, because he was paid it on each transaction since 1859; and there has been nothing of the kind, because we wanted to simplify it, so that there should be no complexity about it—we have no entry since 1859, showing the amount of commission received by him—I cannot undertake to say that goods to the amount of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. have not been sold by him—I really have not the remotest idea whether it is 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the petty cash-book contain merely entries of petty cash? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; such entries as ink and postage stamps, and things of that sort; it was in that book we entered small transactions with the prisoner—of course we had no notion of anything of this sort, therefore we did not keep them—we do not destroy other books—one of our reasons for making the alteration after 1859 was, that there should be no account between us; but that the commission should be handed over at once—the ledger contains entries of the goods sent out to Mr. Moore and Mr. Burgess—we gave the bill to the prisoner to give to Mr. Moore—I cannot say whether I gave it him myself, but we always give the bill three months after the goods have been delivered—that account would have been given to him in February—there is no pretence for saying that we divided profits with the prisoner prior to 1859—we advanced him money in consequence of his necessities.</p>

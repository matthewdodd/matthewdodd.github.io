               <p>Q. Have you ever received the payment of that bill, or any sum of money to that amount? - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did ou afterwards go to Mr. Wright, and make enquiry of him? - A. No, I did not; I enquired of the prisoner respecting it, but he gave me no account of it; he left my service the morning I came home.</p>

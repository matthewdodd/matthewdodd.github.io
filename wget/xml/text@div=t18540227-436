I am a policeman, at Woolwich—the prisoner was given into my charge, and I took her back to the pawnbrokers shop—the pawnbroker said, "It is in her mouth"—I saw her mouth in motion, and some hard substance in it—I took her throat and looked in her mouth, and there I saw a half sovereign, and three or four other persons saw it besides me—I put my finger in her mouth, and she swallowed the half sovereign—I have no doubt about it; I am sure she swallowed it—I noticed that she bad</p>

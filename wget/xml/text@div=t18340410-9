            . I am a policeman. On the 16th of February, I heard a noise in Hoxton Town about 5 o'clock in the afternoon - I was in doors - I went out, Warren and the witness Slater were struggling together - I asked Slater what was the matter, - he said something about a robbery, and I took the boy into the school-room, which is called the chapel, and there Slater stated in his presence, that they had been robbed on two previous Sundays, that he had secreted himself in the singing gallery, and heard the window open, and two persons enter - that he afterwards heard the cupboards opened - he jumped down and took Warren, and Spencer escaped - I took Warren to the station-house, and on the way there, he said to me, "You are not going to fetch the two Spencers - they were with me, they live at the china shop in Hoxton Town" - after taking him to the station-house, I told him to come to the light of the gas, for I thought I knew him, and I recognised him as having seen him with the two Spencers on two previous Sundays, with money in their possession in a coffee-shop - Warren had said in the coffee-shop there, "Flare up! we won't have a penny egg, bring me a three-half-penny one" - and he admitted that before the magistrate - I went in search of the Spencers - I found them at their father's house - he is a very respectable man - I took them into custody - the youngest Spencer was admitted as evidence for the Crown, on account of his youth - all their parents are very respectable, and I do not think anybody could say a word against either of the boys previous to this transaction - their parents have lived at Hoxton for thirty years, and bore an excellent character in every respect.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SLATER re-examined. The window was shut before I heard it open, I am certain - I observed before that all the windows were fastened - the window under the gallery was fastened - when I got down, it was wide open - it fastens by a piece of wood falling - it is a sliding window, and when it is closed, the wood fastens it, and keeps the frame from sliding back - the window is nearly four feet from the ground - there is a railing before the window - it was opened by putting a hand through a pane of glass which was broken the week previous, and lifting up the latch inside - I am certain the window was latched with the wooden latch - I had examined the windows to see they were fast.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SLATER. I never heard anything amiss of Warren - it was far from the wish of the school to prosecute the children.</p>
               <p>JAMES CAULDWELL. Warren always conducted himself with the greatest propriety - he was the last boy I should have thought would have been guilty of such a crime - it was not our wish to prosecute; but Mr. Broughton compelled us, (after remanding them for a week,) much against our wish - I hoped he would have inflicted some punishment on them on the Monday morning.</p>

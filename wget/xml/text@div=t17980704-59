             sworn. - I live at No. 53, London-wall: On Monday, the 28th of May, I was robbed of the things contained in the indictment; I found it out in the manner I stated before; I gave the prisoner in charge of the officer, the corner of Bedlam; I got the information by means of the servant girl. I went, with the officer and the prisoner, to her lodgings, she the produced out of the drawers, the things mentioned in the indictment, part out of one room, and part out of another; she said, those were the things which she had of the girl; in consequence of that, she went to the Compter. The things have been lodged ever since in the possession of the officer. I have nothing further to say.(Mary Eldrid was called, but her husband said, she was so ill as not to be capable of attending).</p>

The next day, she brought me two little caps, and I gave her four-pence for them. I never knew where she lived till the day they took me to prison. I have got four children.</p>

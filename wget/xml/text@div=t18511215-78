Do you know a person named Roberts if—Yes.

Roberts.'</hi> Did you, in consequence of that letter, go anywhere at five o'clock?—Yes. Where?—By the Ben Jonson, at Stepney. What was the date?—The 31st of March. Was that the day you got this letter?—Yes. When you got there did you see Richard Roberts?—No. Did you see the prisoner while you were waiting?—Yes. Did he say anything?—Yes, he asked me if my name was not Harriet Newman, I said, 'Yes;' he asked me if I was not waiting there for Richard Roberts, I told him, 'Yes;' he told me if I came with him he would take me to Richard Roberts; I asked him what was the reason Richard Roberts did not come himself; be told me he was ashamed to come himself; I told him that he might well be ashamed to come himself; I followed him down by the <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> Jonson, and there he stopped. Yes?—He beckoned a <hi rend="italic">cab<lb></lb>man</hi> from the stand, took hold of my arm, and told me I must go with him;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185112150003"></xptr>
               <p>the cabman came up and took hold of my arm. Did Day take hold of your arm?—Yes, and the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi>, too. Did you object to that?—Yes, I screamed, and told him I would not go with him. Well?—Three men and one woman came up and asked the young man what they were going to do with me; he said it was nothing to do with them, I was his wife. Did they get you into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—Yes. Who?—Day and the cabman. What happened then, did the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stop, or drive on?—It drove on very fast. What became of Day?—He was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with me, and the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man was on his seat. After you had been in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> a little time, did Day do anything to you?—He held my hands while he put a handkerchief over my mouth. What hap<lb></lb>pened after that?—I do not remember anything more till I found myself on a sofa in a large house. Do you know where that house is?—No. Have you been able to find it?—No. When you came to your senses, did you see anybody? Yes, I saw a young woman sitting opposite. Do not tell us what she said, did she give you anything?—She asked me if I was any better; I said I did not know I was ill. Did she give you anything?—No. Did she afterwards?—An old lady came and gave me a glass of something; the young woman asked me if I knew where I was, I told her, 'No.' Did the young woman herself give you anything?—She gave me a knife. And at the time she made a communication to you?—Yes. After that, did you see an elderly woman?—Yes. What did that woman say to you?—She told me I must stop there all night; when she first came into the room, she came into the room with a glass in her hand, and she told me I must drink that, and then I should be better. Did you take any of it?—Yes. What was the effect; what happened to you?—I did not feel the effect of it directly. How soon?—Directly I drank it I made an attempt to come out, but the old woman stopped me. What else?—I held up the knife to defend myself. After you were stopped, what happened to you?—There were three gen<lb></lb>tlemen came running down-stairs when the old woman made a noise. Had you got the knife in your hand?—Yes, I was then in the hail. Did one of those men speak to you?—Two of them came up and spoke to me. What did they say?—They forced roe back again into the room. What did they say?—In the struggle I cut one of them over the hand with the knife. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COMMISSIONER GURNKY</hi>.

Did you get into the room again?—Yes, and the knife fell from my hand, and the old woman put me on the sofa again, and said I should not leave the house. What else happened?—They tried many times to get me up-stairs. Did you continue to resist?—Yes. Do you recollect a watch and chain?—Yes. What happened?—One of the gentlemen put it round my neck. What did you do with it?—I threw it on the ground. Did you, after that, see Day again? Yes. In which room?—(<hi rend="italic">inaudible</hi>). How came he into the room?—One of the gentlemen called him. Do you recollect how he called him?—No, I do not know. Did either <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the gentle<lb></lb>men order Day to do anything?—To go and bring a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>. In what condition were you as to your senses?—My senses seemed very much stupified. Were you in a condition to distinguish the features of anybody?—Yes. Were you in a condition <hi rend="italic">to</hi> distinguish the features of Day?—Yes. Did you go to the door?—No, Day came into the room and said if I was quiet he would take me to my father; I then left the house, and went into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> along with Day. Did Day say anything to you while you were in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>?—I asked him the reason why he took me there; he said it was only for a <hi rend="italic">spree</hi> with his <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi>. Did he say anything more?—Not till he got me into a very dark street, and the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was stopped, and Day got out and told me he would</p>

Yes?—He then left me. Well, what became of you?—I found the use of my limbs all leaving me, and I sat myself on the step of a door. Up to this time had you any notion what the time of the night was?—No. In what condition did you become afterwards?—I know nothing till I found myself in the hospital. In the house, just recollect what was said by either the men or the women?—The young woman told me, if I was a respectable woman she would advise me to go out of the house. What did the old woman tell you?—I must make myself happy there for the night, for f should be made a lady of. Did any of the men ask you to do anything?—Yes. Anything you felt improper to be done?—Yes. Where did you find yourself next morning?—In the hospital. When did you see the person you say drove you in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> again?—At a beer-shop, in Holywell-lane, on a Saturday night, the Saturday following. Where there a number of persons there?—Yes. Did you point him out as the person who had taken you in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>?—Yes. Did you give a description of the clothes which he wore?—Yes, corduroy-trowsers, and a black coat, and a black neck-handkerchief. Was he dressed in the same way when you saw him before the Magistrate?—No. The night you saw him in the beer-shop, was be dressed the same way?—No.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. How old are you?—Nineteen. Past nineteen?—I was nineteen on the 30th of March. Day was a perfect stranger to you?—Yes. Had he never seen you before?—Not that I know of. When the old woman gave you some<lb></lb>thing to drink was it like gin-and peppermint?—Yes. Did the three gentlemen hold your hands at all?—Yes. Did you throw tumblers at them?—Yes. And then they found it was no use, and they called Day to bring back the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>?—Yes. Now the letter you received, was it in the handwriting of Roberts?—No. Whose handwriting was it?—I do not know. Come, you know what has taken place; whose handwriting is it?—I do not know. Do you know Mrs. Woodfield?—Yes. How long?—A long time. Nearly all your life?—No, not so long as that. A good many years? I have not been at home long to know her. Now, tell me who wrote that letter?—I don't know, no more than baring it come to the house. Who wrote the letter?—I do not know. Was not that letter written by your direction, at your request?—No. Be careful; had you never seen that letter till it came by the post?—No. Did you ever <hi rend="italic">go</hi> to Day's friends to ask for money?—No. Be careful; did you never <hi rend="italic">go</hi> with Mrs. Woodfield to Day's friends to ask for money?—No, I showed her the house, and told her where Day lived. Was that when she went to get money?—I do not know what she went for. Did you ever live with your aunt?—Yes. Where?—At Brentford. How came you to leave her?—Through a fall out. What was the fall out about?—Because I fetched beef-steaks instead of mutton<lb></lb>chops. Do you mean to say that on your oath?—Yes. On your oath did not your aunt accuse you of stealing?—No. Be careful; did not your aunt send you away because you had robbed her?—No, sir, she did not. Do you ever go to see her now?—Yes. When?—I dare say it is about three months ago since I have seen her. How long is it since you lived with her?—A twelvemonth. Did you ever stay out three nights from home?—Never; I staid out one night, at my grandmother's. Did you ever attempt to drown yourself?—No, sir, I did not. Be careful; did not you stay out for three nights, and did not your father behave unkindly to you in conse<lb></lb>quence; and did not you attempt to drown yourself?—No, sir, I did not.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185112150005"></xptr>
               <p>Nothing of the sort?—No; the reason 1 fell out with my aunt was, that she hit me, and I left her. I thought you said it was because you brought beef-steaks instead of mutton-chops? <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COMMISSIONER GURNET</hi>. That was the fall out. <hi rend="italic">By</hi>

What did you go to your aunt's for about three months ago?—To see her. How long did you stay, a minute?—No, sir, I staid all day. Do you mean to say you have ever been allowed to go to your aunt's house since the time you left, having lived five years with her?—Yes. Was your aunt at home?—Yes, Now, did you say to Mrs. Woodfield, 'Don't <hi rend="italic">split</hi>, for God's sake, for I shall be a ruined young woman? '—I did not. Did Mrs. Woodfield ever write any letters for you?—No. Upon your oath, has not she several times written letters for you at vow request?—Never; I never spoke to the woman till she came to my father's house; all that I knew her by was telling fortunes. Did you call on Mrs. Woodfield and ask her to write some letters, one addressed to you, and another addressed to your father?—I did not. Did she ask you why yon wanted those letters written?—No. And did you answer, 'It is only a lark, Mrs. Woodfield, with Richard Roberts and a lot of us? '—No. And did you say, 'You must write it in a man's hand, for my young man's hand will be known, and spoil our <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>? '—No. And did she not write the letters, and did not you take them for the purpose of putting them into the post?—No. Did not a person open the door to you, and did not you say, I want to see Mrs. Woodfield, I want a letter written? '—No. Did Mrs. Woodfield come to you before the last examination of the prisoner and entreat you not to go up and appear?—No, sir, it was after the first examination; she said she had beard the case in the paper, and that father would want a little of her assistance; she came to father's house; mother told her she knew nothing about it; she said she could give him a <hi rend="italic">lift</hi>, one which would take him across the <hi rend="italic">herring-pond</hi>; mother said she knew nothing about it, it was in the solicitor's hands; and she told me she did not mind taking a false oath for any one for a shilling. Was not one letter written in blue ink, by Mrs. Woodfield, for you?—No. I ask you once more, did not you say to her, 'Don't <hi rend="italic">split</hi>, for God's sake, for I shall be a ruined young woman,' and did not she say, 'You don't mind ruining the young man? '—No, there was no such conversation between us; she wanted me to go to her house and have my planets told, and then I could find out the writing. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined by</hi>

How came you to go with her to Day's house?—By her persuasion; she asked me to go and take a walk with her, I said, 'No;' she said she wanted to see Mrs. Ellen, and I went, and then she asked me to show her the house. Was that all that passed between you?—She told me, going along, that she would help me over it, and she would give him a <hi rend="italic">lift</hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I remember, on the evening of 31st March, young Day coming to my place—I had a bill in my window stating I had a bed to let, and he came to inquire if I had one to let—it was about half-past 5 o'clock, as near as I can tell; it was past 5, but it had not gone 6—my house is in Charlotte-street, which runs out of Curtain-road—it is a very long way from the Ben Jonson at Stepney—I could not accommodate Day, as the young man who was sleeping in the bed was not going to leave that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a nurse at the Free Hospital, Gray's-inn-lane. I recollect, on the morning of 1st April, Harriet Newman being brought in—she was in a perfect state of stupor, and perfectly helpless—her limbs were perfectly useless—her gown was torn out of the gathers—I afterwards saw the gown at the trial; it was then torn—she was brought to me at 2 o'clock in the morning—Mr. Tindal Robson, the house-surgeon, was not called at the time; he was then very ill in bed—she recovered so as to be able to speak within an hour after she came in—I went to Mr. Robson, and he gave me orders what to do—I believe he is now in Wales—I do not know how long he has been there, but he has left the hospital three or four months—she gradually rallied and became more rational from the time she came in op to about 10 next morning—she was a great deal more rational then than when she came in, and that increased;. she became more conscious—I did not con<lb></lb>sider her rational an hour after she was brought in, although she could speak; she only asked for something to drink—it was not until 10 that she had any conversation with me—she then made a statement to the house-surgeon, Mr. Robson, in my presence—that was the first time she made any statement that was gf any particular notice, nothing—that I could make anything of—I was not before the Magistrate on the examination of William Day.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> She was examined by the surgeon in your presence, was she not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She was; I undressed her—there was blood upon her hand, or hands—I saw no mark of the blood having come from her<lb></lb>self—it was on the back of her hand—I could not say as to both hands, but I know it was on one, because I particularly remarked it—I did not observe any dirt with the blood—her hands were covered with blood and dirt—it might have been on both hands, but I know there was upon one—both hands were dirty, and I particularly noticed blood on the back of one—I do not remember seeing any appearance of her having been treated with violence when I undressed and examined her—I was examined here in May—there was no appearance of violence to her private parts; nothing of the sort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> She was brought into the hospital at 2 o'clock in the morning, was she? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; quite in a state of stupor—I consulted with the surgeon, and described her symptoms—he ordered me to undress her and put her to bed, and put a bottle of hot water to her feet, nothing else—he did not see her himself till 10 next morning—she gradually rallied up to that time—I went to his bedroom to let him know how she was every hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any smell of liquor, or of a drug of any kind, about her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a peculiar smell, but it was not the smell of spirituous liquors—I have no idea what it was the smell of; it was nothing like chloroform, I think—I have no reason to say that it was—chloroform was mentioned when she made her statement to the house-surgeon at 10 o'clock—she did not men<lb></lb>tion chloroform before that—she made some rambling statement before that, but nothing, as I said before, that I could make any sense out of till she said it to</p>

               <p>the surgeon—she said something about a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>; that was between the hours of 2 and 10—I cannot say exactly at what part of the time—no one was present with her but myself that I remember—she remained in the hospital five days—she was gradually recovering from the stupor—between 10 and 11 next day the house-surgeon gave her an emetic, and she was very sick—she com<lb></lb>plained of headache—she complained of headache before the emetic was given—the smell was something like peppermint—it was a peculiar smell, but I really could not take upon myself to say what smell it was—I have frequently seen chloroform administered—the length of time in which it takes effect is according to the strength it is given, according to what the patient will bear; sometimes the effects will last till the next day—it is sometimes necessary to repeat the application to continue the stupor if the patient does not take it well at first; if the patient does take it well, it will last, I should say, about half an hour, or an hour, or not quite so long—the stupor does not come on immediately on the application, sometimes in five minutes, sometimes in ten minutes; some will take it much quicker than others—I never saw an in<lb></lb>stance where chloroform was administered, and stupor came on in an hour or two afterwards—I have been in the hospital very nearly two years—she was in every appearance as a person would be were they in a state of intoxication, perfectly helpless and perfectly senseless—as I said before, she gradually recovered; and when she gradually recovered she complained of a severe headache—that is not an uncommon consequence, either with chloroform or drink—chloroform will leave the same effect, a sickness and headache-vomiting very frequently follows upon chloroform—she did not vomit until after she had had an emetic, but complained of great sickness—chloroform generally produces sickness without an emetic—there are medical drugs that would produce stupor; an overdose of laudanum would do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see what she brought up from her stomach after the emetic? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; there was nothing in it of any character whatever, not of drink, nothing that would enable me to say what it was—there was no smell of beer that I could detect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there still that peculiar smell you have talked of that you could not say what it was, but something like peppermint? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was; but I could not say what it was, nor I believe could the house-surgeon either, and he strictly examined it—I kept it until he came—I do not re<lb></lb>member what remark he made upon it—I think he said she might have been drinking; there was nothing in it, but she might have been drinking—it was something to that effect, I cannot tell the exact words—it was said in her presence—I am not able to give an opinion as to how long the smell of a drug would be perceptible in the contents of the stomach.</p>

She was also indicted a Second Time on the Coroner's Inquest for the same. Mrs. Dickson, her Mistress, deposed, That the Prisoner having a Day or two before, complain'd that she had hurt her Back by lifting a Washing-Tub, she gave her something and sent her to Bed: That in the Morning she said she was something better, but afterwards complain'd again; that she having laid down on a Bed, on which her Father, who was not well, wanted to lie down, she sent a Lad up to bid her come down: That the Boy came down and told her that Mrs. Steward, a Woman who liv'd in the House, desir'd her to come up immediately, for something was the Matter with the Prisoner. That thereupon she went up, and Mrs. Steward, and her self examining her, did think there had been a Miscarriage. That the Prisoner not owning any Child, she at last sent for some Neighbours, and a Midwife, and being search'd, the Midwife was of Opinion there had been a Child born. She gave no Account of it, but at last it was found under the Stairs in a Chamber-Pot. That the Jaw-Bone of it was broke; and the Side of the Check torn: That having wash'd it in warm Water, it bled at the Wound. That the Child had Hair and Nails, that it was very small and lean. Mrs. Steward confirm'd what the former Witnesses had deposed, adding, That the Occasion of her bidding the Boy bid his Mistress come, was, That he inquiring of her which was the Way to the Prisoner's Chamber, told her there was Blood on the Landing-Place of the Stairs, which she taking notice of, did suspect something more than ordinary. Another Evidence depos'd several Things before depos'd, relating to the Child when found, adding, That the Prisoner said she had done nothing to it, but turned it in the Chamber-Pot. The Midwife-deposed, it was her Opinion that the Child was at its full Time, and that it was born alive; and the rather, (which is usual) because it had a Stool after it came into the World. The Evidences generally were of Opinion, That the Jawbone of the Child might be broken, and the Wound received, by the Child's falling on or into the Chamber-Pot, and that they perceiv'd no other Marks of Violence upon it but those. The Mistress and several others gave the Prisoner the Character of a very silly Creature; that she was a half natural, and that her Mother was so before her; and the Prisoner's Aunt deposed, That the Prisoner herself was born without a Midwife, and the Prisoner's Mother, and, as it was said, Grandmother, in like Manner. The Prisoner in her Defence said, That she knock'd for Help as loud as she could, but no Body came to her, and that she did not murder the Child. The Prisoner's Case being evidently within the Statute for Bastard Children, the Jury found her <rs id="t17230116-38-verdict205" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>WILLIAM GRANT sworn. - I am a stone mason: On the 28th of January, about half past twelve, going past New-court, I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw the prisoner with a coal-scuttle in one hand, and a bundle in a silk handkerchief in the other, and the two women running after him; he was walking very fast up the court; I stopped him till the women came up, and Mrs. Swaine said it was her coal-scuttle; he said, he bought it at a shop in Fleet-lane; I asked him if he should know the shop again; he said, he did not; I then took him to the constable's, and he was secured.(Henry Beadle, the constable, produced the coalscuttle, which was deposed to by Mrs. Swaine).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I bought it in Fleet-lane; I told the lady so, as soon as she asked me; I walked with her to Fleet-lane, but there are so many shops alike in that line, that I could not tell which it was; I went up the passage to see if that was it, and the lady gave the alarm of shop thief, immediately; I had it openly in my hands, and I might have got away before, if I had had a mind.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character, and deposed, that when he had been drinking, he was in a state of derangement. <rs id="t18010218-24-verdict126" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Edward Maynard, of Bull-lane, near Barking. On Tuesday night, 4th Nov., I brought some goods from London in a cart—I took the cart into Mr. Maynard's barn, which adjoins his house, and left it there safe about 11 o'clock—it contained some Dutch cheeses and some spruce in a half gallon bottle—I locked the barn door, and left it—I was near the barn again about ten minutes past 12 o'clock that same night, and saw the prisoner about thirty yards from the barn—he was in the road, walking towards Mr. Maynard's premises—next morning I found the barn broken open—the staple had been forced out by a plough coulter, which was found there, and the padlock taken off—I missed eight Dutch cheeses and the bottle of spruce.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 285). On Wednesday morning, 5th Nov., about 4 o'clock, I went to Mr. Maynard's barn—I found the door had been broken open, the staple had been drawn and was lying on the ground with the padlock—it appeared to have been done with a plough coulter which belonged to Mr. Maynard—the barn comes quite close into the road, but it was the back door that was broken open; a person to get to that door must have gone into the field—I found some footmarks leading from the road into the field and to the barn door—I took the prisoner into custody about 7 o'clock that evening—I took off his shoes, and compared them with the footmarks in the field leading to the barn door, they corresponded exactly—the nails in the middle were very much worn, but those round the outside were per<lb></lb>fect—I first made an impression with the shoe by the side of the footmark, and then compared the shoe in the footmark, I did not perceive the least difference—I traced the footmarks to the barn, and then from the barn about 250 yards to a hedge, where some cheeses were afterwards found—Mrs. Hewitt showed me the place—I could not trace them farther, because the ground was too hard to receive any impression.</p>

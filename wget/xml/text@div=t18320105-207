            . I am a gentleman's servant. In October and November I was in the service of Mr. Wardsworth; I had only been in his service a few days - I was at his dwelling-house, No. 3, <placeName id="t18320105-207-crimeloc1148">Clifford-street, Bond-street</placeName>

On the 18th of November I heard a knock at the door; I had been in the dining-room about a quarter of an hour before them, locked the door, and put the key under the mat, close by the door - it was then I saw the silver spoons; a woman, who was housekeeper, was in the house with me; on hearing the knock I opened the door, and saw the prisoner and Willis, who rushed in as soon as I opened it - Willis said, "I want to see Mr. Wardsworth;" I said he was not at home - before that he turned the handle of the parlour door, which was locked, and then ran up to the drawing-room; I followed him - he looked over the rooms, to satisfy himself that Mr. Wardsworth was not there - he looked over different rooms; he was up stairs four or five minutes; I then followed him down stairs, and saw the dining-room door open; Willis could not have opened it, because he was with me - nobody could have opened it but the prisoner - I found the prisoner in the dining-room alone, taking down the curtains; I asked what he wanted - he said, "My name is

             - these are mine;" Pattempted to lock him into the room - he took down a wire blind, opened the window, and was going to give them to a person who was waiting in the street; I have not seen that person since -I did not lock the door, and he gave them out to the person at the front door - they were all taken away; the spoons were also gone - I am sure the spoons were in the room ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before; Willis said to the prisoner, "What, have you taken them? mind, I have no hand in this."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You had no previous acquaintance with the prosecutor? A. I had known him some little time before - I knew him when he was in the Marshalsea twelve months ago; I was not a creditor of his - I do not know the amount of the debt he was confined for - Clifford-street is a fashionable street; it is at the corner of Burlington-street; I was not acting as footman; I said I was his servant - I was out of livery; I was there about a week.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not a broker who takes possession for other people? A. I have been in possession once for the prosecutor; I have been in a house with a bill of sale - I was in this house afterwards with a bill of sale, in possession for a person named Cooper; I went into possession on the evening of the 18th - the deed was executed that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you having been servant to the prosecutor five days, on the fifth day take a bill of sale from Cooper to take your master's goods? A. I took a bill of sale - I was merely attending for Mr. Wardsworth while he got a little money advanced on the goods; I then became servant to Mr. Cooper - he is a wharfinger, and lives at Pickle Herring-wharf; I believe he has the bill of sale - the goods were all taken away; not under the bill of sale about a dozen men came in one day, and held me down while they took the goods away - I have been a brewer, and have very likely said that I was a broken down brewer; I was put in possession of the bill of sale about five or six o'clock, the same night the curtains were taken away, which was between eleven and twelve o'clock; my master had come home about five; I was put in possession - I had seen 
               <persName id="t18320105-207-person1828">Cooper</persName>
             that day; I have seen him and my master visit, perhaps five or six times, about a year and a half ago - I do not know where the woman remained while I and Willis went up stairs; I believe Willis is a bailiff, and had come to arrest my master - the prisoner had been to the house the day before I believe; the goods were taken in open day.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, be cautious, did you not say you were waiting in the house, and would not say you was in possession till more goods came in? A. No; nor that I would remain in the house as the prosecutor's servant, and not take possession till more goods came in, for it was not worth while - nor to that effect; I did not say I was waiting to take possession when more goods came in, nor any thing to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up stairs with the bailiff, was not the maid servant in the hall? A. No, I believe not - she is not here; I do not know where she is - I know I left her down stairs; there was no other servant in the house; I do not know Mr. Wilkinson, a pianoforte-maker - I recollect a person taking a pianoforte away; that might be a fortnight ago - no complaint was made against <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050104"></xptr>him, to my knowledge: the spoons which were taken were tea-spoons - I do not know where they were bought; I never heard master say he had a large quantity of plate coming home, with a crest on it; these had no crest - they were nearly new - I did not know Mr. Richards, the linen-draper; the bailiff did not say he had come to arrest master - he said he had a writ against him; the prisoner said he was Mr. Richards, and took away the curtains - I never went to Mr. Richards to claim the property back, nor did Mr. Wardsworth, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. The spoons were never claimed by any body, only the curtains - then the spoons, at all events, must have been stolen? A. Certainly; I went before the Magistrate after I had a true bill found against him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. A true bill could not be found till the Grand Jury sat - did you complain to any Magistrate? A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. The Sessions, if I remember, were on the 4th or 5th of December, at Clerknewell? A. It was at Westminster - my first appearance as an accuser was before the Grand Jury; I dare say that was about a fortnight after the goods were taken - I believe the prisoner was taken up the first day of the last Session; the prosecutor went to Mr. Clark's office, got a certificate of the indictment, and then went to the Magistrate - they took him that evening on the certificate, in Mr. Richard's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him before a Magistrate? A. No, he was taken to the Police-station, and then discharged; he was taken before Mr. Minshull about a fortnight or three weeks before Christmas - my master did not attend then to make a charge against him; I went there - I got there about half-past twelve o'clock; he was then liberated on bail - I went to inquire, and found him liberated; I did not go before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at this gentleman, (Mr. Harmer) - on your oath, do you mean to say you went at twelve or half-past twelve o'clock, and the prisoner was discharged? A. Half-past twelve o'clock; I went to inquire of Mr. Burchall - I went into the clerk's office, and inquired there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that Mr. Minshull, hearing the story from Mr. Richard's employer, took his own recognizance to appear? A. I do not know, nor do I know that he has surrendered voluntarily, nor that he has never been in Newgate - I believe it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him as he walked here today? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Do not you know this trial stood over from morning to morning here for the prisoner to surrender? A. I have heard it; I do not know it - I was here yesterday, but I do not know that he was not tried because he was not in custody; I have not seen him waiting about to surrender - master has not told me that he had not surrendered; I have not received any notice of his intention to surrender, neither last Session nor this - I do not know that he has been on bail ever since; I was told he was on bail.</p>
               <p>Q. During the five days you were there, a great many people came after your master? A. Yes, several people who came after bills for goods sold; very little came into the house while I was there - there were a few things, such as eatables and beer; no furniture, nor any thing of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you to swear that no person came to take away different articles? A. After that they did.</p>
               <p>Q. Alleging that they had been swindled out of them? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. An indictment was found against the prisoner? A. Yes; he was afterwards apprehended on a warrant, a fortnight or three weeks before Christmas.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know where he lived? A. Yes, because we had apprehended him - I do not know why he was not taken before; I merely went to identify him - I did not make any deposition; I told Mr. Wardsworth what had happened.</p>

             and Co. of Oxford-street, and purchased the goods named in this bill,(looking at it); I bought some crimson silk curtains - I believe I had six brass hooks of Mr. Richards; the bill amounts to 31l. 19s. 10d. - I had known Mr. Richards about twenty-eight years; he said nothing about the mode of payment - I called on him before I ordered them: he had a very large stock of goods, and was very desirous of selling me goods to furnish my house; he proposed to me to purchase not only these, but other goods - I received the goods named in the invoice, part on the 19th of October, and part on the 28th; I had some servants to make the silk up into window-curtains - part of them were put up in Clifford-street; I used about three dozen hooks - I believe about two dozen were taken away with the curtains - I had purchased part of the braiding of Mr. Richards; that was part of the braiding included in the bill - I also used on the curtains other braiding, and hooks, besides those supplied by him; I was in the house on the morning of the 18th of November, and left between nine and ten o'clock, leaving Aylett behind - I had a woman in the house; I breakfasted in the parlour - the curtains were all up then, and there were a dozen silver spoons, which I intended to take away with me, had I not been obliged to go out on important business, and I left them on a small sideboard; I returned about five o'clock - the curtains and spoons were gone; I was informed a person, describing himself as Richards, had been there - I spoke to my solicitor, and the Sessions were just on; I immediately went to find the bill, the Session being two or three days after; it was the Westminster Sessions - I had a good deal to attend to of importance: I know I went the first day of Westminster Sessions, and found the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do on finding the bill? A. I went to the Clerk of the Peace, in Carlisle-street, Soho, and I was to wait - I was referred to the Old Bailey; I applied here on the first day of the Session - Mr. Clark or his servant told me I must wait till the first day of the Session; I could not have a warrant till then, because the Jury must sit; I obtained the certificate, and got a Police-serjeant and his man that very evening, and took the party to identify him - I took him to the station-house in Marylebone-lane; there he was known to the party, and they discharged him - I was recommended to go to Scotland-yard against the Police; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050105"></xptr>went to Bow-street three or four weeks afterwards, and obtained a warrant, which was executed - I did not attend at Bow-street when he was taken on the warrant, because I did not know of it - I have not got any of my property back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you sure you should know the property again if you saw it? A. I do not know that I should - I did not put the stitching in it; I did not make them - I was in business last at Manchester at Waterloo-place, Southwark, No. 2; I was in business there from the time of the panic till about two years ago - I was there from 1824 to 1828; I do not recollect what month in 1828 - I had a docket struck against me there, which I superseded; I left Waterloo-place about two days before Christmas - I have done a little commission business since that, in buying and selling malt; I was a spirit-merchant at Manchester - I have not dealt with many persons in the malt line in London.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in any line? A. I have got so many things in Chancery, I have done no business except buying a trifling article or two - I have done nothing but the malt commission business since I came to London.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live first when you came to London? A. I stopped sometime at a public-house at Islington - I lived there three or four months; it is at the corner of Sun-street, about half a dozen doors from Finsbury-square - I got out of the coach at Islington, and stopped at the Green Man, opposite the Angel, about four days, and then came to lodge at this house; I do not recollect the sign - it is the corner of Sun-street and Crown-street; one end runs to Bishopsgate-street - I do not recollect the landlord's name: I paid him a week in advance for the lodging - I took no receipt, I had witnesses enough - I then took the remaining part of a lease from a person named Benjamin, in Union-court; I believe it was No. 13 - I was there about six months; it was No. 13 or 14, I do not know which - Mr. Stirtevant, the Common Councilman, was my landlord - I went from there to Stingo-lane, No. 8, and have lived there from that time to this, pretty well occasionally.</p>

               <p>Q. The inquiry is not where your family lived, but where you yourself lived? A. All my family lived in Union-court; I lived in Stingo-lane two or three months - my family did not live there; I staid in Stingo-lane two or three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to from Stingo-lane? A. I lived at Sydney-terrace, Sydney-square, No. 2; my family lived there at the same time - I went from there to No. 10, Sutton-street, close by; I stopped there six months - I stopped three months myself, and left my family there; I think I was in Sydney-terrace near six months - I was arrested in Sutton-street, and went to the Marshalsea; I was arrested for three or four sums on some bills - I do not know the amount together; they swore to sums and upwards - I defended the actions myself; I have had a verdict for the third - and the fourth I compromised, to prevent any difficulties.</p>
               <p>Q. After defending three actions, what was the sum you remained in prison for? A. Why, near 30l. - I remained there a few weeks for that sum; when one person arrested me, and went to trial - then they lodged a detainer; I was there about a month - I am married: I took two ladies to Mr. Richards - I was there four times, and think I took two; I am not quite positive: I did not take my wife there- it was after I got out of the Marshalsea; I did not tell Mr. Richards I had been in the Marshalsea - what occasion was there for that? he knew me when I had 1000l. in my pocket, and he had not 1s. - I did not promise to pay him ready money for the goods; I bought the spoons in question from Thomas Wilkinson, Piccadilly - here is the bill and receipt: they amount to 4l. 6s.; they were paid for before they were stolen - I never had an office in Somerset-house; I did not represent to Mr. Richards that I had an office in Somerset-house, nor a place, nor any employment there, nothing of the kind; I never said so to the prisoner, or to any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to him, when he came with 7l. worth of goods, which is the last portion, that you could not pay him till you got your money, but you would pay him when the quarter was up? A. No, nothing of the kind - if any body has said so, it is pure invention; these were the only spoons I had in the house, and the only ones I had bought - my wife was down at my brother's, in Hertfordshire, at the time; I have four children - two were in Clifford-street; one is concerned in a steam-packet, the other was now and then at Clifford-street - sometimes he was at Margate; I had looked at some other spoons, but not ordered them in, nor had I ordered any plate.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a bill of sale at the time Richards took your things - you were removing from Clifford-street? A. No, I was not, but I was pressed very much by Mr. Bailey, and had immediately to raise about 700l., and I had seventeen workmen there - I ordered some plate afterwards from Mr. Hamlet: whether he was to supply me depended on the price - I had looked at a considerable quantity of second-hand plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bespeak any plate of any body else - I am not talking of looking at it? A. I think I did, of Mr. Thomas, in Bond-street; I bespoke none of any other, to my knowledge, except to Mr. Wilkinson - I believe I ordered no more; I might go into a shop, but I believe not- I am sure I did not bespeak any other plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply for any - did you try to get any from any body else? A. No, I did not - I swear that; I do not know Mr. Oswald.</p>
               <p>Q. In Great Russell-street - now, I tell you he is in Court? A. Oh, I will tell you; I went to look at a tea-pot there, because I did expect a sum of money - I told him to put my initials on it, but I should not take it till I got the money, and begged him to take care of it till I did - I wanted nothing but the tea-pot, and did not want to get that, for I left word I should not have it; it was taken to my house to be seen, certainly - I believe I told Mr. Oswald I wished my wife to see it; she was not living in the house then, but she would be in town in a day or two; I did not tell him I wanted a large service of plate - I said if he had got any thing cheap, I should want some - I was furnishing a house, and laid out a great deal of money; I cannot say how many persons I bought goods of on credit - I will tell you why I could not pay my way; my landlord was ill, and kept me three months without a lease, that kept me out of about 300l., which I expected, and I expected to receive some money from Manchester - other tradesmen, whom I had bought goods of, took them out of my house; no one took them by force, to my knowledge.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050106"></xptr>Q. That you will swear? A. Yes; Mr. Bailey and Mr. Wilkinson did not indict either of them for robbery- Mr. Wilkinson never applied at all, to my knowledge, for payment for his pianoforte; he, Mr. Bailey, and all came together - there were twelve or fourteen of them and their men, but I was not there; I did not take any steps - Mr. Bailey sent in a bill for 400l.; the painoforte was about 70l. I sent to Mr. Bailey, about three weeks before, that I should give him the security of a gentleman in the Lord Chamberlain's-office - I owed Mr. Plasket, the wine-merchant, 30l., Mr. Goodey, a tailor, 16l., but he owes me a little, I had some child's clothes from Mr. Lock, another tailor; I owe Mr. Whiteley, an ironmonger of Holborn, 7l.; I offered Mr. Bailey security; I told him if he was not satisfied with a gentleman he was acquainted with not to serve me, not to send any thing, and when he sent me about 20l. worth I said, "Go to the Lord Chamberlain's-office, and ask your friend again;" then he sent them - I do not know whether he took the goods away; they are not in the house now -

             is the person in the Chamberlain's-office; he holds a berth there now: he gives his name on the card, and I believe he is there to-day; I do not know that he became security - I owe Mr. Foster, a linen-draper of Oxford-street, 8l. or 9l., and Mr. Blaket, of Regent-street, 8l. or 9l., Mr. Mortlock, a chinaman, of Regent-street, 40l. - I believe Mr. Williams, a silk-mercer, claims 4l.; I was to pay 160 guineas a year rent for the house in Clifford-street, besides taxes; I was to do all the repairs before I had the lease.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me the name of the attorney you went to after Mr. Richards robbed you? A. I mentioned it to Mr. Reynolds, of Clement-street, Kingsland-road, and to his clerk: I never saw Richard Miller, who is now a Policeman, letter C. No. 50 - I came out of the Marshalsea more than twelve months ago; I do not remember after that being in a public-house in Fleet-lane with

             and some women - I might be in Fleet lane; I remember a man, named Biggers, in Fleet-lane; I do not know a woman named Cann - I have heard of a woman named Jenkins; I was many times in Fleet-lane, next door to Biggers', at a public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you drinking in company with two women and a man there, Mrs. Jenkins being one of them? A. Very likely - I am sure I was; I have no doubt but I told a man there that I had been just discharged from the Marshalsea.</p>
               <p>Q. The man I allude to is Richard Miller - did you ever tell him you were acting with others in getting goods and selling them? A. Never - that I am sure of; (looking at Miller) I do not recollect him - I never recollect seeing him; I might be drinking with him at a public-house in Fleet-lane - I was not a gentleman then.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, did you never tell a man that you were employed acting with others in getting goods and selling them, and did you not propose to Miller to join you? A. No, I did not; if I did, I must be completely in liquor, and lost - I did not propose that Mrs. Cann's husband should give the references, and that I and Mrs. Jenkins should sell the goods; I swear that positively - nor that we should share the money; it is totally untrue - nothing to that effect passed; if you could bring half a dozen to swear it, I would still deny it - if true, I would admit it.</p>
               <p>Q. What took you to drink with a Policeman? A. If he came into the parlour to ask me a question, I do not know, he might take advantage and ask me a question, for some motive planned by other parties; it was Mrs. Rivett I took to Mr. Richards' - she is the wife of Mr. Rivett, who is in the Lord Chamberlain's office.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he in the Lord Chamberlain's office? is not be a trumpeter? A. Yes, he is, and I will tell you what he is - he attends before His Majesty at the coronation; and he collects the Peers' fees; he lives at No. 12, Belmont-terrace; I believe I took but one lady to Richards' - the other lady whom I believed that I took, lis

               <p>Q. Will you swear you never went with Mary Wright to other tradesmen's houses, disguised as a lady? A. I never did - I never took her to tradesmen's houses, nor any other woman; I have a board up to sell the house in Clifford-street; I am now living in Stingo-lane, if I please - I have an objection to tell where I sleep every night; I slept in Lisson-grove last night - I slept the night before at Mountford-place, Kennington, and I slept there on Sunday, Saturday and Friday, at No. 1; my son keeps the house - my address is in Clifford-street.</p>

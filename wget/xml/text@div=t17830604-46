               <p>The prisoner robbed me of 14 s. I was coming out of Piccadilly, betwixt twelve and one o'clock in the morning, the 19th of May, she asked me where I was going, I said to Crutched Fryars, she said, you will not get there to night, God bless your charity, give me a glass of gin; we went to a public house, and had two glasses of gin, and I paid for her; and I had all the silver in my hand; and put it into my right breeches pocket; as we came out, she said, she could get me a bed for one shilling, I said, I should be obliged her; she took me into a court, she said, will you have any more liquor, I said, I would give her six-pence, I put my hand into my pocket to give it her, and found I had only two six-pences left out of sixteen shillings, I said, she had got my money, she turned with a blast, and flung me back my six-pence; whilst I was stopping to pick it up, she ran off, and I followed her, and caught her, I charged the watch with her.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you sober? - I was midling; I counted my money when I paid for the gin, and I had just sixteen shillings, I am certain I put it in my pocket; I did not feel her get her hand into my pocket, I had no intercourse with her; they did not search her, because she was an old offender, and would not have any thing to do with her.</p>

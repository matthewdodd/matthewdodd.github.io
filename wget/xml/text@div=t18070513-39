I was sent for to the house of Mr. Mathews; there I found a girl that described herself to be a servant to Mrs. Lyon, she keeps an old iron shop; she told me that she received the duplicate from her mistress; she said the person was at her house that gave her the ticket. I went to her house, I asked Mrs. Lyon whether the woman that was there gave her the ticket; she said yes, and pointed to the prisoner Frame, who was sitting by her side. Frame told me she had got the duplicate of a woman who was waiting at a public house till she returned; I went with her to a public house in Ratcliffe Highway, and there I found the other prisoner Flynn; she brought Flynn out of the public house, and said she had given her the duplicate of the shawl; Flynn replied, lord, how could you say I gave you that duplicate.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any mark upon it. - A. I put a mark upon it after I received it from Mr. Matthews.</p>
               <p>Q. The question is whether that is the same shawl that you had in the shop. - A. I have no doubt it is mine, but I will not venture to swear it.</p>

On Monday, the 8th of February, we took these two notes, and on Tuesday, the 31st of February, I and my wife went to Edmonton, and on our return, about five in the afternoon, we found him drunk. Between eight and nine o'clock, some shoes were brought home for him. He said to the shoemaker, the hostler will pay for them. as he has got money of mine in hand. His name is Bagwell. I took no notice till next morning at six o'clock. I then rung the hostler's bell - he produced the two 1 l. notes to me. In consequence of what he said, I sent for a constable. I never paid him more than 5 s. at a time, and could not have paid him a 1 l. note. He came to live with me in January.</p>
               <p>HANNAH SKILLECORN. I am the wife of the last witness. On the 8th of February, I received those two 1 l. notes, and wrote the persons name on them, and laid them on the table to dry. I got up and turned round to serve a customer. I did not leave the bar, and in about a minute they were gone. My husband was in the bar, and went out; I thought he had taken them. I cannot say whether the prisoner was near me or not, it was about half-past seven o'clock.</p>

I asked him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120027"></xptr>where he got the two notes from. He said he received them from a man that came out of the country, and he had had them about three weeks. As I was taking him to the Compter, I said,</p>
               <p>"I suppose you can produce the man you received them of?" he said, it is no use telling any lies, I took them out of my master's bar. I produce them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to light the bar fire, and picked up a roll of paper.

In three weeks I gave them to the hostler, and made use of them.</p>

That a Fire breaking out on the Day aforesaid, the next Door his House, near Kensington Palace, a Bell was rung to call the Men together belonging to his Majestro Works; and among the rest, the Prisoner at the Bar was very officious in helping off with his Goods. After the Fire was extinguished he missed several Things, in particular, the Plate mentioned in the Indictment, which he cryed by the common Bell-man, but to no Purpose: After this he sent for the Prisoner at the Bar, and charged him with them, which he at first considently deny'd, but after some Hesitation, he confess'd he had the Silver Lamp, but nothing further.</p>

             depos'd. That by Mr. Joyns's Order he went with the Prisoner at the Bar to fetch the Lamp back again, and coming to the Prisoner's House, he got out of the Window, and lifting up a Tyle, took the Frame of the Lamp from under it; after this he went to his Bed, and brought the other part of the Lamp from off the Tester, from which Place this Deponent made him bring out the Silver Sauce-pan and Punch-ladle.</p>

On the 27th of February last, on a Friday, about five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner at the bar came into my house; he came to the bar and asked for a glass of gin, which was served him; on that he retired to the tap room; there happened to be but one person in the tap room beside himself, who was a working man having a pint of porter and some bread and cheese; the prisoner waited in the the tap room till the man was gone, and seeing me busy in the bar (the other man went out of the house, leaving the pint pot standing by the fire place, on the side of the fire, on the hob) he took my pot, concealed it and walked out of doors with it, the maid servant came out of the parlour at the instant, she seeing the man going out of the tap room, said, sir, have you taken the pint pot from the tap room? I said I have not; and she went to the door immediately, and caught the prisoner by the door, just as he was going off the step; the girl says to him, master, you have got a pint pot of my master's; he says, no such thing, how can you say so; I was directly close, and had hold of him; I said, my good man, it does not signify denying it, for I am positive you have it about you; and I took the man into the tap room, and sent for a constable to search him; I never quitted him; the constable came as soon as possible; in the mean while, before the constable came, the prisoner wanted to get from my hands, so as to get to a far box in the tap room; I would not quit him, and he twisted his hand, and drew the pot from under him, as though he drew it from his breeches, and put it down on the seat, before my face.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you see this? - I positively did; I had him by the collar all the while; after that he began to ask my pardon, and beg for mercy; and if I would let him go he would pay me for the pot any thing that I desired.</p>
               <p>Q. The constable has had the pot from that time to this? - I delivered it to the constable immediately. It has got my name and number on it.</p>
               <p>Q. There were no pots in the house but what belonged to you? - There was not a pot on the premises to my knowledge, but what belonged to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see any instrument called a cutting engine at his house - A. Yes; I went up in the top garret of his house where he resided; I saw him use<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310005"></xptr>the cutting engine for cutting out metal blanks for shillings and sixpences. I have seen him do that more than once or twice. On the 22d. of August, in the morning, I saw him using it in that way.</p>

            . Q. You went to Butt's house - A. I did. On Wednesday the 22d of August, we found him at home and Mrs. Walton; I took them up stairs in the garret, I there found this cutting engine with these pieces of metal laying by the side of it. All these plates of metal were laying on a box in the same room, this is one cutter of the size of a shilling, one part of the cutter goes to the bottom and the other at the top, and the metal plate goes between, and by the force of a screw it cuts out the blanks.</p>

This is the under part of the cutting engine, and this the top; the plate is put between, and by force of this large screw the blank is cut. Witness cut out a blank and it was handed to the Court.</p>
               <p>Armstrong. I found this counterfeit money in a drawer, under the cutter a considerable quantity of shillings, here is some more counterfeit shillings, and these are all sixpences.</p>

            . I produce a blank sixpence found under the cutter; and a quantity of money finished in another part of the house; it is in this paper there is a great many shillings and a great many sixpences, they were all found in the lower part of the house. I found this blank under the cutter, this one dropped to the floor; there was a box at the bottom to catch them. Butt gave the key of the drawer in which that quantity was found; here is a blank of a sixpence which was cut by me in the presence of the prisoners, by order of the magistrate; it exactly corresponds with the others. There was a quantity of sand paper, sissel, and other things found in the house; there was a lathe that works by the foot that is for the purpose of rounding the edges with a file after they are cut out by the engine.</p>
               <p>MR. NICOLL. Q. Would this instrument cut out blanks from gold and silver - A. Yes, and these are flatted bars.</p>
               <p>Vickrey. The one blank was found under the cutter, and the other in the room down stairs; the key of a drawer in the room down stairs he produced himself, and admitted that the whole house was in his possession.</p>

               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

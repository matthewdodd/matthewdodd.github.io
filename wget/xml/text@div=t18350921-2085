                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 83.) On the 14th of September, about one o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Trundley's-lane, and saw the prisoner sitting in a ditch with another one, or I think two—I listened to their conversation, and went up to them and asked what they were doing there—they said they lodged at Mr. Davies's, who lived close by—I said I thought it was not proper to sit there—I got into the ditch, and they rushed away from me—I found a quantity of lead in the ditch—I took the prisoner afterwards; his companion escaped—I returned to the ditch and found msome more lead—It was afterwards applied to a house belonging to Mr. Beck and fitted—It appeared recently cut from the side of a chimney—It correspond in quantity with what wsa lost—It supplied the deficiency and fitted the place—I did not lose sight of the prisoner.</p>

I found him holding the prisoner in a meadow, near Trundley's-lane—I went to the ditch and found one large piece of lead—I should think it weighed tewenty pounds—I saw several other pieces found—the prisoner told me it came from a house, and said there were three of them in company, and the other two had got away.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant R</hi> 15.) I observed the roof of a house in Trundley-lane, on Tuesday afternoon, the 15th—It was about fifty yards from the ditch the lead was found in—one piece of lead was on the house, fastened with holdfasts, and fits to what was found in the ditch—a great quantity was taken from the house—It is in the parish of St. Paul, Deptford, in Kent.</p>

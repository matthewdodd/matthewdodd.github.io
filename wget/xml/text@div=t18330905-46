No; I will take my oath I did not use any threat or promise; I did not say I would charge a policeman with him - I will swear I did not strike him at all, nor touch him.</p>

            . I am a clothes salesman, and live in Marylebone-lane; the prisoner came to my shop about three months ago, and purchased a pair of breeches, a waistcoat, a pair of gaiters, and a hat; I think they came to between twenty and thirty shillings; I showed him a coat at the same time, for which I asked him twenty-five shillings; he said he would not give that, but he would come in the afternoon and have it, if I would take £1 for it, and he came and had it for that; he came again some time afterwards, and bought a fustian jacket, two waistcoats, and a silver watch; he paid for them 2l. 10s.; he gave me a £5. note - I asked him who he had it of, he said I had no occasion to be afraid, that he lived with Colonel Dyson round the corner; he said he had just received his wages and he was going into the country; I sent to enquire, and he did live there; these are the clothes, some of them have my mark on them.</p>

             sworn. - I live in the same house with the last witness: On the 9th of November I heard somebody at Mrs. Stevens's door, I went down stairs, and found the prisoner in Mrs. Stevens's room; I asked her how she came there, and she said, the door was open; the work was tightened up then, as a man might shoot on it; I went up to my room, and came down again in about a quarter of an hour; I found the door bolted; I knocked, and said, Sally, are you there, is Mrs. Stevens come home; she undid the door, and said, she was not; I turned round, and saw the work slack down to the threddles; I said, O, my God, the work is all slack; she said, she knew nothing about it; I heard Mrs. Stevens coming up stairs in a very few minutes, and I stood in the entry.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you parted from the prisoner between that conversation and Mrs. Stevens coming up? - A. Yes; I went to look for her son, and left her in the room; when Mrs. Stevens came in, I said, for God's sake, come up, here has something happened to your work; then she came up, and examined her work; she had twelve handkerchiefs done all but a piece, and when she counted them in the loom, she had but ten all but a piece; then I left them.</p>

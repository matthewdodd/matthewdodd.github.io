When the chaise was taken away, Mrs. Pincott called stop thief; Mr. Pincott followed the man, and most cruelly used him, for which he was summoned before the Alderman. I returned home, and next day I observed a paper stuck up on the front of the defendant's house, with wafers, in a very conspicuous manner. On the 5th of September, I observed a paper stuck up as before, only in larger characters. (A paper shewn him.) This is the paper, and which was taken down by my order; I saw Mrs. Pincott, but not Pincott; his wife principally stood at the door while the paper was up. In consequence of the ill-usage the officer received from Pincott, we attended before the Magistrates. After the 5th of September, I observed a paper pasted within side the chaise-house, and after that it was chalked on a board, and exposed to public view, and attracted a crowd of people round the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are a green-grocer? - A. No, I keep a grocer's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. The defendant is a coach-maker? - A. He <rs id="t18031130-58-viclabel337" type="occupation">lets out chaises</rs>

               <p>Q. Don't you know the chaise you ordered to be taken away, was a chaise sent to be washed and repaired? - A. I do not know it of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know to whom it belonged? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen that chaise washed in the course of the day? - A. I had seen some washed.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a sort of bye-place, is it not - there is no thoroughfare for carriages? - A. There is a thoroughfare for foot-passengers, and a carriage way up to Albion-buildings, but no thoroughfare for carriages.</p>
               <p>Q. The street opposite Mr. Pincott's is rather extensive, is it not? - A. Yes, but a carriage could not pass without going round Mr. Pincott's chaises, sometimes five, six, or seven, of them.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of a chaise standing there one day, it was drawn away by your order? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not told the defendant you were going to take it away? - A. Not that day, but our vestry clerk had; and I went up myself, with some other trustees, a week or ten days before, with the act of parliament, to request Mr. Pincott would take the chaise away, or abide by the consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not do so on the day the chaise was taken? - A. I certainly did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen chaises washed there? - A. Yes, and I have seen them repairing chaises there, painting them, and doing the smith's work there.</p>
               <p>GEORGE GOODCHEAP sworn. - I am apprentice to the defendant and his brother-in-law; I lived in his house on the 5th of September last.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that paper, and say whose writing it is? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Mr. Pincott write? - A. Yes, I don't believe it is his hand-writing; I cannot tell whose it is; I saw a paper stuck up, but cannot speak to it; this is something like it, but I cannot say, as there were two; I believe this is one; I only read a paper, and did not take any particular notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who put it up? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the defendant at home when it was put up? - A. I don't know; he was at home at his meals.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him standing at the door while the paper was there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body reading the paper? - A. Yes, a few.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say there were only a few? - A. I was in and out all day; there might be five or six when I saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Mr. May? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he reside near you? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Senior? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Bishop, a tailor, and Dighton, a chandler? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear Pincott say any thing about the paper? - A. No, I am his apprentice, and work out; I am only in his presence at meal times.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you never heard him speak of that paper? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever hear any body else speak of it in his presence? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever ask him how it came to be put up? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were surprised to see it there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you see it there? - A. I cannot say; I saw it about ten or eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Were people looking at it when you went in and out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Pincott somebody had stuck a paper up? - A. No.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Greenwich, and am clerk to Mr. Thomas Wheatley, a coach builder and coach proprietor there. The prisoner has been in his service about two years—we took him as a poor man; his salary was 12<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week—it was his duty to pay in money, which I gave him from time to time, into the bank in Nelson-street, Greenwich—on 15th Aug. I was going to the bank, and I met him, and as I had occasion to go to London, I gave him 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in gold and silver—he was to take it to the bank, and a check, which was sealed up—I gave him the pass book—it was his duty, on paying in the money, to bring back the pass book—it was his duty to attend the next day—I did not see him again—I gave information to the police—the money was Mr. Wheatley's.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, R</hi> 38). On 16th Aug., I received information. I went to Mr. Collins's house, in Greenwich—I ascertained that the prisoner lived there—I had seen him go to that house; I live just opposite the street—I found some books, with his name in them—I found a "Bradshaw's Railway Guide," with the leaf turned down right upon the express train which leaves London for Dover and the Continent—in consequence of that, I went to Calais and Lille—I saw the prisoner there—I followed him to the Hotel de I'Europe—I went into the room, and said to him, "Good morning, Mr. Henin!"—I looked at him, and said, "I suppose you know me?"—he said, "No, I don't"—I said, "My name is Carpenter, a sergeant of police, of Greenwich; I suppose you know the object of my mission?"—he said, I suppose you are coming after me for Mr. Wheatley's money?"—I said, "I have; and I hope you have not spent much of it;" he said, "I have not more than 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "Where is the remainder?"—ha said, "I have it"—he unbuttoned his waistcoat and trowsers, and took from round his waist this belt, which contained a great deal of money, it was very heavy, and from his pocket he took this bag, which was also very heavy; it was full of French silver money—he gave me the key of his carpet bag, and told me the remainder was in there—he told me he had changed the 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Belgian notes, and there were 460 francs in Belgian notes in the bag—he said they bad charged him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the exchange—just at that period the French police appeared, and asked for his passport—I saw the passport, and there was the name of John Thompson, London, 11th Aug.; I saw it, and heard it read—I said to the police, "That is not his name, it is John Henin;" they said if that was the case, they must take him before the com<lb></lb>missary</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185309190095"></xptr>
               <p>—I said there was no need of that, he had given me the money, and was willing to go to England; but they insisted on it, and before the Magistrate they made me give up the money, and would not allow me to count it—I was going to open the carpet bag to look at the notes, and the Magistrate got up and took it from me, and locked it up in his cupboard, and he told me I must go to Paris and see the English ambassador, and get a letter of identity that I was an English officer, and then he would give me the prisoner and the money—I went to the English ambassador, got it, and the Magistrate said it was right, but he sent me to the Prefect, and he said he would not give me the prisoner nor the money—I came back, and found the prisoner on 13th Sept. in Westminster; I saw him coming, and stood on one side—when he came, I said, "What are you doing here? I thought you was in France;" he said, "No; I had my liberty on Friday or Saturday; they gave me my discharge, and gave me twenty francs"—I said, "Was that to pay your passage over?"—he said, "No, it was to pay some money that I had to pay; and I went to the minister of the English Church at Lille, and he gave me twelve francs"—when he was before the authorities in Lille, I charged him with having stolen 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a check for 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> When he came to me, he said, "Do you know me?" I said, "No;" he said, "My name is Carpenter;" he said he came for Mr. Wheatley's money; he said, "He won't prosecute you, if you give it up;" I gave him all up immediately, and gave him every information; he afterwards strengthened his depositions.</p>

               <p>BENJAMIN HERRING sworn. - I am clerk to Messrs. George Seddon the elder, Thomas Seddon, and George Seddon the younger; the prisoner was <rs id="t17990109-12-deflabel76" type="occupation">employed in the feather garret</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17990109-12-defend148 t17990109-12-deflabel76"></join>.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect the prisoner? - A. In consequence of a note being dropped in the feather-shop, which said upon it, "Sir, search Giles:" it was picked up by William Marchant, and we agreed to stop him when he left work at eight o'clock; I followed him out of the premises, and called him back; I then called Mr. Thomas Seddon, and he interrogated him whether he had at any time taken property from the premises, and he said he had not; he then asked him if he had any property about him at that time, upon which he said, he had not; Mr. Seddon then told me to feel in his pockets, which I did; I found in one pocket some wood, and in the other feathers, in the half of a pillow, they were delivered to the constable; he then went upon his knees, and said, it was the first time.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MARCHANT sworn. - I am clerk to Messrs. Seddons; I found a note at the accompting-house door, (producing it); I took it into the accompting-house, and gave it to one of the clerks.</p>
               <p>JAMES RIDGWAY sworn. - I am clerk to Messrs. Seddons; I received the note from the last witness; I consulted Mr. Seddon upon it, and, by my direction, he was stopped as he was going out; in short, he had got almost off the premises before we knew of it, for he went before the bell had done going, and I sent the first witness after him; I was present when he was searched, and the feathers taken from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear they are the prosecutor's feathers? - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>ANDREW ANDERSON Sworn. - I work for Messrs. Seddons; about two days before he was taken, I saw that the prisoner had a bundle, but I do not know what it contained, I wrote the note.</p>
               <p>RICHARD JONES sworn. - I work in the feather-garret for Messrs. Seddons; I saw a parcel of feathers in the prisoner's pocket as his coat hung up in the room, a day or two before he was taken; I told Anderson of it, and he said, it was sitting the master should know of it, and he wrote the note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I own the feathers were in my pocket, but I do not know how they came there; I believe it was a spite that

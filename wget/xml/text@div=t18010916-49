On the 4th of August, about seven o'clock in the morning, I lost upwards of forty pounds of beef from the block at my door; I was gone to market at the time; it is what we call the fore-rib. I found it at a butcher's shop in Windmill-street, and knew it again immediately; I helped to kill the bullock, and to cut it up the next morning; it was an ox that appeared to have been very much over-drove; I had the fellowpiece at home.</p>

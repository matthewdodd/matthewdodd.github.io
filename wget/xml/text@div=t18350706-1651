                  </hi>. My husband is steward of ship, and lives at No. 5, Catherine-street, Stepney—I have know the prisoner, Hatch, for eight years—he lodged at my house—on Monday, the 22nd of June, I heard him knock at the door, and come in doors—I heard him speak to his sister, and ask her what o'clock it was—she said it had just gone eleven—she was in bed—I had just gone to bed—I heard him go into the back parlour, to go to bed—he slept there—I heard him close the outside door after him—I heard him called up to his breakfast the next morning, by his sister, about nine o'clock, and I saw him and his sister sitting down at breakfast—I did not go into his bed-room that morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner Hatch's sister. On the 22nd of June, he came home a little after eleven o'clock—there was nothing out of the way in his appearance—I live in Catherine-street, which is about a mile from High-street, Shadwell—he came into my room and got a light, and went to his own bed-room—I saw him in bed next morning, between eight and nine o'clock—he got up, and breakfasted—he brought nothing home with him.</p>

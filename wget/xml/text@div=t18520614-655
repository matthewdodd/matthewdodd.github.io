                  </hi>. I am a candlemaker, of 5, Philip-street, Kingsland-road. The prisoner has been living with me four or five years—I have been away from her now about two months—on 8th June I was standing at the corner of Canal-road, Shoreditch, and saw the prisoner over at the oyster stall—after she had had some oysters, she came across to me, and began to abuse me—I tried to get away from her—she followed me, and came to a butcher's block, where I caught a glimpse of a knife, and made a run to get out of the way—I received a blow on the side of my head—I lost myself for a second or two, and then caught her, and held her till a policeman came—I was cut on the side of my head, through my hat—it hurt me much—it came with great force—I went to the station, and then to the doctor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a harness-maker, of Golden-lane. I was walking along the Kingsland-road; I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor at the butcher's shop—he appeared to be trying to get away from her, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> her back two or three times—she walked to the butcher's block, laid hold of a knife, and when he saw it he ran, and she threw it at him with all her force—it fell down, and he said, "You have stabbed me, and I will hold you till a policeman comes"—she said, "You b—r, I wish it had killed you"—I saw blood running down the side of his face—he had not used any violence, but he was trying to get away—she did not fall down at all.</p>

On 8th June, Smith was brought to me, with an incised wound on the right side of his head—the instrument had penetrated through his hat, which broke the force of the blow, and it did not penetrate very deep, but it must have been a blow with very considerable violence.</p>

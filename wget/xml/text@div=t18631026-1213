I live at 13, Pegwell-place, Hertford-road, Kingsland—I am cashier in the employment of Mr. Marshall, newsagent, late of 44, Ludgate-hill, now of 125, Fleet-street—the prisoner was a porter in the same employ—he was there about nine months—on Monday, 7th September, I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 3/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay for some newspapers at several offices, in the</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 255). About a month ago I received some information from Mr. Marshall respecting the prisoner, and about twenty minutes past 7 on 15th October I took him into custody, in Farring<lb></lb>don-street—I told him he must go to Fleet-street Station, on a charge of robbing his employers of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "I lost the money, but I could not run against anybody worse than you, as you know me so well"—I took him to the station—nothing was found on him but a duplicate of a waistcoat, pledged for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

Q.</hi> Did I attempt to elude you at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw you first, and then went round to meet you, and you popped round into a public-house—your mother was in there—I saw you coming out of the public-house and I took you in charge then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner read a written defence, stating that he had the money safe in a bag in his pocket when he left; that he went into a public-house with a young man he knew, and that after he came out, when he was about to pay for some papers at the publisher's, he found he had lost it; that he was afraid to go back to his master, and intended to go to sea, but altered his mind and came back, and then wrote a letter to his master, in which he offered to pay the money, by having</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">s. a week stopped from his wages. The letter being read, stated that the prisoner had lost the money; that he was innocent of stealing, and begged the prosecutor to take him back, and allow him to pay it off weekly.</hi>

                  </hi>. I live at Albert Street, Bromley, and am the wife of William Westbury, a shoe maker—on 24th April, about half-past five, I was passing a public-house in Arthur Street, and saw the prisoner with my son's finger in his mouth—I went up to him to take it out, and he <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> my finger into his mouth, and cracked the bone between his teeth—the blood gushed down his whiskers, and I fainted away.</p>

Q.</hi> Was I not fighting with your son? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not see you—I did not notice whether you were drunk, because I was so frightened—I have not been able to do anything since, and am in that state that I cannot bo left night or day.</p>

I examined the prosecutrix at the station—she had a compound fracture of the index finger of the right hand—there was a lacerated wound, which appeared caused by a bite—it is doing tolerably well now, but it will be some considerable time before it is quite well, and it will never be the same as before; the flesh is torn away from the bones.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a beershop, in Francis-road, Plum-stead-common. The prisoner came there last Tuesday three weeks, in the morning—he said he was a gentleman, and had a crossed check in his pocket—he asked me if I would allow him to have eatables and drinkables till the Friday, when he would change the check, and pay me my demands—I believed him, and let him have bread, meat, tea, ale, and lodging, from Tuesday till Friday; it amounted to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the Friday I asked him for the money; he said, "You need not doubt my word, here is the check," and showed it to me, but kept it in his hand—he said he was going to London to get it cashed—he said it was for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw enough of it to know it again; it was an old bill of exchange—I told him I doubted it—he said if I doubted it he would give me an I O U, but I did not like that any better, and went and asked advice of a Magistrate, who sent a constable to take him into custody.</p>

I took the prisoner on 7th Oct.—I told bin he was charged with obtaining things under false pretences, and he must come to the station with me—he said he did not care for that, as it was not the first time he had been before a Magistrate—I searched him at the station, and found this old bill of exchange, which is exhausted, and several papers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I am put on my trial without having any one to defend me, through the stopping of my letters by the governor of Newgate; I have had a very respectable position in life; I kept the City farm house, and have farmed twenty-one parishes of the City poor, from 1826 to the passing of the New Poor Law; I had Mrs. Akers, an excise officer's wife, to take charge of; she was a little bit deranged, and not so sharp as she should be; when persons came to my house they never left it till it pleased God to take them; I had three servants, who lived with me upwards of 100 yean, putting all their years together, and I have accumulated sufficient property to live independent, but unfortunately I was persuaded to go into the country by a doctor here, and his prescriptions; I went to Lancaster to take my native air, but nobody cared about me there; I had a brother-in-law at Plumstead, and I went down there; his house was very small, and I could not see my two nieces take the bed from the bedstead and lay on the ground for the accommodation of their old uncle, so I went and took a small place myself; my landlord lives at No. 2, Pinner's-hall, Broad-street; I had every wish to pay Mr. Day, honest, true, and faithful; his wife and he had a few words respecting his going to London with me to fetch my phaeton and horse; she said he should not go; he said he should; I said I was very sorry, Mr. Day should not go with me, and then he said to me, "You shall not go yourself;" I went to my brother-in-law's to get shaved, and Mr. Day placed five extra men round the house for fear I should run away; I have been committed to Maidstone for a week, but I was very well treated there, and when I came out I went before the Magistrate again; the under governor, Mr. Ellis, came and brought me some very nice steak, which cheered me up, and then I came here. Gentlemen, I put myself in your hands; it is for you to say if I have not had enough punishment by Mr. Day's <hi rend="italic">swagging</hi> my ale and <hi rend="italic">baccee</hi>; I have been summoned several times on the Grand and Petit Juries, both here and at Hicks's-hall, and if my Lord will postpone the case I will spend 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. rather than I would not beat such a <hi rend="italic">thing</hi> as that (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Day</hi>), though he is such a big lump; I have been deprived of a defence, even though those gentlemen (<hi rend="italic">the Counsel</hi>) actually sit here for the purpose; I can afford to pay Mr. Day or any other person to the tune of 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

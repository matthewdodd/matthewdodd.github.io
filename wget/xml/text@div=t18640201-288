                  </hi>. I am assistant to John Bressey, of Stratford, a pawn<lb></lb>broker—on Tuesday, the 29th December, the prisoner came and offered me this ring—he put it on the counter, and wanted five shillings on it—four shillings were offered, and he took the money—I did not weigh the ring, because I took it for a wedding-ring, and could see its weight would be about one pennyweight—I supposed it was gold, and any one might take it as such—he gave the name of John Blake, of Weston-street, Stratford—Mr. Lewis came to me a short time after he left the shop—I then examined the ring very closely, and found that, it had the silver hall-mark, and the lion was fractured, and looked like "22"—I afterwards saw the prisoner coming through the town, and I asked him, "What do you mean by offering me a silver ring in pledge for a wedding-ring, defrauding me of four shillings?" and I gave him into custody.</p>

I am assistant to my father, who in a pawnbroker at Stratford—his shop is ton minutes' walk from that of the last witness—on 29th December, the prisoner came into our shop about 5 o'clock, and offered a wedding-ring—he put the ring into my hands, and said, "I want five shillings on this ring"—he said nothing about "wedding" ring—I offered him four shillings—he said, "I will take it"—I was making out the ticket, and made the remark, "The ring is bent"—he replied, "wedding-rings will bend by wear"—I gave him a duplicate—he gave the name of Tran<lb></lb>mer, of Prince's-square—my attention was afterwards called to the ring—I found it was silver, worth about fourpence or sixpence.</p>

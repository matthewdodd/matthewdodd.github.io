               <p>Court. Q.Was it light or dark when you were alarmed? - A. I was rather frightened at the time, and I brought a candle down with me, but when I went to the watch-house, I found it sufficiently light to walk along; there was light enough to distinguish the features of a person's face; I probably was the last of the family up, excepting the prisoner; I cannot say whether my house was fastened over-night, but probably it was.</p>
               <p>Q.Was any part of your house injured, or broke open? - A. Not that I saw, the patrole was in the entry at the time.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the value of those shoes? - A. I value the women's shoes at seven shillings, and the men's shoes at three shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I observe your name is Thomas-Bassett-Reid - have you any partner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.You say, that probably, the house was secured, but you don't mean to say that? - A. No.(

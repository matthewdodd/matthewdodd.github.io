                  </hi>. I am an attorney's clerk, and reside at 1, Wine Office-court, Fleet-street. On Wednesday morning, 30th June, between 3 and 4 o'clock, I was near the Black friars-road—I was under the influence of liquor, but knew perfectly what I was about—I was accosted by two females—some little conversation passed, and drink was proposed—I told them that the first house we came to that was open I would treat them, as I was merely taking a walk to refresh myself, and did not intend to go to bed so early in the morn<lb></lb>ing; I thought it would injure me, as I had to attend to business at 9—we pro<lb></lb>ceeded over Blackfriars-bridge, and on the east side of Blackfriars-road there were seven or eight men, and, I believe, a woman, together—I made way for them, and Michael Ryan, who was one of the number, made a sudden rush at me with his head into my privates, which staggered me, and hurt me very much—I got into the road, and called out," Policeman!" as loud as I could, and at this time he seized me by my waistcoat pocket, which contained a purse with two sovereigns and a half, and in the act of taking it away he tore the waistcoat pocket down—the women who were with me also called "Police 1"—a policeman instantly came to my assistance, and I gave Michael Ryan into his custody—I have no recollection of John Ryan having done anything to me; one of the other parties struck me a violent blow on the right arm, but it was not him; he was there, but did not do anything—I gave Michael into custody, the others went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a married woman; my husband is a carriage lamp maker—I reside at 8, Cross-lane, Holborn. On Wednesday morning, 30th June, between 3 and 4 o'clock, I was with Mrs. Gorman, in Blackfriars-road—we met Mr. Whelan—Mrs. Gorman had been having a few friends, and we did not feel inclined to go to bed, so we took a walk over the bridge—we had had a little drop of drink—we said to Mr. Whelan, "Will you stand anything to drink?"—he said provided we could find a house open he would—I had never seen him before—as we were going along we met six or seven men and a woman, and the prisoner, Michael Ryan, <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> his head against Mr. Whelan, and took the purse out of his pocket—I saw that, and some woman rushed upon me and knocked me down in the kennel, and I saw no more—I saw no one but Michael Ryan do anything—Mrs. Gorman hallooed out, "Police!"</p>

Q.</hi> What were you doing there at 4 o'clock in the morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We took a walk over the water for a bit of air—I live at 8, Cross-lane, Newgate-street, Holborn—I did live in Plumptre-street; I gave that address—I did not want any one to know where I lived, because I owed a trifle of a debt to a tallyman, and had not the means of paying it—I gave my right address to the Magistrate—I never told any one that I had given a wrong address, because I did not want to be found out—I will not swear I have never said so—I do not go out with Mrs. Gorman every night—I was out with her not long before—it was quite light when this happened—I am surfeit was Michael Ryan who struck the blow—when I first saw the prisoners together they looked so much alike that I could not identify one from the other, but the man that struck the blow was taken into custody at the time—he never escaped; he could not have got out of the way while I was on the ground—Mr. Whelan, I think, held him—it was after we hallooed "Police!" that the woman came and struck me for giving him in charge—we hallooed "Police!" when Mr. Whelan was struck—Michael Ryan was in custody at the time the woman assaulted me—I had seen the whole transaction up to that time—I saw no struggle or fight between the prosecutor and Michael Ryan—I only saw the blow given when he rushed against him, and he made a grasp at his pocket and took the purse out—I saw the purse in his hand; I did not see what became of it—it was a red one—I could not see whether it had anything in it.</p>

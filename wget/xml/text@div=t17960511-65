             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Jones; these men were employed to take the dust out from under our forges, and in filling one basket about three parts full of dust, I happened to turn my head, as I was blowing the fire, and I saw these shoes lying in the basket upon the dust, there were twenty-five of them; I said to one of them, my brave fellow, you will take them out again; he made me no answer; I repeated those words again to him, and he made no answer, but clapped a shovel of dust upon them, it was Williams; the other man, Dawson, brought another empty basket in, and then he helped Williams up with it, and he put it into the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they persist in taking these horse-shoes though you spoke to them? - A. They did; they shot them into the cart, and I got upon the wheel of the cart and took them out, and chucked them to the ground.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether Dawson saw them or not? - A. I don't think he did; because the dust was over them when he came in.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BROWN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Jones; I was informed the prisoners had been taking the dust, and I saw Partridge throw about half the shoes out of the cart; and this shoe, (producing it), is a shoe that came off a mare belonging to Mr. Knowles, a distiller; the mare was in the shop at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe them all to be your master's shoes? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Williams. Q. Did you see me put any of them in the basket? - A. No; I was not in the shop at that time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner William's defence. I went to take the dust out; and I filled out of seven or eight holes in the different shops, I never saw any thing of the shoes;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110124"></xptr>they might be among the dust, or they might not, I never saw them.</p>
               <p>Dawson's defence. I went to have a share of a pint of beer with a friend, who is in Court, when I came back, I went in for the last basket of dust; I did not know any thing at all about it.(The prisoner Dawson called two witnesses, who gave him a good character).(The prisoner Williams was recommended to mercy by the prosecutor, on the ground of his having a wife and two children).</p>

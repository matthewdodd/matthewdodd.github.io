            . I am constable of Aldgate. On Saturday afternoon, the 7th of July, about half-past four o'clock, I saw the prisoner at the corner of St. Martin's-le-grand, with a person who I knew. I saw him try a gentleman's pocket there, but he took nothing. I informed the gentleman - he walked with me to the end of Newgate-street. I saw him try upwards of twenty persons' pockets - the other man was still with him, holding an umbrella over his head to cover him. They turned over to St. Sepulchre's church to the bottom of Skinner-street, and both went under the gateway of the George inn, and stood there some minutes. A gentleman's servant, in a blue livery great coat, went by - they instantly followed him, and opposite Ely-place the prisoner stepped forward, opened the pocket, returned to his companion, and followed the servant to <placeName id="t18210718-21-crimeloc118">Furnival's-inn</placeName>

The prisoner then stopped again, put his left hand into the pocket, and took out his handkerchief, put it into his left hand breeches pocket, and ran down Holborn as hard as he could. I crossed and stopped him, and took it out of his pocket. I saw him put it in. I do not know who the person was.</p>

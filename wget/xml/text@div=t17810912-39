She put out the candle. I got another candle, and lighted it by the candle that stood at the other press, which was not put out. The dies were fixed upon two large presses; one in the first cellar, the other in the cellar on the left-hand. There was a cutting-out press in the other cellar: there were great quantities of halfpence, and many of them were warm, which I verily believe were struck but two minutes before I came down: they were of two different dies, both the year 1775, one fresher than the other. There was a cecil, blanks, and copper, by the cutting press. I do not know that I saw

The reason of seizing her was, there were some counterfeit halfpence taken out of her pocket by Senhouse. The pieces produced are in three states; some are the blanks, some have the impression on them, and the others appear to have been shook in a bag, to rub off the roughness. Lees came out of the cellar, and slipped under my arm. The presses were very large, and calculated for men to work; but the women may be useful, to put the blanks between the dies. These presses could not be worked with a less number of people than were in the cellar.</p>

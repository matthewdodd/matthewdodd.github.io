                  </hi>. I am single—I lodged at 29, Henrietta-street, Vinegar-ground, about five months, with the prisoner—we were very good friends up to 9th April—I went out that day, and when I came home I found her lying on the bed—I went out again, returned in about five minutes, and found her sitting on a chair, not quite sober—she shut the door, and said she wanted some money of me—I owed her a trifle—I had paid her some of it—I said she wanted to go drinking with it—she got up, got me to the fireplace by my hair, and cut my head open with a poker—she gave me a second blow, and I became insensible—about three o'clock next morning I came to myself in the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter. On 9th April I was at a friend's house, opposite to 29, Henrietta-street, and heard cries there—they had opened the window—a female there begged me to jump in—I did so, and saw Brown lying on the bed—Jones had hold of her by the wrist, and had a poker in her hand—Brown's head was bleeding—I parted them, and took this poker away(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Brown was insensible—I put her into a cart, and took her to the hospital—the prisoner was not sober.</p>

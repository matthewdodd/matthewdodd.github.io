On Sunday evening, the 15th of December, a little before eight o'clock, I went down stairs for some water, and observed the street-door wide open - I immediately shut it. I came up in two or three minutes, and found it wide open again, (I have several lodgers) I shut it again, and desired my wife to take a candle, and go up stairs, which she did, and called out, that there was a strange man on the stairs. I went up, and found the prisoner on the first-floor stair case, and asked who he came for; he said he came for one Johnson, a gentleman's servant. No such person ever lived in my house. I asked who sent him; he said he came from a coach-maker in Long Acre. I said. I knew every coach-maker there, he could not tell whom it was. I sent for a constable, and went up stairs with him. We found the attic-floor room broken open, the lock was forced open, and the padlock broken off besides. The constable searched him, and found two keys in his pocket, and I saw four more keys found on the staircase between the attic and where I seized him; it had been dark a long time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you present when the keys were found. - A. Yes. Donahoe, who was bound over, is not here; he found them on the stairs. I did not see him pick them up, his father lodges on my second floor - he visits there. I understand he is a carpenter. I do not know him to be a bad character.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I went up stairs when he found the door open, I took a candle - it was dark. I met the prisoner on the third flight of stairs, he had got on the first stair from the garret passage, coming down - he had no light. I asked him who he wanted, he said one Mr. Johnson - I said, we had no such name in our house. I went down stairs, he followed me down two stories. I called to my husband, who came up and secured him. I heard my husband shut the door the first time. I heard nobody come in between that and when he shut it again. I asked Donahoe to go up stairs, and see if the garret was safe; he was on the second floor looking over the bannisters; he went up, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150018"></xptr>came down and informed me the garret was broken open; he brought four keys down - my husband did not go up then; there were beds and boxes in the garret, but nothing disturbed. I afterwards went up myself, the padlock was broken off, and the other lock forced open. I had been up about six o'clock that evening, it was dark then the asp and staple were safe. I locked the door, and brought the keys down with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were there not marks of violence on the padlock. - A. Yes, on the staple. I never knew Donahoe to have any tools in the house. He offered me no violence, nor tried to pass me.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took charge of the prisoner, about eight o'clock. I searched him, and found two keys on him; four more were produced, one of them unlocked the padlock. Donahoe said in his presence, that he found them on the stairs where the prisoner stood. I went up and found the padlock laying on the floor, and the asp wrenched.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you find any thing in my possession that would have done the violence to the asp - A. No. I know nothing of Donahoe.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the Saturday evening, previous to this Sunday, I was in conversation at a public-house in the neighbourhood, with a man who I had seen there occasionally; he asked if I was in work, and said he could put a crown in my pocket; that an acquaintance of his was in debt, and wanted to leave his lodgings, but could not carry his box away as he had a bad arm. I asked why he did not do it, he said it was too heavy for one. I said I did not object, and met him accordingly at Moses door, which was wide open; he told me to go in and wait till a person came down stairs. I went into the passage, and in two minutes a young man came down, and gave me two keys, saying,</p>
               <p>"These are the keys of the box, and another one; wait till you hear the room door open, then come up, and take the box out; it stands on the right hand." I heard him shut a door, which appeared to be the second floor, I then went up, and at the top heard somebody coming, I stopped, and Mrs. Moses came up, asked what I wanted, and called out. Finding myself charged with a robbery, I instantly made the best excuse I could, and asked for a person I knew nothing of. I followed her down, and on the second floor her husband came up. Donahoe came out; they gave him a light, to go up to the rooms; he came down, and said the door was open, and Moses produced four keys, which he said Donahoe had picked up - these keys correspond with each other. I relied on the appearance of Donahoe, to have made out a complete conspiracy between him, another man, and the officer. The prosecutor's persuasion, or his own conscience has kept him away.</p>

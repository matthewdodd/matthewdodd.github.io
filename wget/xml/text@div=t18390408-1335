                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the house of Vandercomb and Co., attorneys. I live in a house belonging to Messrs. John Calvert and others, in New Gravel-lane, Shadwell—there is an arch-way on which the side of the house abuts, which is called the boarded entry—there is a shop, then a staircase, then a back room, and then a long room covered with tiles, with a sky-light, which is covered at top and bottom with lead.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 51.) I was on duty in New Gravel-lane on the night of the 29tb of March—I know these premises, and the archway or passage—as I was going along near the boarded entry I heard a bit of a scuffle—I heard a conversation between two persons—I heard some one say, "Go it, <hi rend="italic">Joey</hi>" three times, and at the bottom of the boarded entry I saw the prisoner Davis standing with his back against the wall, on the other side of the boarded entry to where the long room is—I knew Davis well—I went down the entry—Davis did not say any thing, but hemmed twice, and then walked away—I permitted him to go up the entry, which would lead him to New Gravel-lane—I then walked up the entry and saw a piece of lead lying flat against the wall where Davis had been standing—I put my foot on it—I then looked up at a shoot which comes down between the roofs of the two houses—I saw it was bent, and saw the prisoner Mahoney on the top of the building, as if he were about to jump down, but he saw me, turned round and made his escape on the other side, over the roofs of the houses into the other court</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183904080156"></xptr>
               <p>—I sprung my rattle, and ran out of the entry towards New Gravel-lane expecting to see my brother officer—I then thought Mahoney would re<lb></lb>turn, and went up the entry again, but he was not there—both the pri<lb></lb>soners escaped—I went on the Wednesday following with Pavit to the premises with the lead—I found some lead had been taken from the bot<lb></lb>tom of the sky-light on the roof of the long room—I applied the lead which I had picked up in the entry to the place, and it fitted exactly—there were fifteen nail-holes on the lead I picked up—I found some nails in the sky-light, with which the holes in the lead exactly corresponded.</p>

                  </hi>., Q. C., <hi rend="italic">in support of the plea, contended that the wounding with intent to murder, charged in the first Count of the former indictment, and of which the prisoner was acquitted, was in effect the same accusation as the present. It was not disputed that it arose out of the same transaction and from the same wounding. It was clearly laid dawn in Chitty's Treatise on the Criminal Law, p.</hi> 455, <hi rend="italic">that it was not in all cases necessary that the two charges should be precisely the same in degree; it was sufficient that an acquittal of one would show that the defendant could not be guilty of the other. The present case fell within that principle; the wounding was the Same, the penalty was the same, death in either case. The mere fact of the death of the party wounded did not affect the question; for, although not the ordinary course, there was no reason why, if the death had occurred at the time, the prisoner should not have been tried for the very offence of wounding with intent to murder, of which he had been acquitted; nor would it have been any answer to such a proceeding to say that, because the man was dead, therefore the prisoner could not be tried on such a charge. It was analogous to the case of a party acquitted of a common assault, which he might plead in bar to any future indictment for a felonious assault, there being but one assault, and the felonious intention and the transaction being identical with the assault of which there had been a previous acquittal. As an authority for this proposition, see the Crown v. Robinson</hi>, 5 <hi rend="italic">Deas and Anderson's Reports</hi>, 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">also</hi> 5 <hi rend="italic">Law Chronicle, Regina v. Walker, 2 Moody and Robinson</hi>, 446. <hi rend="italic">upon these and other authorities</hi> (<hi rend="italic">to be referred to</hi>), <hi rend="italic">he contended that this case came within that principle of the law which declared that no man's life should be placed in jeopardy twice for the same offence.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M'MAHON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">apprehended that the Court would consider the case upon the record only, abstractedly of the facts. The plea stated that the prisoner was, upon a former occasion, indicted for cutting and wounding, with intent to murder, and that he was acquitted of that offence; the plea did not allude to any second Count, nor did the Crown reply that Count; he was therefore clearly acquitted of the wounding which caused the death, and the Court could take no notice of the grounds, of that acquittal; the acquittal was of the whole offence, of everything essential to be proved against him; for if it had been possible, on the facts, to convict of an unlawful wounding, the Statute enabled the Jury so to do. As to the general rule, that a party cannot be tried twice for the same offence, the learned Counsel referred to Blackstone</hi>, 2 <hi rend="italic">Hale's Pleas, ch.</hi> 35 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 36; 4<hi rend="italic">th Cooke, p.</hi> 40, (<hi rend="italic">Darley's case</hi>), <hi rend="italic">Hudson and Lee; Yaux's case, Holcroft's case Sparrow's case</hi>; 5 <hi rend="italic">Cooke, p.</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">As to case of pardon, he referred to Hale's Pleas</hi>, 426; <hi rend="italic">Plowden</hi>, 401, (<hi rend="italic">Cole's case</hi>); <hi rend="italic">Cooper v the Hundred of Basingstoke</hi>; 7 <hi rend="italic">Modern Reports; also</hi>, 2 <hi rend="italic">Salkeld</hi>, 614; <hi rend="italic">Holt's Reports</hi>, 638; <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">nd Raymond</hi>, 826, <hi rend="italic">Hales and Pettit; Plowden</hi>, 262; <hi rend="italic">Cole's case, Nicol's case; Foster's Reports</hi>, 64; <hi rend="italic">and Rex v. Jenning, Russell and Ryan</hi>, 388. <hi rend="italic">From these cases he urged that, if the Crown, instead of prematurely proceeding to trial before the death, had granted a general pardon of all felonies and offences, it was quite clear that the prisoner could not have been afterwards tried for the murder, and the case was exactly the same upon pardon, punish<lb></lb>ment, or acquittal. The case of Rex v. Vandercourt and Abbott</hi>, 2 <hi rend="italic">East</hi>, 519, <hi rend="italic">and Leech's Crown Law</hi>, 316, <hi rend="italic">was very much in point; to an indictment for burglary, with intent to steal, was pleaded a former acquittal of burglary and stealing; but as, upon the first indictment, there was no proof of stealing it was held to be no bar to the second. This established the principle that unless the first indictment were such as the prisoner might have been convicted upon by proof of the facts contained in the second, an acquittal on the first indictment could be no bar to the second; and this principle was a very striking test to apply to the present case. He therefore submitted, as well upon the general principle as upon the authorities referred to, that, first, upon the ground of the pleadings, the prisoner had substantially been acquitted of this offence; and, secondly, if the pleadings were to be amended, and the Crown permitted to reply the conviction on the second Count, that, then the prisoner would be punished twice for the same offence.</hi>

                  </hi>. "<hi rend="italic">I believe we are all of opinion that this is not a good plea. The prisoner is, on the present occasion, indicted for murder, and murder may be committed without any intent to kill. If a man intends to maim, and causes death, and it can be made out most distinctly that he did not mean to kill, yet if he does those acts and use those means for the purpose of accomplishing that limited object, and they are calculated to produce death and death ensues, by the law of England that is murder, although the man did not mean to kill. On the former occasion the prisoner was charged with wounding, with intent to kill. The Jury found that he did not intend to kill, and there the intention was of the essence of the crime; that is not so on the present occasion; it is not necessary here to prove any intention to kill; it is only necessary to prove an intention to inflict an injury that might be dangerous to life, and that it resulted in death; that is quite sufficient to sustain the present charge. Try this by the very test which Mr. M'Mahon has presented to us; he says that it is no bar to the second indictment that a</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">party has been acquitted on the first, unless the facts proved on the second indictment might have produced a conviction on the first; why, a party may be convicted upon an indictment for murder, by evidence that would have no tendency to prove that there was any intent to kill; nay, by evidence that might clearly show he meant to stop short of death, and even took some means to prevent death; but if that illegal act of his produces death, that is murder. Two authorities have been cited with reference to an acquittal or a conviction in a Police Court; one of them was a case before Mr. Justice Coltman, which turned entirely upon a particular Statute</hi> (9 <hi rend="italic">Geo.</hi> 4, <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 91, <hi rend="italic">sec.</hi> 28); <hi rend="italic">and as to the case in 5 Law Chronicle, it is evident that proceeded upon some Act applicable to Scotland; or, if it did not, I entirely dissent from the doctrine there laid down. The only suggestion that raised, for a moment, a doubt in my mind was from Mr. M'Mahon, to the effect that as acquittal of an assault with intent to kill, was an acquittal both of the assault and of the intent; but I think that is not so; the acquittal of the whole offence is not an acquittal of every part of it, it is only an acquittal of the whole; therefore the result of such an acquittal would only be, that the acts were not done with intent to kill; and although it was urged that, under a recent Act of Parliament, it was competent to the Jury to convict of unlawfully wounding, I am not sure, if the whole record had been before us, that that would have presented any sort of answer; but the record is not before us; all we have is, that the Jury acquitted the party of the wounding with intent to kill; that is the only thing we have to deal with. It appears to me, therefore, with reference to all the authorities that have been laid before us, that the two offences are not the same, that the plea cannot be supported, and that the prisoner must answer over. I am authorised to state that Mr. Justice Crompton and Mr. Baron Watson, before whom the case came at the last Session, have looked into the matter, and concur in the view now taken.</hi>"</p>

                  </hi>. <hi rend="italic">was of the same opinion. After alluding to the peculiar form of the plea, which omitted to aver the identity of the crime now charged, with that of which the prisoner had been acquitted, and which omission, in his opinion, was fatal to the plea, he referred to that portion of the argument founded upon the maxim in Hale and other authors, that no man could be tried twice for one and the same crime; that maxim presented a true criterion by which to test this question; was the crime here one and the same? now the offence for which the prisoner had been tried was one of intent, and was therefore complete the moment the stab was given; whereas, the offence for which he was now indicted, could only be consummated by the death of the party. To the mind of any lawyer, this must be deemed conclusive as against the plea, which, on the grounds already referred to, was not to be supported.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE WILLES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">gave judgment to the same effect. In order to support this plea, it must be shown that the former acquittal was an acquittal of all that state of facts which might constitute the party a murderer. Now, on comparing the two indictments, it was clear that the Jury had not so acquitted him; all that was then disposed of was, that he did not wound with intent to kill; it could not be assumed that they negatived the wounding; therefore, if the wounding, coupled with circumstances not showing an intention to kill, might constitude murder, the prisoner ought now to be tried for that offence; and that this might be the case, was clearly shown by the fact, that persons inflicting wounds whilst engaged in the commission of burglary or robbery, without any intention to kill, would be guilty of murder where death ensued.

                  </hi>. On 8th July last, I was a prisoner in the Queen's Bench Prison. About 2 o'clock that day, I observed the prisoner, Mr. Gower, and Mr. Thompson, go up stairs towards Mr. Robertson's room—about five or six minutes after they had gone in, I heard a scuffle, and I saw the prisoner run out of the room, and Mr. Gower after him—they ran along the corridor towards the stairs—I went immediately to Mr. Robert son's room and found him wounded and bleeding, supported by Mr. Thomp<lb></lb>son—I then followed the direction that the prisoner and Gower had taken, but did not come up with them—I returned towards Mr. Robertson's room—before I got there, I saw this knife lying down on the ground between Mr. Robertson's room and the stairs to which the prisoner and Gower had run; it is in the same state as it was then, except that there were some marks of blood upon it—I then went down stairs and found the prisoner and Mr. Gower detained—I said to the prisoner, "You are the assassin; your name is Salvi"—he made no answer, but started back in voluntarily.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and attend at the Queen's Bench Prison. On the afternoon of 8th July, I was called to see Mr. Robertson, he was in his room—I found him wounded; he had one wound on the right temple, one by the side of the face, one on the right side, another over the collar bone on the right side, and one at the nape of the neck, five in all—I attended him from that day until the 22nd Aug., when he died in the prison—at that time the whole of the wounds had healed</p>

               <p>externally—after death I made an examination—I found a portion of knife adhering to one of the vertebrae—it had transfixed the spinns process of the vertebrae and completely passed through it, the point emerging at about the anterior portion of the neck, to the extent of about a quarter of an inch—the division of the spinal marrow was the cause of death—about three-fourths of it was divided, he was entirely paralyzed on one side and partly on the other—I have here the portion of the spinal cord with the portion of knife in the position in which I found it (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—it must have required very great force, indeed, to inflict that blow; the portion of bone cut through is extremely hard—I have compared the knife produced with this portion in the spine; it appears to be a portion of it.</p>

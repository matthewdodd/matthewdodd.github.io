               <p>Q. Was this property stolen from your house? - I was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this property kept in your house? - Yes. The bed was taken down to clean the room and shake the dust off, and not carried up stairs immediately, but put into the parlour in a corner of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your house? - City Garden-row.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you last see it there yourself? - I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen it in the parlour? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago was it? - In July.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know it again when it is produced to you? - Yes. I have had it in my custody ever since; it was taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160077"></xptr>to Worship-street, and the prisoner was committed; I took it there with the prisoner; the prisoner was apprehended the next day after the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see it in possession of the prisoner? - No. The prisoner did not take it away but dropped it, as far as I understand.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of Mr. Williams? - No more than a neighbour. About seven o'clock in the morning. Wednesday, the 22d of July, when I got out of bed I went across my room to look at the window, I see the prisoner at the bar at Mr. Williams's window; I could not tell at what, but looking more at her, I see her pulling something out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. It was at the parlour window? - Yes, about three steps up, she could get at it; by pulling something by little and little out of the window, it came presently out in a lump, which she quickly lapped up and clapped under her arm, and then I cast up my window and called out, Mrs. Williams, you are robbed. The prisoner was making off, and I called out stop theif! and one Mr. Dixey was coming past, and I said, Mr. Dixey, stop that woman, She has robbed Mr. Williams; on my saying that she dropped the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it picked up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it? - A tent bed furniture. I then told Mr. Dixey to hold her till I put on my clothes and I came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Dixey hold her? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the bad furniture? - it was given to Mrs. Williams, who declared it was her property. A Mrs. Turner that picked it up gave it to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it given to her? - I did, at her own door. She said it was her own.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner within hearing? - Close to her own door at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was it? - Striped, brown and red, and white. Here is the furniture; I am sure of this to be the very same.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the woman? - I never see her before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Did you receive it of your wife? - I took it out of the parlour. I can swear to it by the figure.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going up to get some myrtles at Islington; I deal in myrtle trees; there was an uproar at this gentlewoman's door; by and by, when I got a little way on, a man stopped me, and said, I must go back; I said, what must, I go back for? they said I had stole that property; they afterwards let me go. I was going up the next day, and a gentleman stopped me again, and said they would have me before a justice; and I said, for what? and they took me before Mr. Wilmot, in Hog-lane, and he told them he must send me to this place; where I have been eight weeks for nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Court to Cooper. Did you let her go? - Yes, the first morning, on her promising never to come that way again.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you let her go? - A whole day.</p>

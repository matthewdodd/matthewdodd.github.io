            ; the prisoner was in the employ of myself and partner, between five and six years; he is a German I believe. On Thursday morning we had information that the prisoner had some property about him; I sent for a constable; he searched him and found three pieces of fur; when he went about searching him, he threw one piece from his waistcoat pocket, and the other two pieces were in his breeches; when the constable was searching him, he threw them down behind him; I desired the constable to take notice of the pieces, and to take the man in custody.</p>

            . I am a constable; I took the prisoner in custody, and began to search him; he pulled out a piece of fur from one of his pockets; I took it. from him, and with his other hand he pulled out two more pieces from his breeches left side, as I supposed. These are the three pieces of fur.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at it; are these pieces your fur - A. It was of that description that he was working on that morning; it is impossible to swear to fur that is not marked; I have no doubt but they are mine.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called one witness, who gave him a good character</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Hawkes and Co.; the firm consists of myself, Mr. Wigan, and Mr. Stephens—we have a brewery at Bishop's Stortford—that business came into out possession in 1876—the prisoner was engaged by us permanently about January, 1877 as an accountant at a salary of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he came originally from London, where he was practicing as an accountant, in order to open the books on a new system which we had instituted—one of his principal duties was the checking of the agents' accounts—he was occupied entirely at the brewery at Bishop's Stortford—in June, 1877 we established an agency in London, with offices at St. Pancras Station—up to October last a man named Henry Woollett was out London agent—he entered our service in 1877—he was first mentioned to us by Wall, he went to London to see Woollett and to obtain references from him—he wrote to three people whom Woollett referred to—we had two answers—I have not been able to find the third—they were considered at the time to be satisfactory—we have since made inquiry about them—we have ascertained that one of them was a reference to himself and signed by himself in another name, and the third one, to which I could find no answer, was also written by himself under a different title, and another business—Woollett superintended our London office and the London business—his duties were to solicit orders, obtain customers for the firm, and collect money—we arranged with the bankers at Bishop's Stortford that Barclay and Bevan, the London agents, should receive it, and his duty was to pay it in to Barclay's—it was also his duty to forward to Bishop's Stortford a daily sheet—there were two sheets, one to show the sales, and another called the cash diary to show the moneys received—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a form of the cash diary—these shects would be addressed to the firm, but it was arranged that the letters from the agents should be opened by Wall in the absence of the principals; at the end of each week Woollett sent a weekly advice note, which should set out the moneys paid in during the week to the credit of the firm at Barclay's, and that of course should correspond with the moneys received, as shown by the diary—these forms were supplied to Woollet by us—we had special forms of printed receipts, with counterfoils, in books, numbered consecutively—those receipt</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188003010009"></xptr>
               <p>books were given out by Wall, and he kept a register of what he gave out, and to whom they were given—it was Wall's duty to see that the counter<lb></lb>foils tallied with the receipts, as stated in the diaries; there is a column there for that purpose—upon the application for a new receipt book, Wall should have required the used up one to be given back, and should have recorded the issue of the new one—it was his duty at the end of each week to check the daily diary sheets with the weekly advice notes, and also to check the advice notes with the cash book, to see that the money had really been paid in—we balance our accounts on 31st July each year, and it would be Wall's duty, as shortly after as possible, to balance the various books, to extract the balances, and to lay before the partners the statement of the balances from his summary ledger, which contains a short statement of the totals of the monthly balances—that was a locked book, it was kept entirely by Wall, I mean all the writing was his—it was generally in his custody—he had a key, and the partners had a key—he had a room to himself in the brewery opposite the partners' room up stairs, and the book was generally kept there—the agency letters were in foolscap, with the word "agency" printed in the corner—on 22nd October Mr. Wigan showed me a copy which he had made of a letter of Woollett's, addressed to Wall, and marked "Private," but which Mr. Wigan had opened—we do not recognise private letters coming to the brewery, they are supposed to be on business—up to the time I saw that letter I had no reason to suppose that Wall and Woollett were on intimate terms, or had any business transactions between them—shortly after that letter was shown me this paying in slip (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) came into my hands—Mr. Wigan showed it to me; it refers to a draft of Mr. Turnham's for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., paid in by Woollett, dated 16th September, 1879—we had lent Mr. Turnham 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on seeing this I turned to the pass book, but could find no trace of that sum—we then called Wall into our room, and the three part<lb></lb>ners spoke to him—we first asked him when Woollett last paid in any money to our credit—he said he did not know—we asked when did he last advise the payment in of money—he said he did not know—we asked him to fetch his latest advice—he said "I don't know what form of advice you mean"—we then sent for a form of the weekly advice note, and showed him, and he said "Oh, Mr. Woollett has discoutinued using these forms long ago"—we said "How long?"—he said "Several months"—I then showed him the paying in slip—I then knew that it was not in the pass-book—I asked him how long it was since Woollett had paid in any money—he went to look, and said he had not paid in any since the end of July—we then asked what balance was in Woollett's hands at the end of July—he went out of the room to his own room, and came back in a minute and said 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and some shillings—he would ascertain that by looking at the summary ledger—I asked why he did not call our attention to the non-payment sooner, and Mr. Stephens said that what he had stated left no doubt on his mind that he had been in collusion with Woollett—Wall very much resented that expression—we did not prolong the interview because Mr. Wigan and I resolved to come to town by the next train to see Woollett—before doing so we looked at the pass book, and found that the last entry with Woollett's name against it was the end of July—Mr. Wigan and I then went to London and saw Woollett at the St. Pancras office—we asked him when to he had last paid in money, and why he had not advised payments in—he said that he had paid in everything up to October, and that he had regularly</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188003010010"></xptr>
               <p>advised moneys on these forms, and he showed us his press letter book—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he showed us five press copies in the form of these advice notes, dated subsequent to July, and said that he had sent the originals to the brewery—the five he showed us were 5th, 11th 18th, and 25th August, and 15th September—we said it was so extra<lb></lb>ordinary that he must accompany us to Barclay's bank to ask them, and he went with me in a cab to Barclay's, where we saw two of the cashiers, and asked them for information of the latest payment in by Woollett—they referred to the books and said that the 25th or 26th July was the last payment, and the account tallied with the last payment that we had found in our pass book with his name against it—Woollett still persisted that he had made other payments—I took him back to the office when Mr. Wigan was, and we suspended him at once, and told him to come the next day to meet us—it was then late in the evening—before leaving we asked him what amount he had not paid in, or not accounted for, and after being pressed a good deal he said he had 116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he had not accounted for—the amount of the five copy advice notes he showed us was 545<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we insisted upon his leaving everything behind him in the office, his keys, a bag that he carried about with him, and everything—we asked him for his own pass book—he had a private banking account at a bank close to the office—he looked for it in a drawer, and said he had not got it—after he had gone out of the office I found it in a waste paper basket at the side of the chair where he had been sitting—he had also shown us two cheques payable to Wall of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, dated 3rd and 16th July, with Wall's endorsement on them, and also a cheque of 126<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the firm, the last one he paid in in July, which was endorsed in the name of the firm by Wall, which he had no authority to do—those cheques were drawn by Woollett on his own private account at the National Bank, King's Cross—an agent was not allowed to draw on his private account to pay in moneys received from customers—we had occasionally received cheques from him drawn on his account, but they were payments of an exceptional character, not for customers' moneys, those he was ordered to pay in direct to us—we found several loose receipts in his bag, and four or five in the table drawer, and receipt books mutilated, some had whole pages torn out, also some letters from Wall wholly unconnected with business, and some telegrams from Wall to Woollett, also the counterfoil book of the paying in slips of the National Bank—we found from that that large quantities of customers' money had been paid in to his account there; in fact, we found that he had made the payments in to Barclay's general! from his own account instead of the money being paid in direct—two of the telegrams are dated 1st August and 17th October, 1879, referring to interviews not on the business of the firm—we found this letter of 18th August from Wall to Woollett (<hi rend="italic">This referred to some negotiation for the purchase of a brewery by the prisoner; that he had secured</hi> 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">and would want from</hi> 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">more, and inquired whether he could depend upon Woollett for some</hi>)—amongst Woollett's papers we found the lease of a brewery at Croydon to Woollett, and an agreement for the purchase of a wine business in Mount Street—we afterwards found cheques which had been given in payment, to the amount of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that referred to a brewery at Croydon; he had given that for the goodwill and plant to the former proprietor—we also found a number of cards and other things that he had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188003010011"></xptr>
               <p>had printed for this brewery, with the name of Woollett and Co. as trading there—the brewery to which Wall's letter refers is a different one altogether—Woollett was paid partly by salary and partly by commission; I think it came to about 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the last year—on the morning of 29th October I came up again—I did not see Woollett that day, and I went back to Bishop's Stortford—on the 30th I went to Wall's private room in the brewery, and there found these seven cash advice notes in the secretaire, which he kept locked, they were under a number of other papers—they were the five of which Woollett had shown us press copies—on the one of 15th July I find an addition of some figures amounting to 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. It. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. it which is the true balance that was in Woollett's hands on 31st July, 1879—some advice notes were afterwards found by a clerk in the strong room, one of them is the last one on 15th September for 249<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the others were all of antecedent dates—we afterwards examined the summary ledger, which is here; we added up the figures, and found the amount against Woollett to be, not 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as Wall had represented, but 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Woollett had in the meantime sent us a statement of his deficiency, through his solicitor, amounting to about 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—upon examining the ledger we found that it was an increased deffciency month by month—Wall had never said a syllable about it—the cheque for 126<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of 30th July was forwarded by Woollett to Wall in an advice note of the 29th—I was at the brewery all day on the 31st, the date on which the cheque was actually paid in to our account, it was market day—if that cheque had been handed to me for endorsement I should probably have asked what it represented, and wished to see the letter in which it was enclosed—this is the letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—from 31st July Woollett never accounted for any moneys received from customers—the amount of our deficiencies altogether is over 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Woollett was first mentioned to us by Wall—we were desirous of opening a London agency and of meeting with a person who would be likely to carry out that view—I have no recollection of any advertisement—Wall was sent to London to make inquiry about him and he was engaged subject to references—the references were written for by Wall, and answers were received which were thought satisfactory at the time, and he was engaged—he did a very fair amount of business, about 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—his salary was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year and 5 per cent. on custom introduced by him, with certain exceptions—part of Wall's duty was to check the receipts with the counterfoils—Wall kept the receipt books—I believe towards the close of the time Wall gave the books to the cashier—it would be Mortlock, the cashier's duty to compare each entry with the receipt book with regard to the home trade, but not with regard to the agency—it would be Mortlock's duty to post up the cash book from the pass book—the cash book was kept by Mortlock—there is no entry of moneys having been paid in by Woollett after July—as Mortlock is out of Court I may perhaps say he is more honest than clever—he has explained why he did not call our attention to the fact—our accounts are made up for the year on 31st July—our turn over is considerable—it takes a considerable time to find the balances—the accounts were not completed on 28th October, when I had the interview with Wall—the posting in the summary ledger is in pencil, not in ink—there was no reason why it should not have been done, except from his desire to conceal that he was far behind his time in that part of the work—he had been asked fcveral times for these balances—on 28th October I asked him what was the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188003010012"></xptr>
               <p>state of Woollett's account—he went out and returned in two or three minutes, long enough to cast up rows of figures—he is a particularly accurate accountant, and I never knew him make a mistake of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—brewers' accounts are paid in 28 days as a rule—we had no suspicion of Woollett till this discovery—Wall had no testimonials or references when he came into our service—he was known to Mr. Stephens, my partner, when he was in Allsop's brewery; but I have ascertained that he was discharged sum<lb></lb>marily from a brewery where he was engaged in the interval, Mesas, Sedgwick's at Watford, because there was something wrong in his accounts—I made inquiry at the brewery myself, and that was the answer I obtained' Mr. Stephens of course was quite ignorant of that—the cheque of 31st July was paid in to our credit and duly appears—I last saw Woollett on 30th October—I took out a warrant against him on that day, but nothing was heard of him—we made every inquiry, offered rewards, and had circulars sent all over the kingdom—I don't think anything but the letters and two or three telegrams were found on Woollett's premises showing a connection between him and Wall—one of the letters refers to the purchase of the Brentford Brewery—I do not know Mr. Sedgwick's writing. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Alfred Hutchings, of</hi> 4, <hi rend="italic">Baker Street, here deposed to the letter being in Mr. Sedgwick's handwriting, which was dated</hi> 23<hi rend="italic">rd January</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">and sated that Wall was a thorough accountant and very trustworthy</hi>.) Wall came into our service at the latter part of 1876—I know Woollett's handwriting—these letters from him to Wall are not all marked "Private"—these confirm what I have said, that Wall had interviews with Woollett before he was engaged—I had a guarantee of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the Guarantee Society with respect to Woollett—it was on 28th October that I had the conversation with Wall about Turnham's draft for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Wigan made that inquiry—this was received, I suppose, the next day, if it was enclosed in a letter dated 16th September—I believe Wall went away for his holiday on 15th or 16th September—I think he was absent a fortnight—he was absent when that letter arrived containing that paying in slip—in the absence of the partners Mortlock would be allowed to open the letters—I have no recollection of having opened it—a letter was written to Woollett inquiring why the money did not appear, and his answer was that there had been something irregular in Turnham's cheque, and therefore the bankers would not accept it, and he had to wait for a fortnight while Turnham had gone away to Lowestoft before he could get it set right—no doubt the cashier referred to the pass book at Tufnell's, but he did not report it—I can't say that I ever referred to the summary ledger in a systematic way—I have looked at it occasionally, perhaps once in two or three months—I don't think I ever looked at it by myself, it was simply when I have been asking Wall about it—Mr. Stephens used generally to communicate with Wall as to the summary ledger—it must have been apparent to Wall month by month that the credits were largely in excess of the debits—Wall was placed in super<lb></lb>vision of these agents for the express purpose of a systematic supervision being kept of them, and we considered that anything wrong would be brought to us—the daily'diaries were sent down every day with the amounts received from customers—they are all pasted into a book by the office boy—we had no means of knowing what amounts were received by Woollett except by the aid of the diaries—if Wall had compared the ledgers with the publicans' accounts he would immediately have discovered this—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188003010013"></xptr>
               <p>woollett came down to Bishop's Stortford from time to time with the pub<lb></lb>licans' accounts for the purpose of verifying the ledgers with Wall, and Wall ought to have insisted upon seeing the publicans' books with Woollett's receipts in them—with the exception of the two sums of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. we know of no money received by Wall from Woollett—Woollett failed to pay in accounts corresponding with the amounts which he admitted he had reeeived—there were additional frauds of Woollett's with which we do not charge Wall having anything to do—the deficiency varied from month to month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Woollett was engaged in May, 1877—the testimonial as to Wall was from Mr. Sedgwick—I believe there was more than one Mr. Sedgwick in the firm—the active partner is now in an asylum—I saw one of the managing clerks—I don't know his name—he told me what I have stated—I have, of course, no means of knowing whether it was true—our clerks had been prohibited more than a year ago from endorsing cheques in the name of the firm—we considered Wall at the head of the office at Bishop Stortford, and we so informed him—he was next to the partners and our right hand man—if our books had been kept in the way I have described it would have been impossible for these deficiencies to have escaped notice—the system is a very detailed and a very complete one, and if properly carried out it would be impossible for any fraud to be committed by any one person—it is only fair to say that we do not state that Wall would have known of the entire amount of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the amount of which he should have informed us would have been a little under 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the other was through forgery of Woollett's which he did not know of—Wall did not inform us that either he or Woollett contemplated the purchase of a brewery or a wine business—we had no idea of such a thing—Woollett was a man in trust and authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. Woollett began to defraud us very shortly after he came, and Wall during the year ending 31st July, 1879—he allowed Woollett to get more and more into arrear until he ceased to pay in at all.</p>

On 22nd October last I found a letter addressed to Wall from Woollett, which I opened in Wall's absence—on 28th October we want to town and seized Woollett's papers, and among them were these two cheques for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—up to that date I was not aware of any money transactions passing between Woollett and Wall, or that Woollett was nego<lb></lb>tiating for the purchase of a brewery or wine business, or that Wall was negotiating for the purchase of a brewery; if I had been I should have shown him the door immediately—on 29th October I went to Wall's office with my partner, Mr. Stephens, and in his presence I asked him whether he had had any money transactions with Woollett—he said "No"—I then pressed him, and said "Do you mean to tell me that you have had no money transactions at all with Woollett?" he replied that Woollett had lent him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we then had the two 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheques in our possession—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188003010014"></xptr>
               <p>Woollett had said that the money had been repaid, but Wall said it was still owing, and on that I went into my room and wrote a letter to Wall to tell him on no account was he to part with that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. without my sanction—Wall endorsed a cheque on 31st July in the name of the firm—we had never authorised him or any person in our employment to use the name of the firm on the contrary, finding that such a practice had existed with the old firm, we expressly forbade it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter in which I enclosed Woollett's letter to Wall—that letter gave me some notion of his relations with Woollett—if I had discovered that he was endeavouring to set up a brewery for himself I should certainly have shown him the door; he was engaged for us, and it would have been wrong for him to negotiate with Woollett for a business on his own account while he was receiving our pay—there was a brewery at Brentford which was for sale at that time—it has since been sold—I believe I was absent on my holiday on 31st July—I don't suppose I referred to the summary ledger twice in the year, never by myself—I have asked Wall to come in and give me information once or twice—we generally wind up our business on 31st July—it ought to he wound up within about two months; it had not been completed that yer on 28th October—Wall had been spoken to about it when he absented himself without leave on 21st or 22nd October; that was about the time when the Brentford brewery was in the market—I did not know him before he came to us; Mr. Stephens had known him at Allsop's, but he had lost sight of him for some few years—he discharged his duties in the usual way—I had a conversation with Mr. Mortlock relative to Turnham's cheque—I believe Wall was away at that time—I told Mortlock to make inquiry about it—I don't remember that I ordered the cash-book to be produced, or that I referred to Tuffnell's pass-book—I did not ascertain at that time that nothing had been paid in by Woollett since 31st July—I did not refer to the cash-book to ascertain—I know now that there is no such entry; I did not know it at that time—Mortlock kept the cash-book; he did not enter it up from the pass-book, it was simply compared with the pass-book—I know it was not made up from the pass-book—if cash was advised' it was Wall's duty to take the cash advice to the cashier, and the cashier would enter it in the cash-book, then it would find its way into the pass-book; but as a matter of fact from time to time the cash-book and pass-book was or should be compared, but unfortunately not to the extent it should have been by Wall—Wall did not keep the cash-book, but he had access to it, and frequently had it in his possession—it was the duty of the cashier to keep the cash-book, ledger, and receipt-book, and conduct the general correspondence—the London agency receipt books were kept by Wall—the others were sent by Wall to each agent, and they never returned them till they were filled up and done with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. On 21st October Wall sent a letter stating that he wished to be absent two days on important business; but he was not absent, he came next morning in a very excited state, and said something about the 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he went to town on the 22nd.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier to Messrs. Hawkes—I kep the cash-book—I got the materials for doing so from the cash diary sheets—I was supposed to have them every day both from the office and the agencies and the travellers, except the London agency, that I did not have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188003010015"></xptr>
               <p>from the cash—sheets—I got the materials for mating the entries in the cash-book from the bankers' pass-book—I did not get the weekly letters, they came through Mr. Wall; he did not hand them to me—as far as the cash-book was concerned, I merely had to put the amount in the bankers' pass-book and place it to the London agency in one lump sum—my only mate<lb></lb>rial for making up the cash-book was the bankers' pass-book at Stratford—the weekly advice notes containing amounts of money paid in by Woollett to Barclay's never came into my possession—they were kept by Wall and placed in a guard book, or should have been—if I wanted to make any inquiry about the London agency, or any agency, I should go to Wall—he always had access to the cash-book and pass-book—I remember on 31st July Wall giving me a cheque for 126<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that had been received from Woollett about that time—I paid that into the banking account with other cheques—I did not notice at the time that it was made payable to Hawkes and Co.—I know that Mr. Blunt was at Bishop's Stortford on 31st July—it was market day—I used to endorse cheques under the old firm, and I continued that course until the present firm said they should better come before one of the principals, as many were doing it—that was a general order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Sometimes if a cheque was paid late it was not paid in till the following day—I said before the Magistrate that it would be de<lb></lb>niable that all cheques should be paid into the bank before the close of the half-year—my duties were to take orders from Wall, who was my superior—it was not my duty to check the cash advices—I was commu<lb></lb>nicated with by the firm as to the cheque of 16th September, and I searched the cash-book; there was no entry of it—I did 'not call the attention of the firm to that, because I did not notice it—there was no entry in the pass-book—I did not know but what it might come through some other channel—I had implicit confidence in the prisoner—you won't find remittances every day or every week—these sums were paid through Sparrow's bank, and my duties were not to look after the London agency; that was the prisoner's department, not mine—we were very much pressed after 31st July in making up the books of the firm, and the ordinary duties were very much increased; they were kept up, they might be a little behind—of course, if I knew then as much as I do now I should have noticed the entries in the pass-book—I knew nothing of Woollett; I never saw him but once or twice—the endorsement on the 121<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque was brought to the knowledge of the firm on 28th October; nobody suggested it was a forgery at the time—that was the first I heard of it—I acknow<lb></lb>ledged the receipt of it to Woollett, and paid it in to the account of the firm at Sparrow's, and it came into the accounts of the current year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I had no communication at all with Woollett, only to acknowledge the receipt of anything—the moneys received by Woollett were paid into Barclay's bank in London, and would be entered to the account of the Bishop's Stortford bank—I should have the pass-book of the Bishop's stortford bank, and from that I made up my book—all London agencies were marked "Woollett" at the side—they would come to me in a lump sum—it was Wall's duty to check the gross amount with the documents handed to him—that was no part of my duty—there was nothing to call my attention to the fact that Woollett had not been sending in any moneys after July—in making up the accounts as regards the agencies I did not touble myself as to who paid in the money.</p>

I am a clerk in the employment of Hawkes and Co., of Bishop's Stortford—in consequence of instructions from Mr. Wigan, on 18th November I searched the strong room, and pushed up against the wall, at the back of the strong room, among a number of other dirty papers, I found these 16 weekly cash advices from Woollett—another clerk found a number of paying-in slips by the side of them.</p>

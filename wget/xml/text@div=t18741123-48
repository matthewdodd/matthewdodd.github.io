                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Johnson, and was lodging on the 29th October at a lodging house, No. 20, New King Street, Deptford—I had seen the prisoner during the time he had been lodging there (about</p>

I am a gauger, and know this lodging house—I was there on the 29th October, in the kitchen, when the prisoner and prosecutrix were there—the prisoner was going up and down the kitchen eating bread and meat—he had a knife in his hand, and the prosecutrix asked for a bit of string to tie a dog up—the prisoner said "Go to your two fancy men"—she was up a few steps going into the back yard, and she came back and called him a b——monkey, which aggravated him, and he up with his left hand and gave her a back hand blow with the hand in which the knife was.</p>

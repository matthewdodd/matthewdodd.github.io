               <p>I have known the prisoner eight years since the Westminster association, he asked me a little trifle for rent; I went to him and asked him to settle it; he told me he would be with me on Saturday night or Sunday; on the Sunday evening he came between four and five; he was very much toxicated in liquor; says he, I cannot pay you, then says he, I am doing very well, I have got my watch out of pawn; and he had a silver watch in his hand; I knew him eight years ago to have a watch; he went away; I thought this was the prisoner's watch; I never knew the prisoner guilty of any improper action; he is a hard working industrious man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I knew nothing at all about the matter till I was challenged about it on Monday night to my knowledge; I have not had a watch for some weeks; I have worked hard upon the spot seven or eight years; I never saw any watch; if I had been guilty of such a thing as this, many favourable opportunities would have happened; I had no watch to my knowledge.</p>

            . I am a watchman in St. Giles's; I was calling twelve o'clock in Silver-street, going into Bloomsbury-market, and heard a noise in the court, I saw a man coming along the court and seven or eight following him, Lewis was before them; one of them gave him a desperate blow with his fist, he immediately fell with his face in the kennel; I asked what was the matter-the prisoner is the man who struck him. I never took my eyes off him till I took him - I saw him strike the prosecutor. I uncovered my lanthorn, when the prisoner said, "watchman, what is the matter?" I went up and pretended to raise the prosecutor up; the prisoner was by his side, I seized him while he was asking me what was the matter. I told him he was the man who knocked the prosecutor down; he said, "me!" I said, "yes, I saw you do it." He made no answer. Chibnall came to my assistance, and said he saw him throw something into the water; I saw him take a case of razors out of the kennel, we then took him to the watch-house. I saw two handkerchiefs found in his hat; the prosecutor claimed one of them.</p>
               <p>ANTHONY CHIBNALL. I am a watchman. I was calling twelve o'clock at the end of Lyon-street, Holborn, and heard the bustle; I went up and Ward gave the prisoner in my charge; I immediately saw him throw something into the kennel, and told Ward to hold him, I searched the kennel, and found the case of razors there; a handkerchief was taken out of the prisoner's hat, which the prosecutor claimed. He described the razors before he saw them.</p>

I heard the disturbance, and saw seven or eight men run away as I came down Hart-street; I looked down Market-street, saw the prosecutor in the kennel, and a man standing over him, by the passage - I went up; Ward seized the prisoner; Chibnall came up and searched the kennel. The razors and handkerchief were produced at the watch-house, which the prosecutor claimed.</p>

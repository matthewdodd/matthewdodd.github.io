On 12th April, at half-past eight at night, I was on duty at Star-corner, Bermondsey—I saw the two prisoners in a marine-store shop—I saw Lomas take from a handkerchief the copper I now produce, and put it in the scale—I went in—Marriage was in the shop, about two yards from Lomas—I asked Lomas how he came by the copper—he told me he bought it of a man at the bottom of the Blue Anchor-road—I said I was not satisfied, and I asked him to go to the station—when we got a little way he told me I ought to have taken the other party in the shop; that was the man that gave him the copper—I asked him where he was at work—he said he had been pulling down a roof, and this copper he took to get some beer—I asked him where he worked, he would not tell me that—he said it would be all the worse for him if he did—I made no reply—I found the prosecutor the next morning, and described the other party who was in the marine-store shop.</p>

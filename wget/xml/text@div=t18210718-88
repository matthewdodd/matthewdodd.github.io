On Saturday, the 14th of July, I received 5 l. 9 s. 3 d. pension-money, at Chelsea, and on Sunday, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I was in the King's-head public-house, Oxford-street, with a woman, and had lamb chops for breakfast. I then had four sovereigns, and five shillings - the prisoners were there, the woman I was with spoke to them; I treated them all with liquor - the two women said to me,</p>
               <p>"Countryman, you are getting fresh, you had better go home to our bed, and have a nap there; you will be as safe as if you were in heaven." We all four went to their lodgings, I was quite sensible, I gave them 1 s. and the prisoners went for some rum, leaving me and the woman in the room - they returned; Hunt said, 2 s. would buy enough meat for the four, he went after the meat, my companion gave him 2 s. to buy it; he returned and said it came to 3 d. more, I said I would pay him; it was to be ready between one and two o'clock - we all came out, I went to a public-house to change one sovereign, and all four had more liquor - we then returned to the room; I saw no more of the woman I had been with - the prisoners remained in the room, and I laid down on the bed, and for safety, put my canvas purse, containing three sovereigns and one shilling, inside my breeches, and I awoke by feeling a grappling about my breeches, and seized Hunt's hand in my breeches, and missed my money - I said,</p>
               <p>"It is too bad to rob me, I have treated you with eatables and drinkables" - they both pushed me about the room; the mutton came in from the baker's, I said, I would have some of it, but they bundled me down stairs, and threw my handkerchief after me, and said, I might go to hell - I got into the street, and gave a boy 6 d. to fetch a constable, but he never came back - a man brought two, and they were secured about two yards from the house; Hunt said a woman was spending my money - I have not recovered any of my money.</p>

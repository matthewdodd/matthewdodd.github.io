                  </hi>. I keep the Robert's Arms, Devonport Street, Com<lb></lb>mercial Road—on Saturday night, 4th May, my wife brought me a half-crown—I went into my bar, and saw Carter with a man—I told him it was a bad half-crown—he said "It is a bad job, I must take it back" I put it into his hand, and he put it in his pocket and paid me with a good shilling, and treated me to some drink—they then left, and I followed them and saw them join Daniels at Stepney Church, where I gave them in custody, but the man got away—Davis said she did not know it was bad, that Carter gave it to her—Daniels took a purse out of her pocket, and Carter tried to snatch it from her—the constable took it, and it contained nine bad half crowns.</p>

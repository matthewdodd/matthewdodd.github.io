My husband's brother gives me spatterdashes to make, which I give out to poor people to do. The prisoner came to our house and asked me for work, and I let her have some to make up, about three weeks before I was robbed. She came to my house on Saturday the 11th of December, and work being slack she was there all day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with her?</p>
               <p>E. Davis. I had been acquainted with her but about a fortnight, from the time of my giving her work, on the Sunday morning being the 12th. Her landlord came to me and asked what I had done with Mrs. Gray, for she was not come home. Then I went into my closet and missed my teaspoons.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did you miss?</p>
               <p>E. Davis. I missed three.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find them again?</p>
               <p>E. Davis. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Give an account how?</p>
               <p>E. Davis. I met with the prisoner on the Tuesday following in St. Anne's Lane in the morning.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175701140009"></xptr> I asked her where my spoons were; she said, she knew nothing of them. I told her if she would tell me, I would not hurt her. Then she told me where they were, and went with me to where they were pawned; she told me two of them were pawned for half a crown, and the other for 16 d. but I found the two were pawned for 3 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise her, you would not hurt her?</p>
               <p>E. Davis. I did, but that was not in my power, for my husband was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the spoons?</p>
               <p>E. Davis. I found them in Orchard-street, at two different houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she own she took them?</p>
               <p>E. Davis. She did. (The spoons produced in court and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. From prisoner. Did not you give me a coat to mend of your husband's?</p>
               <p>E. Davis. Yes I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The spoons were in one of the pockets of the coat.</p>
               <p>E. Davis. There was never a pocket in that old coat.</p>

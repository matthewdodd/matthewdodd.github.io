                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Stark, and keep a boot and shoe shop, at Deptford. I know the prisoner—she first came to my shop one evening at the latter end of April, miserably clad, and asked me to take something, as she was very much in want of a pair of boots—she came on Wednesday, 5th May, and I had a good deal of conversation with her about letting her have some boots in exchange for some articles of her own, instead of money—my son showed her some boots—she did not purchase any—she proposed to sell me various articles out of her house, such as trays and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185506110147"></xptr>
               <p>I candlesticks, and different <hi rend="italic">oddments</hi> that she brought into my shop—I told her I did not want anything, and she went away, without buying any boots—I at last agreed to take a piece of floor cloth—I missed two pain of boots on the following Saturday morning—I have since seen one of those pairs of boots at the police court—I had never sold them to the prisoner—she came again on Saturday, 12th May, and I let her have a second pair of shoes, in exchange for some more articles—I had previously let her have one pair of kid boots and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in exchange for some—she came again on Tuesday, the 15th, and asked me to buy some little books—I declined doing so, as they were not modern—I turned into the parlour, to get a book to show her, and as I returned I found her on her knees, in the act of stealing a pair of boots—she took them from off a rail, and put them under her arm, under her shawl—I was so agitated at first I did not know what to say—at last I asked if that was anything to sell that she had under her shawl—she said, "No"—after a few minutes, I asked her if she was in want of those boots I had seen her turning over—she again turned round and stooped to the same boots, turned them over, and said she was in want of a pair of common boots—she then wished to be shown some better ones; and my son began to take some down, but I would not allow any to be moved; I told my son to put everything up—she then asked me if I would purchase those books for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told her, no, I would have nothing to do with her books, nor anything she brought—she had a basket with her, and produced some books from the basket; but on my saying that, she put them in again, and was going away—when she got to the mat, some eight feet from where she stole the boots, I stood in front of her, and said, "It is a very hard case for me, ma'am, but you have a pair of my boots under your shawl"—she said, "Yes, I have"—I lifted her shawl, and drew the boots out by the string—they were a pair of my boots—I said, "This is not the first You have taken from me"—she then said the boots were her own property; that she had purchased them down the Broadway—I said, "You cruel woman, here is my child's handwriting on the boots"—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the boots, and here is my son's writing on the sole—I shut the door, and sent for a policeman—she became very violent; I was compelled to call the servant in for protection—about 8 o'clock that evening the policeman brought me some other boots and shoes-; among them, one of the two pairs that I had lost ten days previously—I know them by an alteration which I made in them myself.</p>

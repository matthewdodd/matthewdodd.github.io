                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Joseph Reeve—I was engaged on board the ship <hi rend="italic">Excel</hi>, which laid at Carpenter Smith's wharf. On Thursday, the 3rd of August, master gave me a sovereign to pay some ballast-men—I put it into a purse, with 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and put it into my waistcoat pocket—immediately after I went down to have my tea—I took the purse out of my pocket, put it on the cabin table, and left it there—I came on deck after tea, and sent the prisoner down to have his tea—he is steward of the vessel—I afterwards missed my purse, and said to him, "Steward, I have lost my purse with a sovereign and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it"—he said, "It is a bad job"—I afterwards saw the policeman take it from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dressmaker, and live at 76, Abbeyfield Road, Rotherhithe—on 27th July, about 8.50 at night, I was by London Bridge, going under the dry arch over Thames Street—I saw the two pri<lb></lb>soners there and the prosecutor against the wall—the prosecutor was so tipsy he could not stand—he was being propped up by the prisoners, and was leaning against the wall—the prisoners put their hands in his pockets and took something out, each of them, and put it in their own—I was on the other side of the road—I could not see what they took, but I could see there was something in their hands which they put into their own pockets—they brought him out into the road and let go of him—he fell down—he was unable to stand—then they were going away up the steps, but Nicholls came back and took hold of his arm to help him up—I went and took hold of Nicholls' arm and he swore at me—I thought the man was dead—he hit his head on the ground when he fell—Nicholls brought him out of the road and let him go again, and went up the steps, and I saw no more of them—there was somebody with me, and she could see what I saw.</p>

On Saturday night, the 19th of April, he had eleven sheep; I counted them about seven o'clock in the evening - I went there again about eight next morning, and missed two; I examined the fences round the field, and could not find where they could have strayed - I afterwards accompanied Mead round the field; we noticed two corners of the field where the sheep appeared to have been driven up together; and about one o'clock that day we went to the prisoner's house - he lives on Chase-side, nearly half a mile from where the sheep were taken; we found him at dinner - he had got part of a neck of mutton (I think) on his plate; I am sure it was mutton, and his wife had part of the breast.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You think it was mutton? A. It certainly was mutton; I think it was boiled - he lives ten or fifteen yards out of the high road; there is a little lane up to his house - it is a thoroughfare, but not for carriages; I do not think it had rained in the night, but it had on Saturday.</p>

            . I am constable of Enfield, I went to Mr. White's premises, and examined the field with Westcoat; the sheep had been driven into two corners - I found against the gate a place where a man had been standing with very large nails in his shoes; there were two footsteps on the side of the gate; and on the hedge some wool - there was half a tip on the inside of the heel of the right foot mark; and on the outside a great many<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290031"></xptr>nails, and more nails round the toe; and there were a great many nails all round the left foot mark - I traced these footsteps out of the field, about half-way down the road towards the prisoner's house; I got a warrant and searched his house in consequence of suspicion - we found him at dinner; his wife was eating a breast of mutton - and he had part of the breast and neck on his plate - I asked him where he bought the mutton; he said, at Mr. Taylor's, and had given half a crown for it - I took him to Mr. Taylor's, who said, in his presence, that he had not sold him any mutton, and had not seen him; I had received information, and asked the prisoner where the pie was, he gave no answer - I went into the wash-house and found a mutton pie; and in a large iron pot I found a quantity of mutton stewed down - there was part of the neck, breast, loin, and head; I should think sixteen or twenty pounds in weight - it was small Welch mutton, and Mr. White's were small Welch ewes; I searched the privy and found part of a pluck, crammed down with this sheep's-foot - it is the foot of a very small sheep; the pluck appeared very fresh, and two or three spots of blood lay on the privy; it had evidently been recently killed - I took the prisoner to the watch-house, took off his shoes, and compared them with the foot marks at the gate of the field; they fitted - here is the shoe of the right foot; it has half a tip - I applied it to the impression; it corresponded, and the other shoe fitted the other impression; I applied them to two or three impressions over the gate, in the road - they matched; he had a kind of short jacket on, and there was some blood just across the hind part of his shoulder - he had a smock frock on; but that did not come so high.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near to his house did you trace the foot marks? A. Not within a quarter of a mile; as when I got into the main road it was hard - the lane his house is in, is also hard; carts and horses go down there, but they cannot get through - the privy of the next house discharges itself into his; I cannot say whose mutton it was - there is no mark on the sheep's foot; many countrymen wear these kind of shoes; but it is a large foot - this has been a whole tip. but worn off; I have been a shoemaker - it is not common to make labourers shoes with half tips; one of these has no tip.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Liddle, of Church-street, in the parish of Bermondsey. On the evening of the 21st of January I was in the back-parlour with my children, and heard a knock at the door—I went out, and saw Mr. Sweeny holding the prisoner on the step of the door, which was open—he was detained till another gentleman came up, and then taken to the station-house—I had been in the front-parlour be<lb></lb>tween four and five o'clock that evening—the window was shut close down then I am certain, but I believe it was not fastened—I had left a sheet, shift, and night-gown on the sofa there—I saw them picked up, in the prisoner's presence.</p>

On the 21st of January, I was passing No. 4, Church-street, noticed the window up, and one blind open—I looked into the room, and a man pushed the blind in my face—I said, "I beg your pardon, I thought there was nobody at home"—I walked a little way, and saw the blind shut—I went and knocked at the door, the prisoner opened it—I asked if the woman of the house was at home—he said, "Yes, walk in"—I said, "Do you live here?"—he said, "Yes"—I said "Stop a bit"—I knocked at the door again—the prosecutrix came, and said, she did not know him—Mr. Hillier came over to my assistance—the prisoner struggled from us and dropped the bundle, and I secured him until I met the po<lb></lb>liceman and gave him to him—I am certain he is the person who dropped the bundle.</p>

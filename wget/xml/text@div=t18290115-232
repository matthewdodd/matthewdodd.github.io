            . I am in the coal trade, and live in North-bank, Lisson-grove. I heard a cry of Stop thief! I went out, and found two or three other neighbours, the prisoner and the prosecutor in dispute about a watch; the prisoner denied having it - the prosecutor spoke very positive as to her person, and wished to have her searched - she refused, but said she would go any where and he searched by a female - on the Thursday following, I found the watch in my garden, which is three or four doors off the spot.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Was the altercation on this side of your garden? A. I should presume she had passed my garden - I found the prosecutor, and went to him; I was not quite satisfied with his description of it, and I took it to the office.</p>
               <p>NICHOLAS HARVEY re-examined. I believe the prisoner ran by Mr. Maddox's door; I am sure she took my watch- she said she was in distress, and that she lived in Park-street, Oxford-road; I was going to give her a few halfpence out of charity; if I were going to die, she is the woman who took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I heard some one cry out Stop thief! there were two females at a gate, and they asked what was the matter; I said I did not know - the prosecutor took hold of me, and began to pull me about; I said I would not be searched by him.</p>

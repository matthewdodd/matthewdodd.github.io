                  </hi>. I am servant to Francis Paget Watson, at No. 8, Thavies'-inn, in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn. On the 10th of March, a little before twelve o'clock, I went on an errand—I left the street door ajar—there was a washerwoman's cart at the door, and Smith was with it—I was gone about ten minutes—my mistress stood at the door, and said some man had been in and stolen the salver, which I had seen safe on the cheffonier in the drawing-room, on the first floor, about a quarter before twelve o'clock, and had dusted it.</p>

The servant went out on the 10th of March—while she was gone I thought I heard a person come down stairs—I ran up, and asked the woman at the door if anybody had gone out—she said, "Yes, that young man"—I looked out, and saw him—he was then about as far as No. 6—he looked very like the prisoner—I then ran up stairs, and missed the silver salver—there was no one in the house who could have taken it—it was worth about 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Walworth. I was with the laun<lb></lb>dress's cart in Thavies'-inn, Holborn, on the 10th of March, about twelve o'clock, to take care of the linen—Mr. Watson's servant came out, and left the door a little ajar—a young man, very like the prisoner, went after her, but he had a lightish brown coat on then—I saw his face—I am sure the prisoner is the man—he came back again, and slightly knocked at the door—he then walked round the cart, and, after two or three seconds, pushed the door open—he looked round towards Holborn, and then walked in—in two or three minutes he came out again—his coat was buttoned with one button at the top when he went in, and when he came out it was buttoned up—I did not notice whether anything was under it—Mrs. Watson came almost directly to the door, and my mistress said there was a man come out—he was then about as far as No. 6.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fur manufacturer, of No. 60, Cheapside, near Bow-lane; there are two partners, the prisoner was our porter. On Saturday morning, 8th July, on my arrival in town, I received information from Clements, who is also a porter in our employ; in consequence of</p>

               <p>which I told the prisoner that Clements had seen him remove a boa from behind a box; he said he had not taken it—I told him that Clements had seen him go up, put his hand behind a box to feel for something which he did not find, and that he went round to the other side, put his hand behind again, found it, took it into the next warehouse, and put it into a basket—he said he had not seen it, and that Clements did not know a sable boa from a fitch boa—I confronted him with Clements, and he still denied it—I said he had better wait till my partner came to town, and when he came he sent for an officer, and gave the prisoner into custody—I then told him, that he had better tell all he knew about it—I did not say that, till after he was given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the porters to Messrs. Cuthbert and Wotherspoon. On Saturday morning, 8th July, I was sweeping the ware-house, and the prisoner came in and said, "Good morning, where is Mr. Craig?"—I said, "I think he has gone up stairs to breakfast"—he then went to a box which stood before the fireplace, went on one side and could not reach; he then went on the other side, drew out a sable boa from behind the box, took it into the next room, rolled it up, and put it in the corner of a basket—I know the difference between sable and fitch; a sable boa is brown, and a fitch is white and brown—he was waiting for a watering pot; after he had received it he went up stairs, and I called the other porter's attention to it—we found it rolled up, it had a ticket on it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) answers the description of the boa I saw—we both examined it—I continued sweeping the warehouse, the other porter went down stairs, and then I heard the prisoner go down stairs and come up again—I and Korn then went to the basket, and the boa was missing—no other person could have gone to the basket to take it out—I spoke to the warehouseman—I did not hear Korn speak to the prisoner about it, but the prisoner came to me and said, "Korn says you accuse me of taking a sable boa, it was not a sable boa, it was a fitch boa; you have not said anything about it"—I said, "Yes, I have"—he went up stairs, came down, and said it was a fitch boa, and it was all right.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter to Cuthbert and Wotherspoon. On Saturday morning, 8th July, I was sweeping the warehouse, and clements called my attention to a basket in the Bow-lane warehouse—I saw a sable boa in one corner of the basket with a ticket on it, bearing the private mark "b. x."—it was taken out by Clements, looked at, and put back again—Clements and I afterwards went to the basket together, and the boa was gone—it was like this one produced.</p>

On Saturday, 8th July, I was called to the prosecutor's warehouse—I told the prisoner I was a police officer, and that he was suspected of taking the boa, but he had no occasion to answer any questions unless he pleased—no promise was made to him while I was there—he said he had picked up a boa, but it was a fitch boa, and he had put it into a bundle—I asked him if he objected to my search<lb></lb>ing his house; he said, "No"—I searched it, but found nothing; he was afterwards given into custody—after that I saw him going down stairs very fast, and I told him I would see where he was going to get the boa from; he knelt down, and produced it from under a sink—it is a sable boa.</p>

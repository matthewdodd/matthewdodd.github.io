            . I live in Henry-place, White Conduitfields, Islington, and am a carman. On Saturday, the 26th of January, about a quarter-past six o'clock in the evening, I saw three young chaps loitering about, and being suspicious characters I watched them; I saw them go into Poulteny-terrace, open a window, and get into a house belonging to Mr. Vincent: I ran towards the house, after seeing one of them get in; one of them jumped out, and all three ran away - I cannot say whether more than one had got in: I followed, and caught the prisoner about two hundred yards from the house, without losing sight of him; I saw him throw this tea-caddy down: I had seen the window pushed up.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw one of them open it? A. I saw it go up. The other two got away. I gave the prisoner in charge of Essex, with the caddy.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Lane gave the prisoner in my charge, with the caddy - I took him back to the house where the robbery was committed; I found the window open, and a square of glass broken where the catch was - it was Mr. Vincent's house; there was nobody in the room at that time. I knocked at the door, and the caddy was claimed. I took the prisoner to the watch-house, and delivered the caddy up there.</p>

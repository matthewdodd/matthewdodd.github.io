One Thursday Eliza Day came to me for change for a shilling—I gave her the change, and put the shilling into the till—I did not mix it with any other money—the prisoner came to my shop from a quarter to half-an-hour afterwards, asked for a penny loaf and paid me with a shilling—I put that shilling into the till, where I found the other shilling which I had put in first alone—there was no other shilling there—my husband came in in about a quarter of an hour—I showed him the shilling—I saw the prisoner again in custody on the Saturday evening following—the</p>

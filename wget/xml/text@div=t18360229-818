                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Tuesday evening, the 1st of March, I was on duty in Well-street, Hackney—a little before two o'clock, I beard a noise at the back of the Green Dragon—I went round and found the prisoner Marchmont standing at the prisoner Gregg's back door—I asked what he did there—he said Gregg had given him leave to come in that way, that his mother should not know it—I brought him round to the front door of the house; and he called out to Gregg, who came out—Marchmont said, "Did you not give me leave to come in?"—he said, "Yes, "and I let him go—a little time afterwards, I went and looked into the wash-house, and found the pump gone from Mr. Heeves's which is about two doors from Gregg's; and then I found the pipe gone—it is an empty house—I saw a spade, and brought it out—I went over the next premises, called Mrs. Venables up; and said she had seen the pump and pipe safe the night before—I went, and found the pump close to the fence next to Gregg's premises—I brought it round to the front, and informed my bro<lb></lb>ther officer what had occurred—he sent me round to the back of the house, and he took Marchmont into custody—we all went to the station-house together—I took off Marchmont's shoes, and they corresponded with the marks in the mould where the pump had been taken from—at daylight we tired it again, and traced several of the same footmarks into Gregg's premises—there were prints of only one person—the pipe was removed from the wash-house, but not off the premises—it was moved out of the wash-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty in Well-street—I was called by the witness—I looked at the premises, and I took Marchmont—I took his shoes off, and compared them with the footmarks in the mould—the pump had been in a wash-house—there were impres<lb></lb>sions of the shoe close to where the pipe had been, to convey water to the house—the impressions in the mould tallied with the shoes exactly—I have not any doubt that they were made by the shoes—the prosecutor's premises join Gregg's at the bottom part—nothing but a low fence parts them—it was a soft water pipe—this pump was found in the garden.</p>

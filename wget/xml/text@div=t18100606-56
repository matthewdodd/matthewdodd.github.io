On the 22nd of May, about six o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner and another woman came into the shop to look at some wedding rings; the prisoner, after taking up several and putting them down, took up two, and one of them she put in her mouth; and the other, after having it on, she laid it down. I told her she had another; she said, she had not; I said, I was sure she had, I saw her put it in her mouth. The woman that was with her then run out of the shop. She took the ring out of her mouth, gave it to me, and then ran away; Mr. Hatton went after her, fetched her back; she attempted to run away the second time, but I stopped her; we then sent for an officer.</p>

            . At the time that the prisoner was looking at the rings, a man came in and asked to look at some gold broaches, I handed the gold broaches to the man. When I heard Mrs. Hatton say to the prisoner, you have got two rings, she said, she had but one; Mrs. Hatton said, you have put one in your mouth; she denied having it in her mouth, but made an attempt of slipping it out of her mouth, which Mrs. Hatton saw, and told her of it; she then gave it out of her hand to Mrs. Hatton; there was a parchment ticket attached to the ring, which was in a moistened state, from having been in the mouth. The moment that Mrs. Hatton charged the prisoner with the ring, the man that asked to look at the gold broaches, walked out of the shop.</p>

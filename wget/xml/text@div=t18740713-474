I am a warehouseman to Mr. Daniel Gow, 47, Friday Street—on the afternoon of the 30th June, about 2 o'clock, I was sitting making up the books—I heard the lad holloa out "Hi, what do you want 1" I looked up and saw the prisoner with the shawls under his arm standing by the counter—I came out of my desk, and directly he saw me he dropped the shawls; four of them went half on the counter and two on the ground—he ran out and turned, sharp round to the next warehouse—I went in and asked him what he wanted in our warehouse—he said he was not there at all—I said "I shall lock you up"—I sent for a policeman and gave him into custody—these are the shawls—I picked up the two that were on the floor.</p>

I am clerk' to Mr. Daniel Gow, and on the afternoon of 30th June I was on the second floor of the warehouse looking down on to the first floor, and I saw the prisoner just between the counter and the stairs with the shawls under his arm—I asked him what he was doing down there—he said "It is all right, mate," and he dropped the shawls and ran down stairs—I holloaed to Mr. Young, he got up and ran down stairs after him—the prisoner is the man, I have no doubt about it—these shawls are similar to those he had—I could see there were half-a-dozen.</p>

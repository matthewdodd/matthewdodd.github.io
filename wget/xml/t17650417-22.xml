On a Saturday morning, I cannot tell the exact day, I had four or five guineas, a half guinea, and four or five quarter guineas in my pocket apron, which I had told over the night before, and laid under my head: after I brought it down I laid it on the dresser, and sent the prisoner to bring me a clean pocket apron; she very officiously said, she would take the money out of the soul one and put it in the clean one: I thought she had done it: I then looked upon her to be honest. I took and tied it up, with my halfpence in it, and took it roll'd up in my arms to the market. I went to turn my money out, and found but four or five small pieces of gold, called quarter-guineas, among my halfpence; all the rest was gone: I immediately ran home to the maid, and asked her what she had done with the gold; she said she had not meddled with it: My husband coming down stairs that minute, I was afraid to let him know of it. I ran away to market, without saying any thing to him: I told some of our servants of it; and said, if my husband should come to know of it, I would say I had found it again. I never searched the prisoner, nor made much to do about it; but used to say, it is strange the money should be gone so. I, about a month after, told the prisoner she had got it: she said, You lie. She was taken up about a month after for robbing my husband's till; then I spoke of this to my husband.</p>

            . I am a tripe-man in Clare-market: I know but very little of the thing; it was kept a secret from me. I took the prisoner up for above forty guineas that I lost out of my till, which I miss'd on Sunday the 24th of March; if I say threescore, I believe I shall not tell a lie. She, at her coming, always went prodigiously ragged, with great holes in her stockings, and her shoes down at heels; and after she had been with me some little time, she was dressed out with fine fly caps, and as good things as any lady in the parish: we have an account of things to the amount of 16 l. she bought. She staid out on the 24th of March till 11 at night; I said, You keep very bad hours; She said, If you don't like it, I'll go away: She went away, and came early in the morning for her things: She had been at our house about seven weeks.

After that, on another examination, she said she did not borrow any money, but got all by whoreing in the streets, at six-pence and a shilling at a time.</p>

               <p>I am very innocent of it. The morning my mistress lost her money, she took her pocket upon her arm, with the money in it, and went to the shop. She sent the boy to look about the street for it, to see whether she had not dropped it: she came home, and said her husband had taken four guineas out of her pocket; this is not the first time he has served me so; he is an old rogue. Then she said Jemmy or Sam must have it; then she went to a neighbour, and asked if they had seen it in the streets.</p>

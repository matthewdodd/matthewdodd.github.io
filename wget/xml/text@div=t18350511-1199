                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Park-place, in the parish of All Saints, Poplar. I rent the house—I have lived there four years, and have two lodgers, named Amelia Kyne and Henry Wright—I have a kitchen in the yard adjoining the house—I can go from the house to the kitchen without going into any open place—I was in the kitchen on the night of the 10th of April, about ten o'clock—the window was down, but not fastened—there was a glass hanging on the screw which usually fastens the window—I use it for washing and shaving—I was alarmed about four o'clock by the report of a musket or pistol—I got up and came down stairs, opened the street door, and saw nothing there—I then went to the kitchen, and found the kitchen window open—I am sure I had left it shut the night before, it looks into the yard—a person must get over into the yard to get to the window—I found my shaving-glass lying on the wash<lb></lb>ing-stool in the kitchen, and my washing-basin removed from the washing-stool, and put into the yard—I missed a shirt which had hung on a horse in the wash-house, the wash-house communicates with the kitchen, with<lb></lb>out going into the yard.</p>

I occupy two rooms, and have the use of the kitchen—I saw my tea-kettle safe about eleven o'clock the night before, in the kitchen—I saw a bag of tools belonging to Henry Wright in the kitchen that night, hanging on the wall—I saw a shirt hanging on a horse in the kitchen at the same time, and Wright's drawers hung on the clothes line—I am sure the window was shut when I left the kitchen; it had not been open for two days—I missed these things next morning when the alarm was given.</p>

I heard a noise in the yard about four o'clock—the yard is between my house and Brett's—I got out of bed, and went to the window; I saw the prisoner coming over the wall—I am positive of him—he was coming as from Brett's house, over the wall between my premises and Brett's—I never saw him before—I was thirty or forty yards from him—it was light enough to distinguish a man at that distance—he had a pair of flannel</p>

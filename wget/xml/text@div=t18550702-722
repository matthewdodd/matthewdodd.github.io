                  </hi>. I am a widow. About the middle of Feb. last, I was a pauper inmate of the workhouse at Newington, and saw the prisoner there and her child—it was three months old, within a day or two, when it died—I believe its name was Mary—they were in the ward called the mothers' room; I was the nurse of that room—the mothers who had children to take, care of were in that room by themselves, I had ten of them—I had seen the deceased child in the lying-in ward before that, several times; it Was born in the workhouse—I had seen it in the lying-in ward about a fortnight before it came into the mothers' room—it was then in its mother's care, and. when it came into my room it was in the mother's care—it appeared very; bad in health then—it was under my care about five weeks—I do not know how it was when it was in the lying-in ward, but when it came to me it. was very poorly—it was continually crying and screaming—it was very thin—I saw it daily, and nearly hourly—about a week after it came to my room I spoke to the prisoner about it—it was my duty to see that the mothers attended to the children—the prisoner had nothing to do but to take care of the child, she had no labour to do—she had a very fine breast of milk—she had the means of giving plenty of nourishment to the child from the breast—I said to her, "Sturgess, your child does not look well, I will call Mr. Lowndes's attention to it"—she said she did not want any attention—I did call Mr. Lowndes's attention to it—she was in my room between a month and five weeks; she was then taken before a Magistrate, and taken to prison—she ill used the child very much—it was a complete sight from want—I constantly called her attention to it, night and day—she was allowed arrowroot and other things for the child, but she did not give it,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185507020067"></xptr>
               <p>they were supplied by the authorities of the workhouse, in order that she might feed the child properly; there was plenty for that purpose—she would not suckle the child—she did not do it, and she would not do it—she said she would not, and she did not—I heard her say so repeatedly—her breast was not at all sore, I examined it several times—she appeared to be quite well—I have seen her hit and shake the child—I do not know whether it was naturally a healthy child; I think if it had had food it would have been healthy—I did not see it shortly after it was born—Mr. Lowndes examined her breast in my presence, and told her that she had got a fine breast of milk and that she must suckle the child—she said she could not give it, and she would not give it; she said it did not want milk, she would bring it up by hand—her conduct was very bad to the child—I should say I saw her give it the breast very little indeed, and she never gave it at all the whole of the night—the child was in a very bad state when the pri<lb></lb>soner was taken away—it was taken the greatest care of by the matron and the master, before the prisoner was removed, and afterwards also—it was fed well when I had it—it lived ten days after the prisoner was removed—it had a pint of arrowroot and milk, and every attention was paid to it; it died on Saturday night, 24th March—in my opinion the child seemed to suffer from want of food and nourishment—I believe the prisoner is about twenty or twenty-one years of age.</p>

                  </hi>. I am master of the poor house at Newington. The pri<lb></lb>soner was admitted about the middle of Jan., and was confined in the house a few days after—about the middle of Feb. my attention was called to the prisoner and her child; she was then in the mother's room—the child seemed in a very delicate state—I told the prisoner that the nurse had reported to me that she refused nourishment to the child, and if she neg<lb></lb>lected it, I was in duty bound to take her before a Magistrate—she said she Hid not care, she did not wish it to live, she wished the little devil was dead—she seemed to be serious; she said it in a serious way—I desired her to feed the child, repeatedly, day after day, both myself and the matron did—</p>

               <p>food was supplied to the prisoner to feed it with—I never saw her feed it—I asked her to do so on several occasions, and she refused, and said she wished the little devil was dead—she said that more than once—I took her first before the Board of Guardians, and then before a Magistrate, and she was sent to prison on 15th March—the child was then in a very delicate state—every care was taken of it after the prisoner was removed, but it died on the 24th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at No. 7, New-street, Camden-town. I was an inmate of the Newington poorhouse for about three months, commencing about Feb.; it was while the prisoner was there—she was delivered of a child there, in the lying-in ward—I was there at that time, and saw her and the child from day to day—she was not kind to the child; she used to slap it and shake it, and <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> it on the bed—she did not attend to it when it cried; she would let it cry for two or three minutes—she appeared to have a full breast—I have spoken to her a great many times about letting it cry, and not giving it the breast—she has said, "Mind your own business, and let the little devil cry"—she afterwards moved into the mothers' room—I saw her there—her conduct to the child there was very bad; she did not give it the breast—we had to force her very much before she would do it—she used to give it the breast then; that was not very often—there was plenty of food supplied for the child—I have seen her give the child a little, and eat the rest herself—I have seen her throw the child on the bed, and say she hated the sight of it—she appeared to be serious when she said so—the child looked very bad.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you say she threw it on the bed, you mean on the bedclothes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; she threw it there for the purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">LOWNDES</hi>. I am medical officer to the poorhouse at Newington, My attention was first called to the deceased child on 14th Feb.—it was then about ten weeks old—it was healthy in appearance, but delicate—in consequence of being told that the prisoner refused to suckle it, I examined her breast, and found it copiously supplied—I then remonstrated with her upon the cruelty of withholding its natural diet from it, and also upon the consequences likely to ensue from it—she said she had no milk, but I found plenty—she took it to the breast again, and I heard no more of her until 15th March—I then examined the child—I found it grossly neglected—there was great excoriation, in consequence of its napkin not having been changed—it was then taken from its mother—it did not appear likely to live—it certainly did not appear to have been properly suckled and taken care of—I ordered it farinaceous food, arrow root, and light diet—if any<lb></lb>thing could have sustained life, they would have done so, judiciously employed, or rather, I should say, it might have prolonged its existence—it died on 24th March—I made <hi rend="italic">a post mortem</hi> examination on the 29th—the brain was perfectly healthy in structure, but ex-sanguineous, paler than</p>

               <p>usual, and there was effusion in the ventricles, or between the membranes—the lungs were perfectly healthy, but flaccid—the stomach was perfectly healthy, but there was not a particle of nutriment in it—there was a quan<lb></lb>tity of bile in the duodenum—the mucous membranes of the <hi rend="italic">ilium</hi> were congested—the larger intestines were quite empty, not a particle of faeces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you account for that, because the child had then been in the care of the parish officers for nine days? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot account for it—the kidneys were healthy—the body was quite ex-sanguineous—in my opinion, the cause of death was inanition; I should say that was of about a month's standing; it is impossible to state exactly—those appear<lb></lb>ances would not hare been so positive if the child had been properly fed from the 14th March till the 21st—I think if it had been properly taken care of for the last nine days it would not have presented those appearances—taking all the circumstances into consideration, I think want of due nourishment was the cause of death—the first cause was want of due nourishment before 15th March—if it had been properly nourished since 15th March, I think it would have been very doubtful whether death would have occurred or not—I did not think the child would have lived from the first time I saw it—if it had been properly nourished from 15th March to the 24th, I do not think it likely that it would have lived—the evil had been done on the 14th, when I remonstrated with the mother as to the neglect—it pined afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi>. Why did you first say it was doubtful whether it would have lived or not, and immediately afterwards say it was not doubtful? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My opinion is, that whatever care might have been taken of it, it would not have ultimately lived; it might have prolonged life, it would probably not have died so soon—my attention was not called to the child at all between 14th Feb. and 15th March—I passed the ward every day, and the prisoner then had the child, and therefore I heard no more about it—it wanted no medicine; all it wanted was moral management—children are not subject at that very early age to disease of the mesenteric glands; it is the case if they are of a scrofulous tendency, but here the visceras were perfectly healthy—the mesenteric glands appeared perfectly healthy—I did not see anything of a strumous habit in the child—I never examined the mother particularly—she was not subject to scrofula of the neck, or anything of that kind—I believe scrofula is an hereditary disease.</p>

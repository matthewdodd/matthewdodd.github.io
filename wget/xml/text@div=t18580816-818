                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Dagnell, a greengrocer, in Whitecross-street, Woolwich—about 11 o'clock in the morning on 28th July, I was just going into the kitchen, I turned round and stepped quickly back in the passage, when I saw, through the parlour door, the prisoner coming through the shop from the till—I went quickly into the shop, ran to the till, and found a half-crown gone—I had placed it there the moment before; there was no other money there but one sixpence and a threepenny-bit—I ran after him in the street, and when I was going to catch him, hie made a strike at my face—I told the police, and he was taken into custody in the evening and brought to my house—I know him; I have served him, several times with fruit—when he saw me close upon him in the shop, he asked me if I had any pears which he knew I had not, because there were none exposed—the till is underneath the counter, and he was coming from the till—no one had been to the till in the meantime.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When I was taken at night how could you swear it was me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I had watched you before—I had my suspicions of you—I described you so closely to the policeman; I described you by the way you wore your hair, and the dress you had on, a white blouse.</p>

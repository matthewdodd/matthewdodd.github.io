            , Constable. The Bail for Saxon told me yesterday, that the Prisoner had sent a Man from Newgate to bribe Saxon to keep out of the way - I took up the Prisoner with Justice Deveil's Warrant, and carried him to the Justice's House. The Justice not being at home, I went to fetch Saxon, and when I returned I found Major Barnwell there. He took me into the Justice's Parlor, and putting his Hand into mine, he said, Be easy, be favourable, let the Man go, and I'll give ye what ye will, and be a Friend to you as long as you live - I charg'd him with this before Mr. Justice Deveil's Face.</p>
               <p>Court to M. Barnwell. What do you say to this, Sir? You ought to know 'tis a great Offence to endeavour to screen any Person from Justice.</p>
               <p>Major Barnwell. I never intended it, but thought the Man was innocent.</p>

I went the same Day to the Prisoner's House, and found a Thief selling Lead there - The Prisoner was convicted about five Years ago for receiving a Leaden Pump that was stolen, and was to have been transported.</p>

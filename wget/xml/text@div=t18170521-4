I went to the watchman and told him; I then went up Coventry-street to see if I could find him, and he passed me with the bonnet in his hand - I gave the alarm, and he was taken. I saw my comb taken out of his pocket. I am sure he is the man. I first saw him in Coventry-street, but did not go any where with him. I did not know him before.</p>

            . I take in needle-work. On the morning of the 18th of May, I was going along, and the prosecutrix told me about the robbery, when the prisoner passed us with the bonnet covered with a handkerchief; she said he was the man immediately - I called the watchman, and took hold of his coat, but he made his escape; the watchman caught hold of him, and he got away again, leaving a piece of his coat in the watchman's hand - He was retaken before he got out of my sight.</p>
               <p>JAMES SMITHERS. I am a watchman in St. James's-street. The robbery was committed in St. Martin's parish. Between one and two o'clock in the morning, I heard the call, but did not see any person; the prosecutrix was bleeding very much at the mouth. In about twenty minutes or half an hour, I took the prisoner in Coventry-street, about thirty yards from the place where the prosecutrix spoke to me. I collared him, and saw him drop the bonnet; I took him to the watch-house. The constable took the comb out of his pocket.</p>

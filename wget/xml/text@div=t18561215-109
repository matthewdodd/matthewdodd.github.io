               <p>About 9 o'clock, on 13th Nov., I was in Oxford-street, I met the prisoner Hill there—she asked me the way to Bloomsbuiy-street—I directed her—she then wanted to know where I was going—I said I was going home—she wished me to accompany her home—I at first objected, being rather late; at last I consented, and went home with her—she took me to a house in Barley-court, Drury-lane; we went into a room there, she then went outside and called Began, who came in, shut and locked the door, and placed herself against it—she then said I should not go till I had given her some money—I told her I did not come there with any intention of giving her any money—I did not take her to be a prostitute at the time—she said she did not care for that, I should not quit the house until she had some of me—she said, "Where is Jack? fetch in Jack; he will soon make him give up his money"—she took up the poker, and threatened to beat my brains out if I did not give her all the money I had in my pocket; being frightened and alarmed at their threats, I gave them 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., all the money I had in my pocket—Began said that was not all I had, and she came and felt my pockets, and put her hand inside to see if I had not any more—when she found that I had no more, she used bad language to me, and told me to go out—I went away, and being rather late that evening, I did not interfere about it then—I went to Bow-street on the Monday evening, and spoke to the inspector, and he sent me with a policeman—we went to the same house; I found Hill there, and gave her in charge—nothing had been said about money before Hill went out and called Began in—she said nothing about money until she demanded all I had in my pocket—I refused giving her any then; I had not done so before—I did not go to the house with her for any improper purpose, I took her to be a respectable young woman; her language was very civil at first, I thought she was merely inviting me to go home with her.</p>

               <p>THOMAS LYON. I live in Old Burlington-street. I am a <rs id="t18131027-51-viclabel285" type="occupation">coachman</rs>

On the 9th of October, a quarter past twelve o'clock at night, I had been having a little beer; I had my senses about me. This happened to me nearly opposite of Newtoner's-lane, in <placeName id="t18131027-51-crimeloc286">Drury-lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18131027-51-crimeloc286" type="placeName" value="Drury-lane"></interp>

In crossing the street I hit my foot against the curb; I fell down, and my hat came off. The prisoner and another came up; the prisoner took hold of my hat when the other picked me up. I then questioned the prisoner concerning the handkerchief in my hat; he put himself in a threatening posture; the other man run away. They came up together; they were in company. I can be upon my oath when my hat fell off my head the handkerchief was in my hat. The prisoner was a stranger to me, and when the other run away I gave him in charge of the watchman. As the prisoner was going to the watchhouse he said he had not the handkerchief, and if he had his liberty he would serve me out. I have never seen the handkerchief again; it is worth five shillings; it cost me nine shillings.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was coming from the cook's shop, I saw the man laying down; his eye was cut, and his nose was bleeding. I picked up his hat. He fell down again. I gave him his hat. He said, give me the handkerchief. I said, you are a pretty one to get a man in a hobble. The man that assisted him in getting him up, ran away. He then gave me in charge of the watchman. I know nothing of the handkerchief. The prosecutor has been at my house, and offered to make it up for five shillings.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. His mother came to me at Marlborough-street office; I told his mother I did not wish to hurt a hair of his head.</p>

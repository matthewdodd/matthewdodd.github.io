I suspected that a man employed with him had robbed me, and instead of going to breakfast I watched and saw the prisoner take these eleven bars under his arm in this sack, which I know are mine; he had been but a few weeks in my service - when I took him he said he never took any before, and he would take them back again.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that one Penton, who employed him, had desired him to take the iron to the New-road, where he would meet him.</p>

I am the landlord of the Fox and Geese, Ber<lb></lb>mondsey-street—on Friday, 6th June, the prisoner came to my house, and asked my wife for some gin and tobacco—she served him—after he had gone, she showed me a florin—the prisoner was sent for, and he came back—I asked him if he knew what he had given me, and said it was a bad two-shilling piece—he said, "I did not know it was bad"—I said, "Where is the change?"—he pulled it out of his pocket, and gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the articles he bought cost 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he then took the florin up off the counter, put it into his mouth, and swallowed it, and said, "Now, what can you do with me?"—Mr. McIntosh, the inspector, was passing by at the time, and I called his attention to it—he caught hold of the prisoner by the throat, and looked into his mouth—I did not see him give the florin to my wife—she is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the head constable of the Victoria Docks, in the service of the London and St. Katharine Dock Company—I know the prisoner, he is a ship worker at the E jetty department, in the employ of the London and St. Katharine Dock Company—on 21st September I accompanied Clements to 10, Cheshire Street, Bromley, the prisoner's residence—Clements went into the house, and brought out these four skins, (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) value about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took them to my office in the docks, and next day the prisoner came to my office, and said, "I hear you want to see me about some skins"—I said, "Yes; what do you know about them?"—he said, "On Saturday last I went into Clements' office, he showed me some skins, and asked me if I would take them out of the Dock for him; I unfortunately took one of the skins under my coat, and conveyed it out of the Dock into the Marine Hotel; Clements followed me out, and came into the hotel, where I gave him up the skin, and he put it in a bundle with other skins; I afterwards went to the Sir John Franklin public-house, Poplar, and Clements came in while I was there, and offered these skins for sale; he said, 'I will sell them for half-a-crown;' he offered them publicly for sale; I said, 'Do not be pleading poverty here; here is a half-crown, and I will take the skins, and I took the skins from him"—I took the prisoner on the 20th, and he said, "This is a very bad job; Clements has drawn me into it"—I had held out no promise or threat to him—this portion of the skin was found at Clements' house, and this other portion in a cask at the Docks—this exactly corresponds—the Dock Company's regulations are in writing—I have not got them here—no one is supposed to pass out of the Docks with any article, without a pass, which is not given unless it is a proper transaction—the prisoner had no right whatever to take these goods out—he has been many years in the service of the Docks—the skills are the Company's property.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know that he has been fourteen years in the Company's service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not from my own knowledge—he has always borne a very respectable character—Clements was tried at Alford Police Court, on Saturday last, for stealing these skins, and was sentenced to two months' imprisonment—the prisoner insisted on being tried here—it is a fact that when the matter came to Seaman's knowledge he came to me first and said, "I hear you want to see me about the skins"—I went to his house, but did</p>

               <p>not go inside—Clements went inside; he was unable to tell me the number of the house or the street; but he said that be would show me, and he went with me, went in, and brought out the skins (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I held out no promise to Clements; he volunteered his services to show me the house and number—after that I took him before a Magistrate—I here known the prisoner several year; but not familiarly—I have seen him occasionally—Clements was a clerk in the Company's service.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that the prisoner made that statement on the 22nd September, and he was apprehended on 20th October; why was all that interval? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From information I received 20th September, I reported to the directors on 23rd or 24th September—I believe, they there consulted the solicitors—from information I received, I went to Clements about the skins, and he volunteered a statement, which led me to know that they were in the prisoner's house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, of 34, Manor Street, East India Road—five weeks ago last Saturday I was at work in the, docks—I went to the Sir John Franklin, to have a glass of ale—a man named Clements came in, and said that he was rather hard up, for he had spent his money on the previous evening, and he wanted some money to make up for his week's board, and he would sell the parcel which he had got for a half-crown—he had a parcel—the prisoner afterwards said that Clements was not to plead poverty there; but he would lend him a half-crown if he was hard up—Clements asked the prisoner if he would take the parcel home, and let it remain there till he called for it—the parcel was not opened at that time—there were several other persons before the bar—Clements had a little half-and-half, and the prisoner also had something to drink—I did not hear the prisoner say anything about his not wanting the parcel—he said he wanted to make something for his chest.</p>

I live at 12, Thomas Street, Bromley—I am a sea faring man—on the day this happened I was working for Seaman at the Docks—it was five weeks ago last Saturday—about 12 in the day we went to the John Franklin—I saw Clements there with a newspaper parcel under his arm—Seaman was there then—Clements said that he had spent all his money the previous evening, and he had not sufficient money to pay his mother for his week's board—Seaman said, "Don't plead poverty, I will lend you ft half-crown, and you can leave the parcel with me and call for it when you like."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You knew what was in the parcel, did not you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he showed them to me at a tavern in the East India Road, just before we got to the John Franklin—that is about a mile from the Marine Hotel—he showed me a square piece of skin that he had for his chest—it was similar to that, or larger—he did not offer to sell them to me—he offered them to time persons at the bar—he only showed them to me—I saw Mr. Seaman take the parcel in the "Sir John Franklin"—he did not say what was in it at that time.</p>

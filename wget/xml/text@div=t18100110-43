Mr. Webb is master of Wapping watchhouse; he came, I gave him into his custody. These are the shoes, the prisoner immediately threw them down when he was caught hold off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You are a shopkeeper you say; did not you serve your time to Mr. Whitnell. - A. Yes; I knew the prisoner ten years, he ordered shoes of me the Wednesday before he robbed me. He is a plaisterer.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr Webb, is not he a respectable man. - A. No doubt of it, and Mr. Whitnell is a respectable man so far as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took the prisoner in custody, he called out to these men. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do not you know that the person charged at the bar by you was the person appointed to point out Hollincrest to the bailiff. - A. No; upon my oath, I never heard it, if it had been so, he had no business to take my goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hollincrest leave the magistrates the same time as you did. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he go off home, in a boat or by land. - A. He came which way he pleased.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to tell me this moment, when I desired the short hand writer to take down your answer to my question, that you never heard of it. - A. I knew it last August.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not the man at the bar, say at the time you charged him coming to rob you; I came to point out Hollingcrest, and not to rob you of a pair of shoes. - A. I declare he never mentioned a word of a pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. I am talking about a writ; which part of the shop was Hollincrest concealed and Thompson. - A. Almost the further part of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. And about three hours, the men had been lurking about your door. - A. They had.</p>
               <p>Court. They gave you plenty of notice to be three hours about your shop. - A. Twenty pound would not excuse what I lost last year.</p>
               <p>Court. You know that is not evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did not Hollincrest tell you, that he came to your house to be protected from the bailiff. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he lodged with you. - A. He came in December some time.</p>
               <p>Q. There had been a writ out against him ever since the month of August, and it is not till December, the honest creditor is able to find him out. Who took the shoes from the prisoner. - A. He dropped them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said, that you were sorry he did not carry the shoes away. - A. I did; because if he had taken the shoes away, I thought it would be the worser for him; I have been so much robbed.</p>
               <p>Court. When men harp upon that, I always suspect them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. In the month of December, the prisoner ordered a pair of shoes of you. - A. He came to me on the Wednesday, as I was robbed on the Saturday; he said, will you make me a pair of shoes; I said, I would, he said, what will be the price; I said, half a guinea; I was to get them done by Saturday night; as he passed on the Friday night, he said, will you be sure to make my shoes again to-morrow night.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you knew him perfectly well. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did not you know the reason of his going backwards and forwards before your shop, was for the purpose of ascertaining whether that man was in your house. - A. I declare to God, I did not.</p>

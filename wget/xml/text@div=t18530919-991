                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father, as a ship broker, in the Circus, Tower-hill; we carry on business under the firm of Hall and Son. On 25th Aug. I had occasion to go to the Bank for a Bank post bill for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is the custom at the Bank to make that application by filling up a blank form given for the purpose; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) it the form that I filled up, it is for a Bank post bill for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to the order of oar firm (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Bank post bill, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to Hall and Son, Circus, Tower-hill; value received of the same. 25th Aug., 1858")—I think I made the application about half past 9 o'clock in the morning, or before 10 o'clock, at all events it was the first thing in the morning, perhaps it might have been a little after 10 o'clock—at the time I was writing out the order, there was some person near me, I cannot say who the person was, I took no particular notice of him—having filled up the form, I handed it in to the Bank post nil office, with the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked what time it would take to make out the bill—they said about a quarter of an hour; I said I could not be back so soon as that—I went away and returned in about an hour and a quarter—I was then told that the bill had been already given out; I eventually got another—I never gave any one authority to apply for this bill (<hi rend="italic">bill produced</hi>)—the endorsement here of "Hall and Son," is not the writing of our firm, nor has it been written by our authority—it was not endorsed by my father or myself; we are the only two persons in the firm, no clerk has authority to sign for the firm—this is not the bill that I got.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the cashiers of the Bank of England. I was on duty in the Bank post bill office on 25th Aug.—Mr. Hall would not apply to me for the bill, he would apply at the counter to one of the clerks, and fill up the form; the bill would be made out from that, and then it would come to me to sign—I remember a Bank post bill being brought to me to sign, I have no doubt the one produced is it; here is my signature—our usual practice is after signing it, to call out the name of the person to whom it is payable, if we see any person present—any person who answers and correctly describes the bill, receives it—I distinctly remember giving that bill to some person—I am not able to say to whom—I cannot be certain whether I called out the name of Hall and Son; when there are very few persons in the office we do not always call out the name, we lay the bill down and put a lead upon it; it is most likely that I did call out the name; some person applied for it correctly, and it was given to that person—I remember Mr. Hall afterwards coming and applying for it, I could not positively state how long that was after it was given up, probably about an hour.</p>

My father returned home on Saturday, 20th August, after being absent fox some time—we were then living at No. 39, Arbour-square, Commercial-road, Stepney—on Thursday morning, 25th August, he left home at half past 10 o'clock—I went out of the house with him—we went through the City to the news rooms in Cheap-side, for the purpose of looking at the advertisements to see if there were any situations advertised—we came straight from the news rooms to the Royal Exchange—we sat down there for a few moments, and then returned home again a little after 1 o'clock, I think; and in the evening we went out for a short walk—on the next day, Friday, we went out about the same time, and proceeded up to the news rooms in Cheapside as we had done the day before—I do not know exactly how long we stayed there, but we returned to the Royal Exchange at half past 12 o'clock—we sat down there for a few moments, and my father and I thought of whom we could borrow some money—after thinking for some time, he thought of some person in Threadneedle-street, I think he said, and asked me to go with him; I declined, and said I would rather wait in the Royal Exchange till he came back—he then went out—I should think it was not more than five minutes; I am certain it was not more than ten before he returned to me in the Royal Exchange, with the bill open in his hand—there was some mud on the bill; it looked as if it had been trodden upon, as it was folded, and he was wiping it off with his pocket handkerchief.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We understand that your father lived in Church-street, Soho, with two women of the name of Taylor, mother and daughter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe so; my mother lived in Arbour-square—it was on Friday, 26th Aug., that I declined to go with my father, and sat down in the Royal Exchange; I am quite certain of that—he wanted me to go with him to see a friend of his, to borrow some money of; I do not know who his friend was—we sat down to think who he should borrow money of, and it came into his head, not into mine; that was about half past 12 o'clock—I do not recollect telling Webb, the officer, that it was 10 o'clock when my father left me—I do not recollect such a thing—I cannot say whether I did or not; it was on a Wednesday evening that he came to see mamma and me—I do not know whether I told him that it was 10 o'clock on the Friday when my father left me; I should not think I did, I do not recollect—I did not tell him that my father went away from me at 10 o'clock on 26th Aug., I do not think I did; I will not swear I did not—my father came back to me while I was sitting in the Royal Exchange—he had a piece of paper in his hand, which he was wiping the dirt from; 1 do not know what it was—I looked at</p>

               <p>at the paper, certainly; I did not read it—I looked on both tides of it, I merely glanced at it—I do not know what time it was when he brought the bill back, I only know the time we went into the Royal Exchange was half past 12 o'clock—I should think it was near 1 o'clock when he came back—he was not gone half an hour—I do not recollect telling the officer that this occurred at 10 o'clock in the morning—I do not think I did, because I recollect the time so well; I must have been very agitated if I did—we sat down in the Royal Exchange at half past 12 o'clock—we were thinking; I named several persons, to see whether my father could borrow some money of them, and he said no, no; they would not do—when my father left me, he went out at the left hand side, as you stand looking towards the front of the Queen's statue—that would lead to the Bank—when he came back he said, "Look here, what I have found!"—I said, "Where did you find it?" and he said, "If you come with me, I will show you"—I went out with him, and we went to Capel-court; I do not know whether that is the entrance to the Stock Exchange—he pointed down to the side of a scaffold-pole there, that was lying oil the ground where there was some building going on, and said, "That was where I found it; it was just underneath that scaffold-pole"—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>) this is my father's handwriting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say when he came in he said "Look what I have found," but you did not read it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not read it—my father told me in the evening that it was a Bank-post bill—that was when we were out for a walk in the evening; he did not tell me at the time—I think we got home about 3 o'clock that afternoon—I did not then know what the paper was, not till the evening.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Too saw sufficient of the paper to see that there was a name already on the back? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw there was a name on the back of it, as you were wiping the dirt off with your handkerchief—I saw there was a name written on the back, at the top of the bill, on the side where the printing was.</p>

                  </hi>. I have known the prisoner many years, and have received many communications from him in writing—I should positively know his handwriting, as far as my judgment would go—I have done business with him; (<hi rend="italic">looking at the bill</hi>), I should positively swear that the name of "Hall and Son," on the back of this bill, was not his writing, according to the best of my belief, and I will give my reasons; on looking at the "George Thompson, Guildford, Surrey," I find an "S" which is exactly like his; it is the S" in "Surrey;" I believe that to be his—I do not think the "S" in "Son" is like his; I see not the slightest likeness whatever to his handwriting there—I saw him sign his name only a short time ago—I saw him write lately at my house—I have known him eight years; for the greatest portion of that time he filled a very important situation in a most respectable firm at Bermondsey, but from some differences which arose between his wife and himself, there was an alienation—I have had the highest opinion of his honesty and have now; his character for honesty was exceedingly good—latterly he has been in very extreme poverty—from the high opinion I had formed of him, I have advanced him sums of money from time to time—some short time ago I knew him to be in the lowest state of poverty, so much so as to be glad of a few pence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where was he living at that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He gave me his address, "No. 13, Church-street, Soho"—I was never there—I am an</p>

               <p>auctioneer—he is in my debt now, not many pounds, it is for money that I have advanced to him—I formed a very high opinion of him—I do not know how be came to leave Mr. Ross, of Bermondsey—that was the employment that I referred to—I do not know that he left that service, having embezzled 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have heard it within this day or two, from his own family—I have been in communication with his wife—the next employment I found him in, after leaving Mr. Ross, was making razor strops, he came to me to borrow money to carry out the project—I never was at the house in Arbour-square—I was never at any house where he lived, except the one at Bermondsey, when he was at Ross's—I did not know anything of his acquaintances; I formed my opinion of his honesty from his filling an important situation; until Mr. Ross died, I had no other means—Mr. Ross died about two years ago—I cannot say that I see any similarity in the writing of this "Hall and Son," and "Geo. Thompson"—they appear to me to be entirely different; the "H" of the "Hall" appears to have been written over two or three times, it appears to have been written with very bad ink—the "Geo. Thompson" is written in blue ink, and thick—I consider the two names differ as much as two hands from different persons will differ—I should not like to form any opinion upon the flourish, it is altogether different from his—I never taw the bill before.</p>

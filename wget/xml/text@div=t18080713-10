               <p>Q. On the 26th of May was there a sale in Mr. Eddis's rooms - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the articles was there a watch with a chain and seal - A. There was, in a place that was partitioned off.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they afterwards produced - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. I do, he was in that quarter of the room where these articles were; I missed them on the day of the sale, about three quarters of an hour after I saw the prisoner in the room. About ten days after the loss of these goods, I went to Newgate street to pay an account; on my way to Newgate street I called in at Mr. Abbott's who were selling off their China; immediately on my entering the room, I saw the prisoner Fazakerly, I accosted him with how do you do; on my going into the room he was coming out, so that we soon met each other, I the moment I entered the room, saw the seals, I kept my eye on the two seals that I saw suspended to a watch chain; on my going near him to identify these seals; I observed him put them under his waistcoat. I immediately made a snatch at them, observing that he had some pretty seals there; upon my seizing the seals the prisoner said something, but however what was said by him was unintelligible; he made his way to the door quickly, I following of him; when he got into Fleet street (this house is the corner of Bride's passage); he attempted to make the best of his way, he was just upon the point of running, I seized him by the collar, he asked me if I meaned to tear his shirt, I told him no, but he must go along with me; he said he only meaned to go the back way; I entwined my arms around him, and he walked peaceable with me to the Strand, towards where the property was taken from, to Mr. Eddis's; Mr. Eddis being out I sent for him, upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180807130011"></xptr>on Mr. Eddis's return he came into the parlour where the prisoner and I were; I then delivered to Mr. Eddis the two seals and part of the chain that I snatched from the prisoner; when I snatched at them they came off the chain being very slight. Mr. Eddis then said where is the watch sir; he pulled it out of his pocket, together with the remainder of the chain; Mr. Eddis then said where is the gold neck chain besides; the prisoner pulled out a pocket book and produced the duplicate of a chain. He was then taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I observe, Mr. Smith, at the time you saw the prisoner, after you saw him at your rooms, ten days had elapsed - A. I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. So his possession of this property was after he had been ten days in your room - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your's is a public room and of course open to any body - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there many persons there that day - A. No; very few; there was none of the plate dealers there that day.</p>
               <p>Q. My purpose is answered if there were other persons there; how many persons were there - A. I will say to the amount of eight persons where this watch was deposited.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you missed the articles had you taken an account of the things in the sale room - They were all there about an hour and half before the plate sale; the plate sale does not commence immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Then for what you know there may have been twenty people passing and repassing in that room; it any person had been so disposed as to take them they might; it was an open room for any body - A. I should not have let a chimney sweeper or a dustman in there: we admit none in that room but persons of genteel appearance, Mr. Fazakerly is a of a very respectable appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before had you taken stock - A. I believe that does not apply to sales every morning; an hour and a half before the sale commences we call over the sale; this was a metal watch, lot one; we had it two clear days in our possession; I know of the watch coming to us; I know it was in our sale room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has Mr. Eddis had this sale room in the Strand - A. About two years. I am a clerk to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not partner to him - A. I am not.</p>

               <p>Q. Relate to his lordship and the jury what brought you to your house - A. I was sent for; I was introduced into the parlour; I asked the prisoner what he had done with the watch; he produced it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that watch sent to you for sale - A. It was, by Mr. Patmore on Ludgate hill; I then enquired what he had done with the gold neck chain; he told me he pawned it at Mr. Milton's, Westminster road; he produced me the duplicate and supplicated for mercy.</p>
               <p>Q. The watch having been lost I believe you paid for it - A. I paid two pound seven shillings; the duplicate of the gold neck chain I have in my pocket book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Do you know whether it is an unredeemed pledge - A. I should presum not.</p>
               <p>Q. Unredeemed pledges, I believe, when the time is out. then they are to be sold - A. They are compelled to sell them.</p>
               <p>Q. These pledges when they get into your hands they are to fetch what they can, and according to the sale and the quantity of bidders they are sold. - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore this article when it came to the hammer it might not have fetched more than thirty eight shillings - A. I will save you a great deal of trouble; it was not to be sold under two pound ten shillings; I as agent am to take my commission out of it.</p>

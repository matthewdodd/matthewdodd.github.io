                  </hi>. I live with my father and mother, in Munster-street—I have three brothers, one named Arthur, who is older than me. One Sunday morning, about eight o'clock, when Arthur was in bed, my brother Edwin and I wanted to take out two dogs which we have—one of them would not go out with him—the prisoner, who is my father, was in the room—he took a broom-stick to poke the dog out—it threatened to fly at him, and bit the broom—Arthur then kept the dog back, and said it should not go out, it was his dog—after breakfast my father was reading the paper—Arthur interrupted him and my father told him to be quiet—Arthur said he bad a right to talk, that was amusing himself with reading the paper, and he was amusing himself he with talking—my mother begged my brother to be quiet, and then my father took up the poker to him, and said he would make him be quiet—my brother then took up the tongs—my mother said, "For God's sake, put down unlawful things, there will be mischief done"—my father then put down the poker, and my brother put down the tongs—my father said he would not do a bit of work till that dog was got rid of—he then punched his fist on the table, and broke a piece off it—my mother then said to my father, "Well, you need nol to have broken my poor father's table"—my father then took up the piece of table and smashed it all up—there were two pots on the table—they fell off—my mother said, "Now you have broken my father's table, I will break your pots"—she kicked one, and broke it—Arthur broke the other pot, and said he—would do that much towards it—after my father broke the table, Arthur struck him with his fist, and knocked some of his teeth out—after that Arthur went out to buy a cap (the shops are open in Tottenham-court-road)—he came home again, and we were at dinner—my mother offered Arthur some dinner—he said, "No, I have had some"—my father said, "Don't give it him, eat it yourself"—soon after that Arthur went out again—he re<lb></lb>turned in about an hour and a half, and laid down on a chair to sleep, and slept till about six o'clock at night—we had then had our tea—my mother sent</p>

               <p>me and Edwin to John-street, Golden-square—we were gone about an hour and a half altogether, and took Arthur's dog with us—when we came home we did not go up stairs directly—as we were going up the stairs, I heard a cry of "Oh!" and when I looked into the room I saw my father beating Arthur with the fire-shovel—he hit him on the face—Arthur was lying back in the chair at the time—he apparently had just awoke up—the dog had come into the room with us, and flew at my father—I and Edwin went down stairs, and fetched the policeman.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 14th of January, I was at the station near Munster-street—about half-past nine o'clock the witness and another came, and, in consequence of what they said, I went to No. 3, Munster-street, went up stairs, and found Arthur on the landing, bleeding from his head—I looked for the prisoner, and found him in the back kitchen down stairs, took him in charge, and told him he had ill—used the boy—he said, "I am the man that has done it"—he said nothing more then—as I was taking him to the station, he said, "He has aggravated me all day, and I mean to pay him for it"—at the station he said he was very sorry for what he had done.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at University Hospital—the boy Arthur was brought there on Sunday evening the 14th Jan., at near eleven o'clock—he had four wounds on the scalp, varying from an inch and a half to three inches long, two of them one above each other, over both eyes, the skull was fractured; there was a fissure; the scalp was torn from the skull; over the right eye the covering of the bone, the peritoneum was removed; his nose was very much injured, there being a large cut extending from one cheek to the other, across the nose; the two nasal bones forming the prominence of the nose were broken in pieces, and the two processes of the superior maxillary bones were both bare; the six front teeth of the lower jaw were entirely broken off level with the gum; the tongue had a triangular wound, and there were several smaller wounds about the face; he appeared to have bled very much, and was quite in a collapsed state when he came in—I ordered him to bed—he rallied, and I dressed the wounds—none of the wounds were dangerous in themselves, but from the effect that might follow I supposed him to be in great danger.</p>

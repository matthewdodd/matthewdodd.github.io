                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at the Waterside, Wandsworth—about a quarter to 4, on the afternoon of the 22d November, I saw the prisoners and the deceased coming towards the Waterside, all very drunk—the two men began fighting; they had three rounds, and the deceased picked up the prisoner Smith, and said, "George, I will have no more; I will give in to you"—the deceased then said to Gee, "I will fight you; you are rather too fast"—Gee jumped over the fence and paid, "We will fight in this field"—the deceased said, "I will not fight in that place; come down to the open, and I will fight you there, at the beer-shop"—they went there and fought five rounds—the deceased fell four times on the back of his head—they struck each other as well as they could—Gee. fell to the ground—the last time the deceased fell, he fell right backwards on the back of his head, and somehow or other his legs went up—Gee had not hold of him—he fell at the side of him, but not on him—Smith picked the deceased up—that round was the one before the last—Smith said to the deceased, "Will you have any more? you had better have another"—the deceased said, "I will fight when I am sober"—Smith then got him up on his legs, and they went at it again—it was after that statement that Smith said, "Go on, you had better have one more"—they only went on to the fifth round; they then both fell on the ground—I saw the deceased fall when Smith was lifting him up—he fell back on the ground, and touched the back part of his head.</p>

               <p>I beard a noise, stepped into the middle of the road, and saw the prisoners and the deceased—I saw one of them fall against the palings—I stepped back into my house, and they came quarrelling down by my door—they wanted to come into my house, but I would not allow it—Gee and the de<lb></lb>ceased stripped and began to fight in front of ray house—one of them said, Have another round—I believe that was Gee—I think that was said in the third round—they had another—the deceased was in another man's arms—a baker was holding him up—he came down and wished them to be quiet, and not to fight—Smith picked Gee up the first three rounds, and seconded him—the deceased's name was Smith also—I picked him up the last time, and tried to hold him—he fell the last time in retreating from Gee—Smith acted as the deceased's second during the early part of the fight—Gee did not wish to have a second; he pushed him on one side—they were both drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—on 22d November, about half-past 5 o'clock, I examined the deceased—he was in a complete state of insensibility—the surface of his body was cold—his pupils were widely dilated, and blood was oozing from his nostrils and mouth—he died afterwards from the compression of the brain; that was the result of a fall.</p>

The prisoner at the bar and three or four more women met with me, and haul'd me into a passage. They took a handkerchief from my neck, and three golden guineas and eight shillings from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner take any thing from you?</p>
               <p>West. She took my handkerchief from my neck.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did they haul you?</p>
               <p>West. They took me by the arms; one took hold of my right arm, and the other of my left, and so hauled me into the alley.</p>

               <p>Q. Which pocket was your money in?</p>
               <p>West. It was in my left coat pocket, in a paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when they took hold of you?</p>
               <p>West. I was coming up Chick-Lane; and they took hold on me, and invited me into that place, and threatened what they would do to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How invited you?</p>
               <p>West. They took hold of me; one of one arm, and the other by the other, and ask'd me to go in.</p>
               <p>Q. Invited you in, where?</p>
               <p>West. I was ask'd to go up the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ask'd to go into a house?</p>
               <p>West. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go willingly with them?</p>
               <p>West. I went along with them as they pull'd me along, according to their directions,</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with a free good-will.</p>
               <p>West. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not try to get away from them?</p>
               <p>West. I have not the proper use of my arms as another man has. I tried to get away from them as well as I could; but could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out?</p>
               <p>West. I was afraid to call out.</p>
               <p>Q. Why?</p>
               <p>West. Because I was got into such an ugly place.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you going?</p>
               <p>West. Home, from Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>West. I live in Bridgwater-Gardens.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>West. This was the 15th of January, about eight at night; and as soon as I was in this bye place, they began to rifle me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner take your handkerchief by force?</p>
               <p>West. It was loosely tied.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she use any threatening words to you?</p>
               <p>West. I can't say there were any great railmenting, only d - ning and swearing to one another, but not to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they demand any money of you?</p>
               <p>West. They did not ask for any money; but they took it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had your money in your pocket at the time?</p>

               <p>West. I can't say I had drank nothing. I had drank part of a pint or two of beer, with a person that belong'd to the same regiment that I did, that is in the college.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know you was rob'd at the time you lost your money?</p>
               <p>West. After losing my handkerchief from my neck, I put my hand into my pocket, and found my money was gone; but I did not care to cry out in that narrow place.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be in that place with them?</p>
               <p>West. I believe I might be there with them about half an hour, from first to last. I can't limitate the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you doing all that time?</p>
               <p>West. Pulling and hauling. I can't give an account, I was so frustrated.</p>

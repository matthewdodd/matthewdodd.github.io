             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Clement, a pawnbroker; I produce the gown pawned by the prisoner on the 12th of January.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the prisoner in your shop before? - A.Frequently; I know her perfectly(produces the gown); I gave her a duplicate.</p>
               <p>Drisdale. That is my gown which I lost from the bed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. She lent me the gown to pledge, and not being able to redeem it according to my promise, she took me up; she told the pawnbroker she sent me with it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hancock.) When you me the prosecutrix did she charge the prisoner with stealing the gown? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Nelson. Mrs. Drisdale came to me, and asked me if her gown was pledged with Mr. Clement; I said I would send the boy up to see; she said she had sent this woman with it, and had received 8s. but not the duplicate of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You are perfectly sure she said that? - A. Yes; she asked for it as pledged for 8s. I searched the day-book, and found it was pledged for 10s. the boy went up, and brought it down, and delivered it to her.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Drisdale.) You said you learned by information where this gown was pawned? - A. Yes, Mrs. Shirley told me she supposed it was pawned at Mr. Clement's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the pawnbroker that you sent the prisoner with the gown? - A. I did, because Mrs. Shirley said, I had better say I sent it, or else they would not produce the gown, being a stolen article.</p>
               <p>Q. You insist upon all you have originally sworn, that you lost it in the way described. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. When did the woman come first? - A. On the Monday, that was the first time I saw her; she slept with me that night.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find the gown? - A. About a fortnight after she robbed me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came she to sleep with you?- A. There was but one bed in the room; she came on a visit to the woman I lodge with; we all three slept together; she rented the room I slept in; I had lodged with her only from the Sunday night.</p>

               <p>Jury. Q. Is Mrs. Shirley here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to any other pawnbroker's to enquire after the gown? - A. I went to a great many besides, and did not find it.</p>

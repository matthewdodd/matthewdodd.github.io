On the 26th of September, near two in the morning, I was waked by a pistol going off in the alley (I live at the corner of White-cross-alley); I lie backwards up one pair of stairs; I got up to see what was the matter; they began beating at my door violently; there were a number of people; they broke in; I heard one man's voice very plain in the entry; he is not taken; his name is

            ; he is gone off; they broke the warehouse door, and got in there.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner was the outward door broke?</p>
               <p>Cromwell. They had forced the door so that the lock had flew down the entry about eight yards, where I found it with the key in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed over night?</p>
               <p>Cromwell. I went to bed about eleven o'clock. The door was then locked and bolted with two bolts. When they broke in I heard the door fly open, and I heard something fall in the entry at the time, which, I believe, was the lock. Then I heard them beating against the warehouse door, which fell down I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of your house is your warehouse door?</p>
               <p>Cromwell. That is about a yard, or a yard and a half within the street door, on the right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had that been fastened over night?</p>
               <p>Cromwell. I had fastened that, and had the key in my pocket; in a few minutes after they were gone I went down, and went into the warehouse, and found it cleared of every thing partly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go into any other room?</p>
               <p>Cromwell. I believe they did not. I did not find any body had been in the parlour; the door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss?</p>
               <p>Cromwell. I missed a parcel of raw silk; I believe about fifteen pounds weight of different sorts.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that?</p>
               <p>Cromwell. The value about twenty-five or twenty-six pounds. I missed some dyed silk, about ten or fifteen pounds weight, worth about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060047"></xptr> twenty shillings a pound. I missed some silk triming; there might be about two or three hundred yards of it; the value about twopence or three pence a yard. I missed some black and scarlet gimp, about two or three hundred yards of that, the value about twopence or three-pence a yard.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen these goods before?</p>
               <p>Cromwell. I had seen them over night; as for the trimmings I had made them up for an order, and left them on the counter in the warehouse over night.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you quit the warehouse over night?</p>
               <p>Cromwell. About ten o'clock; the dyed silk was in a glass case, which they broke down, and the raw silk was hanging on a peg.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of the men?</p>
               <p>Cromwell. No, I did not. I was afraid they would have come up, but they did not. When I went down I found my street door broke all to pieces, and the warehouse door lying along in the entry; the bolts remained on the door but the staples were flown out.</p>
               <p>Q. What number do you think there were of them?</p>
               <p>Cromwell. I can't tell what number.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any other persons go with you?</p>
               <p>Haines. Yes, there might be about eight or nine of us; we all went upon that agreement. It was about twelve at night when we went there; some had cutlasses, some had pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. What had the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Haines. I can't be positive whether he had any thing in his hand or not; we broke open the door of the house, and broke the door of the warehouse, and went into the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did all go into the warehouse?</p>
               <p>Haines. I cannot be positive who went into the warehouse, because it was all dark; there might be three or four in; we all cut and destroyed some lace and trimmings; we took some raw silk away; I can't justly say what quantity; some to make trimmings of.</p>
               <p>Q. How much raw silk?</p>
               <p>Haines. There might be five or six pounds weight of it.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon did you meet with the prisoner after you went from the house?</p>
               <p>Haines. I saw him in the value of ten minutes after.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts were you when you first saw him after?</p>
               <p>Haines. We were got a little beyond the watch-house; then we joined the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was that to the place where you left him when you went into the house?</p>
               <p>Haines. It may be about thirty or forty yards from the house, much about the place where we left him when we went up to the door, there was not a great deal of odds in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a light or dark night?</p>
               <p>Haines. It was a very dark night, there was a lamp by the watch-house, and another over Cromwell's door.</p>

I thought they were going to another weaver on the right hand. I was not terrified, because I never suspected their coming.

When they drawed nearer the house then I was rather afraid; by drawing nearer, and crying out, for I heard the prisoner's tongue, Blast you, fire! Fire blast you, fire!

            . I can't say how near; I heard his voice very plain.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is the watchman's stand to the house?</p>
               <p>Haines. It is about twenty yards from the house. The prisoner was at some distance from the house. It was towards the watch-house that I heard his voice. I have served the prisoner silk, out of Mr. Cromwell's warehouse, several times. I have known him about three years; he was a workman to Mr. Cromwell, and often came to his shop. Sometimes I have seen him come there two or three times a week: sometimes every day. I heard them strike with great violence against the outward door. They first struck at the parlour window, but there is a crossbar in the inside shutter, and they could not get in there. I heard every beat from first to last. The blows were like as if with a sledge-hammer. In about three blows they struck off the lock from the door, it flew to the stair foot; then it appeared to me they struck four or five blows before the bolts came off; then they fired into the passage as soon as the door was burst open; then I heard them chop at the warehouse door; it appeared as if they were chopping, and it looked afterwards as if they had chopped. I heard them huzza, and Carmichael cry, Blast you! fire, when in the house: The sash windows in the warehouse were all smash'd; that I suppose they did,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060049"></xptr> at the time they were taking the goods out; the firing was without side after; there were some within, they fired at the gentlewoman's window that lodges in the next room to me. There are four rooms on a floor. There were bits contanings picked up in that room, that were fired in.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pistols were fired while they were in the house?</p>
               <p>Whiffen. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there three times?</p>
               <p>Whiffen. I should think three times half a dozen. There was some glass out of which they took the dyed silk; that glass was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. How came you to tell me you was sorry for me, after I had been at Sir John Fielding's, and was cleared?</p>
               <p>Whiffen. I spoke less than I knew by a great deal. After the prisoner was acquitted before Sir John, he came by Mr. Cromwell's house. I went to the door; he nodded his head to me and I to him. He said, Ah, here I am, blast you! and pointed his finger. Said I, You are a cruel fellow, how could you say I tried to s cragg you? Said I, I really could have done it, but I kept away, you good for nothing scoundrel; the voice I heard that presented a pistol, and said sit still, or stand still/, or you are a dead man, by G - d. I knew that voice. He said before the justice, I am a poor distressed fellow. I said I am sorry for you, you have distressed yourself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever work for Mr. Cromwell after he was acquitted?</p>
               <p>Whiffen. He came for work the next day, and I said, how can you come to ask for work? you see the man is ruined by a pack of rascals: he said, Do you mean me; madam? Then he turned about to the rest of the folks and said, G - d d - n them, What cruelty is here! How they have broke the door! I believe he did not work for Mr. Cromwell after this, for there was nothing to serve him with.</p>

            . I am a watchman, my stand was near Mr. Cromwell's house in Moorfields. I remember his house was broke open about three months or eleven weeks ago; they came between one and two in the night, near one; as near as I can guess there might be sixteen or eighteen of them. I had cried past one. A gentleman came to the watch-house for a light over the fields; I went to light him over the fields. There were two men ran over the fields' crying, Lord have mercy upon me! I said to the Gentleman, let us go back. They shut the watch-house door. I was out, and could not get in.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is that watch house from Mr. Cromwell's door?</p>
               <p>Tarrant. It is about forty yards. A man sat down by my right side, and pulled my hat over my eyes, and there he held me all the time. I did not see any of their faces, neither did I know either of their tongues. The gentleman that was going over the fields got into the watch-house, but I could not. This man that sat down by me was one of the sixteen or eighteen.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he continue holding your hat over your eyes?</p>
               <p>Tarrant. About ten or twelve minutes; they fired away over my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the noise of breaking?</p>
               <p>Tarrant. No, I did not; after that they opened the watch-house door and let me in; then one of the men said, do you stand at the door? we do not want to hurt none of you. Who they were I do not know. One of them said, D - n your eyes, we do not want to hurt you! he bid me stand at the door, and keep it shut, that is the watch-house door; they fired through the watch-house window, there is the mark it made now. When they went away I lighted the gentleman over the fields; after that I went with my light to Mr. Cromwell's house, and found it as they say. I do not know that ever I saw the prisoner before I saw him at Justice Fielding's in my life.</p>

               <p>Hickey. I believe it is about an hundred yards distance. I believe it is either eleven or twelve weeks ago this night I was in the watch-house. They would not admit us out; they kept firing upon us. There were our watchmen in the watch-house, and we dare not come out; there was only one man spoke; he blasted our eyes, and d - d, and bid us put our lights out; we put out our lights; there was nothing but blasting and swearing, and such like as that.</p>

               <p>Cromwell. I received information by Haines that the goods were carried to Baker's in Hoxton. I found some silk at Baker's, a damask silk, which I know to be mine; and is what I had in my own house over night. It is a dyed silk.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the robbery was it that you found it?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060051"></xptr>Cromwell. I never heard her declare that within these three weeks; I believe she had rather he should be cleared.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to think he was guilty?</p>
               <p>Cromwell. Because he was always among these people in this club; I was in search of him and had a warrant against him, and he went off the next morning. I never spoke a word to Ward as he has mentioned. I told him Mr. Fielding had cleared him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell him you had one in your house that heard his voice if that would be sufficient?</p>
               <p>Cromwell. Upon my oath I never said any such thing to him.</p>

            , about a month ago. I believe he might be about a month in custody when he was discharged. I did not know any thing what Mrs. Whiffen could say.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to speak of it?</p>
               <p>Cromwell. The prisoner came and bred a riot about the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was examined six times before Sir

               <p>Q. to Whiffen. When was the first you declared to any body that you knew his voice?</p>
               <p>Whiffen. That was about three weeks or a month ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it as you did know his voice, that you did not speak of it before?</p>
               <p>Whiffen. Because he abused me, and told me I had a mind to scragg him; then I said you are a cruel man, If I had a mind to have done it I could have done it; he had not injured my property, and I did not mention it before.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he committed for?</p>
               <p>Whiffen. He was committed for assaulting and abusing me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you tell the justice of the peace that he was one of the persons in this riot?</p>
               <p>Whiffen. That was just after he had assaulted me. I told the justice of it at the time he assaulted me, so that he was committed for the assault and this at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Which did you complain of first?</p>
               <p>Whiffen. I went and took out the warrant for the assault; I declared before his face, that I knew his voice, and saw him with a pistol and cutlass in his hand; I saw them all. I think I distinguished his face. I said before the justice I saw him hold a pistol, or small gun to a watchman. I got a fight of his face before the lamp was broke; they put their faces up as if going to strike at the lamp; I think I saw the prisoner in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to say so now?</p>
               <p>Whiffen. I thought I was not obliged to answer particularly to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make the complaint for an assault before you laid the information?</p>
               <p>Whiffen. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the complaint for an assault, and information made the same day, and at the same time?</p>
               <p>Whiffen. I had the warrant served; and before the justice I said you are a cruel fellow to use me so; and after that I said I knew his face.</p>
               <p>Justice Wilmot. This woman and Mr. Cromwell came on a Saturday evening. I was told a man had threatened their lives; the woman was afraid to go home; upon that I issued out a warrant: this was the Saturday before the information. I think on the Monday they brought the prisoner to the Rotation. Upon her examination she said, he threatened to beat her brains out. I asked him if he had any bail to answer that. She said to him I never thought to appear against you, but if I had appeared at Sir

               <p>Justice Wilmot. She said she knew it was the man that she saw at a distance; and that he held a watchman's hat, as she believed, with one hand over his eyes, and had a pistol. As he had been discharged before Sir

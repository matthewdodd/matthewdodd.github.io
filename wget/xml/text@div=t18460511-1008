                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Having heard a description of the facts which occurred on Battersea-bridge about an hour before you saw the prisoner, in your judg<lb></lb>ment, with the experience you have had of persons in such situations, is it your opinion that at the time she did these acts, by which the child met its death, her mind was unsound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Decidedly, I should say—if she had been I describing something to have happened to her which had not in fact happened at all, such a description would be a symptom of a deranged intellect—from what I have heard her allege to have happened, and what she herself afterwards did, and from the state in which I found her, I should say decidedly her mind was in a state of aberration an hour before—I draw that conclusion from the state of her pulse, which was 100 above the general standard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose a person to commit a great crime, and was in a great fright? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My lord she did not appear in a fright—she was calm—I speak from the state of her pulse, and the eye, which is not capable of being governed by the will—I had, unperceived by her, noticed her, and there was that which is characteristically indicative of aberration, what is termed a mowing of the mouth, and a bragging of the lips, as if in internal communion—the tremu<lb></lb>lous motion of the tongue is characteristic of mental aberration.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you able to see anything more? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was congestion of the brain in consequence of an increased action of the pulse—in my judgment that would assist to deprive her of consciousness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Like a man in a sleep? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—not properly speaking a perversion of the understanding, but like a man in delirium jumping out of a window for instance—a state of delirium from fever—there would be no pre<lb></lb>vious appearance of perversion of intellect, but like a person cutting his throat in a paroxysm of fever—not that the mind is wrong, but like a person with<lb></lb>out a mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do all the circumstances you have heard detailed confirm in your judgment that was the nature of the disorder? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They do—I am decidedly of that opinion—this is a character of madness which may come on on a sudden, and equally rapidly subside—mental causes produce physical effects, which may subside after the cause has subsided—she was not aware that I was looking at her—I appeared to be talking to the inspector, and observed her unknown to herself—I saw her again at the police-office, on the Wednesday—she appeared then in <hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi>, more distressed—I did not speak to her—I at that time most decidedly thought her mind deranged—similated madness is very easily distinguished by the faculty, the symptoms are too well known—there was no reason to suppose that on Wednesday, there was any opportunity of deceiving me by any simulation—there was not the slightest reason to believe there was not mental derangement.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The contents of the letter appear addressed to the husband, and the letter itself addressed to a relative, would that in any degree interfere with your conclusion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the contrary, it will assist it.</p>

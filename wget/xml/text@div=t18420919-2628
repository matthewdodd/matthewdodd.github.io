                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Thomas Acocks, a cheese<lb></lb>monger—Broad was his wagoner, and Mills his porter—I ordered Broad to take some articles in his cart, on the 17th of September—I received infor<lb></lb>mation, and went to the policeman—I. desired him to watch—I saw the policeman take a bag out of the cart, which had a bulky appearance—I have examined the cheese produced—I believe it to be my master's—I did not authorise Mills to take any cheese that day.</p>

I am the son of Thomas Acocks—I did not authorise either of the prisoners to take any cheese that day—our book is here—I followed Broad, accompanied by an officer—when we got to Water-lane I saw the cheese openly in the cart—Broad went on to two or three other places, and then the cheese was not where it had been before—I asked him what he had done with the cheese he had in his cart—he said, "You will find it in the <hi rend="italic">flat</hi> or in the cart"—the officer then went up and took out this cheese, which was in a bag—it is my father's cheese—neither of the prisoners had any right to take it.</p>

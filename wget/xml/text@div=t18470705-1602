               <p>about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner Hooker came for a penny-worth of cheese, and put down a shilling—I looked at it, and said it was a bad one—he said he took it of his master for some hay-making—I weighed it, found it was bad, and laid it down to him again—I said, "I am afraid you knew it was bad"—he said he had no other money—I said, "I think I ought not to give it you back"—he went out of the shop, in a direction towards London—I looked out after him.</p>

I am stationed at Enfield—on the 25th of June, in consequence of a communication made to me, I watched the two prisoners, between three and four o'clock, they passed my door together, in conversation, in a direction towards London—they went to the next door but two, to a little chandler's shop kept by Mrs. Chadwick—they waited outside, in conversation, about five minutes—Vine then went into the shop—Hooker crossed the road, and waited on the opposite side—Vine came out of the shop in about five minutes, and Hooker crossed the road and joined him—they went on towards London, to a shop kept by Byatt—I did not see Hooker go into that shop, but I took Vine, who was standing ten or twelve yards past the shop, and took him into Byatt's—Hayes went into Byatt's, and took Hooker—on my proceeding to search Vine he dropped this bad shilling from his right hand—I found this other bad shilling in his left hand waistcoat pocket—we went together to the station—as we were going, Vine said it was the first time he ever was in a job of the kind, and he would take care it should be the last—I had not said anything to induce him to say that.</p>

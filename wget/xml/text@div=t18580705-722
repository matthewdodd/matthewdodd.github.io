                  </hi>. I keep the Windmill, in Wyndham road, Cam<lb></lb>berwell. On the 28th June, I was there, and saw the prisoners enter together, about half past 10 o'clock at night, and Jones, who now gives the name of Nunn, asked for a half quartern of gin; I served him, and he gave me a crown; I gave him a half crown, two shillings, and fourpence in coppers; he put the change in his pocket—Warren was with him—Jones then said, "You seem very short of t sixpences, will you give me two sixpences for a shilling?" I did not look at it, but gave him two sixpences, and put the shilling in the till; he and Warren then left together—I am perfectly sure that the change I gave Jones was good, because I took it out of some parti<lb></lb>cular silver—the prisoners returned in about five minutes; they came in together, and Jones asked me for a pint of porter; he gave me in payment a good half crown—I gave him two shillings, and fourpence in copper—they drank about one-third of the beer, and then he said, "You seem very short of sixpences, give me two more sixpences"—I saw him looking at the money in his hand; he gave me a shilling, and, having my suspicions, I tried it, and it was bad—when I found it was bad, I went to the till, and found another bad shil<lb></lb>ling (there were other shillings there)—when I found that, I said, "It is too bad to pass two upon me in one night; I shall certainly give you in custody;" Jones said, "If that is the case, I am off," and he ran off as soon as he could—I jumped over the counter, and looked out, but could not see anything of him—I saw the constable on the other side of the road—Warren had not left the house; he did not attempt to leave; he was taken into custody; he resisted very much; we were obliged to have another constable to search him at the bar—I gave the constable the shilling that Jones gave me, and the one that I took out of the till.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Warren.</hi> He stated in his deposition that he detained me there, while he fetched a constable. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> The constable advised me not to go into the house till he got further assistance; that was about five minutes; there were several of my neighbours in the house.</p>

I went to the Windmill last Monday night week—I looked in and I saw Warren sitting down—I did not go in then—I did afterwards with two other officers—we called Warren to the door, and I said to him, "You are in my custody, I shall take you in and search you;" he struggled violently; it required three of us to search him—I searched him there, as well as I could, and he was taken to the station—he was searched there a seoopd time—while he was at the police station I saw a piece of paper fall from his left hand; an officer picked it up—I saw it opened, and there was this counterfeit sovereign in it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

               <p>Warren—we tried to search him—I found in his coat pocket a sixpence and 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—we did not search him correctly at that time—he resisted very much, and I said the best way was to take him by each hand and take him to the station—I did not go with him; we were surrounded by low Irish people—I went to Jones' house, at No. 11, Elizabeth Place, four doors from Warren's—it is about forty yards from the Windmill—the potman, Sum<lb></lb>mersby, and Mr. Fearis were with me—I directed them to go down the next street to watch—I then knocked at the door of Jones' house; the door was opened in about two minutes—I went through the house into the back yard—Ifound Jones near the water closet, apparently coming from it—I told him he must consider himself in my custody for passing bad money at the Wind<lb></lb>mill—hesaid he had not passed any, but if he had passed any he had done it innocently—I searched him in the yard, and found on him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 5 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. all good; I took him to the station—I found Warren there, and the charge was entered—I saw Warren drop a small paper parcel from his left hand; I took it up; it contained this counterfeit sovereign, rolled in white paper, and then again in a brown paper—I told Warren to pull off his coat; his coat was taken off and then he resisted being searched again—I took from his left trousers pocket <hi rend="italic">a porte monnaie</hi> containing 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in good money, a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, two sixpences, and a bad half crown amongst the other money—after I had found this, I returned to Jones' house—I went to the water closet in the back yard, and in the pan I found a paper parcel—I took it out, and it con<lb></lb>tained these nine counterfeit shillings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—a small quantity of dry mould was thrown in upon the parcel—these are the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. given me by Mr. Fearis.</p>

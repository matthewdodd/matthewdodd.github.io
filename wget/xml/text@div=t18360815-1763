                  </hi>. I am under-porter at the King's Arms, in Philip-lane, Addle-street. On the 15th of July, I was at the Plasterers' Arms, at half-past eight o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner come up the kitchen-stairs with the ham under his arm, in a sack—I watched, and he put it into a truck which stood in the hall-yard, and went away with it—I followed him to East-road, New North-road, and he went into a shop there, but did not take if off the truck—I went into the shop directly he came out—I did not hear him offer it for sale—I followed him to Popham-street, Popham-terrace—I then missed the basket the ham was in, off the truck, for about half an hour—I did not recover the ham—I suffered him to take it away—I did not like to stop him without my master's leave.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Cripplegate. I took the prisoner into custody, about eight o'clock the same day—I made him no promise or threat—I took him near his master's in Aldermanbury, coming home with the truck—I said, "Why, John, I have been looking all day for you"—he said, "I suppose you have"—I said, "I want you to go along with me"—he said, "Very well—wait till I take my truck in, and take the dog out"—I took him over to the watch-house, and just before he got there, he said he had stolen the ham on purpose to get transported, and he said so at the Compter also—he said he offered it, for sale in the East-road, but afterwards finding the boy was following him, he threw it over the canal-bridge, as he thought no one should be blamed with him, for what he had done—that he was tired of living with his wife, as they had quarrelled, and he did it on purpose to be transported, as he was quite tried of his life.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Plasterer's-hall. The prisoner was in my employ once—he left me about twelve months ago and went into the em<lb></lb>ployment of a person who occupied a room in Plasterer's-hall—I could not swear that I lost a ham, as I cannot tell how many I had—I kept a quantity there—they nearly all run from 24lbs. to 28lbs.—they were Yorkshire hams, and were worth 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a lb.—the prisoner had no business down the kitchen stairs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Mr. Lake, his master, had a room on the same premises? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he had no cellars below at that time—the prisoner was cellarman and porter at Mr. Lake's—Mr. Lake had no bottles down the staircase, to my knowledge—he had no right to have any—he kept bottled ale and stout in his room—the prisoner lived about three years in my service—he went into Mr. Lake's service immediately after, and has been there up to the time of this charge.</p>

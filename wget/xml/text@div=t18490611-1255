                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father; we are shoemakers, and have a shop at 25, Drury-lane. A lad named Moon was in our service—he was taken up and discharged—on 16th May I went to the prisoner's shop in a street at the back of Holborn; I believe it is Princess street, near Turnstile—he was asked in my presence if he knew John Moon—he said, "No," but after some time he said such a boy had been there about three months before, and offered some pieces of leather, and some nails—I asked if he had bought leather and cloth of him—he said, "No"—I asked where he bought that leather which I pointed to—he said no doubt the man would be there in about a fortnight that he bought it of—Moon's father-in-law was with me—he asked the prisoner if the boy had been there lately—he said, "No"—he said he had been seen there smoking some little time previous—the prisoner then said he had been there about a fortnight before and asked for a light for a pipe—he said he had been there several times-there was a drawer partly open, and I saw in it these two pieces of cloth; they are about three quarters of a yard—I supposed it to be our cloth, and on returning to the piece in our warehouse I saw about a yard had been taken from a piece of about fifty yards—I asked the prisoner, when this cloth was found, if he had bought cloth of the boy—he said, "No"—he did not tell me where be got it—I saw some pieces of leather on a window-board, and some</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184906110031"></xptr>
               <p>very near the prisoner—they are now produced here—I have a part of the piece of cloth here; this piece appears to have been cut first and then torn, the parts exactly correspond; that enables me to identify the cloth found in the drawer at the prisoner's as our property—I did not ascertain that any leather was missing when I got home, but I have missed some since, I wrote to Northampton; I knew these skins had been sent from there before, and from the eight that were sent, about four were used, and there was only one left, so that three were missing—the leather is worth 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the cloth about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—this leather belongs to me and my partner—I did not ask the prisoner any questions as to where he got the cloth—I asked if he bought any cloth—he said, "No"—I asked him this while I was handling the cloth—I asked him if he bought any of a boy—he said, "No."</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the prosecutor's service—I have, known the prisoner three or four months—I was in the habit of going to his shop two or three times a week—he has several times said to me when I have gone there, "I shall want so and so next week, "or" I shall want a skin next week" that was a calf-skin—about three weeks before I went before the Magistrate I took a calf-skin to the prisoner; I got it from my master's: I had not my master's authority, or any one's authority to take it—the prisoner did not give me anything for that skin when I took it to him—I had taken another skin to him about the 5th May, I think he gave me 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for that—he knew where I brought them both from—I took some cloth to him which I cut from the whole piece at my master's premises, the prisoner did not pay me anything for it when I took it—I said it was to be made into a pair of boots for a girl, but when I went again in a day or two afterwards I said he should reckon it in with the leather—he knew where I brought the cloth from, and he knew I was living in the employ of Messrs. Kendall—I cannot recollect how much money I received from the prisoner altogether—he paid me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the first skin, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the second—I generally used to go to the prisoner's to smoke, and it was then that he said he wanted some leather—I did not mean to have any boots made with the cloth; I was only joking.</p>

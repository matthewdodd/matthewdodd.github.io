On the 6th of March, the prisoner came in about half after nine or near ten in the morning, he asked for a pint of purl, he paid for his purl, there was no attention paid to him; while I was in the cellar, and other people absent, he concealed the pot under his apron, leaning his elbow on the table;

             came into the passage and informed me there was a person taking my property away, and told me if I would go into the tap room I should see the person no doubt; I went into the tap room and saw the prisoner leaning on his elbow, he offered to go to the door, and I went after him and stopped him, and told him he had got something that was not his own property, and I found this pot in his breeches, my pot; he begged for mercy, when I told him I should certainly make an example of him for others, because I had lost sixteen dozen within this six weeks; he said, I might do my worst I could not hang him; he was very sober.</p>

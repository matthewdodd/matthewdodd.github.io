                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Ricardson Barkas, and live in Ebenezer-place, Mint-street. The prisoner and another person, named Emma Coppin, came to lodge with us on 2nd Nov.—they had an unfurnished room at first—at the end of a week the prisoner felt dissatisfied at being with the other person, and asked if I could let her have a furnished room—I gave her one—Coppin had some things in her room—the prisoner remained in the furnished room till 26th Nov.—she was in my room about ten o'clock that morning—I had a watch on the sideboard—I had it in my hand in the prisoner's presence, and moved it a little further on the sideboard—about a quarter of an hour after, I went into the kitchen—I returned in about two minutes, and sat down—the prisoner took up a card, and said it would make a nice watch paper—I said, "What is the use of a watch<lb></lb>paper?"—I looked as the sideboard, and did not see the watch—I thought no more about it then—I left the room again. and she then left and did not return—I had occasion to go to my purse, which was in the drawer, and saw it had been shifted—I found the money was all right—I then locked my door, and went out for an hour—when I returned I found the door locked, as I had left it—I missed my watch when I was going to bed at night—I went to the lodgers' room, up stairs, and told them of it—I then went to the pri<lb></lb>soner's room, and missed a pair of blankets off her bed—I went to my room again, searched further, and missed from a box in a drawer three half<lb></lb>sovereigns, three ear-rings, and a brooch—I also missed a pair of boots and a pair of shoes from a cupboard in her room—she was in my debt 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for lodg<lb></lb>ing—next morning, in making her bed, I found the ring of the seal, which had been in the box where I missed my money from, and this bit of bent wire—I afterwards tried the key of the prisoner's door to mine, and it would unlock it—I tried the other keys, and none of them would do so—I have not found any of my things.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Allen, and lodged in Mr. Barkas's house for about seven weeks. On 26th Nov., about half-past two, I was washing in the kitchen—the prisoner came through, and went ino the yard—she came in directly, and shut me in the room, and in two minutes after I heard the street door shut—she was dressed, ready to go out—she did not come back.</p>

On 11th Dec., I met the prisoner—I told her I took her on suspicion of robbing Mr. Barkas—she said, "Good God! good God!"—in going to the station, she said she did not rob her, but left her because she owed her some rent; but before that she said she did not know Mr. Barkas, and I must be mistaken in the party.</p>

                  </hi>. In October I hired the prisoner as my servant, and she continued in my service till the 5th of April—I missed a watch, and was very angry with her about it—I had been to church on the morning of the 1st of April, and when I came home I saw the key of the watch hanging out of the prisoner's bosom—I laid hold of it, and said, "How dare you have my watch?"—she hesitated, and said she took it to cook her dinner by—but we have an eight-day clock in the room where she was—this was on Sunday between one and two o'clock—I took it from her.</p>

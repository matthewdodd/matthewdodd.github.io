                  </hi>, Jun. I am the son of the prisoner, and lived with him and my mother, Sarah Smith—on Saturday night, 19th June, we were at home—my father and mother had both of them had a drop to drink—they were tipsy—there was a quarrel between then—I saw my father give mother a slap on the side of the head with his hand first—he then hit her on the back with a machine-stick—this is the stick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—my father is a chimney-sweep, and this is one of the rods of the machine—I afterwards saw him lift his foot—I did not sec him kick her—my mother was always a worreting him every time he came in doors—she was worreting him this evening—I did not sec her doing anything else to him—after he lifted his foot I went into the next room, Mr. Williams' room—I went on an errand for him—I returned in about twenty minutes—I then saw my mother up against the window, sitting on the floor, and I saw blood on the floor, two or three drops—I forget where my father was at that time—he was there—I did not say anything to him, or he to me—I did not hear him say anything to mother—I heard her say to him, "Oh, you have done it for me now"—my father said something, but I really forget the words used—he then went down stairs—I went out afterwards—Mrs. Kelly and Mrs. Fox came into the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Your father was always very kind to your mother, was he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she was very drunk that night, and that was not the first time by a great many—I saw her fall down stairs; she fell from the top to the bottom—father did not strike her then—she went up stairs after that—I went for the doctor—father did not send me, Mrs. Kelly did—mother had been drinking all that day—this happened about 7.30 or 7.45 at night—when she fell down stairs, father went and helped to get her upstairs.</p>

I am the wife of John Kelly, and lire at No. 2, Street's Buildings, right facing the window of the prisoner's room—on Saturday night, about 8 o'clock, I met the prisoner on his own door-step—he begged me to go up stairs and see his wife—he was drunk at the time—I went up immediately, and found her sitting down on the floor under the window—she had blood all over her, and I saw it come from her nostrils—I went and got some cold water and flannel, and wiped it up—there was blood on the floor, a reasonable share—while I was attending to her, Mrs. Fox came in—I sent for Dr. Bloxam—he came directly and examined her—she was put into a cab and taken to the hospital.</p>
               <p>

I am the wife of Thomas Mount joy, and live in the same house with the prisoner—on Saturday evening, 19th June, I heard him and his wife quarrelling—I heard high words; I heard the voices of both—I did not hear what they said, as I was shut in my own room; but soon afterwards I heard Mrs. Smith fall down stairs, just against my door—I did not hear anything besides words of altercation—I heard the prisoner ask her to get up after she had fallen down the stairs—she said, "I can't," and that was the reason of me opening my door—I went out and picked her up, and took her inside my room—I kept her there five or ten minutes—during that time, George Woodcut, a fishmonger, came, and she left my room to speak to him—after that she returned to her own room, at least she left my room, and turned to go up stairs—my room is on the ground floor, just at the foot of the stairs—I still heard them talking loud up stairs—I think it was quarrelling between Mr. and Mrs. Smith—I went in and shut my door—I was afterwards called up by one of the neighbours, and found the deceased sitting on the floor, with her back towards the window, resting against the wall—that was about a quarter of an hour after I had assisted her up at the foot of the stairs, or not quite so long—she was not sensible then—she never spoke after I went into her room—when she was down in my room she could say very little—she was holding her hand to her side, and said she had hurt her side—I did not see any blood on her then—when I saw her up stairs I saw blood on the floor, in two or three different places, and there was some on her clothes.</p>

                  </hi>.—I am in practice at 21, Mount Street, Grosvenor Square—on Saturday night, 19th June, I received information, and went to Street's Buildings, where I saw the deceased lying on the floor, on her back, her head supported by a neighbour—she was insensible—her clothing was saturated with blood, and her body covered with blood and excrement—there were pools of blood upon the floor, in several places—I did not tike accurate notice of the number of stairs that I ascended in order to get to the prisoner's room—I have not been there since, but I should think there might have been some two dozen steps to the staircase—it was almost vertical, a remarkably steep stair-case, highly dangerous—the top was about fourteen feet or sixteen feet, perhaps, from the ground, but I could not speak positively—I desired her to be sent to the infirmary—I made a partial examination of her first—I discovered tin immense loss of blood, and supposed she had been wounded somewhere, but I did not discover any wound at that time—she was washed at the infirmary—I then found a lacerated and con used wound oh the left side of the external genital organ—the cavity of the wound would easily have contained a hen's egg—I proceeded to dress the wound in the usual manner, and she died during my attendance upon her—stimulants and nourishment were given to her whilst I was attending to her—the prisoner was in the room at the time I saw her at the house—I inquired if she had been drinking—he replied, "She is not drunk"—he was drunk—in my judgment the wound was certainly not the result of the fall clown stairs—I afterwards made a post-mortem examination—I found the body almost entirely drained of blood, the wound I have described, a severe bruise on the left temple, lacerating the temporal muscle, blood in the left nostril, the upper lip bruised and cut, several bruises on both fore-arms, some bruises on the scalp, a very severe bruise on the left lower rib, and slighter bruises on the arms, legs, and thighs—the vagina was, as it were, dissected from the surrounding tissues on the left side—in my judg<lb></lb>ment, that wound was inflicted by a kick, or thrust with some blunt instrument—this stick would be calculated to cause such a wound—there is no mark of blood on it that I can see—the immediate cause of death was hemorrhage.</p>

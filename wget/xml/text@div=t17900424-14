               <p>What appearance had the child? - It was bruised from the very two ends, to the fingers ends, and all up the body; and on the right side of her body, there was a sad bruise indeed, by the side of her belly: when I came down stairs, I said to Mrs. Lovedon, certainly that man has murdered the child: I found the child dead, bruised in that manner: I never saw the man till after he was taken, on the Monday after; I never saw him at the house after.</p>
               <p>Had you seen the child on the Thursday, when the father called it up? - I did; likewise the child was down at play with my children all the day.</p>

               <p>Was it a healthy child? - It was of a very delicate constitution; but I never saw it fail from its victuals while I was in the house.</p>

On Friday night, March the 12th, about twelve, the mother of the child came home: Mrs. Tate got out of bed, and let her in; when the woman came in, they had some discourse, but what I do not know: Mrs. Tate had just got into bed, when the woman came down stairs, and said, O Lord! O Lord! my child is dead! my child is dead! I let her in, and went up stairs, and saw the child laid out on the bed; it seemingly to me, was properly laid out; I saw many marks about the child; I did not touch it: the woman and me came out together; she said something; I cannot remember what: I put down my arm, and shook my head at Mrs. Tate; I desired her not to go up, because I thought it might frighten her: the woman walked up and down; at last, I took a book in my hand, and read a little; the woman sat on the side of the bed; and all of a sudden, she jumped up, and ran up stairs; I followed her; when she got in the room, she ran round the room till she came to the side of the bed, where there was a little hammock; she pulled out some petticoats, and looked at them again; the woman seemed to be much reconciled; then she looked upon the bed, and cried; I forced her out of the room; I made the woman some tea, and sat up with her: Mrs. Tate was in bed; the woman drank two dishes I believe, and eat a very little bit of bread and butter; I sat up with her till half past seven; I was too much frightened to take notice of what she said.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any concealment of the child: the child was laid out? - No, there was not; there was a wound in the side, that I did not see in the morning; there were bruises all over, but a particular wound in the hip: I did not examine whether the skin was broke.</p>
               <p>In what manner did the prisoners treat this child while alive? - They always used it with as tender usage as any parents could use a child with; to outside appearance, more so than most parents: I never saw them strike the child, or even heard the child cry, without it was playing with the children.</p>
               <p>You never heard the child cry up stairs? - Never in my life.</p>

               <p>Now describe, not technically, but in the plain common way, the situation of the child? - I found the head, the neck, the body, and extremities, marked with a considerable number of bruises, that appeared to have been given from blows at different periods of time, by some kind of blunt weapon: upon opening the body, I found the cawl, which is that membrane which covers the bowels, in a state of laceration; and from a division of some of its vessels, a large quantity of blood had fallen into the belly; the bowels were much inflamed, in some parts more than others, sufficiently so as to cause death: there was an external bruise on the right side of the belly; and that bruise had been given by some kind of iron.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the head? - Yes; that had suffered much injury from severe blows, being covered with bruises; and upon opening the skull, there was extravasated blood on the brain, in a considerable quantity, on the left side in particular; in short, the whole scalp was one continued act of violence; it could not be done at one time: all the superior part of the head had been beat: there were a considerable number of bruises in all parts; the arms, the breast, and the lower part of the belly, seemed to carry the greatest marks of violence: there was a grazing of the skin, but no kind of perforation; it might be done with the heel, but it must be done with violence: the brain and the bowels were, in my opinion, mortally affected; the brain must have suffered much from the rupture of vessels that were broke, to cause that extravasated blood.</p>
               <p>Court. How long do you think these deadly wounds, on the head and in the bowels, might have been given before the death? - Why, I apprehend that the wounds on the head were recenter than those on the bowels.</p>
               <p>How long might that have been given before, do you think? - Why, I should imagine immediately, almost; it might be so; I cannot speak positively to that.</p>
               <p>Had they been given twelve hours before the death? - I cannot speak with any certainty upon that; it was three days after the decease of the child, that I saw it.</p>
               <p>Court. I have been looking at the account you gave before the coroner; I see nothing of this wound in the head? - I did not examine the head till a more leisure time, which was the day after.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing of a bruise on the hip? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Was that a cut or a bruise? - It was a bruise; there was a division of the parts.</p>
               <p>Now, could any of those appearances which you have mentioned and stated here, arise from convulsions, if the child had died in convulsions? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Would the cawl have been lacerated by convulsions? - By no means; by no spasmodic symptom whatever.</p>
               <p>You think the wound on the head might have been given very soon before the death; do you think it might be twelve hours before the death? - It might possibly be so; there was a number of bruises, by turning the scalp back; there were a dozen; the head being round, spherical, it must take a number of blows to bruise it in every part; the right and left side had more blows than any other part.</p>
               <p>How long do you think these bruises of the body might have been given before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240131"></xptr>the death? - The injury or bruises that were in the hip, might have been given two or three, or four, or five days.</p>

               <p>Court to Surgeon. Did you attend to what was read just now: that he gave the child a blow, and struck it against the bedstead; does that account for all these marks? - No, by no means.</p>
               <p>You see, the child was struck, and fell against the bedstead, and from thence to the ground; that accounts for three blows? - That does not account for the whole by any means; I can positively speak to a dozen distinct blows. I will not particularize the number, but a great number.</p>
               <p>Do you think by any possible supposition, this account satisfies the number of blows? - By no means; I cannot consider it so.</p>
               <p>How many blows do you think were mortal? - The injury done to the bowels was certainly mortal; this injury, seemingly, must have had a fatal effect.</p>
               <p>I am talking of the head; suppose a great number of blows given nearly the same time; as fast as they could, by one after another, what effect would it have? - It<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240132"></xptr>may produce a stupor, a convulsion, and many nervous affections; and violent nervous affections cause a death.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. My Lord. With respect to the other confession, it does not seem to affect the woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Masters. What I did, I did not do it with an intention to take the child's life away, but I am willing to resign myself to the laws of my country; this woman is innocent; she was not in the place when it was done.</p>
               <p>Court. Perhaps in your present situation it may have escaped you, what this witness has said; you, in your confession, have admitted you gave the child one blow, and she fell against the bedstead; but the account of the surgeon is, that upon examining the head of this child, it does not correspond at all with that confession, because it does not appear to be two bruises only, which would be the natural consequence, if your account was true; but there are at least a dozen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I struck it upon its temple, and it fell down against the bed.</p>
               <p>Court. But the surgeon says, that does not correspond to the account you gave, for there were at least a dozen blows on the child's head. Would you ask him any question, or offer any thing to the jury, by way of remark on that evidence? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the jury. The prisoner,

            , is indicted for wilful murder; it does not appear but that the woman has acted the part of an affectionate mother; and that if the child was murdered, she had no hand in it. (Here the learned judge summed up the evidence, and then added) The first probable cause of this child's death, is the wound on the belly, where the cawl was lacerated, and the extravasated blood introduced; if you were to believe Masters's account in his confession, as it is called, and if the blows on the head could in any degree correspond to that account, you ought to acquit him; because though this blow given to the child without any provocation, and the child accidentally falling against the bedstead, and dying, it would not amount to murder; it could only be manslaughter; but the appearances on the head of this child, I am very sorry to say, in no wise correspond with this account; the surgeon has told you, that he cannot possibly think that the appearances on the skull of this child at all correspond to this account; for he says, that there was at least a dozen blows on the head; the child's head was all over bruises, and it must necessarily occur to any one, that if a great number of blows are inflicted, if one singly would not occasion death, yet all being given at the same time, and one after another, they might have that effect; if so, I do not see how you can make it less than murder, if you believe that account: it can only be manslaughter; on the other hand: if you believe the surgeon, it certainly does amount to murder: to be sure, in cases like this, where persons stand charged with the murder of infant children, there generally appears to have been a series of ill usage; in this case, on the contrary, it appears there has been the greatest good usage and tenderness; the child was never heard to cry up stairs, as if it received any correction, but always was treated in the gentlest manner possible; so much is in favour of the prisoner; it appears also that this woman, affected with all the affection of a mother, and shewed all that distress which was expected in a mother; that was the reason why I did not call upon her for her defence: the evidence only affects the prisoner Masters, and it is for you to give your verdict on all the circumstances of the case.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father and mother, at 137, High-street, Whitechapel—they keep a tobacconist's shop—on Monday, 23d March, two men came there for some tobacco, and gave me a bad shilling—I told the man who gave it me that it was a bad one—he said, "This is not bad"—I said, "It is bad," and I kept it—the prisoner then came in and said, "Give her three halfpence, and let us go"—one of the other men gave me three halfpence, and they all went away together—on Saturday, 28th March, I saw the prisoner again—a boy named Robert Keenan, who serves in the shop, gave me a bad florin, which I saw the prisoner give to him, for half an ounce of tobacco—I was in front of the counter—I told him the florin was bad, and said, "You are the same man that came in on Monday with a bad shilling"—he said, "Oh! never mind that, here's a good one; I don't want any bother about it"—he then threw down another florin, which the boy Keenan put in the till, and gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—a policeman then came in, and I gave the prisoner in charge—I kept the first florin in my hand; I bit it, and gave it to the policeman, with the shilling that I had taken—my mother afterwards looked in the till.</p>

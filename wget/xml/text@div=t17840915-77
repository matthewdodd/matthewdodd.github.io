               <p>I did live then in the Little Minories opposite these people; I was talking to my little girl, I saw the prisoner bundle up a packet of clothes, I saw her through the window, their window was a-jar, it was neither open nor shut, in the one pair of stairs; Mrs. Phillips had had her windows cleaned, and left her window open, or else I could not have seen.</p>
               <p>Then she had left her window open before she went out? - She had left her window a-jar; I did not see the prisoner go out, I saw her in the room, she appeared to me to be looking over clothes; I looked at her a good while, I had my little girl with me, and I said to her, Mrs. Phillips is very busy looking over her things, and presently I saw the prisoner come down with the property: I should have had no mistrust, but she dropped a pair of morone coloured breeches and an old sheet in the passage, I then thought she had been robbing the house, she had a large bundle, almost as much as a porter could stand under, with a quantity of false keys; and all that she had about her.</p>
               <p>Did she turn back to pick them up? - No, she went on, I pursued after her as quick as possible, she went with the things to the Three Kings, where she had left her child while she committed the robbery.</p>
               <p>Who got the things after? - I do not know, it was a Jew man, a constable.</p>

               <p>Please you, my Lord, I stopped this woman, she had the things with her, I saw the constable take charge of her, they are the same things.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the constable here with the things? - He was not bound over; the things were left in my care, because there was some things in them, which his wife could not do without in her lying-in.</p>
               <p>When were those things given to you? - There were thirty-four picklock keys found in her pocket and a particular knife.</p>
               <p>When did the constable deliver them up to you? - It was the 15th of July, the next day after the robbery; the same night she was taken the things were sealed up, and left at my next door neighbour's house.</p>
               <p>Who took charge of the things at the Three Kings? - The constable sealed them up, and left them with a next door neighbour of mine in my presence; I saw them again the next day at Guildhall, they were brought there in the same state; they were opened by Alderman Plomer, and they were looked over, and the Alderman asked me what I would value them at; I told him I would leave it to him, and he valued them at three pounds; they were then committed over to my care, and have been in my possession ever since, and are here now, the same things that were sealed up in the bundle.</p>

               <p>(The things deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court. What may your coat and waistcoat be worth? - Ten shillings, the velvet breeches five shillings.</p>
               <p>What are your two gowns worth? - Ten shillings, they are charged in the indictment at eight shillings.</p>
               <p>What is your white petticoat worth? - Four shillings; the black petticoat, four shillings; and the sopha cover, four shillings.</p>
               <p>Are there any sheets? - Here are three old sheets, value three shillings; three shifts, three shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. Were there any neckcloths? - I cannot find any here.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I deal in clothes, a woman asked me to buy them, and I bought them, and that gentlewoman charged me with an officer: I have two poor children.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this indictment is founded upon a particular act of parliament, which was made for the protection of poor people, who are obliged to leave their houses in the day time to go to their labour, and which makes it a capital offence to break into a house by day time, and to steal therein to the amount of five shillings; if there is a deficiency in the proof of breaking and entering, that makes an alteration in the charge, for unless the house is broke and entered, stealing therein to the value of five shillings in the day time is not a capital offence; but if she did not break and enter the dwelling house, still, if she stole to the value of forty shillings, she is guilty of a capital offence.</p>

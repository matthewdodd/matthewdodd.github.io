                  </hi>. I live at No. 4, Great Carter-lane. On 6th June the prisoner applied to me for a truck, about a quarter past 5 o'clock, and gave the name of Davidson—I had previous knowledge of him, and let him have one—he said he was going to put paper in it, and I gave him a wrapper with it—I was not there when he brought it back—he afterwards had trucks of me on two or three occasions.</p>

On 6th June I was in Farringdon-street with another boy, Stokes, and saw the prisoner—he asked us if we wanted any jobs—I went with him to Mr. Wickendon's, to get a truck; we then went to Queenhithe, and he gave me something in an envelope, and told me to take it to Tyler's—I took it there, saw Mr. Collins, and received from him four reams of paper—the prisoner stopped at the top of Queenhithe—we then went with him to London-wall, and he took the paper into a pawnshop up a court there—he gave us 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, told me to take the truck home, and gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay for it.</p>

This piece was in our possession on the 3d of October, I do not believe it ever was disposed of in trade; I have been in the shop ever since, and should have seen it go if it had been sold. These shawls have the private mark of Anstie and Baker, I cannot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179110260008"></xptr>tell who made it; I know the patterns of these pieces that have Welch's marks; we had such patterns, there are pieces without marks, I know those patterns; the sixth I know not.</p>
               <p>Welch. Here is my mark on two of the three pieces, which proves to me to a certainty that at some time I have received this piece from Anstie and Baker: it is made by me in chalk, it is a hasty way to mark hundreds and thousands. A. B. I recollect no other customers whose names begin so, but Anstie and Baker; the other piece has an A. only, which is not so satisfactory.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the value of these articles? - The four cotton shawls are worth about 7 s. the chintz, which was found in his hands, is worth 16 s. the other articles are worth 5 l.</p>

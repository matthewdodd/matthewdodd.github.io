I am a ship's carpenter, of Woolwich—on Satur<lb></lb>day night, 11th July, I was returning home between 12 and 1 o'clock, and saw the prisoner at Green End—I accompanied her to Mount-street, where she said she lived—she said, "This is my house, but unfortunately I have not got the key, but we will stand here, and my friend will be here presently with it—she placed her arms round me several times, and then said, "Oh, here comes a policeman, you had better go out first"—I then missed my watch, which was safe before I met her, fastened through my button-hole with a guard—I was perfectly sober—I described her, and afterwards saw her at the station—have seen my watch since—it is worth 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

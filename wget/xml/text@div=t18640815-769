                  </hi>. I am a labourer—I knew the deceased, John East—on 30th July I was waling with him down Richard's-place, Haggerstone; it is a court between six and seven feet wide, with houses on one side and a dead wall on the other—the prisoner was sitting on the pavement by the house No. 5, with a child in his lap, and his legs straight across the footway; there was room for one person to pass without touching his legs, but not for two—the deceased and I were going along side by side, and the deceased kicked against the prisoner's legs—the prisoner said something, but I don't know what—the deceased said, "Why don't you take your feet up out of the way; I did not see them"—we walked on three or four yards, I looked round and saw the prisoner coming behind East, with his right hand like this and he struck him at the side of the right ear—I am quite sure I saw that—it knocked him down; he fell with his knees and head into the wall, not flat down—the wall struck his right eye—I picked him up; he was bleeding very much from over the eye—he walked to Mr. Greenwood's with my assistance; he was not at home—I then took him to Mr. Sykes'; he was not at home and he was at last taken to St. Bartholomew's hospital—he was quite sober, and quite sensible when he was walking with me, and appeared in good health—he was about fifty years of age—he died on the Wednesday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The deceased stumbled over the prisoner's legs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I saw no one but the prisoner and the child in the passage; I dad not see Henry Carter there, nor anyone else—I did not hear the prisoner coming up behind us, but I looked round and saw him—I don't think the deceased looked round—we were walking, not running—I am quite sure I saw the blow struck.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's hospital—the deceased was brought there on 30th July; he walked in with the last witness—the was quite sensible—he was bleeding very much from some wound on the right side of his forehead—he was admitted into the hospital—he made a statement to me—erysipelas came on on the Monday, and he died on the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> August—he complained to me of the back of his head, just behind the right ear—when I made the post-mortem examination I looked at that part, but I discovered no marks of injury—his face and head were so swollen with the erysipelas that I could not have done so—there was nothing internally; there was no injury to the brain—there was a small wound just over the right eyebrow, and above it the skin of the forehead was torn away from the scalp, and hung down over his eye—I could not say from which the erysipelas sprang; they were both inflicted at the same time—I imagine that his head was struck with some blunt instrument, and then the skin of the forehead was torn down—the whole of the skin was torn—a blow or a fall against a wall would produce such injuries.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

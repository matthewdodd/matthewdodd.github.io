                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Royal Oak public-house, Poplar—on the evening of 12th July last, at about half-past 7, I was serving in the bar; the prisoners Potterton and Cave came in, and I served them with half a quartern of gin and peppermint—Potterton gave me half-a-crown: it was a good one—I gave him in change a florin and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of coppers—I put the half-crown in the till—Potterton asked for a small glass; I got him a smaller glass, when he said he would make the first one do, and I put the other back again—they drank the gin and peppermint—Potterton then said, would I give him smaller change for the florin? and he put the florin in my hand; I gave him in change two 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. pieces—I put the florin in the till—he gave one of the shillings to Cave—they then went away—I did not see Ward—there were about ten people in front of the bar at the time—almost immediately after they had gone, a person of the name of King came in and spoke to me—I then looked into the till—no one had been to it in the meantime—I took out the florin and found it was a bad one; it was on the top of the other silver—I did not examine the rest of the money in the till—there was another florin at the bottom of the other silver: there was about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of silver—I am quite certain from the position of the other florin it was not the one I had put in the till, or that Potterton gave me—I gave the bad florin to King, who shortly afterwards returned with a person named Winter, bringing in Potterton and Cave in custody—King gave me the bad florin again—a constable was sent, and they were given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, living at Elford-street, Millwall—on the 12lh of July last, I saw the three prisoners in that neighbourhood, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening; Potterton and Cave, were standing opposite the Royal Oak, and Ward was hanging about there—I saw them all three go into the house; Ward went in about a minute first, and they all came out, one after the other—directly they got out, me and my mate went in—I spoke to the barmaid; she pulled the florin out of the till, put it</p>

               <p>into her mouth and bit it, and then said it was a bad one—my mate Winter was with me at the time—we left the Royal Oak, and followed them right away down Millwall, to a little beer-shop called the "Times Brewery Tap."—Potterton and Cave went into the Times Brewery Tap; Ward was walking about on the other side of the way—they remained in the beer-shop a very short time; when they came out, they went down the road again, and the other one joined them—I went on ahead of them to find a policeman, and left my mate to watch them—they went to the Islanders public-house—I and Winter went in and told them they must consider themselves in our custody—Ward had walked away towards Mill wall—they wanted to know what I took them in custody for; I said, "For passing bad money"—they said they knew nothing about it. I brought them directly up to the Royal Oak, and handed them over to a police constable—it was half an hour after I saw them at the Royal Oak, that I took them into custody at the Islanders—when I took the two prisoners back to the Royal Oak, I gave the florin back to the barmaid; I kept it in my pocket by itself, while it was in my possession—I afterwards took Ward into custody on the canal-bridge, Blackwall, in about two hours.</p>

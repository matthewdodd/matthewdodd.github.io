                  </hi>. I am shopman to Thomas Robinson, pawnbroker, of Charlton-street, Somers-town. On the 7th of April we had some shawls hanging on the door for sale—I found two had been pulled down—I found one tucked into a pair of steps, and the other was gone—in conse<lb></lb>quence of information, I went into the street, and met the prisoner in the New-road, about a quarter of a mile off—I asked what she had under her shawl—she did not say anything—I pulled up her shawl, and found mas<lb></lb>ter's shawl wrapped in an old waistcoat—she said a young woman gave it to her—I bad seen it safe ten minutes before—I found her with it in about five minutes—I had not seen her in the shop.</p>

On the afternoon of the 7th of April, about half-past three o'clock, the prisoner came to my door, stood there a few minutes, then stooped down, stood up again, and dropped this shawl behind her—she turned round—I pointed to it—she stooped down, took it up, stood a few minutes longer, and then walked away—I saw her in the prosecutor's shop, about five minutes after, in custody.</p>

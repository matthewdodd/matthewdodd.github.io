                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Huggins—we live in Union-street, Spitalfields. The prisoner was in my service for four days—I was going to discharge her, and she left about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, on Wednesday, the 11th of Dec.—after she was gone I missed my purse, which contained a sovereign, four half-crowns, eight shillings, and some coppers—I have not seen my purse since—she told the policeman she lost it out of her bosom—she told me she had spent the money with the exception of buying herself a bonnet, which came to 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and she said she was very sorry for it—I had taken her as an orphan—I was about to part with her because she did not suit me—I had told her about an hour before that she did not suit me—when she went at half-past eight, I knew she was going for good—she said a girl tempted her to take the purse, that she went to thread a necklace, and the girl told her whatever there was to take it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman to Mr. Charles Lyall, he keeps mustard and flour mills at Lambeth. On the 12th of January I was driving his cart with this cask and 60lbs. of mustard in it—I got to Mr. Adams's at Rotherhithe between six and seven o'clock at night, and when I went into his shop to deliver some mustard I missed this cask—I must have lost it in Pudding-lane, where I had stopped to deliver two sacks of ground ginger, as that was the only place I had called at—I was away about five minutes—the cask could not have fallen out, as it was a tilted cart—I gave information at the station-house—I came back to Pudding-lane and found the cask of mustard in the prisoner's wagon—when I was in Pudding-lane first I saw the prisoner there, and he asked which way I was going—I said I was going to back out, and he said be was going to draw down to load at one of the warehouses—I then went on to Rotherhithe, and when I came back I found his wagon drawn lower down to the place where he said he was going to load—there were two more persons standing talking with him when I got back, but he was the person who had the care of the wagon—I found this cask of mustard in his wagon covered over with a sack, and some loose straw put on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a policeman at this time—Nash came to me—I went with him, and saw this cask concealed in the wagon under a sack and some straw—the prisoner was sitting on a step opposite—he said he belonged to the wagon.</p>

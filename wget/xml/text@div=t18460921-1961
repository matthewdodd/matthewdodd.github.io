                  </hi>. I am a clerk to the South Eastern Railway Company—the prisoner was their porter at the Bricklayer's Arms station—it was his duty to unlock the trucks of fish in the morning, which come up from Dover and Ashford by the night trains, and to put them in different places for the carriers to take away—on Monday morning, the 14th of Sept., I saw him on the stage between three and four o'clock—he walked to the top of the stage—I perceived something under his arm—I watched him—he left the ware—house, and got into the road—I followed, and asked what he had got—he said, "A few apples"—I put my hand under his jacket and pulled out a live crab—there were such articles came up that morning—I asked where he got it from—he said, "From a basket in the warehouse"—that is a warehouse belonging to the Company—he said, "Let me put it back again"—I said, "No, I cannot countenance a thing of that sort, I shall be compelled to give you into custody"—I allowed him to go into the warehouse—I found a po<lb></lb>liceman, and gave him into custody—I went into the warehouse—there were baskets of live crabs there—they were all tied down—I should think this was not a crab that could have got out of itself.</p>

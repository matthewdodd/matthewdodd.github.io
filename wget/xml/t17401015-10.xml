             fellow, Watchman. I was standing at the End of White-Horse-Yard, and saw the Woman run out of Clare-Court, toward Wych-Street, and the Man after her; he called Watch, I immediately pursued her, and took her, and when the Prosecutor came up, he charged me with her; She is the same Woman that I saw the Prosecutor pursue, and a good Pair of Heels she has; I believe she would make shift to run 20 Miles before I could run 15. She denied she had the Watch before the Justice, but she was not searched.</p>

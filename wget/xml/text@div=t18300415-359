            . I am inspector of the Ward of Bishops-gate. I saw the prosecutor with Cowling - he charged her with stealing a half-sovereign, and said there had been another woman in company and described her - I went and took Brown and took hold of her hand to prevent her throwing any thing away; I found two half-crowns in her hand, which she said she received from a gentleman in Cavendish-court - the prosecutor had been drinking, but was not so far gone but I think his testimony might be taken.</p>

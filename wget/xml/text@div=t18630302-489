I lived at the Bremen Flag for three days—I was there on 1st February, when the prisoner came in and asked his wife several questions, which I did not understand; and then he took a phial from his pocket, took the cork out, flung the contents over her face, and ran out in<lb></lb>stantly—she ran into the road, and was jumping about with pain, till she was taken away—I was near her, but as I saw the cork coming from the bottle I threw myself back, but some of it came on my dress; my skirt and sleeve were burnt completely asunder.</p>

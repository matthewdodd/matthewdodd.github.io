               <p>Q.Therefore, of course, you did not examine them? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that other person here? - A. No, he is not.</p>
               <p>Q. You find it a very common thing for one person, living in a house, pledging articles for another? - A. Yes, very often.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. That is her real name? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Her husband lodges in the same house with her? - A. Yes. (The property produced).</p>
               <p>Binch. I am sure this is my wife's gown by its being new sleeved; the shirts I can swear to from the mark, one is marked No. 1, and the other No. 3; they are marked by my wife in blue thread.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you safely swear to their being your shirts from those marks? - A. I think I can.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This is the first time I ever knew a man called to prove his wife's gown, or his wife's mark-Upon your oath, where is your wife? - A. At home.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she not been very intimate with the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear your wife never gave her authority to pawn them? - A. I think I could.</p>
               <p>Q. I beg you to give me some reason why your wife is not here? - A. There are only two of us to look after the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore she, who is the best calculated to judge of these things, stays away; and you, who are the best calculated to attend the shop, are here; what business is your's? - A. In the tobacco way.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not the more usual way for you to take care of the tobacco business, and your wife of the household business? - A. Yes; I asked the officer if there was any occasion for her coming, and he said, there was none in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Who made that gown of your wife's, your wife herself? - A. I do not think she did.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did the officer give you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100043"></xptr>that advice? - A. I asked the question during the business, and he said, he did not see occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask that officer, Treadway, that question? - A. Yes, I did, in the course of the week, whether there was any occasion for Mrs. Birch to attend, and he said, he did not see any in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not mark these shirts? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not wear that gown of course? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what is it that should send you here, in preference to your wife? - A.Because, when I went to Bow-street, I was bound over to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have not you heard it said, that your wife gave her authority to pledge them? - A. Yes, with you.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard that suggested? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never asked your wife that question? - A. No; I had no reason to ask her.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in her defence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Treadway.) Q. Upon your oath, did this man ever consult you upon the propriety of calling his wife here as a witness? - A No, he never did; his wife was not at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you any recollection whether you ever said to him any thing about the necessity of his wife coming? - A. I have not, no such word ever passed.</p>
               <p>Q. And you know he has sworn it, now will you swear that what he has said, is false? - A. I will; I know him very well, and I knew his father to be a man of property and character, before he was born.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Birch.) Q. Was it Treadway, or Mumford that said it? - A. It was said in the course of one day since I have been attending the Old Bailey; I was saying, I did not know whether it was necessary my wife should be here, and one of them said, there is no occasion.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

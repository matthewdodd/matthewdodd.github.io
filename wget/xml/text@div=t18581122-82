                  </hi>. I am a saddler, at Stoke Newington. Last Saturday night, 20th November, I left my place about 9 o'clock, and was proceeding on my way somewhere down Bermondsey, leaving there to go to Kenning<lb></lb>ton-gate to take a <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—on my way I went into some public-house, I cannot tell exactly where, it was in some part of Bermondsey I believe—I had something to drink while there—I took some money out of my pocket to pay for it, and some of the party that was there behind me struck the money out of my hand—I saw the prisoner there—he was sitting at the table where I was—he was behind me, I believe, at the time my money was struck from ray hand—I picked my money up, and I believe I lost a shilling—I left the public-house directly after, and proceeded on my way to take a Kennington <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—some person from the house, a connexion of the prisoner's followed me, walked on the side walk some little distance, and asked me to go and take something to drink—I went in, and I believe we had half-a-quartern of rum, which I paid for—we drank the ram between us, and left the place together, and walked on the side walk some little distance—we had walked, I should say, something like five minutes, and as I was crossing the road with the man alongside of me, all of a sudden some one struck me in the right eye, and made a rush on me and took my watch from my pocket—I was somewhat stunned from the blow—I was knocked down—on getting up again I knew my watch was gone, because I felt them forcing very hard to get it away from me—there was more than one person—I saw two distinctly run away from me—I felt them pulling my watch away—the chain was an Albert chain, hooked on to the button-hole—it was not round my neck—the watch was in my waistcoat pocket—I pursued the men, and called "Thief"—I afterwards saw the prisoner in the custody of a police-officer—I am sure he is the man I saw in the first public-house—I knew him at once.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 76). Last Saturday night, the 20th, I was on duty near Lant-street, Borough—whilst there I heard a cry of "Stop thief," about a quarter to 11 and saw some one running—I ran after him up a blind court where there is no way out, called Blue Ball-court—I caught him there—I brought him out into the middle of the road, and a man came up and said, "It is all right, constable; let him go"—I said I would let him go when I was further satisfied—I held him about a minute and a half, and the prosecutor and a mob of people came running from the same direction that the prisoner had run from—the prisoner was the man I caught—the prosecutor said to the prisoner, "That is the man that I have been treating"—the prisoner said nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> It is true that the constable caught me—I heard the cry of "Stop thief," and I ran too, and ran round the corner where the constable was—I was not in the prosecutor's company at all that evening—I never saw him till he charged me with the robbery—if you put it back for a day, I could have witnesses to speak to my character.</p>

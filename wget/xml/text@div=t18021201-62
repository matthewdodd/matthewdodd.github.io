               <p>Q. Where is your shop? - A. No. 119, High Holborn; he gave an order for the best gold timekeeper; I had none ready at that time, and told him I could not provide one by the time he wanted, but would provide one for him by that day week, and the price of it would be sixty-five guineas, for that it was not one of the best; he said he would call for it that day week, which I believe was on Saturday; he did not call till the Tuesday following, when I was not in the way, but I had left the time-keeper for him; he did not take it away, but called again on the Wednesday, when I was at home, and told me he had called the day before, but would not take the time-keeper as I was not at home; I gave him the time-keeper, and, in payment for it, he offered me those Bills, saying his name was Capt. Foote; there were two Bills to the amount of 681. 5s. one of which is for 421. signed

            pawnbroker; on the 7th of October the prisoner came to our shop, and offered a gold chronometer or time-keeper to pledge; I had a suspicion, and put many questions to him, which I thought would induce him to answer clearly as to how much he gave for it, and where he got it; in consequence of which, he shewed me a receipt for it, from Mr. Earnshaw; the nature of the timekeeper is such, that it is screamed down in a box, so that I could not open it; I begged the prisoner would suffer me to send it to a watch-maker to get it opened, but that he declined, saying he would take it to a watch-maker, and get it unscrewed. and bring it back again. As soon as he was gone, I desired my brother to go to Mr. Earnshaw's and enquire as to the truth of what the prisoner had said. As my brother was going to leave the shop, a hand-bill was brought in from Bow-street, describing the watch. I desired him to go to Mr. Earnshaw, and say, in case the prisoner should re-turn, I would secure him. The prisoner returned in about half an hour, as near as possible; but before that, I had given orders to one of our young men, in case the prisoner did come, to shut the back-door, in order to prevent his making his escape. The young man went to the back-door, and in fastening it, the bolts being loose, made a grating noise; the prisoner immediately stepped back, and wanted to know what that noise was, or the reason of it; I told him he must be secured, and shewed him the hand-bill; he begged I would not send to Bow-street, but that I would send for Mr. Earnshaw, who, he made no doubt, would be satisfied by having his watch returned.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you got the hand-bill? - A. No, I shewed it to him; but previous to that I had sent to Bow-street for a constable, and in a few minutes Miller, the officer, arrived, to whom I delivered the prisoner in custody: That is all I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not state any particulars of what had passed between him and Mr. Earnshaw? - A. No, he did not.Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180212010040"></xptr>know the prisoner before? - A. I had seen him the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not at all acquainted with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Where did you see him the night before? - A. At our house; he offered some telescopes, of which we had the same suspictions.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when he offered them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I rested my defence principally upon the evidence of a medical gentleman, who is not here, and I applied to the Court to put off my trial, in the hopes of obtaining his testimony, to shew that I was in a state of mental derangement months prior to the time mentioned, which that gentleman could, to the satisfaction of your Lordship and the Jury, have shewn. I have no recollection or knowledge of the charges exhibited against me. I have nothing further to say, only to recommend myself to your Lordship's mercy, and that of the Gentlemen of the Jury. I rested my defence solely on him and the other medical gentlemen, who had known me in that state for three years before.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.(To Mr. Earnshaw.) Upon your observation of what passed, did the prisoner appear to be under any mental derangement? - A. Very far from it. There was one circumstance which will let you see he was very keen in his endeavours. He called on Tuesday for the watch, which I had left, with a bill and recept, and finding I was not at home, he went away without it. He told me himself that he had called on the Tuesday," and the reason," says he, "Mr. Earnshaw, that I did not take the watch was, that you were not at home." I apprehended that he suspected it would not have been delivered to him by my people without the money, and I set it down to him as a piece of art. He told me that he called on the Tuesday for the watch, but as I was not in the way, he would not take it, and seemed to hold himself much upon that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any symptoms of mental derangement? - A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Birkitt) Did you perceive at the time the prisoner called before, and at the time he brought the time-keeper, any symptoms of mental derangement? - A. Not in any respect whatever.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called the Chevalier Ruspmi; who gave him a good character.</p>

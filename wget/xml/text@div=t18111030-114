            . Q. You live with these gentlemen - A. Yes. On the 21st of October I was laying down some beer at <placeName id="t18111030-114-crimeloc648">the King's Head in Bear-street, Liecester-square</placeName>

When we had taken a fourth I came up again and missed the barrel cask; I asked Mrs. Farrol if she knew the men; she said she knew one of the men, they had a quartern of gin, and left me to pay for it. I know no more of the men than what I have told you. She told me they were gone into Castle-street, and it was Mr. Atkinson's dray in Cannon-street. I went there and asked the prisoner what business he had with the cask; he said he had no cask belonging to me; I told him it was my cask, it had Mr. Buckley's name on it; I told him I should get an officer; I did, and when I came with the officer the cask was put on my dray.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The man that was with me told me to take the cask, and when the man was gone to Bow-street, he put it on the dray, and I saw no more of the man. I was taken to Bow-street.</p>

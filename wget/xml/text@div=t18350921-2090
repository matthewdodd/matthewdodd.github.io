                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Stephens, a labourer, and live at No. 3, Rome-street, Greenwich. These articles are my husband's—the prisoner came to lodge at my house in July, and staid not quite a fortnight—these articles were let to her with the room—she took the key away when she left—I sent for a constable to open the room, and missed the things—I afterwards received a parcel containing the key and some duplicates, by which I recovered the property—I don't know the hand<lb></lb>writing of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on the 5th of September, in East-lane, Greenwich—I told her it was for robbing her lodgings—she said she thought that was settled before that time—as we came along, she said she had taken the things and pawned them, except the blanket, which she gave a person to pawn for some drink—I found nine duplicates on her, but not of this property.</p>

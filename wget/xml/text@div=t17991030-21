               <p>Q. The watch was on your left, and the prisoner was on your right? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come into the room while she was there? - A. Yes, a French Priest; she staid about four or five minutes after he came in; he called for a watch that I had of his, to know if it was ready; I told him it was not, but if he would call about Wednesday next it would be done; at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300022"></xptr>that instant I got up from my chair; I turned into the room to see if my linen was right with the bill; I took my own watch out of my pocket, looked at the regulater if it was right, and then I went to work.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the French gentleman gone before the prisoner went? - A. Yes.</p>


               <p>Q. Was she gone when you went to look at your linen? - A. No; when the French gentleman was going away, the prisoner was standing about the work-bench, and asked me what was the price of a vice; I told her she could get a second hand one for our shillings; at that instant, I proceeded to see my linen; while I was looking at my linen, I had my back turned to the prisoner, and to my watches; then I went to the corner of the room to fetch some money to pay her; I gave her the money, and she went away; I missed the watch in two or three minutes after she was gone, and I never saw it again.</p>

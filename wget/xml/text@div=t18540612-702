                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Attree, the barrister; I take care of his chambers. On Tuesday, 9th May, the prisoner came to the chambers—Mr. Attree was in the country—the prisoner asked to see Mr. Attree, to see if he could get him a situation—I said I expected than every minute; and he asked to write his name down; he wrote his name at my seat—he asked to wait a few minutes, and he went into my master's office to see if it was high tide—he took both the studs up—he went away, and said he would come</p>

               <p>the next day—I afterwards met him in Elm-court, and he asked me to go with him to buy two penny biscuits—he gave me one, and I ate it—he came back to the chambers, and stayed a few minutes—he went and looked into the cupboard, and two seals were lying there—he went into the bed-room, and he said the things were in a different place—he asked to black his boots—he opened the drawer where the plate was kept, but I did not see him take anything—he said that was where the blacking was—he then got up, and said he would go and see what time it was—he came back, and told me it was 4 o'clock, and he thought I had better go—soon afterwards he went out, and ran away—after he was gone I missed the silver out of the plate drawer—I missed 1 large spoon, some small tea spoons, and other things—I went and told Mr. Dyer, and he came back with me—I then made further search, and missed the gold studs—the seals were missed when my master came home—he returned on the Wednesday—the prisoner was taken on Friday.</p>

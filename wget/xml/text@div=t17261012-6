               <p>Thomas Collier thus depos'd. I had been a drinking with some Friends at the King's-Arms-Tavern at Charing-Cross, and so got fuddled, as a Man may say, and we parted about 10 at Night, and I went along the Strand, as I think they call it, in order to go to my Lodging at the George Inn at Holborn-Bridge; I was a stranger in this Town, and whither I went, or what I did with my self I cannot tell, but I fell asleep somewhere or other, and when I waked, I found my self upon my Back without either Hat or Wig, or Coat or Wastcoat. It was mortal Dark, and I look'd up and saw nothing but the Sky above me, and in a great Amazement I was; says I to my self, what will become of me? Where am I? In the World or out of it? At last I lookt a little lower and saw the tops of the Houses, and then I be thought my self I was got into some Town or other, and was lying in the middle of a dark Alley without any Clothes upon my Back, though still I was strangely confounded to think which way I got there, and how I came to be in such a sad Condition: However, I made shift to get upon my Legs, and quickly came into a Street that lookt a little lighter; and as I was going along, I spied a Man making Candles: I inquired of him where about I was, and he ask'd me how I came to be in that Pickle. I told him that I could give no other Account of it but that I came from Whitney and had lost my self. Pray, says he, do ye know Mr. Busby in Whitney? Yes very well, says I and every me body else in that Town, and so upon that he lent me a Cap and a great Coat, and carried over to an Ale-house, where I staid till day-light, and then sent for some of my Friends. When they came, they went with me to look for what I had lost, and there we went up and down till we met one

             thus depos'd. We had been drinking with the Prosecutor over Night at the Kings-Arms at Charing-Cross: he was fuddled when he went away, and I desired him to send for a Coach, but he said he'd try how his Legs would carry him first, and so we parted. About 6 a-clock next Morning Word was brought us that the Prosecutor was at the Rose and Crown Ale-House in Drury-lane, and that he had been rob'd and stript and left asleep in the Street. We quickly found him, and took him with us to look for the Persons that had rob'd him. We made Enquiry after ill Houses, and were particularly directed to Castle-Alley in Mercer's Street near Long-Acre, and there found the Prisoner Smith with the Goods upon him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman. On the 28th of January I was employed on the <hi rend="italic">London,</hi> a Newcastle trader—the prisoner was an appren<lb></lb>tice and was employed on board that day—be and I were engaged in handling some iron bars into the ship, between nine and ten o'clock at night—he was standing between the decks upon the beam, steadying the bars as they came in, and I was in the hold receiving them—he handed them to me, and I took them into the hold—in turning the bars they some<lb></lb>times touched the prisoner—that happened three or four times—he said, "You do this on purpose"—I said I did nothing of the sort—they happened to touch him again a little time after, and he took up a log of wood and flung at me—it hit me on my thumb, so that I lost the use of my hand, and dropped the bar out of my hand—I asked him what that was for—he gave me no answer, but went away on deck—I followed him, and found him on the quarter-deck, by the main rigging—I went up to him with a rope's-end in my hand, about as thick as my finger—I was hitting at him two or three times, but the rigging and the quarter-boards prevented as I getting at him—I dare say the rope hit him, but not as I intended—I then took him by the collar and pulled him out from there, and as soon as I him out he stabbed a knife into me—I had hit him with the rope before that, and was then in the act of pulling him ont and striking him with the rope—while I was doing that he stabbed the knife into me immediately—I did not see the knife in his hand, but I felt the blow—he struck me at the back of the left shoulder—I could feel that it was done with some sharp tool or knife—at the time he struck me he said, "Take that"—I left him, and showed my shoulder to Thomas Walton and the mate—I went immediately to a doctor in the Minories, who advised me to go to the Lon<lb></lb>don hospital, which I did, and was there from the 28th of January to the 15th of march.</p>

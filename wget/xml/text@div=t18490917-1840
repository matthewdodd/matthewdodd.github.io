I conduct the business of Mr. Box, of Charing-cross, and have done so twelve years; I reside at 70, Union-street, Lambeth-walk On 3d Sept., I was at business till ten o'clock in the morning, and afterwards left my house with fifty sovereigns rolled up in a piece of wash-leather, and tied round with string; I had other money with me as well—my wife was in Somersetshire—I went with my son-in-law to the Commercial Dock for a load of deal—as far as my knowledge goes, I parted with him about four—I cannot take my oath as to that—I have no recollection of seeing Murphy at the Waterman's Arms, or of being there that day—I had new seen Murphy before that day—I recollect calling a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at London-bridge—from the time I left my son-in-law, till then, I do not know what happen—I do not recollect being on a dray-cart with Murphy—Myers drove the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, I got into it; I had never seen him before—when I got into the cas Murphy jumped on to it—I asked him what he wanted, and he said he was a friend of the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi>, and was going a little way—he did not get into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, to my knowledge—the first thing I knew about his being in the <hi rend="italic">cab was</hi> when my trowsers were torn down at the left-hand side—I am quite positive I recollect that—we were then both in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I saw Murphy's hand passed from my pocket, and asked him for my money he had takes away—I felt in my pocket, and it was gone—he rushed out of the cob—I do not recollect what passed before he jumped out; it appears that I ran after him, and returned into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, but I have no knowledge of it—I do not know how I got back—I asked him to return me my money without any bother or <hi rend="italic">fuss</hi>, and told him I should call a policeman—he pretended not to know what I meant, and I called "Police!"—he turned round, took me by the collar, twisted me, held me with the left hand in the corner of the cob, and put the money through a door in the roof of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, which was a "Hanson," with his right hand, and I saw the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man receive it throng the roof—we both got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> together while it was going on, and</p>

Yesterday afternoon, half-past four o'clock, I wes at London-bridge. I called a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, which Myers drove, and directed him to drive me home; I had been drinking. The other prisoner got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> without my sanction. He said he was going with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man. The <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was driven about for four hours and a half. I suppose I was asleep; I fell into a sort of stupor. I was awoke by feeling something at my pocket, and found the left-hand trowsers pocket torn down, and I saw Murphy had a piece of wash-leather in his hand, in which I bad fifty sovereigns tied up when I got into the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> Murphy gave it to the other prisoner, who was driving. It was a "Hanson" <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and Murphy passed it up through the door in the roof. I told Myers to return it to me, and I said 1 would call the police. He pretended not to know what I meant. I called out for the police, and Murphy immediately laid hold of me to prevent my calling out, and then jumped out of the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> Myers immediately drove the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> on, whipping his horse, but I jumped out and followed Murphy, who went up Joiner-street, and stood against a wall, looking round, and said he did not know me, and asked me what I wanted. I gave him in charge. The <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was driven off, as fast as it could be, but a person followed it, and Myers was brought back. The money was tied up in a piece of wash-leather, and I am sure it was in my left-hand trowsers pocket when I got into the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> I must have fallen into the stupor the moment I got into the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> The last house I had been in, was halfway between Deptford and London Bridge, and I had walked from there to where I took the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> I was quite sensible when I got into the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> I recollect calling the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and, to the best of my know<lb></lb>ledge, about five o'clock. It was not dark. I have no recollection of going to a public-house, or getting out of the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> The first thing I recollect is when I got out after Murphy. I do not remember going down a court, and the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man coming after me. I do not remember being knocked down by Mur<lb></lb>phy after the constable took him. As far as I can recollect, Murphy was standing on the road near the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and got in as a friend of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man's. I had not been with him before. I had not seen him till I called the <hi rend="italic">cab."</hi> (<hi rend="italic">A subsequent deposition of the witness teas also read, as follows: "</hi> I have since found that it must have been about half-past seven instead of half-past four that I got into the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> Neither of the prisoners were known to me before this. I had been drinking brandy-and-water with my son-in-law; we had five or six glasses. I was not sober. I told Myers where to drive. I had been saving up my money, and my wife being out of town, I did not like to leave it at home. I had not pulled it out of my pocket. I have no knowledge of taking the prisoners into a public-house. I found a hole through the rim of my hat, and a bruise on my chest")—(<hi rend="italic">A further deposition was also read: "</hi> I remember feeling my money in</p>

I don't remember going anywhere after that, nor what time it was when I left there, nor seeing Murphy till I called the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> I could walk well enough when I left the Gregorian Arms. I have no recollection of anything that happened after I got into the <hi rend="italic">cabt</hi> till I found my trowsers being meddled with, and that roused me. I had the brace buttoned upon the button of my left-hand trowsers pocket, which made it difficult to unbutton that pocket; it was necessary to undo the brace first.")—I cannot tell which is true, whether I got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at five or at half-past seven—I cannot say how long I was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I did not state before the Magistrate that I was four hours and a half in the cab—I was sworn, and what I said was taken down—it was read over to me before I signed it—I was asked whether it was true or false, or whether I had anything to add or correct, and after I had kissed the book I signed it—I cannot say how long I was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I have no knowledge of pulling the bag and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of my pocket—I did not know I pulled it out at Mr. Evans's, and put it on the counter—the first I recollect of being in Murphy's company was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I was present when the witnesses were examined, and heard I was in his company from two to four o'clock—I have sworn, to the best of my knowledge—I do not recollect that Murphy knocked me down—I do not know that the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man himself drove to the station-house—I was not there—I have heard that he drove a party there—I have no recollection when Murphy and me got out of the <hi rend="italic">cabt</hi> or of Myers coming after us, and charging us as being two persons who wanted to evade paying.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Brook's-place, Lambeth. On Monday, 3d Sept., I was near the Cock and Bottle, and saw a man run down the court—I went to the other end of the court, met the man, and found it was Murphy—I had seen him before, and have no doubt he is the man—Satcher came up, and they went away together—I saw the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man come down the court—he demanded his fare, and they all went back together to the Cock and Bottle—I heard the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man say, "Who is to pay the fare?"—Murphy said, "Do not let us have anv <hi rend="italic">bother</hi> in the street, let us go to some public-house and settle it."</p>

On 3d Sept., about a quarter-past nine o'clock at night, I heard a cry of "Police!" and saw Murphy come running down the street—he stopped facing my house, and stood against the wall—Satcher followed, and laid hold of him by the collar—I asked what was the matter, and Satcher said he had stolen fifty sovereigns—the Cock and Bottle is about a quarter of a mile from Joiner-street—I also saw Myers' <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and there was an altercation—Myers said he was a stranger, and would <hi rend="italic">go</hi> to the station if any one would show him the way; and I said I would—we went—he went in, saying he would be out in a few minutes, and I minded the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> outside—two policemen then came and searched the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—from the time he went in till then, no one had been near it.</p>

I saw Shrode looking out at the parlour window; she asked me What I wanted? I desired she would let me in; she said She would not open the door; upon which I went backwards, and was helped over a back wall by Grubb, who followed me, and he helped me into the back parlour window. I then went into the passage, to let Grubb in at the door; but, just as I got to the door, I saw the two men, and the other woman, coming up stairs, out of the kitchen. Marshall was without his coat and waistcoat; he had a leather apron and a night-cap on, and his sleeves tucked up. Stead was without his coat, and his sleeves were tucked up, but he had his waistcoat on.

               <p>I heard somebody run up stairs before we got into the house. When we got in, I bid Young go up and secure them, and I myself went down into the kitchen. In the back kitchen I found the windows all blinded up; so was the chimney-piece: and in that kitchen I saw the stamping-press, and a candle alight, and a halfpenny just struck, which was between the dies. In the fore kitchen I found a great quantity of dies. The window of that kitchen was so blinded, that people could not see into it from the street.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120040"></xptr> We attempted to see, but could not. In the passage, under the stairs, there was a great quantity of blanks and copper, and a cutting-out press, and a candle also, lighted, by it. The men were stripped, and their hands were dirty.

Shrode, the old woman, ran to a chamber-pot, and wanted to wash her hands; but I would not let her, for her hands had the appearance of having been at work. There was a great sack of halfpence hanging up on one side of the stamping-press. There were twenty-six dies (producing them, and two that were in the press.)</p>

Marshall, when he was taken, begged for his clothes. I went down, and found his waistcoat below stairs, by the cutting press; and his hat and wig, and coat, in the front cellar, where the halfpence were found. When he was taken to the office, he owned that the hat, wig, and waistcoat, were his; and he put them on. There was a candle lighted at both presses. Moore's hands were dirty: whether the others were or not, I don't know; but I saw her run to the water to wash them. There were twelve pair of dies, besides those now produced.</p>

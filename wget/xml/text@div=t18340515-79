On the 26th of April I was cleaning the stairs - about two o'clock; my son paid the plumber's bill, which was 1l. 14s. - I received the change in two half-crowns and one shilling, which I laid on the stairs, when I had cleaned the stairs I went up, leaving the money there - the prisoner came up, and asked if I had any thing for No. 18, Hill-street - I had never seen him before - I said I had nothing, but I would ask the young people in the next room- they said they had nothing, and the prisoner went down stairs - I went down for the money, and it was gone - I went out, and found him in Berkeley-square, holding a horse - I walked up and down two or three times, to see for an officer - when the prisoner saw me, he called a lad, and gave the horse to him, and he ran away - I collared him, and said if he chose to give me what he had taken from the stairs, well and good; if not, I would give charge of him - he said he had not taken any thing - he was then taken, and in his waistcoat pocket were found two half-crowns and one shilling.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How much did you first say you had lost? A. I first said it was two half-crowns and a sixpence - I was not certain at the moment, as I ran away in a flurry - the plumber's bill was 1l. 14s. 3d., and I was not certain whether he had taken the three-pence or not, but he had not - no one went up the stairs but the prisoner - I cannot tell whether any one came down.</p>

            . I am a police-constable. I took the prisoner about two o'clock - he was stopped, and the prosecutor was in front of him - he was not running - this is my deposition (looking at it), it was read to me - I did not understand that it was read that I saw him running; it must have been a mistake - the prosecutrix said he had robbed her of five shillings and sixpence - in going along, the prisoner said, "Do not let me go to prison - I have plenty of money about me; if you will tell me what you have lost, I will give it you" - the prosecutrix wanted to take the money, but I would not allow it - I found two half-crowns and a shilling in one pocket, and in another pocket three sovereigns and about 1l. worth of silver - I went to No. 18, Hill-street- I found he had been sent by the butler for the linen.</p>

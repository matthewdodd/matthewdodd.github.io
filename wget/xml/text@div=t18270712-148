            . I am a druggist. Timson was at my shop, and as she went out I heard something fall from her, at my door - it sounded like a sovereign. I went out- and a boy said the prisoner had picked up the money; I ran round the corner and seized him. I had seen him pick something up - he said he would not give it up; he was afterwards brought to my shop, and said he would give it up if she could swear she had dropped it - he said he would go to the Magistrate to decide it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not run away - I said if she could prove she had lost one I would give her one, if Davis would be answerable for it - as I could prove it was mine.</p>

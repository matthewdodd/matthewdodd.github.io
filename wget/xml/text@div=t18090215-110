Yes; the prisoner came to me I believe, on the 10th for the money; my wife paid the money; I throwed down a guinea, and my wife throwed down four shillings; I asked about a receipt for the twenty five shillings; he said I cannot write, as soon as I get home I will strike it out of the book. I knowing the man, and Mr. Roberts having a stable close to Barnet Hill, I thought all would be right.</p>
               <p>Q. How was this hay delivered - A. He brought it in a cart, and

               <p>Q. to Webber. Is there any entry in that book of that one pounds five shillings being paid by Mr. Moore - A. Never; I never received any account that he had been paid by Moore; if I had I should have entered it in the book.</p>

I asked him if he had ever received it, he said it was left for Mr. Roberts to fix the price, Mr. Roberts was to make the charge.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been an accountant - A. Ever since he has been in Mr. Roberts' employ, three years and a half.</p>

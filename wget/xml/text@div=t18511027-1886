                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Emms, and live at 21, Booth-street, Mile End New-town. On Monday, 29th Sept. I went out about half-past 11 o'clock in the morning—I left my drawers all shut and locked, and the door was well secured—I observed two boys on the opposite side of the way as I went out; I did not take particular notice of them—I should not know them again—I returned again about ten minutes before one, and found my door open; my drawers were all open—I missed 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the clothes were taken out of the drawers and packed up on a chair, ready the taken away.</p>

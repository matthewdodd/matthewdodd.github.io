I let him a room on the second floor, with another young man, he was to pay 2 s. a week for half the bed. On the 30th of October, he was going away, he owed me 5 s., he came down with a bundle, I asked what was in it, he said some dirty things; I said I wished to see them, he refused, and went up stairs, I followed him, and saw feathers scattered about the ticking which had been ripped open, and feathers taken out. I sent for a constable, we found 2 lbs. of feathers in the bundle - he was gone away then, and had put the bundle into Wood's box, and was taken four day's after; they were taken from the bed in which he slept.</p>

On the morning of the 3d of February, I was informed, two men in a boat had taken a spar, I went down and missed one from the raft. I went down in the Thames-police boat, and boarded a lighter in which were the prisoners and some chips, which corresponded with my timber. One of them said, they must have fallen on board from some vessel that was alongside. They appeared recently taken off the wood. We found an axe on board which corresponded with the chips, the notches in the edge of the axe corresponded. A bargeman came up and said, a waterman had picked up the spar, we sent a boat down and found it: it is above thirty feetlong. I should know it from a hundred. I have cut off one end of it to bring here. I cannot swear to the chips, but are the same quality of wood.</p>

            . I went with Mr. Massie, to look for the spar, we boarded a lighter which the prisoners were in. I asked, where the chips came from: one of them said, he supposed they came out of some ship. I saw a parcel of the same sort of chips floating.

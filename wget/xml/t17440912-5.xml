            . I live at the three Cups in Holborn; on the 10th of July the Prisoner (who was my <rs id="t17440912-5-deflabel25" type="occupation">servant</rs>

On the 22d of July I went to put a bank note into the drawer and missed this purse. I examined the Prisoner concerning it, she looked a little confounded at first, and wondered I should mistrust her, more than any other person in the house? I told her because there was nobody came into the room but herself, (I heard she had let other people into the house to lie there) when I went to the drawer the key did not easily unlock it, and since she has been taken , there was another key found behind the door, which opened it as well as my own. - There was nothing found in her possession.</p>

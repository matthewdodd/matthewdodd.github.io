On the 14th of October, two weights were stolen from my shop, after seven o'clock in the evening. I found them next morning, in Worms' back premises - they keep a marine store shop, in Fox's-court; about a hundred yards from my house. I called on them, and asked if they had lately bought two weights - the prisoner Henry said, we have not; the son said,</p>
               <p>"We have, father," and fetched them out - the boy who took them received 3 1/2 d. a piece for them; they are worth 2 s. 3 d. each. The boy who took the weights is named Ballard. I told the prisoners they ought to know better than to purchase such things of a boy. The father said to the son,</p>
               <p>"If you have bought them, fetch them;" the son said,</p>
               <p>"You gave me 2 d. to help pay for the last weight I bought" - he did not deny it at the time, but he did at Hatton-garden. Ballard said he received 2 d. from the elder prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did Ballard go with you to Worms's shop - A. Yes; he said he took one at a time, and another afterwards, that the younger prisoner gave him 3 1/2 d. each for them, and that the son got 2 d. from the father, in part payment for one. I do not know whether the weights are standard - I have not had them tried since they were stolen. The younger prisoner said his father was not at home at the time.</p>

            . I first took one weight to Fox's-court to sell; I took it out of Bye's shop. I saw young Worms, who gave me 3 1/2 d. for it. He asked if I had any thing else to sell; I said, Yes, and he said,</p>
               <p>"Go and fetch it." When I brought the second weight, he said he had only 1 1/2 d., and went to his father for 2 d. to make up the sum.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the father present - A. Yes, he was in the shop when the son asked for the halfpence to pay for the second weight; he was not there when I took the first. It is a large shop, and he was attending to his business: it was between eight and nine o'clock in the evening. Old Worms took the 2 d. out of his pocket.</p>

On the evening of last Tuesday fortnight, the elder prisoner was at our house; he had two glasses of gin and water, a pint of half and half, and two pipes of tobacco. I am sure he was there after nine o'clock that evening, because I take out my beer exactly at nine, and I found him there when I returned - I believe he had been there a length of time, but I cannot say. He was taken to Hatton-garden Office next morning, and I was sent over as a witness.</p>

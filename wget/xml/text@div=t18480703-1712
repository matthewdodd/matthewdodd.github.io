                  </hi>. I am a short-hand writer. I attended a meeting held in Bishop Bonner's-fields on Sunday afternoon, 4th June—I should think the meeting consisted of from five to seven thousand, as near as I could judge—it commenced shortly after three o'clock—the meeting was addressed by several persons from a natural mound on the Common—I saw a person there whose name I think is Curtain, who acted as chairman—a person named Henry Jones addressed the meeting—I took a short-hand note of his speech—I have not read it since the meeting—this is a transcript of it—I have compared it with my notes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WELSBY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Sharpe follow Henry Jones? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have the original notes of that, and also the transcript here—I have compared the transcript with my notes (<hi rend="italic">reading from his notes</hi>)—Sharpe said, "You still find that I am here to-day to give the lie to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, when I tell them I am always prepared to attend public meetings, to perform my duty. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper seems to <hi rend="italic">chuckle</hi> because I was not on Clerkenwell-green last Monday night. If I could have divided myself I should have been there, and likewise at a large and enthusiastic meeting at Greenwich; but it was impossible, if I had divided myself, that I could enjoy the liberty of speech, and therefore I was obliged to be at Greenwich; and that accounts for my absence from Clerkenwell-green. The gentleman who preceded me has stated that the English and Irish would continue in unity. I beg to state, that ever since the English working man has understood the oppression he labours under, and ever since the Irish peasant has known the degradation he suffered, I must declare here they have always been in unity; and by remaining in unity they are determined to destroy the power of the base bloody, brutal, and tyrannical Government. I am convinced that the English and Irish are in unity, and the interest of one is identified with the interest of the other; and if you recollect (those who were here on last Sunday afe-noon) I proposed a resolution bearing on the very subject. I spoke at great length concerning the prosecution of John Mitchell, and I believe I was not at all merciful in dealing out my remarks to <hi rend="italic">those</hi> bloody government that rules the country at the present time; and as far as my abilities would admit I lashed them as well as I could; and I am here to-day to speak briefly is seconding this resolution, because you will all understand that our meeting—that is, the Chartist meeting with which I am connected, will commence at five o'clock, and then I shall be prepared to tell the Government such a tale, not at all novel perhaps; but although it may be a repetition of the tale, and if the Government consider that I tell it too often, they will not stop my mouth by confining me in prison; for I will be equally as dangerous there, if I can have any communication with my fellow-prisoners; for I am sure to teach my doctrines wherever I go. I will contaminate every man I come in contact with, and I will tell every man, that the destruction of this Government is essentially necessary for the well-being of society; we are all working-men, we support the Government, the Church and State and pay twenty-eight millions per annum for the interest of the national debt; now, we knowing, that the source of all wealth comes from the toil of the working-man, we, as working-men, have a right to look at the sys<lb></lb>tem of Government; we have a right to look how the machinery is set to work, and if there is anything out of order in that machinery; we, as good mechanics, artizans, and mechanics, have a right to put it in order, and I think the union of the Irishmen and Englishmen will be so consolidated, that ere long, the Government will tremble at their power. Permit me to make a few remarks with respect to the meetings which have taken place during the last week; I have no doubt many of you, who were at those meetings and many who were absent,—you have feelings alike with us, and are some<lb></lb>what interested, and you are somewhat excited, and want to know, during this period of excitement, the actual position in which you are placeu. Permit me to endeavour to show you: you will recollect, but a very few nights buck, Lord John Russell made a'declaration in the House of Com<lb></lb>mons, that the working-classes of England were not desirous of reform—(A Voice: He is a liar)—when he made that declaration he told an abominable lie; but it is not unusual for Lord John Russell to tell lies; he is the greatest</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030079"></xptr>
               <p>scoundrel that ever sat in the House of commons; he ought to be transported. He has transported John Mitchell for recommending that which he recom<lb></lb>mended prior to the passing of the Reform Bill—what was the deleration of Lord John Rusell? He said, "If they do not concede reform, I will be the colonel of the yeomanry, and the yeomanry shall lead the people; and their combined power shall destroy the aristocracy." These are Lord John Russ<lb></lb>ell's own words; and if he was justified in 1829, and 1830, in making use of such expressions, I have a right, as a working-man, to recommend people to resort to ulterior measures, which are calculated to proscribe this damnable power with which the Government rules the country. Permit me to say, with respect to the meetings on Monday evening, there is not one person who attended the meeting, on Stepney-green and Clerkenwell-green, who was aware that a procession would take place; it was only known among those men who could be trusted"—here a cry of "Police"was raised, and several persons ran away—the speaker then proceeded to say "Gentleman, is this way you wish to display you patriotism; is at because a few idle boys, or some scoundrel connected with Government, raise the cry of 'Police!' that you must run away across the fields like a number of scared rats. I am ashamed of you. It is not you who will be injured, it is those men who have the hardihood to come forward and address such meetings in the time, of danger, and these are the men that the Government want to entrap, and these are the men who are prepared for any circumstances that may arise, these men feeling assured, that if the <hi rend="italic">Government</hi> are inclined to imprison them, there are other men willing and prepared to take their places; as the people should always be taught the injuries they labour under, and the best method of destrouying the power that oppresses them With regard to the procession that took place on Monday evening, the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper said it was 10, 000 but you are aware that that night there were not less than 150, 000 indi<lb></lb>viduals who composed that procession; and said our only idea and intention the papers have called us destructives, and said our only idea and intention was to make confusion and riot; not proved that working-men, when they have a demonstration are determind to show the Government that they are desirous to respect porperty, and only disrespect the power which <hi rend="italic">causes</hi> their degradation"—I have the word "causes," not "seeks"—my note is very distinct—I so understood the speaker—" I heard that when about twelve o'clock 6, 000 individuals met in Redcross-street, and a friend of mine addressed them from a window, about 100 policeman, with truncheons ready for action, dispersed this body of people in about seven or eight minutes, and he says he saw when the mob was dispersed, he looked about, and saw twenty or thirdy individuals"—I have it in my notes, (<hi rend="italic">the transcript was "seven or eight individuals, "</hi>) the words, "seven or eight minutes" occurred just before, that accounts for the mistake-" who were scarcely able to move on account of the severe knocking about they had received from the police; I was not there, and I mean what I say; and as you have listened to me Sunday after Sunday, you must be aware of the fact, that if I had been placed in that situation, I would have recommended the mass of people to make an opening admitted them all, and have enclosed them all; and if they had done, as I would have done, very few of them would have come out"—it is not "should have come out"—" but this brutal and bloody force, when they find the people meet unarmed, are ready to take advantage; but the time (not "day") is fast approaching, when it may be necessary for that force to beg mercy from the hands of the people, and I hope they will then be as generous with their mercy towards.</p>

               <p>them as they have been towards us. Now, my friends, the Government was completely paralysed; the Government was not aware of such a demon<lb></lb>stration; and one of the liberal members of the Parliament met with no less a personage than one of the executive, (I have no occasion to mention his name,) and he says, 'Good God, Mr.----, what was that procession about last night?' He said, 'Had you surrounded the House of Commons, we must have been compelled to run from it.' When this was told me, I very much regretted that I was at Greenwich, instead of being amons you; for had I been amongst you, I would have been the man to say, 'Come, and surround the House of Commons, not to injure any of the members, but to convince them that we are desirous of reform.' With respect to the meeting, on Tuesday night, I was disengaged, and wished to give the lie to the <hi rend="italic">Times;</hi> and after hearing of the brutality exercised towards the people, I went to Clerkenwell-green. and was the second man to address that large concourse of people; and when I got up, so the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> reports, I spoke openly and advisedly, and likewise I begged the people, who were listen<lb></lb>ing to me; that if thev did not understand they would please to imagine, I will tell you precisely what I said, and I spoke in particular with regard to the brutality of the police on the previous night; and I showed the policemen that they placed themselves in a false position; and I told the people then, if I had been with them on the previous night, I would have recommended them to act on the defensive; this was my recommendation then, and this is my recommendation now. I would not recommend any man to strike or insult a policeman, but if they strike or insult you, if there are not stones, there are better and more formidable weapons. You will often find about the streets of London plenty of railings before the houses; let every man only—when necessary grasp one, and all pull together, and you have then got a weapon better than any policeman's truncheon—it will take a policeman five or six times to strike a man before he quiets him with his truncheon: but only strike a policeman once with such a weapon as I have recommended, and you will soon silence him. This is my recommendation only when it is necessary. I would not recommend you to do so now, there is no occasion;" (the words are not "it is not necessary.") "although we have policemen and soldiers in the neighbourhood, for a peaceable meeting of this kind does not require their interference, they will not come out now. You must excuse me addressing you any longer, I commence again at five o'clock, and I shall be prepared then to give the Government a good horsewhipping; but I hope you will remain here till the other meeting begins; and what with the power we have now, and the power to come up, it will be the largest meeting I ever saw in Bishop Bonner's-fields; and the public mind is so excited, "that I believe Sunday after Sunday the meetings will increase. What power can prevent men from meeting and discussing their grievances. The day is too far gone when the sight of a policeman's truncheon, or a soldier dressed in a scarlet jacket, will stop the mouths of the working-classes. The resolution I most cordially second, believing every one of you sympathise with that man as much as I do myself; and in the wording of the resolution, he has committed no crime, but only taught the people their duty: he gave them such political instruction, as was essentially necessary for the Irish people to establish their independence; and I enjoin; all men, all Englishmen and Scotchmen, as well as Irishmen, to raise the cry "—then the prisoner recited two or three lines of verse, toe whole of which I did not get—I only took the words, "To raise the cry of brave Ireland shall be free and great."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did other speakers follow Sharpe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it continued until about five o'clock—I should say the number of persons present increased during that time—the speeches were received with shouts and applause by the meeting.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>, Did you observe what class of persons the crowd chiefly consisted of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was an admixture of all classes—a great many persons appeared to be dressed in their Sunday clothes, walking about the place, perhaps for their own amusement, and there were many very ill-dressed, those who were principally about the speakers; it was those more immediately about the speakers that applauded—many of them appeared to be Irishmen from their conversation—I remained there till the other meeting that Sharpe referred to, the Chartist meeting, commenced—I heard Sharpe speak at that meeting also—I was not present at the commencement of his speech—Ernest Jones also addressed that meeting—I should Say the numbers had then increased, but not very materially—the first meeting dispersed for some time, perhaps, for about half an hour, and the persons who attended it were scat<lb></lb>tered about the Common—after that interval the speakers repaired again to the sound for the purpose of addressing the people—Ernest Jones spoke from that mound—he followed Sharpe—I have not got a note of what Sharpe said—I was not there at the commencement of that meeting—I have Jones's speech—Mr. "White took the whole of Sharpe's speech—I did not observe what became of Sharpe during the half-hour—I did not take any notice of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you remain till the police attempted to disperse the meeting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I left as soon as the meeting dispersed; it broke up of itself after the address of Mr. Jones—I mean the second meeting which commenced about a quarter to six o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you observe whether any number of the persons moved towards the Church when the meeting broke up as you have described? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We were not very far from the Church—I did not pay any particular attention—Mr. White and myself walked away as fast as we could from the meeting—there were a good many persons in that direction when we left the meeting, and there were some observations made about some policemen being in the Church—those observations were made by Henry Jones, and I think by other of the speakers as well, at the first meeting—I recollect Henry Jones at the first meeting saying that the Church was desecrated by being filled with policemen for the purpose of suppressing the meeting, or something to that effect—that was said in Sharpe's presence and hearing.</p>

               <p>evidently decent people, taking their Sunday walk, and I should fancy had nothing to do with this transaction—there were very few people about the speakers when the meeting first commenced—I think there were from 5, 000 to 7, 000 on the Common altogether—the smaller portion of them were the badly clad—in my opinion, by far the greater portion were persons who were walking about and taking their usual Sunday recreation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From the time that you were there, until you left in Mr. White's com<lb></lb>pany, was all peaceable and orderly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, as far as I saw-—we left the first meeting shortly after five o'clock, and returned again shortly after to the second meeting—at the end of that meeting the people left and dispersed about the Common—the people who attended the second meeting were of just the same class—Mr. White and I walked away directly the speakers had left the mound—there was a room kept for us at the City of Paris Inn, in the neighbourhood, which commanded a view of the Common, and we had bor<lb></lb>rowed a table and two chairs for the purpose of writing on in the field—we em<lb></lb>ployed some men to take them back, and we went with them—we stayed there nearly an hour—we had a view of the Common from the window of the inn—all was peaceable when we left at the end of the hour, but there had been some disturbance in the interim, I believe; I did not see any—about a quarter of an hour after we left the Common, I heard a great noise and shouting of "Police!" whilst we were at the inn; there was a cry that the police were charging the people—I looked out of the window and saw the police running after the people, who were running away—I did not see them use their truncheons—they had them in their hands—they were at some con<lb></lb>siderable distance from us—I saw women among the persons who were run<lb></lb>ning away—the police were on the Common, running from the direction of the Church, and about 200 or 300 yards from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With reference to the report you have read, did you in the first instance furnish the whole of that report to the solicitor for the Crown? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was standing when I took my report—I had a policeman's back to write upon—there was no pushing to and fro to any great extent—I was protected by three or four policemen, in plain clothes, who stood around me—I went there for the purpose of reporting the meeting for the Crown—in my report I have the words," But this brutal and bloody force, when they find the people meet unarmed, are ready to take advantage; but the time is fast approaching when it may be necessary for that force to beg mercy from the hands of the people."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, were not these the words the speaker then used, "And I hope they will then be more generous with their mercy towards them than they have been towards us?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I took the words as I heard them and as I have read them—I have no interest in the matter—it is possible I may have mistaken what he said—I may have misunderstood him, it is possible—he also said, "Permit me to say, with respect to the meeting on Monday evening, that there was not one person who attended the meeting on Stepney-green and Clerkenwell-green who was aware that a procession would take place"—I did not hear him add, "It was only known among those men who could be trusted for prudence and love of order"—if I had heard them I should have taken them; and Sharpe is an easy speaker, he spoke rather deliberately than otherwise—there were at times swells in the noise of the people while he was speaking—I would not swear that I took every syllable he uttered—I had often to appeal to the people around me, to enable me to write.</p>

What have they done to John Mitchell I or what has he done to them? His only crime was, for loving his native land, the land of his forefathers. They have made that an outrage and a crime, and they have packed a Jury by a juggler of a Sheriff, and they have transported him for fourteen years beyond the seas! What for? Because he loved his country. They did not stop there, but they desecrated the home of his wife and six children. When they sentenced him to transportation, they sent a hand of ruffians to his home, and while his wife was standing in her home, <hi rend="italic">bereaving</hi> the loss as she stood in the room, the ruffians came in to rob her of whatever little property belonged to her.

"We have called our countrymen a home cowards, because they have left their native soil; but vengeance is ours, by the Lord!"—as I have got it, but I wish you distinctly to understand that these passages I am now reading I cannot positively swear to, they were taken while I was sitting on the ground, and the people all about me—"This is the last meeting the Irishmen will hold in London or any other place. This is the last meeting of the Irish.

Gentlemen, recollect this is not a meeting of a sect or of a party; this is a meeting of the English Chartist body, and of the Irish Confederation; Englishmen and Irishmen have all one evil to complain of; it is one tyranny, one despotism, that is sucking the vitals of the people of the two countries: let not Englishmen forget the [<hi rend="italic">blank</hi>]; as an Eng<lb></lb>lishman, I solemnly declare that I have no interest in any measure, in any treaty, any public negotiation which the aristocratical Government of this country will make; I have no interest in it. Englishmen, I call on you, as you love your freedom, look at that brave people; they put a man on the throne, having confidence"—I believe he was referring to France—I see that something is omitted by my book—I could not hear—" the fellow violated the confidence that was reposed in him, and that people acted as a noble example, that all people similarly situated ought to follow—to drive a tyran<lb></lb>nical Sovereign, wherever or whatever he is, from the throne. Thanks be to God. we have not a tyrannical Sovereign here; we wish no ill to the lady that fills the throne of this country; we have the most unbounded respect for her person; but by all that is good and holy, we will drive into a state of exile, or something else, the Whig ministry, so that they will not have the power of doing----"—I think it is "harm to anybody; I am quite aware of the responsible position I am standing in in the presence of a noble band of patriots, among whom is gathering the scribes, the penners, and myrmi<lb></lb>dons of the Government; and if I could single out those men, I would ask them to stand by my right-hand, to take a note of every word I say"—I did not write this part out, it is so obscure—" for I wish the executive in Downing-street to know that the day is come when"—then I have a very long blank; I have made a note to that effect; it was caused by confusion of some kind—I was pushed down repeatedly—the next I have is, "I assert this fact, the Union was made for the benefit of the aristocracy"—then I have another blank—the</p>

                  </hi>. I am the incumbent of St. James's Church, in Victoria-park. On Sunday afternoon, 4th June, I was officiating in my Church—the service commenced at three o'clock—I recollect the inspector, with a certain number of police, coming into the Church during the service—I came out from the Church about half-past four—there were then some thousands of people on the Green—the most part of them were near the Church—my house is very near the Church—I could see the meeting from my house—I saw persons addressing the meeting during the course of the afternoon, or rather in the evening—the speeches concluded about a quarter-past seven—the centre of the meeting then separated, and a great portion of them came towards the Church—the next thing of most importance that I witnessed was the throwing the stones at Mr. Inspector Waller, and the windows of the Church—a great many of the panes were broken—I then saw Inspector Waller go into the churchyard, and the police were brought out from the churchyard—they proceeded to disperse the mob—a great portion of the mob ran away—many of them remained behind, and some of them must have resisted the police—I saw the police issue forth with their trun<lb></lb>cheons, and I observed the mob dispersing, and the field in great excitement—a portion of the mob continued on the ground—the conflict with the police was at a great distance from me—I saw a great muster of the people at a dis<lb></lb>tance, and the police proceeding against them—they were at too great a distance for me to individualize them—the next thing of importance which I observed was the return of the police with the prisoners.</p>

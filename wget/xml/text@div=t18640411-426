I examined the prosecutor's premises on the morning of 3d March—in my opinion, an entrance had been effected by a duplicate key at the side door—the front window had been broken, and the back window of the kitchen had been opened, and there were foot-marks which I could trace over the leads to a court, to Barford's-buildings, Earle-street—there were also marks down the face of the wall—the water-pipes in the kitchen were cut asunder—the shop was in great confusion, and some of the boxes emptied—I heard Marshall make a statement at the station; he said, "I was in East-lane, Walworth, about 8 o'clock; I met a man who asked me whether I knew anybody who had a horse and van to let. I said, 'I have got one.' He then went with me to the stables, and we got the horse in the yard, and then we got the van. I then went with him as far as London-bridge, when I got down to make water, and when I returned the horse and van were gone. The name on the van was 'George Hunt, Haville-street, Southampton-street, Camberwell.' "I examined the van; there was no such name on it; there was "Camberwell, Surrey," on the side, and "Coleman," on the front of it—there were marks of something having been nainted out—Marshall stated that ho had lost the van about 9 o'clock.</p>

               <p>Court. A Gold Watch?</p>
               <p>Mr. Arnold. Yes; there were two Seals hanging to it, one was a Cornelian, with my Coat of Arms, and the other a Chrystal with Cicero's Head.

I went to see the Prisoner in the Press-Yard, in Newgate, and knew him at first Sight.</p>

               <p>Mr. Arnold. I was not on that side next him when he robb'd me, so that I had a full view of his Face. The Gentleman who was with me in the Chariot, is now out of Town.</p>

They at first talk'd of getting a Warrant to go by Water to Greenwich; but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173209060027"></xptr> afterwards said, they would stay till Master Jacky came. However, they went away between 12 and 1, and charged me to take care of the Parrot, and to desire Jacky, when he came, to stay there for them.</p>
               <p>Next Morning Mr. Bays came from High-gate, to enquire after the Prisoner, and Stannet, and Jacky, and told me that Jacky had robb'd him of 40 or 50 l. Jacky came about 9 o'Clock. Mr. Bays seiz'd him, and he confess'd that he had stolen the Goods, and that they were all in the Trunk. Soon after a Waterman brought this Letter* for Jacky. 'Tis directed for John Carbury, but he goes by the Name of Conan. The Waterman said, that the Person he had it from was in his Boat. I look'd out of Window, and saw the Prisoner in the Boat; upon which the Constable went down and took him. When the Prisoner came up, he said to Mr. Bays, Billy, if Jacky has done this foolish Thing, and you can have your Goods again, I hope you will give him no farther Trouble. We ask'd the Prisoner, whose Things they were in the Box and Trunk? And he said, they belong'd to the Gentlewoman [Stannet .]</p>

In the Trunk or Box, I know not which, we found, among other Things, 2 Seals, and 2 Rings, one of them a Diamond Ring. Madam said before the Justice, that the Seals were old Family Seals of little Worth, and that the Rings were her own. As those Seals were own'd by no Body else, they were deliver'd to the Care of

               <p>Prisoner. In order, did you see me take it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Pedley. Yes; it was a Green Purse, and I saw some Gold in it.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Wingfield. When the Prisoner had robb'd Mr. Pedley, he came to me, and in very rough Language demanded my Purse and Rings. I had no Rings, but gave him my Purse.

               <p>Mrs. Wingfield. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. And pray what Horse did I ride?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wingfield. A bright Bay, with a black Main and Tail.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Well, I must not be suffer'd to stay till I can have my Witnesses, and therefore I am incapable of defending my self any longer; 'tis very hard. But are you sure, Madam, that I am the Man?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wingfield. Yes, very sure; I knew you again, the first time I saw you in the Press-Yard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Pray, Madam, what have these Whores-Birds given you to swear all this? Are you Mr. Pedley's Wife?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wingfield. No; but I am a near Relation.</p>

               <p>Mr. Serjeant. On the 1st of August, I found these Rings in the Prisoner's Box, at the Fox in Hungerford-Market. I traced out Mr. Champion by the Arms on his Seal (for he had been robb'd of his Watch and Seal) and he describ'd the Rings to me before he saw them.</p>

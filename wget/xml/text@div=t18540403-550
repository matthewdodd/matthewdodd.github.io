                  </hi>. I am a gunner and driver, in the artillery stationed at Woolwich. The prisoner is a gunner in the same regiment—on 20th Feb. I received a letter from my father, with an order, but it was not correct, and the sergeant advised me, in the prisoner's presence, to send it back, which I did on 21st Feb.; and not receiving any reply, I wrote on 5th March, and received an answer—I afterwards went to the post office on the 6th, and found that the order had been cashed—on 24th Feb., the prisoner had charge of the barrack room; that is, he was cook during the day, and had to take care of all things belonging to the men, and deliver them when they came from drill—we were all out on drill on the 24th, and he was alone in the room—when we returned, I found him there, and asked him if he had received any letters for me, and he said "No"—it was his duty to receive the letters—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the order.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the father of the last witness—I forwarded this order to him on 16th Feb., and it was returned to me, through a mis<lb></lb>take of the postmaster at Falmouth—I went to the postmaster with it, he ordered me to in close it again, and it would be all right; I did so, and sent a letter at the same time—I afterwards wrote a note to my son to tell him I had had no reply, and he said he had never received it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bombardier in the artillery; that is the first promotion from the ranks; it is between a private and a corporal—there, are no bombardiers except in the artillery—I received the letters in the month of February—the man who has charge of the barrack room during the absence of the men on drill, is not supposed to quit the room except on duty; and if he goes out, he is supposed to lock the door and carry the key with him—if he goes out to a shop, or to the cooking house; if any letters are left in the room, he has charge of them—he is in charge of every thing, and receives letters for the men when they are out on drill—I do not recollect the prisoner being in charge on the 24th—I recollect well delivering a letter to the artilleryman in charge of the room, it was the first letter which contained the post office order, which did not agree with the letter of advice—I think I delivered a letter to Westron about eight days after the first—I think those were the only two letters—Westron was in the hospital when I took the first letter; but finding that he was dis<lb></lb>charged, I took it to the barracks—about a week afterwards I delivered another letter, directed "James Westron"—I know it was in the same writing, for he has letters very often.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the postmaster at Woolwich—Westron brought me this order in February, there was some informality in it which required correction, and it was given back to him to get it corrected—after that, on 25th Feb., the prisoner brought the order, and my husband cashed it; he came at the time the bag was being made up, and I told him he must wait till it was made up—I looked at the order, and told him it had not been corrected—I had not seen it corrected, and I only told him so from memory—he seemed put. out about it, because I did not pay it; and my husband came up, and I think he said it had been corrected—I left the prisoner before my husband came—I saw my husband look at the back, and examine it, and he produced the letter—I saw my husband pay the prisoner some money—I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

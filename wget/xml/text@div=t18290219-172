On the 31st of January the prisoner, who was in my employ, came to me and said, "Sir, I have done something that is wrong, and I hope you will forgive me;" I asked what it was - he said a person in Aldersgate-street had asked him to bring a lock to look at the works of it; I said, "Have you taken one?" he said Yes; I said,"By whose authority?" he said he had no authority, and the person had detained it; I asked what he said; he said he told them his master sold them for 18s. but he should have it for 8s. I told him to go to work - which he did; Mr. Pullen came and asked me about it.</p>

About twenty-five minutes after six on 10th April I was going home along Kingsland-road, my duty was over—I met the prisoner carrying this clock under his left arm, he was on the oppo<lb></lb>site side of the way—I followed him, stopped him and asked him what he was carrying, he said, "I have got a clock—I have been to fetch it for my father from a gentleman's house in Kingsland"—I did not feel satisfied and took him to the station, he gave me the address of a gentleman at 7, Ock<lb></lb>field-terrace, Kingsland—I made enquiry; there is no such place as No. 7, Ockfield-terrace.</p>

I have the care of the chapel and schools in Southgate-road—on the evening of 9th April I locked up the school about nine or a little after—I saw it a little before seven next morning, and observed that the ventilator of the window had been taken out and a door unlocked on the inside, the ventilator being taken out would give the means</p>

I offered to assist him and carried it; he said he could not get any further, he would wait and get something at a chemist's shop. I was not aware I had fallen into a trap till the constable came to me.</p>

In consequence of information from Howell I came into the shop - I waited about the door till the prisoners were going out, and then detained them; I took them to the back shop - they went quietly, but one of them appeared confused when I spoke to them; I did not see Ann do any thing when she came from the counter, I am quite sure of that; I spoke to them, and asked how many pieces of ribbon they had got; Ann held herself down, and I saw she had a handkerchief and a bag in her hand - she gave me this half-piece of ribbon; I then said to Alice, "How many have you got?" she said, "We have got no more, Sir;" I asked them to walk up higher in the warehouse - I again asked Alice, and told her I had seen her several times, and always suspected that she stole ribbons; I felt their pockets, and found nothing, but in about ten minutes I lifted up Ann's cloak, and found this other half-piece under her arm; they were shown to the shopman.</p>

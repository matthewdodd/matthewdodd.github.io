On Sunday evening, the 1st of October, a few minutes before six o'clock, I went to the chapel with my wife, leaving nobody in the house - we bolted the back door, and the front kitchen door, came out at the street door, and double locked it - I took the key in my pocket; the shutters were fastened - it was just twilight. I returned a few minutes to eight o'clock. and found the street door as I had left it, but the front kitchen window, in the area, was open; I had fastened it myself before I went out - there is no fastening to the shutter, but there are two small sashes - a bar goes into one to keep the other from sliding back; a square of glass in the sash was rather starred before, but on coming home it was taken out, the bar moved, and the window open - there was no hole in the glass before. When we came in we kicked against some things on the floor - it was two pairs of breeches, a pair of trousers, a waistcoat, and a pelisse; these were on the parlour floor, and were not there when we went out; we got a light, and the first thing we saw was, a little cupboard door in the parlour standing open - I found six silver tea-spoons gone from there; I went up to the bed-room, and found the drawers pulled half out of the bureau - they were not locked; I missed two great coats, some cotton bed-furniture, two yards of black silk, and two table-cloths - there was a pair of gloves in my great coat pocket; I missed some powder-flasks from the parlour side-board, and five keys, belonging to the burial-ground office, were taken away. I informed a watchman of it that night, and found the prisoner at Worship-street next morning, with the property. I knew him before - we knew very little of him, but were intimately acquainted with his mother, who is a tambour-worker, living at Homerton. Brick-lane is nearly a mile from my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you certain at what time you left your house? A. Yes - it did not want a quarter to six, for the clock was just before me; it was getting twilight, and was light enough to see a man's face if he was near. I have known his mother four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182610260015"></xptr>years - she has known my wife thiry years - we visited; I believe her to be very respectable - she is a widow.</p>

            . I am a constable of Christchurch, Spitalfields. On Sunday evening, the 1st of October, about eight o'clock, I and Barrs were on duty in Brick-lane, and the prisoner passed us - he had on a great coat, which I thought did not fit him, and I followed him; he took the first turning to the right, and ran; I overtook him, and asked what he had got - he said his own property; his pocket on the left side seemed bulky - he said he had got a shirt; I felt outside his coat, and found there was something else - I took him to a public-house, searched him, and found a purse, with 10s. 6d. in silver in it, also six silver spoons, a powder-flask, with powder, a shot-pouch, with shot in it, four handkerchiefs, a pair of stockings, a pair of gloves, an apron, a piece of black silk, a tobacco-stopper, and eleven or thirteen common keys - he had the great coat on: I also found on him two screwdrivers, a large chisel, and a phosphorus-box; he was nearly a mile from the prosecutor's. I took him to the watch-house. I produce the property.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I received the bundle from Arrowsmith, and left it in his yard - Parish took it up - it contained my bed-furniture. I went to chapel with my husband, leaving the house secure. I missed a steel purse, a pair of cotton stockings, four handkerchiefs, a shift, two yards of silk, a white apron, marked with my name, and this tent bed-furniture, which had been worn some years; I believe it to be worth more than 1l. - it was dirty: we lost two great coats.

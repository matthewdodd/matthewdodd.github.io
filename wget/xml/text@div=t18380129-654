The prisoner was my shopman, and intrusted to take money—it was his business to take the money in the shop—on the 18th of January, in consequence of some cir<lb></lb>cumstances, I charged him before the police-officer with taking a half-crown from the till—I missed a half-crown—he said at first that he had not taken it.</p>

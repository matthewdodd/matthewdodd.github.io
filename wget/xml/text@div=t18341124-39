                  </hi>. I live in Ashby-street, and am owner of a house, No. 19, Crown-street. I missed two bottom sashes from there—one from the first floor, and one from the ground floor—they were hung with lines and weights.</p>

I was on duty at half-past six o'clock in the morning on the 1st of November, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner with these two sashes on his shoulder—I asked where he was going—he said, to take them to the Commercial-road, and he had brought them from Tabernacle-walk—I asked him to go back and show me the house—he said he should not, but I might go with him to the Commer<lb></lb>cial-road—I said it was nearer to go back to Tabernacle-walk—he then said he was authorized by a gentleman in the Commercial-road to fetch them from Tabernacle-walk, for fear they should be stolen—I asked how he got into the house—he said he got the key from a person next door, named Ward, I think—I again asked him to go back—he said he should</p>

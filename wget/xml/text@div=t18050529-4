I did; in going to the prisoner's house I met several articles in a wheelbarrow that I thought was my property; when I saw him, he went down upon his knees; he said he was extremely sorry, he wished me to forgive him on account of his family, he said he had three children; I told him he should have considered that before; I know this box has been about the factory some years, I know they are my locks, it is all my property.</p>

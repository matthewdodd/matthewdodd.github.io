                  </hi>. I am a barge builder, and live in John-street, Com<lb></lb>mercial-road. On Sunday night, the 12th of September, I was coming oat of my father's house in Bond-court, and saw Miss Mahoney and her sister coming along—I spoke to them, and was with them when this oc<lb></lb>curred—I saw the prisoner standing at the end of Bond-street, talking to two females and a young man—I knew him by sight—as we passed he called after the females—he called the prosecutrix a b——w——, telling her to go home to a b——house, and then she could get up early in the morning—I went to him and said, "Don't you know that you are taking these females characters away; you are doing very wrong, it is not only them who hear it, there are people standing at their own doors, and they tear it as well"—he said, "George, we don't want to have any quarrel<lb></lb>ling with you, go about your business"—Miss Mahoney came to me and said, "George, don't talk to them people, we have another way to make them pay for it, without a disturbance in the street"—he directly came round, struck her, tore, her dress off her back, and terribly ill-used her—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184111290226"></xptr>
               <p>her mother came up, and I stopped him from striking her, as he had her against a brick-wall—I pulled him away from her—after that I thought all was quiet—the prosecutrix went into her father's house with her sister and me—in about ten minutes after I thought all was quiet and came outside the door, and saw the prisoner at his up-stairs window throwing flower-pots out—the prosecutrix was just in the door then—he stood with his head out of the window, throwing the pots down on the people below—there must have been twenty people there outside the railing—there were three inside the railing—he threw the pots down into Mr. Mahoney's front yard—I did not speak a word to him—I saw the prosecutrix leaving the house, and when she came outside the door, about ten minutes after the disturbance, the prisoner deliberately came out of his house with a brick in his hand, and stood about six yards from Mahoney's house, in front of the house, said something, and flung the brick at her—it struck her on the head—she was immediately conveyed to Mr. Menzie's—she fell down, a young man named Thorn picked her up, and carried her to the doctor's—her sister fainted—the prisoner afterwards threw a pint pot and hit Mr. Mahoney on the side—he threw nothing else but the flower-pot.</p>

                  </hi>. I am journeyman to Mr. Jones. I did not see the commencement of this, but when the prisoner went down the court to his own house I went down with him—he had all his things nearly torn off his back at that time—we had to pass Mahoney's door, and saw three of them—they were stripped to their stays to fight, waiting for the prisoner, and when he came by the door they all three laid hold of him and beat him—Lartin also took him by the neck and hit him three or four times—I did not try to assist the prisoner—I did not know him before—I told Lartin he ought to be ashamed of himself—some man then took hold of the prisoner and took him away, and I took him into his own house myself—the women came hooting to him to come out again, and somebody came and pushed the door—when I came out I met one of them with a stone and a brick in her hand—somebody begged her not to throw it at the window, and she said she would be d—if she would not—I heard the window smash—I could not see who did it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master-carman, and live in Bond-street. On Sunday the 12th of December, between eight and nine o'clock, as I and my wife and family sat in the kitchen we heard violent screaming—my wife went up, and I followed, and my children also—I opened my door and saw two men fighting—I do not know them—there was a cry of "For G—sake let this good woman come in or she will be murdered"—it was the prisoner's wife—I saw her afterwards—she was then being dragged on the curb of the pavement by females, who I did not know, but I have since found one of them to be Bridget Mahoney—I went to lift the prisoners wife and found she was grasped by Bridget Mahoney by her long hair behind—I ungrasped her hand and she was taken away—she was down at the time and her hair was entangled in Mahoney's hand.</p>

               <p>——<hi rend="smallCaps">BEACHEY</hi>. I am the wife of James Beachey, and live in Bond-stree. On Sunday night the 12th of November I was in my room with my door open, and heard screams of "Murder" and "Police"—I went up and saw the prisoner's wife in the hands of three women, her hair being pulled off her head—I said, "For G—sake some man release the woman"—Mr. Boddy opened his door—I instantly went to the corner of the street and saw the prisoner in the hands of Mrs. Mahoney pulling her face down, and I saw her clasp the prisoner by his whiskers, and he put his hand on her hair and cap to prevent her hitting him—she had him by the side of the face, and her daughter Mary came and struck him—I also saw a strange man come and strike him—I should not know him again—I also saw Lartin strike him in his mouth, and I saw him strike him again and knock him down.</p>
               <p>---- <hi rend="smallCaps">PARKER</hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 27, Bond-street. I heard a most dreadful noise between nine and ten o'clock—I went down to see what it was, and saw Miss Mahoney pick up the bricks and throw them into the prisoner's window—they returned again, and as Bridget Mahoney was running into her own house she fell down on the corner of the step, and received a blow—she was afterwards carried to the doctor's—I had seen her smash the prisoner's windows with the bricks she flung.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many brickbats did she throw into the window? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know how many—I saw more than one thrown by both the sisters—I cannot say what sort of brickbats they were—I saw no garden-pots thrown—I am no friend of the prisoner's nor an enemy of the other party—I saw the prisoner at his own room-window after Bridget Mahoney fell down and was carried to the doctor's—I did not see him come out of his house.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Give us some notion of the manner in which she fell. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She was running into her own gate, and fell down and hit her forehead on the right hand side going in doors.</p>
               <p>---- <hi rend="smallCaps">AUSTIN</hi>. I am the wife of John Austin, a carpenter, in Bond-court. Hearing a most dreadful confusion in the court, I went out, and saw Mary Bridget Mahoney run out of the prisoner's yard on the opposite side, and she fell against the step of her own door—the blood ran very furiously from her forehead—both parties are strangers to me, and I have no interest in coming to speak.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When she fell she was carried to the doctor's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went to my own door, and saw her carried away then—when she fell the prisoner was up at the window of his own house—I swear that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CRISP</hi>. I am solicitor to the prosecution. In consequence of there being no depositions taken before the Magistrate, I thought it right to take as accurately as I could from the witnesses what they deposed, and fur-nished the other side with a copy of it—I heard the witness Thorn say that he never told me he saw the prisoner threw a large flint stone at the people—he distinctly told me he saw a flint stone thrown first, and after<lb></lb>wards a brick, by the prisoner.</p>

It was a contused wound—it must have been from a stone or something—a fall might account for it, but she must nave fallen very heavily—if she had fallen down her face would most likely have been injured, and it was only injured at the one part on the forehead.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I believe this poor woman has a husband who is a maniac? - A. She has a husband who is deranged, and two children.(The officer produced the leather, which was identified by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. This leather was not in your shop, but in the cellar? - A. No, it was not exposed for sale.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is your cellar a part of your shop? - A. We consider it so, because we keep in it articles for sale as well as articles not for sale; this leather is not manufactured, it is not in a saleable condition.</p>

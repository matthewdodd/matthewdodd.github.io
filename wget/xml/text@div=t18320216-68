On the 17th of January I had an ox killed, and at half-past ten at night, I went to look at it: I took particular notice of it, and saw that the kidneys were not so fat as they generally are - the next morning I went to the slaughter-house, from halfpast five to six o'clock, and found that the ox had been robbed of part of the fat, and of the kidneys, I should think of 30lbs. altogether; here is one piece of suet which I took particular notice of, and know it again; I received it from Webster - this is the kidney and the fat that I saw in the ox the night before.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the morning of the 18th of January I went to Edgware-road, and ascertained that the two prisoners had been seen there together, at half-past ten o'clock the night before; I then went to Howard's lodgings, which is about twenty-five yards from the place; I found him in bed - I awoke him, and told him he was suspected of robbing the slaughter-house; he said he knew nothing about it - I told him to get up and dress, which he did, and I saw a large patch of suet on the right knee of his trousers; I asked how that came there: he said he knew nothing about it - he got up, and in going down stairs I asked where his handkerchief was; he said he had pawned it; I locked him up, and then went to Woodward's lodgings; I knocked at the door, and his wife answered; I asked if he lived there; she said Yes, but he was just gone down; I said he was not out of the house, and I must wait - I waited, and he came to the door; I said I believe you are

I am in the employ of Foster and Evans, 45, Bermondsey Street, leather factors—The prisoner came there on 24th January between 2 and 3 o'clock, when I showed him some samples of leather—he said that he was sent from Gibson and Co., of Aldermanbury—Mr. Clarke was present—there were half a dozen kangaroo skins, which he said were very much like his sample—they are sold by weight—they were weighed and I packed them up in paper and he took them away—I am certain he is the man—he had got a dark suit and a low-crowned hat—I took particular notice of his face.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Foster and Evans—on 24th January the prisoner called at and presented this order:—"January 24th, 1878—Please deliver to bearer one dozen to pattern.—W. G., W. T., and J. F. Gibson, merchants and manufacturers, 20, Alder<lb></lb>manbury, London."—I believed that came from Messrs. Gibson, and gave him the goods as near as I could to the sample—he had them counted and weighed and tied up in a parcel—he signed this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said "Your traveller called on us this morning, and I was not in," and he gave me this form from Gibson and said "This is a small foreign order we get once a year"—I afterwards sent this invoice to Messrs. Gibson by post (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that is not my writing—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man who called.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of W. T. and J. F. Gibson, of 20, Aldermanbury—I did not authorise the prisoner to take that order to Messrs. Foster and Evans to get the skins—the printed part of it is very probably from our firm.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. There are two members in my firm—my brother's name is Joseph Frederick—he is not here—the prisoner was in our employ about seven months ago for about two years—he left us in August, 1877—this "W. T." purports to be my signature, but it is not, nor is it my brother's—he would not use "W. T."—he would sign "J. F. G."—the prisoner had no business whatever with this order.</p>

I took the prisoner on the 29th—he was recognised by Clarke, who was with me in Finsbury Pavement—I told him I was a police officer, and should take him in custody for obtaining skins on 24th January—he said that he knew nothing about it—he was taken to Moor Lane station and then to Bermondsey, where he was searched by another officer and the charge read over to him—I went</p>

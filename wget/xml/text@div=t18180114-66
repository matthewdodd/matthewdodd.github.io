On the 8th of January, about half-past four o'clock, the prisoner came into the dining-room, and called for a bason of soup, which I carried to him, with a silver spoon; he eat the soup, paid for it, got up, and walked out of the room. I went to the table to see if it was gone, and found it exchanged. I went down stairs, and charged him with having exchanged it, he denied it- I told him he had left a metal one in the room of a silver one. I called Shafe, and told him, and insisted on his being searched. He immediately pulled off his hat, and threw the spoon on the stairs- I gave him in charge. Rebecca Denton keeps the house.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SHAFE. I am waiter at the Cock and Woolpack. Webb called me, and said the prisoner had changed the spoon, he denied it; he took off his hat, took the spoon out of it, and dropped it on the stairs, I picked it up.</p>

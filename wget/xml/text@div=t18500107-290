                  </hi>. I am a printer, of Princes-street, Red Lion-square. The prisoner applied for work at my office on 6th Dec.—he worked for me on the 6th, and on the 7th, which was Friday—on that day, as I was going up-stairs to tea, about five o'clock, he met me in the passage, and asked me to let him have some money to get his tea—I told him to remain till I came down, and I would give him some—I was gone about half an hour, and when I came down he had gone out—he returned in about a quarter of an hour—I asked where he had been—he said to get half a pint of beer—I paid him what was due to him, and requested him to come the following day; he did not come—about eight o'clock on the Saturday morning I went into the office, and missed some type—I met the prisoner at five the evening before, without his coat—I have not seen the type since; it has been melted down: it was worth about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw the prisoner again, from twelve to one on Saturday night, at his own house—1 had found out his residence, and went there and waited till he came home.</p>

The prisoner came between two and three o'clock on the Saturday after he took the goods from Mr. Bowden—I had never seen him before—my master was present, and the prisoner asked him if be would buy some type—my master said he had no use for them—the prisoner said he would go and fetch them—he went, and came back—my master was not in then—he had some pica type in his hand, wrapped up in brown paper, in a page—he said he would call again—he did not come back.</p>

                  </hi> (Police Sergeant 15 F). On 29th September, about eight o'clock, I went to No. 5, Parker Street, and found the prisoners in bed together—I told them I came for some pictures—Knight said, "What pictures?"—I said, "There was a burglary committed a week or two ago at the corner of Castle Alley, and I shall take you in custody for it"—he said, "All right, it will take you all your time to settle me"—I searched, and on the mantelpiece found these two pictures—Knight said, "They were left here, and I know nothing about them"—I found twenty-four pawn tickets in the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Knight. Q.</hi> You know the pictures. Did not you say that you knew they had been there some time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—Brannan did not tell me that she bought them—I was there when the other officer found the pawn tickets close to the table under a bonnet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Brannan</hi>. I bought the pictures of a man in the street, and had them there two weeks.</p>

I am a furniture dealer, of No. 6, Broker's Alley, Drury Lane—on the night of 6th September I went to bed at a little before eleven o'clock, having seen the shop and the doors safe—I was called up about twenty minutes past eleven o'clock, and found the shutter bar sprung, the shutters taken down, and the window broken—I missed these pictures, value 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., from the window—I have had one of them ten years.</p>

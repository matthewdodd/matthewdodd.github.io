                  </hi>. I did live at the prosecutrix's house in Cambridge Street at the time in question—I do not now—on the night of the 29th December, about 12.30, I was sitting up stairs in the drawing-room—I heard the prosecutrix running up stairs, she said "Don't murder me"—she rushed into my bedroom, which is next to the drawing-room—I saw the prisoner outside the bedroom door—I persuaded him to go down stairs—he said "Let me murder her"—he then knocked me down with the poker as I was holding the door—the prosecutrix was sitting half on the bed when I got up, and he gave her three blows, and as he raised the poker for a fourth I got it from him—he hit her on the head—she had plaits on her head, or it might have been much worse—he said he would do for her, and he said "If you don't get away I will do for you after"—he said she had wronged him, and if she had he would do for her—I put my arms round him and took the poker from him, and he threw me on the fire-place—I got up and screamed "Murder!" from the balcony, and three men came in, and the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

               <p>for two days, and I was very angry with him—he asked me to take something to drink; we went to the Clarendon and drank together; still I was very disagreeable indeed with him, and annoyed him very much; I told him I had burnt his concertina, which was a favourite instrument of his, and also his letters; and I told him I had had another man in the meantime, which I had not done, and that a supposed friend of his—after leaving the Clarendon we stood outside my house about a quarter of an hour, and then we went in together, that was about 11.15—we sat down and began <hi rend="italic">nagging at</hi> each other; of course, I had the most to say; I told him again and again that I had torn his likenesses, and if he looked in the coal scuttle he would find one, and the remainder I wished him to have—whether I commenced to scuffle with him or not I really could not say, because I was in a horrible passion; I had been drinking, and he had had sundry glasses, four I can recollect—I ran up stairs—I could not say whether he ran up, or how he came up; I might have called out on the stairs; I ran into the bedroom on the first floor, and shut the door; he got into the room, and I received a blow, I suppose from the poker—I was then sitting on the side of the bed, which is close to the door—I really did not feel the blow; I can't say whether it was a severe one; I was excited, and had been drinking; I suppose that was the reason I did not feel it so much—I am not aware that he said anything at the time—after receiving the blow I lay back in the bed for a second, and then sprang to my feet and walked from one room to the other—he walked down stairs and I walked down after, and sat down in an arm-chair in the parlour, and he came to me and said <hi rend="italic">"Sue</hi>, kiss mo"—three gentlemen came in and he was taken out—I never gave him into custody, and never wished it, I never should have done it; I aggravated him—I was taken to the hospital by my own wish, and remained there four or five days.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Messrs. Rock, of Walbrook, as a clicker, and have been so rather better than two years—the prisoner was in their employment as head foreman—he worked on the top floor, and I was on the next floor under him—printing was principally done on that floor—about the 11th or 12th January, the prisoner came down, and said to me, "Baker, look out two dozen of the best white leathers"—I said, "Very well, sir"—I looked them out—he came down again, and said, "Lay them on one side for about half an hour"—I did so—he then came down with two patterns, and said, "Cut up one dozen skins of the largest pattern, and see how many you get out of a skin"—I cut them up from the patterns that he gave me—they were purse patterns—I cut up one dozen of the largest pattern, and took them up and gave them to the prisoner—he then gave me the next pattern, a size smaller, and said, "You can cut up the other dozen with this pattern"—I did so, and took them up to his desk, where he was standing—he said, "Look out five skins more; I have not got quite enough to cut up, and cut up to the last patterns you cut the others up to"—I did so—he then gave me a smaller pattern, and said, "Cut up the remaining pieces with this small pattern"—I did that—I got the skins out of Mr. Rock's stock—I gave the patterns back to the prisoner with the leather—in the course of business it is not usual to give the patterns back again—when I gave the skins and patterns to the prisoner he was over against the lift-hole, where</p>

Rock's; they did at the prisoner's—I knew he had a shop—I believe it was carried on as "Carter Brothers," by his wife—Carter is his wife's brother—I know it by hearing other persons say it in the shop—I think I have seen his wife once, but I should not know her again—I knew that Mr. Rock's men worked overtime for the prisoner—I also knew that the prisoner dealt with persons with whom Mr. Rock dealt—I can't say whether the prisoner supplied articles to Messrs. Rock at the wholesale price—I can't say whether he supplied them with purses; I believe he did—I do not know whether any of the other men worked in the shop on their own materials—these strips of paper resemble the patterns—this white leather is of the same character; it is a good deal like it—I don't recollect that this is any part of the leather that the prisoner handed to me—this white leather was bought of Mr. Wrigglesworth—I believe both Mr. Rock and the prisoner dealt with him for leather—I was told so by our solicitor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to Messrs. Rock Brothers and Payne—on 11th or 12th January, the prisoner gave me a brown paper parcel—it contained leather—besides that, he gave me some white leathers, about the size of the largest patterns produced—he told me to cut up material for a gross of purses of the pattern he gave me—I did so—he told me to go to his desk, that I should find some white leather there, and to take a gross from them—there was more than a gross there—it was white, and about the size of the smaller pattern—I packed them up in a brown paper parcel and gave it to the prisoner—I have looked at the white leather in the flap of these purses—it is similar white leather to that I packed in the parcel—white leather is always very nearly alike; it resembles it in quality</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186606110007"></xptr>
               <p>—about a week after this, the prisoner told me he had received these purses back from Miller, who had had them to make for him—I had previously heard from the prisoner that they were going to Miller to be made—he said Miller had charged him fifteen shillings for making them—on the day the prisoner was discharged from Messrs. Rock's service, Gerrard brought me a parcel—I afterwards went and saw the prisoner at his house, 15, Patriot-row, Cambridge-road, Bethnal-green—I told him that those parcels that he had requested I should send out I had not been able to send out, as I had heard that no parcels were to be sent out—he told me that I might have given them to the boys, but that did not matter, the parcels were to be sent to his house—Gerrard was present at this conversation—he told the prisoner that in the afternoon he was binding two books, and they took them away from him—he said, "There are several books there belonging to you, what shall I do with them?"—the prisoner asked where they were—he said he had packed them in a brown paper parcel, and put them in a certain pigeon-hole—the prisoner told him to leave them there, and if anything was said about them to refer to him—Gerrard then asked him, if anything was said to him in the morning, what he should say?—he said, "Why, tell them you have been doing two or three books a week for me"—I said I thought there had been more—he told me I was mistaken; the books I had seen there were books that had come there to have some slight defect rectified—I have occasionally seen more than two or three books a week there.</p>

Rock, the materials for making a gross of purses, which were taken, by his orders, to a man of the name of Miller, in Ware-street, Kingsland-road—he said, "Very well "—I then commenced to search the house, accompanied by the prisoner and Mr. Rock, and in a back room on the first floor the prisoner took up this parcel, and said, "These are the purses Miller made," taking out one of the purses from the parcel—turning it to the back, he said, "This leather I took to your warehouse, where it was cut up"—that was dark leather—Mr. Rock said, "How about the white skins that were cut up at the same time?"—the prisoner said, "I gave no orders for any white skins to be cut up; I am not so black as I have been painted; I have done no more than others in your employ have done, and are still doing—I know everything that takes place at the warehouse, and people call and tell me almost every night, or every night"—I pointed out some other purses that I found in the room—he said, addressing Mr. Rock, "The whole of the materials in this room were being made by your orders"—I asked him who his firm consisted of—he said himself and Obadiah Carter.</p>

Give it a little bit of vellum binding, to make it open freer than a general binding will "—I said, "Very well, I will give it half-and-half; that will enable it to open up freer"—he said, "Do it as quickly as possible, because it is wanted"—I took the book on from the sewers, and got it ready for the cutting—I rather think I cut this book myself, but that I cannot swear to—I covered it—I got the cover from a person, named Baker, in the employ of Messrs. Rock—before I did my part, the book had gone through the hands of Silverson—after it was cut it went to be redded at the edges by Silverson, and then I covered it—I got the boards from Drew—whether he cut these identical boards or not I cannot say; I rather fancy I cut them myself—I afterwards got from him the two Hebrew books—he brought them to me, and told me to bind them in a piece of purple sheep—I proceeded to bind them—there is only one party appointed to cut the boards—sometimes I might cut them myself, if he was not at his post—they were boards from Messrs. Rock's establishment—whilst I was binding one of these books, Mr. Rock came and found me doing it—the books were then ready to be covered—the prisoner was not present when Mr. Rock came to me—I have got one of the intended covers—I should think this was the leather intended to cover the Hebrew book—this was in my possession at one time—the cover for the other book was torn up by myself—I rather think the prisoner was discharged the same day—in consequence of some communication made to me, I afterwards went and saw the prisoner up Bond-court, Walbrook—I told him that I was covering one of the Hebrew books, and that Mr. Rock came and said to me, "What are you doing here? what is that cover for?"—I said, "For covering this book"—he said, "Where is the order for them?"—I said I had no order—he said, "How is that?"—I said, "I don't know; I rather think they are Mr. Hall's books"—the prisoner said to me, "Don't remove a thing; leave them there just as they are"—I said, "I have not covered the books; the two covers are spoiling. and I have torn one up"—he said, "Never mind about that, don't remove anything; if they wish to know anything about the things, refer them to me at once, and see that nothing is removed from the place "—I had pasted the covers when Mr. Rock interfered—I afterwards went to the prisoner's house with the witness Smith—I had previously given a parcel to Smith to take to the prisoner—he had refused to take it—I told him at the time, "It don't matter if you take it or not, it is the parcel you have been making"—I am referring to the wallets—what passed at the prisoner's while Smith was there was very similar to what I referred to just now in the court at Walbrook—I merely told the prisoner what had occurred, and asked what I should do—he said, "The best thing you can do is to put the books into a parcel, put them into the middle pigeon-hole, and if they wish to know anything about them, refer them to me "—I did not hear him tell Smith to say there had been two or three books a week done—I know the lift-hole in the warehouse—there is a lift-hole that goes right through the firm—a person standing at the lift-hole could see any person coming up the stairs—I have received directions from the prisoner with respect to that lift-hole, to place a lad over the hole to see when Mr. Rock was coming, and</p>

               <p>to let me or other parties know—it was usual if, for instance, one of my fellow-workmen spoiled something, to say to me, "I have just done this wrong; put a boy over the hole, or perhaps Mr. Rock will come up and <hi rend="italic">sack</hi> me," and the boy used to sing out "Shears"—I don't recollect whether a boy was put over the hole while I was engaged in binding this book—I know a boy was not put over the hole while I was doing this, or I should not have been caught—it was a common occurrence, if we were going to cook any little thing, or boil water to make tea—if Mr. Rock had caught us, perhaps he would have discharged us—all manner of boys were placed there—Ryan was one of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you still in Mr. Rock's employment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I was discharged a day or two after the occurrence—there are about 120 persons in Mr. Rock's employ, at times when busy—I suppose we were pretty well alike as to irregularities—we had no particular boy placed at the lift-hole—the boys generally understood that was their business—we were very precise as to time—no cooking was allowed, and if we wanted to boil a potato we would say, "Can't you put a boy over the hole"—the word "Shears," was a bye-word with us—we thought if we sung out "Mr. Rock," he would be <hi rend="italic">fly</hi> to what was meant—I rather think that he was fully aware of what was meant by "Shears"—I believe I can prove it—I rather think I received these boards from Drew, or I went and cut them out myself from Messrs.

                  </hi>. I carry on business at 11, Wallbrook, with my partners, as wholesale stationers—the prisoner has been in our service fourteen or fifteen years as foreman—he had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week, and a gratuity of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Christmas—his duty was generally to superintend the binding part of the factory—the binding consists of what is called vellum binding, as distin-guished from the binding of reading books—he had no authority from me to execute any order except through the warehouse—it would never go directly from the factory to the customer—the prisoner had no authority whatever to take leather or skins from my premises and give them out to workmen to be made—some two or three years ago he told me that his wife had some ink manufactory—he afterwards told me that he had established some factory for female labour for binding books—I was also aware that his wife had a stationary business—I did not know of his carrying on business under the firm of Carter Brothers—I knew men by the name of Carter, because they served their time with me, but I did not know that the prisoner was at all connected with them in business—in consequence of a fire, I gave orders for Carter Brothers to supply me with some goods—the firm at first was in the name of Alfred Carter; subsequently, I do not know how, it went into the name of Carter Brothers—the name of one of them was Obadiah—until the disclosures took place which led to this prosecution, I had no notion whatever that the prisoner himself was one of the firm of Carter Brothers;—he studiously concealed it from me—I was not aware that a boy was kept at the lift-hole to cry out "Shears" if I was seen approaching—I wish I had been aware of it—I saw this gross of purses found in the prisoner's house—I never gave him any order whatever respecting them—it was never with my knowledge or authority that he bound books with my material—it was very seldom indeed that we did bind reading books—it was chiefly done for ourselves, and members of the firm—when such work is done on the premises, it is brought down to one of the firm to estimate the cost on which we fix our charge—I never heard of these particular books until I discovered them.</p>

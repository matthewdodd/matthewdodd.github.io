               <p>On Wednesday last, between the hours of nine and ten, this lad brought this spoon in to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you produce it? - I do; I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a silver table spoon? - It is. He offered it to me to sell; I asked him where he lived? - he first told me he lived in Grosvenor-square; he said he had only lived there two days, and he could not tell me justly the name. I asked him more closely, and then he told me he lived in Grosvenor-street. I immediately thought that the spoon was stole, and I inquired about it; I found it belonged to Lord Malden.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any application to the servants about it? - I did the same morning. I have kept it ever since; it is the same I had from the prisoner, in the same state as it is now.</p>
               <p>Q. To Smith. Is that the same spoon you lost? - Yes, it is the very same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this gentleman, the silversmith? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. On that you knew it was lost? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any more missing? - No, there were no more missing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I plead not guilty.</p>
               <p>Court to Sutherland. Do you know whether this boy was an apprentice, or only a servant? - He was only a servant, his master sent for him out of the country to carry out things for him.</p>

               <p>men I was to raise equally on board two steamers, which they bad pur<lb></lb>chased—Mr. Scalia said, "It is true that we have purchased two steamers, and very fine steamers they are, but all the money is not paid for them"—I am not certain whether the names of the vessels were mentioned on that occasion, but they were subsequently repeatedly mentioned—they were the <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Vectis</hi>—I then mentioned to Mr. Scalia my intention of embarking the men on board the two steamers, that I was directed to do so in my official instructions—Mr. Scalia said that he thought it would be I highly imprudent to do that, that it would be running a great risk, and I understood him also to say that he should advise the Prince, or would himself communicate with the government at Palermo, on the subject—he seemed averse to have them put on board—he said there was great risk of the vessel I being seized—the British government would, in fact, interfere, and it would I be to the great risk of the steamers—I then asked what I was to do with the I men, how they were to be sent—I had told him I had to send one battalion, 1200 men, and 60 as a reserve—a great deal of conversation passed on the I subject of the contracts for clothing the men, and I particularly told him that I had got my own uniform made up according to the instructions, and I should like to show it him—he said he should like to see it very much; I did I not show it him—I do not think anything else passed on that second occasion I—I had subsequently more than a dozen interviews—after that I went there I constantly every week—I do not recollect any other conversation about the I steamers, further than that they told me they were very fine vessels indeed, I and the <hi rend="italic">Vectis</hi> was at Liverpool, and she was in a more advanced state, and I would be ready sooner than the <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi>; it was Mr. Scalia said that, he I appeared to me to be the man of business, he always acted—I think the I Prince was present—that was when I came there to receive further instruc<lb></lb>tions, or to know whether any orders had been sent from the government—I always learnt that no funds had been remitted—the answer always was, I "No instructions, no money"—they said they were anxiously waiting for a remittance from the government, and if the remittance was not, as I under<lb></lb>stood, soon paid, there would be an unpleasant circumstance as to the steamers, for the deposit-money that had been paid—I understood they had paid a large sum of money on account of these steamers, but there was more to be paid, and if this money was not forthcoming they Would be in a scrape—I asked them, when they were both present, if they could give any reason I why this money had not arrived, and they answered, that they could only account for it, because a loan which the Provisional Government had been in aegociation for with the French Government had failed—I understood it was for 750,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not understand from either of them on what the loan was to be raised but I knew it—on one occasion, when Prince Granatelli and I to. Scalia were both present, and we were speaking of the steamers, I asked them who was to command the <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi>, and the answer was, that at that moment they were in want of a person—the person who had been engaged, I understood, was of the name of Parker—they asked me whether I knew of any English dashing fellow who would like to take the command of the <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi>—I said acquaintance among the naval officers, but I would make inquiry through my agent—I knew perfectly well how the <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vectis</hi> were to be employed—spoke to my agent, whose name is Latchford, and he immediately made inquiry, and wrote me a note, in consequence of which I waited on Prince Granatelli and Mr. Scalia with Mr. Latchford and lientenant Waghorn—it was twelve o'clock when we arrived at Brook-street</p>

               <p>and we were told the Prince was not up—Lieutenant Waghorn said he could not remain, and it was agreed we should return at two—I returned at two with Mr. Latchford, and saw the prince and Mr. Scalia—Lieutenant "Wagbom did not return—I informed the prince and Mr. Scalia we had found just the very man they wanted to take the command of the <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi>—Mr. Latchford then communicated to Mr. Scalia who and what Lieutenant Waghorn was—that Lieutenant Waghorn, if they would confer on him the command of the <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi>, would engage to have her fitted out in less time than any other man could do it, because he was a friend of Mr. Pitcher's, or Pilcher's, or some such name, who I understood was the ship-builder—Mr. Latchford told them that if they took Lieutenant Waghorn into their service, and gave him the command of the <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi>, he would engage, out of the eighteen steamen which the King of Naples had in his service, to bring in twelve of them, that he would answer for, but he could not answer for the other six—Prince Gra natelli did not speak at all, but when Mr. Latchford had finished speaking in English to Mr. Scalia, I stopped him and translated it, word for word, in French, fearing he did not sufficiently understand English, in order that he might perfectly well understand what Mr. Latchford said, and the Prince answered in French, "<hi rend="italic">Cela sera bon four nous,"</hi> and he rubbed his hands, shook his head, and appeared very well satisfied—the interview ended by Mr. Scalia telling us that he would make an immediate communication to the government at Palermo, particularly asking what the address of Lieutenant Waghorn was, which he took down in writing, because they said they could not engage Lieutenant Waghorn themselves, but could only recommend him and would wait for instructions—that was what they were to write about—I do not recollect that anything was said about the vessel's guns—they did not say what was to be done with the vessels, or their destination—on 15th Jan., in the present year, I took a letter to Prince Granatelli and Mr. Scalia, I and left it with a servant at the house—(<hi rend="italic">the notice to produce this letter was admitted, but it was not produced</hi>)—this is a copy of the letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it contained an enclosure, the letter of the minister of war, La Farina, dated 18ti I Nov., containing my final instructions—I made this copy myself, in my own I writing—this is the original—(<hi rend="italic">letters read</hi>—"15th January, 1849.

Since my arrival in London I have called several times in Brook-street, for the purpose of learning whit I instructions have been sent to you in respect to myself for the mission with which have been charged by the members of the Provisional Government of Sicily I and which mission I have, to the best of my ability, endeavoured faithfully to execute; and, as far as depends upon myself, no exertions have been sparted to carry it through in strict conformity to the orders I received, confidently I relying upon the good faith of the Sicilian government to transmit to England I agreeably to the assurance made to me at Palermo, the requisite funds to meet the several engagements I have found it necessary to enter into on behalf of the Sicilian government. I feel satisfied that you will readily afford me every information in your power; and I have now the honour to represent to you, as commissioners of the Sicilian government in London, to whom I am officially directed in my instructions to apply, that I have now been one moo" I in England waiting for orders and instructions from the Sicilian government I and 1 therefore consider it my duty respectfully to submit to your consider<lb></lb>ation the expediency of coming to a clear and prompt understanding on this</p>

I shall then wait the return of the answer. Signed H. H.

Most worthy Colonel,—To-morrow, profiting by the French steamer, conformably to what has been now agreed upon, you will depart for England, where you will embark all those disciplined troops which you will find ready to be removed to this place; in respect to the remainder of the men that will he necessary to complete the battalion ac<lb></lb>cording to what has been agreed upon with Colonel Forbes; if they are not ready at the moment, you will be pleased to wait for instructions from this government, according to which, and conformably to the conditions which you will find therein prescribed, you will either re-commence the enlistment, or desist altogether from the undertaking: the soldiers who will be sent here with their respective officers will receive their respective pay from the day of their embarkation. Do everything with the greatest zeal and with the celerity corresponding to the urgency of the present state of Sicily, and with the truest sentiments of esteem believe me, &amp;c. G. La Farina." (<hi rend="italic">The an<lb></lb>swer of Prince Granatelli and Mr. Scalia to Colonel Aubrey was here read as follows</hi>—"London, 23d Jan., 1849. Sir,—We have received your letters of the 15th instant, enclosing a copy of a letter, and we have delayed replying to it, waiting from day to day for news from Palermo. What we can assure you of is, not having received instructions which can possibly relate to you, or which treat of the mission to which you allude. Not being able in any way to correspond to your wishes, we must limit ourselves to suggesting that you should write to Palermo, whilst we on our side will make known the communication we have received from you")—I communicated to the Prince and Mr. Scalia the contents of Colonel Forbes' letter which led me to Palermo, and also the instructions—I did not read the letters to them, but I made them acquainted with the contents, as Colonel Forbes desired me to mention to the Prince that he wished his two boys sent out in the <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi> to Palermo, and that the government had transmitted an order to that effect, together with some money—he had already communicated with the Prince to that effect—these are the official instructions of 4th Oct., about the two boys—the letter is countersigned by La Farina—I told them I was come to England for the purpose of raising a body of troops that was to consist of 1260 men, that I was to enter into contracts to supply all these men with arms, clothing, and equipment of all sorts, and necessaries, in order that they should be able to take the field in the most effective state—I told them, that in consequence of my having written to the agents from Leghorn and Lyons, that I was coming and telling them what to do, that the matter was already in a very advanced state as regarded my mission with re<lb></lb>ference to the men and contracts—I told them these men were to be embarked on board these steamers, according to my orders, and then to make the best of our way to Palermo without loss of time, and then, with the assistance of Lord Palmerston's guns, we should be able to make very active resistance—I told them it was not my intention to remain to be attacked at Palermo, but we intended immediately to proceed against the King of Naples, and endeavour to <hi rend="italic">oust</hi> him out of Naples as quick as possible, to proceed to organize an</p>

I received no communication of any kind whatever from them—the first person I communicated with, on behalf of the Neapolitan Government, I was Mr. White, of the firm of White and Broughton—they are solicitors to Prince Castelcicala, and they were solicitors to my family many years ago—they never acted as my solicitors—I saw Prince Castelcicala himself, as near as I can recollect, on 13th March—I never told Prince Granatelli or Mr. Scalia that I would betray what passed between us to the Neapolitan Government—I never gave them the slightest intimation that I was, or ever would be, in communication with the Neapolitan Government—I have not received any money from any of the agents of the Neapolitan Government; I am to receive some; am I obliged to answer that question?—it was agreed that I was to receive the pay which the Siclians owed me—that was six months' pay, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am to be paid that for assisting with my evidence to seize the Bom<lb></lb>bay steamer—I did give evidence, on which the seizure took place—I was the informer on that occasion.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been for some years in the navy—year I was carrying on business as a. Commission Agent at Liverpool—a steamer called the <hi rend="italic">Vectis</hi> arrived there—I went on board, and seeing that she a very nice craft, and hearing from the agent, Liberto, that she was to be fitted out for the insurgent government at Sicily, I applied by letter to Prince Granatelli, and Mr. Scalia for the first lieutenancy or the command of her—followed up my letter to which I received no answer, and came to London and had an introduction to Seignior Scalia, and I presume the party who I never did speak to was the Prince Granatelli—I repeated to them the sub<lb></lb>stance of my letter, that I wanted service—I stated that I had served in seven vessels of war, steam frigates, (that is so)., and was with Lord Keene up the Indus in the gun-boat service, that I had been eighteen or nineteen years at sea, and felt myself fully qualified to carry a vessel into action—Seignior Scalia said he could give me nothing definite in the way of an answer then—I saw him afterwards several times—he told me that he could not give me an answer as to being put on pay until they heard from their emissary, who I presume was Captain Castellia, who had gone over for funds—I had no positive information with regard to the <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi> from the Prince, or Seignior Scalia—I had my information from the intended Commodore Parker—on one occasion I had the pleasure of being at Brook-street to breakfast with the Prince, Seignior Scalia, and Commodore Parker, but nothing took place that I could take notice of to give in evidence—Captain Parker and myself were in the habit of freely talking on the subject of Sicily, or the destination of the <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi>, and Seignior Scalia was present; not several times, only on that one occasion—I heard Seignor Scalia say that the <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Vectis</hi> were going out for the purpose of being war steamers against the Neapolitans—seignior Scalia did not tell me that Captain Parker was to be commodore—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184907020046"></xptr>
               <p>heard that from Parker himself—nothing was said to me by Seignior Scalia as to the persons who were to be employed—I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi> I think early in March—I saw Mr. Wilcox, jun., and Captain Moody on board I—I told Captain Moody that I had been <hi rend="italic">pending</hi> an engagement to go out and join the insurgents at Palermo, since Nov., and I wanted for the sake of saving expense to be appointed an officer of the <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi> until such time as I got out there—I told him that I had been so long with favourable hopes held out to me by Seignior Scalia in conjunction with Prince Granatelli, and he had always given me reason to suppose I should go out in the <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi> as the <hi rend="italic">Vectis</hi> had gone, and it was to be hoped that I should not be kept hanging on any longer, but should have a berth at once—Captain Moody said,"If you bring a note from Prince Granatelli to me, I will make an officership for you, I am full at present—I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi> more than once—I had an opportunity of observing the way in which she was fitted out—she was decidedly fitted out as a vessel of war, and a very fine one too—there is a great difference between a merchant vessel, and a vessel of war—in the first place she had masked batteries for swivel guns—that is by slipping sundry bolts out of the bulwarks you have the whole surface of the deck for the play of a 32-pounder, or 28-pounder, whichever it may be, so that you may have a large swivel gun—she also had circles fitted for fighting guns, and also holes pierced for fighting bolts or caronades for shot or shell—she had strengthening knees for fighting guns which you have not in a merchant ves<lb></lb>sel—they are to sustain the weight of traversing guns to save the deck from being weakened—she was a very comfortable ship for a sailor, for she had everything in proper man-of-war fashion, hammocks, battens, and all the rest of it—they had hammock-netting I believe, but I will not swear to that, but hooks for slinging hammocks; I did not observe how many—I saw racks for small arms, and I understood there was a magazine, but I did not see it—I believe there were two galleys—it is not usual for a merchant vessel to have two, and there would be but one in a man-of-war like the <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi> in my opinion: it depends on the style of the vessel; there are two generally speaking.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the surveyors, outwards, of the Customs. I know the <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi>, and Capt. Moody—I have frequently been on board—the first time was on Thursday, 15th March, and repeatedly since—she was decidedly equipped as a vessel of war—she was equipped as a war-steamer, both fore and aft; there were brass sweeps or circles for one gun forward, and one aft; I should say for 68-pounders; and underneath each of those circles are beams supported by pillars, and other strengthening fasten<lb></lb>ings, capable of supporting such heavy weight—to enable these guns to be used effectively it is necessary that the bulwarks should fall down to enable the guns to fire over them—that was so in this vessel—on each side there are four racks with the requisite fittings of fighting bolts and rings, and bolts for working heavy carronade-guns—below I saw racks for musketry pistols cut<lb></lb>lasses and boarding-pikes, such as are found in all war-steamers, to the extent of four times the amount of what would be required for the ordinary crew of a merchant-steamer of that size—I also saw hooks in the beams for berthing or sleeping of two hundred seamen—I also saw where the maga<lb></lb>zine was, but I did not enter it—the chief officer told me it was the magazine, capt. Moody did not—my impression is, that she had two galleys, but I think she would have had the same amount of galley-room as a packet steamer—I saw holes pierced in her for fighting bolts or carronades for small shot—she was not filled up as any merchant-steamer would be, however; large, if intended for peaceable purposes—it is decidedly weakening a vessel cut down her bulwarks, that is a matter of necessity, and for war alone—is not usual for government mails to have falling bulwarks, or circles for 68-pounders—they are so constructed as to be capable of having guns if called on to do so, but they would not be perforated in that way, and fitted with the requirement for warfare in the ordinary course of events—I took possession of the <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi> on Friday, 16th March; she was at the Black wall-buoy, and capt. Moody was in command of her—her steam was up, and if I had been ten minutes later I should not have got her—there were no guns on board I am aware of—I had an opportunity of seeing her crew on the previous when they were shipping, she had what I should call a fine fair crew, not for war purposes—she had somewhat short of sixty hands—I retained possession of her seven weeks, and gave her up on the 4th May, in conse<lb></lb>quence of orders from the Treasury.</p>

Moody to come out in the <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi> to meet us—Capt. Moody did not say anything while I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Vectis</hi> on the subject of the <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi>—to the best of my knowledge Castellia was to be captain—he took the command out of Capt Bingham's hands; sometimes altering the courses—he seemed to me to have the superior command, and he gave direc<lb></lb>tions to Capt. Bingham—from Gibraltar, we went direct for Sicily—we did not touch at Malta, we laid off Palermo—we lowered the life-boat there, to see whether Palermo was blockaded, and Capt. Castellia went away in her, and went on board another vessel—when he canre back we put the vessel round and ran for Trapani—a lot of Sicilians came on board there—the vessel was very near sunk with them—they were people of all descriptions, from the priest to the pauper—they brought a flag with them of these colours (<hi rend="italic">red, white, and green</hi>); and I saw things like these, with three legs and a head in the centre—it was brought into the forecastle, and shown me by a man named Nicholls—we anchored at Trapani, and afterwards slipped the anchor and ran for Palermo—as we were rounding the point to get into Pa<lb></lb>lermo, we fell in with a small steamer, and we hoisted the Sicilian colours at the peak or gaff—the company's flag is a private signal, in the shape of a diamond—before we got into Palermo that signal was <hi rend="italic">doused</hi> and another hoisted—we went into the mole, and next day all of us were landed at the castle by Capt.

Moody was present, but I cannot swear what the articles expressed, I was not in a state at the time to say—I was taking my fare<lb></lb>well of England, and I was not sober—I did not hear Capt. Moody, or anybody in his presence, say anything about the <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi> following the <hi rend="italic">Vectis</hi>—I went out with her, and came home with the rest of the men in the <hi rend="italic">Indus</hi>, and was paid off at Southampton.</p>

I said,"Yes;""Who sent you here?""The Prince Granatelli;""Well, I will peak to Captain Moody about you"—Captain Moody asked me if I should like to be the steerer of the ship; I said,"Yes"—he said the wages I was to have were 12 dollars a month, and if I came in the course of the week he would let me know more—Captain D'Amico said,"You are a young man, courage, we must try to die; courage, we must go forward, and if we die, our friends will be left afterwards; you come the day after to-morrow; we shall go to try the steamer at Gravesend"—I went on board at Blackwall on the day after the morrow, when she was tried—the Prince and Moody were on board—I do not know Seignior Scalia—there was a pilot on board, and Captain Moody commanded the men—she went to Gravesend, and came back at about five o'clock to Blackwall—I had been on board seven or eight times before that—the circles for the swivels were laid down; there was only one piece wanted—after the trial trip Captains D'Amico and Moody told me repeatedly to come to-morrow and the day after to-morrow—D'Amico afterwards refused to receive me—they suspected something of me—I went</p>

I know Captain Moody's handwriting—I believe this discharge to be his writing—I have seen him write, but have never been close enough to notice it—I was boatswain on board the <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi>—I went on board on 15th March—Captain Moody engaged me; I asked him for employment, and he gave it me—I was to go the voyage with him to Gibraltar and Malta, and any port or ports in the Mediterranean—that agreement was reduced into writing, and I signed it—there was nothing agreed upon different from that agreement, it was wholly confined to the articles—(<hi rend="italic">The</hi>

                  </hi>. I have been a sailor five years. On 14th March, I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi>, saw Captain Moody, and asked him for employ<lb></lb>ment—I knew him, and had seen him several times on shore—I asked him if he had all his hands shipped—he said,"No," and I was to come to-morrow—I went again on 15th, and asked him again if he had all his hands shipped—he said,"No; stop a bit, I do not know whether they will all ship yet"—they all came aft, and some would not go for the money, and I went in one of their places—when I was on board on 14th, I saw a shell lying on the deck</p>

               <p>on the starboard side, abaft the funnel, aft—I heard some directions given about it—Wood, the fireman, was called, he picked it up and went towards the side of the vessel, towards the gangway with it, I do not know where it went to; I did not see it afterwards—I came again on the 16th; I was down below then and saw about fifteen shells there in the manger forwards; there might have been less—they were shell, as far as I could see; it was dark—there was a man below handed one up, and Luton, a waterman, who was on board, took it from him and took it forwards—it was a shell, not a round shot—I have not sailed on board war vessels, I never was on board one—I know the difference in the fitting of a war vessel from a merchantman—I have sailed a good deal in the merchant service—the <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi> was not fitted up like a merchantman—I saw shell-racks on board of her abaft and before the crank—I never saw such a thing on board a merchantman—they were on the upper deck—I saw the circles on the deck—I noticed that the port-holes fell down; I never saw that on board a merchantman, that would enable a party to work guns on the deck, and a great many extra ring bolts to what there would be in a merchant ship—some merchant ships have one gun aft and one forwards, and ports that take out of a hot day—I never before saw any preparation for a 68-pounder fore and aft—I did not see any guns on board—she looked to me as if she was prepared as a war vessel—that was the general <hi rend="italic">run</hi> in the ship's company.</p>

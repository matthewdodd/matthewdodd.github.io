On the 25th of March, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was up in the first floor, my wife and the lodgers were at home - I heard the cellar bolt drawn aside - it is at the bottom of the stairs, inside the house; I thought it might be one of the lodgers; my wife went down in about three minutes - I followed and ran out; a woman passing delivered me two pair of new shoes, which were mine, and had been taken from the window. The shop door was shut and bolted when I went up stairs - it has a private bolt to it, and he could not get into the shop without going into the cellar and pulling a string to undo the bolt - I only missed these two pair, which are worth 12 s.</p>

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor. I had been up stairs about two hours; I am certain the shop door was bolted - I heard the bolt drawn aside. We had but one lodger at home, he was on the second floor - I heard the cellar bolt go, but heard no footstep - I sat quiet, and heard the shop door unbolted then ran down stairs, and saw the prisoner in the shop; he had a smock-frock on, and a stick in his hand, I was afraid to lay hold of him, but followed him, and called stop thief, and saw him throw away the shoes, he then turned round and said,</p>
               <p>"Woman, why do you call stop thief after me, I have no property about me." I said,</p>
               <p>"That is nothing to me, you have broken my place open" - I will not leave you. He was secured without my losing sight of him. One Knight stopped him, and gave him to Potter.</p>

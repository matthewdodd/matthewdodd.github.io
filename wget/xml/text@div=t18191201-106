On the 27th of November, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, the prisoner came to my house, and had half a pint of beer in the parlour - a gentleman was in the parlour at the time. As soon as the gentleman left, not liking my customer, I went to see what he was about, and told him I wanted to shut up. He said he would not be more than a few minutes, and I returned to the bar. He came out apparently in a great hurry, and from his manner I thought he must have committed a robbery - I followed him out. When he thought he was out of sight, he stopped, and stooped down. I went up to him, and asked him if he had lost any thing? he said No. He was feeling about his trowsers. I said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got there?" He said,</p>
               <p>"Nothing at all" - I heard something jink inside, as if he had fetters on. The flap of his coat went aside, and there was the top of the tongs and shovel sticking out of his trowsers - the poker fell on the pavement, and I collared him. He begged to be let go - I gave him in charge</p>

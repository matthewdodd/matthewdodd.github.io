                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I am a baker, of 1, King's Road, Chelsea—on Saturday night, 25th March, I met Bowerman in a public-house near Covent Garden, and went with her to a coffee-shop, where I gave her 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and then back to the public-house again, and then back to the coffee-shop—we went into a room—no one else was there—I locked the door, and she said that the 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I had agreed to give her, was not enough—I undressed, and got into bed, and she began to cry</p>

On Thursday, 18th September, about half-past 8 in the evening, I was on duty in Carlisle-street, Lambeth—my attention was called to a child lying on the kerb—I took her up; she was dead—I took her to Dr. Carpenter's—I apprehended Rickerby on the 19th, at his employer's, Mr. Johnson, Axe-yard, Cripplegate—I told him it was for causing the death of a child in Carlisle-lane, on Thursday evening—he said, "I was there in the cart, but not driving"—I told him I had a question or two to put to him, but he need not answer them unless he liked—I asked him who the boy was—he said, "I do not know his name; he is a boy that goes with me sometimes; he is employed by my master to go with me; I know him very well, but where he lives and his name I do not know"—I told him he must consider himself in my custody—I took him to the station—next morning I took Lodge at his master's yard—I told him the charge, and after cautioning him, I asked him whether he was driving—he said he was—I told him I thought it was very wrong on his part to he</p>

I live with my parents, at 4, South-street, Lambeth—on the Thursday evening, at half-past 8, I was in Carlisle-lane, and saw a little girl walking on the pavement—she went into the road to cross it—when she had got to the middle of the road, I saw a cart coming from Hercules-buildings into Carlisle-lane—I saw Rickerby in the cart—the horse ran over the child and knocked it down in the middle of the road—the child got up, ran about three steps, and fell against the kerb—I picked her up and found her quite dead—the prisoners were driving very fast—I saw them before they struck the child, as they were coming round the corner—I should have been run over if the other witness had not pulled me out of the road—Rickerby was driving—I saw no one besides him—I believe he had the wins—he was standing—I called out, "Stop," and he drove on still faster—that was after the accident—the cart was in the middle of the road.</p>

I live with my father, at 47, South-street, Ken<lb></lb>nington-road—I was with the last witness, and saw the cart coming from Hercules-buildings—Rickerby was in it—I did not notice the other prisoner—I saw the child go off the kerb into the road—I can't say whether the cart went over it, but I know the horse knocked it down—they were going very fast; we were near being run over—I do not know the difference between trotting and galloping—I was on the pavement and the other wit<lb></lb>ness in the middle of the road, coming from South-street—she stood looking about at the children, and the horse was coming along the middle of the road, and I pulled her back—I was walking with her—I called "Stop," after the child was knocked down—they drove on, and several boys ran after them crying "Stop;" and they never stopped.</p>

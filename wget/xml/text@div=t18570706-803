                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's daughter, and am the wife of George Wyllie, and live in Well Street, Stratford—on 20th June last I was at my father's house—I left there at half-past 8 o'clock in the morning punctually—I left my father and my youngest brother Dennis in the house—I lived with my father and mother, and have done so ever since I have been married—I returned again at half past 9 o'clock—I had a large basket of lettuces and onions and flowers—I called at the foot of the stairs for my mother, and no answer was given—I immediately went up stairs and found my mother lying on her left arm on her face and hands in a corner of the room in a gore of blood—I picked her up and put her on her back—she was quite insensible—I went and brought two of the old inhabitants, and then went and fetched Mr. Vallance, the doctor—Benton, the policeman, came there—there was a great quantity of blood and brains on the floor—my mother's pocket was in the middle of the room, cut off, and her cap was round her neck—it appeared to have been cut off—it was plainly cut off—it was tied with two pieces of ribbon round it, and the pocket was cut off like with a knife, it had the appearance of being cut off either with a knife or a pair of scissors, I could not tell which—there was nothing in the pocket but one penny—I looked into a cupboard in the room and found a chopper there covered with hair and blood—we always used to keep the chopper there—it belonged to my father and mother—I gave it to Benton—I do not remember my father coming home on Tuesday, 16th June—I was out washing on Monday and Tuesday—I remember his coming home on Monday—nothing took place then before me, but he has often threatened her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

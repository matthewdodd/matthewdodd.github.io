I am the wife of William Bird, a gardener, of 11, Spicer Street, Battersea—on 25th February, between three and four p.m., Gregory came in for a quarter of an ounce of tobacco—the price was 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the girl served him, and I walked into the shop and took the shilling; it looked a little brassy, but I weighed it against another shilling, thought it was good, gave him change, and he left—I put it into the till with the shilling I weighed with it—somebody came in and spoke to me—I took the two shillings out, and the one Gregory gave me was bad—I am positive about it, because I only had a new shilling in the till with it, and if I had had another I should not have weighed it against a new one, as it might weigh heavier—I marked it and gave it to the inspector.</p>

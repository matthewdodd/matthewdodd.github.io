On the 13th of October the prisoner accosted me in North-street, City-road; she asked me to go home with her; I refused: she then asked me to give her something to drink, which I did - I was not above four minutes with her; I left her, and thought she was gone. I went down my master's stable yard, in <placeName id="t18271025-62-crimeloc393">North-street</placeName>

While I stood there for a necessary purpose I saw her come down the yard, and go back again; I ran after her, but could not find her. My coat was gone; nobody but her could have taken it - it was a light drab coat.</p>

            . I am a watchman of North-street. I saw the prosecutor going to a public-house with the prisoner - he had a coat on his arm; and in about five minutes I saw the prisoner come from the coach, with it on her arm - it was a light drab coat; I called to know what she had there - she said it was an old Benjamin - I said she had no business with it; she said, "Why, the young man you saw me with sent me for it" - I took no further notice.</p>

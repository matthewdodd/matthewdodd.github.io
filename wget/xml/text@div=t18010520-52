               <p>Q. How did you contrive to get in? - A. With a rook; then we got into the sliding passage, and there was a door, we broke that open, an there we staid for sometime, till there was an opportunity of letting Parker and Johnstone in; we let them in; we staid there for near an hour, on account of the watchman being on the opposite side of the way; the watchman went away, on account of a fire that was just broke out, and then we all went away; we took with us tea in canisters from out of the shop, lump sugar, nutmegs, and two great coats, I had one, and Johnstone the other; we were going to Parker's lodgings, and going along, the three prisoners saw the patrol; I did not see him, though I was close to him; I had a loaf of sugar, some nutmegs, and five pounds of sugar made up in papers; the patrol stopped me, and they three went away; the patrol took me to the watch-house, and searched me; he took this property from me, and from thence I was taken before Mr. Blamire; I had one of the great coats on; I don't know what became of the prisoners.</p>

            . I am a Thames police officer. I apprehended the prisoner - I asked him, what he had done with the shawl, the umbrella, and the tea - he said, he had not taken them, but upon taking him to the watch-house, he said, he had taken the umbrella and shawl, but the tea he knew nothing about - he had taken them out of vexation - when he was before the Magistrate, he said, he had been robbed of half a sovereign: on the following morning, he sent for a person, and told me to go with him to his room, and there I should find the umbrella and the duplicate of the shawl.</p>

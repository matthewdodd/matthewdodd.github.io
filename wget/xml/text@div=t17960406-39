               <p>Examined by Mr. Jackson. I travel the country with glasses: I was with Davis, at a cook's shop, saw him pack up a basket; he put in two silver watches, and one metal one; several cards of sleeve buttons, several pair of buckles, and some rheubarb; he wrapped them in brown paper, and put them into a white handkerchief, and then into the basket, with some straw; and some oranges were over them; and packed them with a packing needle; he gave me 6d. to carry it to the Gravesend boat, which I did, and put it on the seat myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Was the basket light oa heavy? - A. Not very light, nor very heavy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Davis before? - A. I had seen him before; I was sitting there at dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. How many oranges were there? - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. You have, perhaps, travelled in the country of Surrey? - A. Yes; crying about bad shillings; I cut them all; and I was laid hold of; that is a twelvemonth ago; the Justice sent me down as a vagrant; I found it a bad business when I was in the House of Correction.</p>
               <p>Q. So you reformed in the House of Correction; that is the place for reformation, and you determined to be a good lad for the future? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in the House of Correction you took this sit? - A. Yes; I was very happy that I was taken there; I used to sell them all to Mr. Cox, in Little Britain; I had them all cut, I had, upon my foul.</p>

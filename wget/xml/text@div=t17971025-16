               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The copper was not cut up till it came to Mr. Myatt's? - A. No; it was bent double.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that the bottom, which is most used, was less worn than the top? - A. The bottom is never so much burnt as the side.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Myatt taken up for this himself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you cut it up at Myatt's house? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. And what did you give him for it? - A.Eight-pence halfpenny for the copper, and one-penny farthing for the lead.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a fair price, and not such a price as persons that have stolen things would sell them at? - A. I never bought stolen goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Myatt never charged with any thing of this sort before? - A. Not since I have been servant to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing about three hundred weight of copper? - A. I never heard of it to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The lead you never saw at all; do you usually buy lead without ever having seen it? - A. Yes; it is a very common thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What, to buy what you never saw? - A. My servant saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave three-pence a pound? - A. Or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is this? - A. The 22d of last month, I believe it was eight-pence halfpenny that we agreed for.</p>

               <p>Q. Has it happened now unluckily to you, some little time ago, that there was an information against you? - A. It did happen so.</p>
               <p>Q. That was something about a similar job with this? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You got through that, did you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And you will get through this, if you can six it upon the prisoner, and save yourself? - A. If I had not had it from him.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe that little accident that happened to you before was about three or four hundred weight of copper? - A. No such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that about? - A. Mr. Rogers can tell you very well; he took some iron from me, and I had it all back again, because I proved that I had it fairly.</p>

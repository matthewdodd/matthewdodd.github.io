The prisoner was in my service, and had been so since Michaelmas 1831, when my father died - it was part of his duty to receive money from my customers - when he came in, I always asked him if he had received money, and I set it down in the cash-book - I did not receive 8l. 15s. 6d. from him on or about the <rs id="t18340904-105-cd594" type="crimeDate">23d of May</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. He never told you he had received either of those sums? A. No; I always thought he regularly accounted to me - he received from me a guinea a week - he generally borrowed money, and I had to receive 5s. a week from him until nearly 20l. was paid; and lately I have been paying him only 15s. a week, as he owed me eighteen guineas, and I deducted the rest to pay it - he has never, with my consent, kept money in his possession.</p>

            . I am an ale and porter merchant, and live in Spur-street, Leicester-square. I owed Miss Dawson 4l. 8s. 9d. - I bought the goods for cash at her house, and I paid the money to the prisoner, who delivered the goods to me in my counting-house - I paid him 4l. 8s. 9d. and took his receipt - I am not positive whether I gave him any change or a Â£5 note - here is his receipt, which I saw him write (read).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him sign that? A. Yes; I believe the whole bill to be his handwriting - I am sure I paid it to him - my brother at times attends to my business - I am sure I paid the money myself; but I do not know whether in a Bank-note or coin.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish Miss Dawson's books to be produced, to show how she proves I did not pay her the money; for she may swear that two years ago I have received hundreds of pounds for her, for which I have no receipt - I had no cash-book to put it down in.</p>
               <p>MISS DAWSON. I have my books here - they contain an account of sums received about that period - I make the entries myself - I ask him what sums he receives, and set them down - I never omitted to set down what he paid me, or told me was paid - nobody but myself kept the cashbook.</p>
               <p>MR. STAMMERS. Q. Was there any other book kept, between you and the prisoner? A. He kept a waste-book- I am convinced he never paid me these sums, or told me they were received - he paid to nobody but me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was another book in which entries were made quarterly from that one. Witness. I never saw it; if there was such a book, you must have taken it away with you; I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There has been another book which her late father used; it was locked up in the iron safe, and the key delivered to her - it was in my writing. Witness. I always locked the chest myself - I know of no book but the three produced, the cash-book, ledger, and waste-book- the bills were made out from the waste-book which he kept - these goods are entered in the waste-book, but not the payment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If she denies there being such a book three hundred times, she is a perjured woman - I wish it produced.</p>
               <p>MISS DAWSON. There was an old book of my father's accounts, as he had the business before me, but not of my business - I have kept a cash-book since October; before that I had no check against the prisoner - he left me in June - I pointed out to him a sum of 4l. odd, due from Mr. Davis, of Hackney, and said, "When are you going to receive that?" though I knew he had received it - I told him I supposed he knew he was answerable for what he was doing, and said, "Mr. Davis's account, of Hackney" - he said, "If I cannot live one way, I must another," and on the Saturday he left, as I heard he had received another sum - I did not then know of these transactions.</p>

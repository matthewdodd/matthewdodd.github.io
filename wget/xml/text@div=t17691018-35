On the 6th of this month the prisoner came to my house, I believe a little before eight in the evening; he called me into the passage, and desired me to light a fire and show him a room for two young women that he was going to treat. One he said was a lady's maid. I lighted a fire. They went up and had some oysters and some cheese, and about one o'clock, when all my company were gone, I wanted to go to bed. I went to him, and wanted him to pay and go. He insisted on having more punch, and insisted much on my drinking. (I suppose to make me drunk.) I told him I did not chuse to drink any more, or make any more punch. He much insisted much upon it, so I did make a shilling's worth. After that he would have some shrub. Some time before that he wanted me to change him a note. I said, If it is not a very large one, I will. He said, It is but a 10 l. note. I knew nothing of him. By and by, when the punch and shrub were drank, he pulled it out. I held it up by the candle, and said, This note will not do for me. I never saw such a one in my life; and gave it him back again. He had a green purse in his hand. I thought he would take out some gold to pay me. He would not pay me. I called my son to go and call the watch. Then we took him to the watch-house. There we searched him for this note, which I had seen him put into a pocket-book. We could not find the pocket-book, nor green purse. We went out of the watch-house, and found the pocket-book, and the false note in it, and the green purse, with a parcel of false guineas and half guineas in it. They were yellow counters. What appeared as guineas had a George the Third on one side and the English arms in a field in the other, and the half guineas a Queen Ann, and the other side resembling a sixpence very badly struck, and only lacquered. Though they shone like gold in the purse, a child of ten years of age might easily discern them not to be coin. In the pocket book was the 10 l. note which he had offered to me (produced in court) on thin paper, to resemble a 10 l. Bank note; the resemblance such, that possibly it may deceive some unwary tradesman.)</p>
               <p>The constable confirmed that of finding the note and counters, near the watch-house door.</p>

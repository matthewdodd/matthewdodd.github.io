             sworn. - I am warehouseman to Mr. Bolt: On Saturday the 25th of February, an officer came, and told me he had taken up one of my men, for stealing sugar, and I went and looked; I did not see him take it; the house is at <placeName id="t18000219-77-crimeloc467">Trigg-wharf, Upper Thames-street</placeName>

               <p>- SAMPSON sworn. - I am a constable: On Saturday the 25th of January, I and Reed were out together; going along Upper Thames-street, I observed the prisoner and three more men, near Mr. Bolt's warehouse; I observed the prisoner and one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180002190060"></xptr>other go to the gate of the warehouse, and I saw the prisoner stoop, and then he came away and went up a court; it was so dark, we could not see whether he had any thing in his hand or not; then he came back again, and brought something from underneath the gateway, up the court, on the opposite side of the way; we stopped at a distance to watch their coming out of the court; after being up the court two or three minutes, the prisoner and another <rs id="t18000219-77-deflabel468" type="occupation">soldier</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18000219-77-defend719 t18000219-77-deflabel468"></join> came out of the court, each had a bag in his hand; I went over to them, and asked what they had there; I took hold of this man; the moment I spoke, down went the bags, and the other man came up to me, and gave me a blow in the stomach, and I fell down; the prisoner was secured, and told me who they were, that they had each a bag, and that they worked on the premises that day, and got it out of the casks, and put it at the gate-way ready, and there is a great deal, some in stockings, and some in handkerchiefs; it was wide enough at the bottom of the door to get it out; I went back to the warehouse to examine it; he told me the others had a bag a-piece, this man behaved very civil, the other did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. What he has said is very false; as soon as I came out of Mr. Bolt's, I went away home, and the man ran after me; my master was satisfied, and never knew me to take half a pound of sugar in my life; I have been there five years; I am innocent of the crime laid to my charge, I had no concern with it at all; I worked there all the week, my master searched me that night, and gave me my money, and I went away; I never offered to take a bit, and he never found a bit upon me.</p>

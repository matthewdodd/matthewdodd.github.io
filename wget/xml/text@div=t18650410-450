                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Payne, of the White Hart, Vine-court, Spitalfields—on the night of the 19th and 20th of March, I went to bed about 1 o'clock—the house was fastened and secured before going to bed—the door leading into the bar-parlour and all the windows were fastened—we were called up about 4 o'clock by the police—I went to the bar<lb></lb>parlour, and found a little back window had been taken out, and two iron bars broken right out—the bar-parlour door was burst open—the drawers and cupboard had all been ransacked, and several things had been taken—I afterwards saw those things at the station on the same morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller, in the employment of Richard Hellaby, of Huggin-lane. The prisoner was in the same employ<lb></lb>ment, as porter—goods have been missed from the warehouse repeatedly for several months past—I was in the habit of going out with a horse and four wheeled vehicle, called a <hi rend="italic">trap</hi>—on the morning of 4th Nov. I had assorted goods to take out, and placed them on the warehouse floor—it was the prisoner's duty to take the goods which I had assorted, and place them in the <hi rend="italic">trap</hi>, and when he had done so, it was customary for him to come in and say he was ready, and then I would go out to him—on this occasion I did not wait for his coming in to me, but went down to my <hi rend="italic">trap</hi> sooner than I usually did—when I got round the corner in sight of the <hi rend="italic">trap</hi>, I observed that the prisoner was doing something underneath the footboard; before I had time to reach the <hi rend="italic">trap</hi>, he held his head up pretty sharply, and saw me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185611240015"></xptr>
               <p>approaching—he then jumped into the <hi rend="italic">trap</hi>, to put the goods which he had into the body of the trap, and then went into the warehouse for more goods—while he was absent I examined the <hi rend="italic">trap</hi>, to see what he had been doing under the footboard, and in the boot I found these four boxes, each containing a dozen neck ties—two are worth 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, and two 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—I took the boxes into the warehouse—the prisoner had no right to place them there—there was plenty of space in the body of the <hi rend="italic">trap</hi> for more goods than were in it—after this he accompanied me as usual with the <hi rend="italic">trap</hi>—I asked him why he had put those goods in there—he made some obser<lb></lb>vations which I did not clearly understand, and I said, "You have no right to put them there, Sir;" indeed, I believe I called him a d—fool for doing so, I was much enraged at it—he said, "I was not going to do any<lb></lb>thing with them"—I went out, and returned as usual—those four boxes did not form any part of the goods that I was to take out with me that morning.</p>

I went to the prosecutor's warehouse on 4th Nov., about 5 o'clock in the evening—as soon as the prisoner came in with Mr. Risdale, I told him I was a police officer, and he was given into my custody, for stealing four dozen neck ties—he said, "I only brought them down stairs with the other goods"—he gave his address at the station house, No. 10, Winchester-street, Borough-market—I went there; he lived there with his mother—I there found the five empty boxes that have been produced.</p>

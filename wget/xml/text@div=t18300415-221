            . I was in Brydges-street, and saw the prisoner walking up Catherine-street, with two others; a gentleman desired me to look sharp after them - they were following the prosecutor and his two friends; I went on the other side, and in a few minutes I saw the prisoner with this handkerchief in his hand; I desired them to wait- I went and took this handkerchief from the prisoner's pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. What first attracted your attention to the prisoner? A. A gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150102"></xptr>told me he thought they were very bad characters; I never saw the prisoner before - they were walking close behind the prosecutor; the prisoner said he had picked it up.</p>
               <p>MR. RICHMOND. This is my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you used it just before? Yes - I am in the habit of carrying it in my hand, and, from the state of the evening, I am confident I must have used it within two or three minutes; it was not then in my hand, and it might possibly have dropped out of my pocket - I had had it in my hand in passing from the Sun newspaper-office; I cannot say how it left my person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking up Russell-street with two young men, and found the handkerchief - it was dirty; I took it up and put it into my pocket - I went down York-street, and as I returned, the officer took me and another young man; I was above two hundred yards from the place where they say this was committed, and it is not likely I should have returned.</p>

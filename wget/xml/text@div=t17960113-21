               <p>I am a watchman, I was calling the hour, I had got a little beyond where the prisoner and the last witness were; I heard the cry of watch; I turned about and saw them down together; I heard him say, I will not let you go, he has robbed my mistress's bar; I told him to let go for I had got him. (The baize was produced in court by Price).</p>
               <p>Snoxell. That is my property, it contains three yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the frock? - A. We did not miss the frock till the next day, till my wife went to dress the child again; she had, about five minutes before this happened, undressed the child; what came of them we cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Price.) Q. Did you see any thing of this frock? - A. No;</p>
               <p>Q. (To Snoxell.) Was this baize in your bar? - A. Yes; it was what we had to cover the child when he lies in the cradle.</p>
               <p>The prisoner made no defence.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Snoxell.) Q. Is there any mark upon that baize? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. He was seen to take it out, and therefore it is not of any consequence whether there is any mark upon it or not.</p>

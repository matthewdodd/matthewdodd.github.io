                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant</hi>). On Sunday evening, 6th Aug., I was on Greenwich-pier, and saw the three prisoners, about half past 7 or a quarter to 8 o'clock, on the <hi rend="italic">dummy</hi> at the landing-place—I was on the pier, which commanded a view of the <hi rend="italic">dummy</hi>, and all below—there were a great many people waiting for a boat—a boat came alongside the pier, and there was a great rush of people—I immediately got on the <hi rend="italic">dummy</hi>, between the two gangways, by the paddle-box, and saw the prisoners passing over the gangway leading from the <hi rend="italic">dummy</hi> to the boat—Rowe got in front of the prosecutrix, and Madden by her side, as they passed over—as soon as Rowe stepped on to the boat he turned round and faced the lady, which caused a slight obstruction for half a minute, and he put his hand into her pocket and pulled out this purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he then went round behind the engine, and conelly also on the other side; they met; and at that moment I jumped on the paddle-box, to get into the boat—I saw Rowe give Conelly this purse into his right hand—Conelly had this umbrella (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his hand, and he put the purse and the umbrella so (<hi rend="italic">grasping the purse and the umbrella together in one hand</hi>)—I could still see a portion of the purse—they separated immediately, before I could get near them—I then spoke to the captain, and, from what he told me, I went into the urinal, and saw Madden, with the purse in his hand, taking the money out—he attempted to pat it into his pocket, and I took it out of his hand—he said, "What do you want?"—I said, "I want you, for stealing this purse"—I took him on shore, and gave him into custody—I then went back, brought out Conelly, and left him in charge of one of the crew—I then went and took Rowe—as I brought him off the boat, I saw the other two, and Rowe said, "What are you going to take those two innocent gentlemen for? they know nothing about it"—as I brought Rowe off, I spoke to the prosecutrix, and asked her to come with me—I took the prisoners to the station, and told them that they were charged with stealing the purse and contents—they made no reply whatever—the lady described the contents, in their presence, within a shilling or two.</p>

                  </hi>. I am captain of a Greenwich steamboat. I came up to the pier on this Sunday evening—sergeant Carpenter came on board, and said something to me—I looked after Conelly, who was standing by the companion, with a female alongside of him—they had some conversation together, and then walked forward; he then walked back to Madden, whom I had not seen before—there is a convenience there, where I saw Conelly give something to Madden, but I cannot say what it was—the moment Madden had got it I saw him turn away, and then I told Carpenter, who fetched him out.</p>

On Monday the 16th of last month a person came into the shop for a pair of jean shoes; I tried them on, she said they would do; the customer wanted some pocket handkerchiefs, I went round my counter to get the scissars to cut the handkerchief off; I saw the prisoner at the bar come in, she asked me the price of a gown that was hanging on the shop door, I told her about five shillings; I did not watch her, I did not suspect her. When I had cut off the pocket handkerchief she took it in her hand, and said how good it was for the money; she went out; I did not know that she had any of my property; a neighbour opposite gave me some information. I saw the prisoner run over the way, and I almost flew after her; I never lost sight of her only as she turned the corner of a court; I stopped<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010055"></xptr>her at the first door of the court; I took a white gown, a white cloak, and a nankeen spencer, out of her hand.</p>

            . On the 16th of May last I was standing at my own door, I saw the prisoner in Mrs. Smith's shop; as Mrs. Smith was busy, I saw her take something down; she then went to the counter, and the article that Mrs. Smith was shewing to the other woman the prisoner laid hold of with her left hand, while she tried to conceal the property with her right; in a short time afterwards I saw the prisoner come out of the shop with the sleeve of something hanging down before her; I directly ran over to Mrs. Smith and told her of it, and she pursued her and took her at the back door of our house, with the property in her hand.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into this lady's shop, I asked the price of a gown; she fitted it on me; I had a bundle with me. I was stooping to fasten my shoe at the step of the door: at that time I laid my bundle down; I must have taken them up in a mistake. From that time I have been in confinement. I have been robbed by the prisoners, which has been a severe punishment to me.</p>

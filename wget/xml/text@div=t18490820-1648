                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, of 204, Fleet-street. On 2d Aug., about a quarter to eight o'clock in the evening, Henry Norriss came to my shop with these four saltcellars (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was twilight—I had a light in one part of the shop—my shopman looked at them, and threw them into the silver scale—while he was writing the ticket, I did not like the appear<lb></lb>ance of the saltcellars, and took one up, and said, "What have you here?"—Norriss said, "Four silver saltcellars"—I said, "What do you want on them?"—he said, "3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said, "Are they yours?"—he said, "No, they belong to a lady, and cost 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "What is the name of the lady?" and wrote down his answer, "Mrs. Norriss, 14, Portland-street, Oxford-street"—I said, "Is the lady related to you, as you bring the salts?"—he said, "No, she is merely an acquaintance"—I said, "What is your name?"—he said, "Henry Stone; I live at High-street, Notting-hill; my father is a whip-maker"—I wrote it down—I said, "It is very singular you should bring the</p>

"I will not trouble you to do that, I will send for her"—he said, "No; I will tend my elder brother"—while I was questioning him, he said, "Here is a watch and chain, I will have 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on these as well"—I had gone on the other side of the counter, seeing him uncomfortable, and he attempted to push by me—I would not let him pass, and sent for a policeman—I told him what had passed, and said, "You don't wish to make any alteration in these statements, I pre-sume?"—he said, "Yes, I should; let me see, what have I told you?"—I said, "You told me your name is Henry Stone; is that so?"—he said, "No, my name is Henry Norriss"—I gave him in custody, suspecting the salt-cellars were not silver; if silver, I would lend 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce on them, which would be 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they weigh eleven ounces—knowing what they are, I would lend 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the four—here is the appearance of an old genuine hall-mark—they have the appearance of old silver.</p>

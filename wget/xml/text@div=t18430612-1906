The prisoner Allport came to my house to look at a room for Mr. Johnson—I showed' her a room—she said it was for a gentleman who had come off a journey, and he was come and look at it—she left, and returned in the evening with Johnson—they left together, and came again next day together—Allport brought a carpet bag, which was taken into the room—Johnson took posse<lb></lb>sion of the room—Allport fetched some ale, and then left Johnson there—he said that night—Allport came again in the morning—she assisted as servant to him—Johnson said she had nursed him in a fit of illness, and he allowed her to come and do for him—he remained at our house till last May—Allport came in the morning, and was in and out during the day—I missed a table-cloth and some spoons about two months after he came—I asked Allport if she knew anything of the spoons, she denied it—on Tuesday, the 9th of May, I gave Allport into custody—I went to the station with her, and returned to my house with-the policeman—I missed the feathers out of the bed, two blankets, a sheet, two pillows, a bolster, fire-irons, and other things, which were my husband's, and had been left in my custody—these are the things which I let to Johnson with the room—this table-cloth and spoons—they were part of my husband's property—in the evening Johnson came, I told him Mrs. Allport was out—he asked how that was—I told him if he would step in I would tell him—I told him she was in custody, she had taken the silver spoons from my apart<lb></lb>ment and pawned them—he seemed astonished, and said he knew nothing about it—I told him my room was stripped of all the things—he said Mrs. Allport did it in his absence—I told him the feathers were all gone out of the bed—he said they were all made into pillows, and they were all safe, Mrs. Allport had done it, and they would be returned again; what could be done in it?—I said it was in the hands of the officer—I gave him into custody.</p>

On Tuesday afternoon, the 9th of May, the prosecutrix gave Allport into custody—she said she knew nothing of the robbery—she wanted to go up stairs and change her dress—I said I must go with her—when she got up there was no dress there—she then wanted to go backwards—I would not let her—I took her, and then went back and found a duplicate of a spoon, and one of a sheet—one was between the bed and mattress—in the evening Johnson came back—the prosecutrix told him Allport was in custody—he seemed quite astonished—she told him the room was completely stripped—he said, "God bless me, you don't say so?"—she said, "Yes, I do, and more than that, all the feathers are gone out of the bed"—he was astonished—he could not sleep on the bedding and not know it-he then said he knew they were gone; they were made into pillows and pledged, but she should have them all again; he hoped she would not go on with it; it was all Allport's doings, and the would be the ruin of him—I found fifty-four duplicates on him, twenty-two relating to this property.</p>

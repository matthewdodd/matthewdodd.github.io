               <p>Had you a fight of them before they got up? - Yes, I saw them upon the man, they appeared to be searching his clothes what I could see of them, I overtook them both; when they found I came up so fast they both turned round and stood, one with a cutlass, and the other with a stick which I thought was a cutlass at first, to make a defence against me; indeed it was a wonder they had not chopped me; then I run back and I came and picked the man up.</p>
               <p>In what situation did you find the man? - With both his hands tied together all over blood almost.</p>
               <p>You untied him then? - I took him home to my master's and we untied him and washed him, and took him to the infirmary.</p>

               <p>Did he appear to be much hurt and wounded? - Yes, he did indeed Sir, we expected he would have died.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of seeing both or either of the men so as to know them again? - No, it was too dark.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the apprehending the prisoner afterwards? - Yes, my Lord, I took him the next morning within ten yards of the place, he came back to see whether there was any money lost, the next morning I went out early with my barrow into the fields, and when I came into the field this prisoner was coming down to the place where the prosecutor's hat laid all night, and I took hold of him, I had seen the hat before the prisoner came, the prisoner was alone when I saw him come up to the hat, I took him before he came to the hat, and he told me after I took him, that he came to see whether there was any money lost, this was while we were taking him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>What did he say to the charge? - He said at first he was innocent of it, and he afterwards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290018"></xptr> confessed and told us where to find the other man, as well as he could.</p>
               <p>Was any body with you when you took him at first? - No, I took him to my master, he confessed to my master he was concerned in the robbery, and told me he was coming to see if there was any money lost, the other man could not be found though he gave us directions after him.</p>
               <p>Did he say who the other man was? - Yes, he said that he had been with him, he said he had not been in company with him above three or four hours before the action was done, but he knew nothing of him before.</p>
               <p>What directions did he give you to find him? - He gave us directions to the Bladebone near Mile-end turnpike, and there we were to ask the servant maid that lived there whether she had seen any thing of such a man.</p>
               <p>Did he name the man? - No, he said he could not name the man, my master and I went there, but we could get no intelligence of the man, otherwise than they had been there the day before, these two men had left this man at another house, while they were there together two or three hours.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was the other man in company with this man before that afternoon? - Not that I know off, this man and I came into London of a Thursday morning, and he pretended to be my friend, then we went to the White Swan, and he borrowed a guinea of me to get change to get some meat for breakfast, I was not mighty willing to let him have it, and he went away about nine, and did not return till three or four, and he brought this man with him; the prisoner told me the other man was bred and born in the same place with him, and that they were all the same as brothers.</p>
               <p>When did you first see this man the prisoner, and where? - On Tuesday night at the Coach and Horses on this side Ilford, he joined company with me there, and came to town with me.</p>
               <p>Was the other man there at all? - No, I never saw the other till I came into London</p>
               <p>Then you did not see the other man till the Thursday afternoon? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Strong. Did you find any of the things in the possession of the prisoner? - We put him into my master's stable, we did not think to search his pockets before we put him into the stable; when we took him out again, we found the handkerchief and the pair of stockings, I was not present when my master found them, he is here.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner confessed to your master that he was concerned in the robbery, was there any promise made him? - I was not there, he told me he came to look if there was any money.</p>

               <p>What did the prisoner say for himself? - We secured him in the stable, I asked him how he came to be such a cruel man to behave in such a manner to a man that he had been acquainted with; he first of all denied it, and said he knew nothing of the matter; I told him he was a very remarkable man, that no person could mistake him, I said if you tell me the truth we will beg for you, and recommend you to mercy as far as we can; but if you mean to deceive us, it will be worse for you; I found these things hid in the stable, I supposed he might be shifting something out of his pockets, he went back and made me no answer either way; we delivered him to the watch-house, and I set a man to clean the stable, I had looked but could find. nothing; and while I stood by the man, he put his hand on the rack, and among some straw that was on the rack there, he pulled out these stockings and this handkerchief; these are the things that were found there, I have had them in my possession ever since.</p>

            , you have been convicted by the verdict of a very merciful Jury upon the clearest and most satisfactory evidence, of a crime so attrocious as to demand the most severe and immediate interposition of Justice; our sovereign has publickly declared his determination to afford no mercy to those wretches, whose wickedness leads them to add the crimes of cruelty and violence to that of robbery; and to endanger the lives as well as the properties of his unoffending subjects; every body must applaud the wisdom and humanity of that determination, and I find it peculiarly my duty in the situation in which I am placed, to lend every assistance in my power towards effectuating his Majesty's intentions. The case that has been proved against you appears to be attended with every aggravation; you were not only a partaker in the cruelty and violence that was used by your companion on this occasion, in treating this unfortunate man in a manner that indangered his life, and was likely to bring you to this bar for murder: but by your extreme treachery you seduced this unfortunate man under the expectation of receiving kindness at your hands, into a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290020"></xptr> situation which gave you an opportunity of perpetrating this shocking cruelty which is a farther aggravation of your crime. There is therefore no circumstance of favour to be found in your case, and for the protection of the innocent and for an example to others, it is necessary you should be brought to speedy and exemplary justice; your case comes so full within his Majesty's declaration, that I shall think it necessary to make a report to his Majesty on Monday, or so soon after as he shall receive the same, and you must therefore prepare for a speedy execution, as soon as his Majesty's pleasure is known; at present it is my duty to pronounce upon you the dreadful sentence of the law, which is, that you be carried from hence to the place from whence you came and from thence to the place of execution, there to be <rs id="t17831029-4-punish27" type="punishmentDescription">

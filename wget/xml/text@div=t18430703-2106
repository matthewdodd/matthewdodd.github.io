                  </hi>. I live in Buckeridge-court, Buckeridge-street, St. Giles's; the prisoner lived next door to me. I was up stairs in my room—the prisoner was down, outside her own door in the court—I heard her say I had taken her candle and candlestick—I sent one of my children to say I had not got it—I put my head out of window—she used bad expressions, and said I had got them—I came out into the court afterwards, and she accused me of it again—I put on my gown, and went down with my candle and candlestick in my hand to show her it was not hers, and said I had no other—she immediately used bad expressions, took up a knife, and said if I said so again she would cut me—she cut me across the middle of my hand with a knife, then took up a fork and stabbed me in the left arm—I went out, and her husband and her, and another woman, followed me out and all beat me—I lent up against the wall to support myself, for I was quite faint with the loss of blood—a person fetched the police—when he came she had gone into her own room—I put my hand through the window, and pulled the curtain aside, to show the policeman where she was gone—the policeman told me to have my hand attended to, and he would take her in the morning—I went to the work—house—the doctor there would not have anything to do with it, it might be a locked jaw case—I was taken to Charing-cross hospital—they were two hours taking me there, from my continual fainting.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Charing-cross Hospital. The pro<lb></lb>secutrix was brought there early in the morning, with a wound on the back of the hand, about two inches long, dividing the skin across the superficial veins at the back of the hand, which produced a hemorrhage—she was very faint—I dressed it—the hemorrhage stopped, and I believed the wound would soon heal, but it did not do so well as I expected—she has been a patient at the hospital ever since—it was a wound about two inches long, very smoothly cut—I believe it was done with a sharp instrument—when I went to the police—office she complained of a stab in the left arm, and pointed out three punctures from the fork—they were not of any consequence—I had not seen them be<lb></lb>fore.</p>

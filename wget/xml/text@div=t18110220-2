I had no doubt of it being Mr. Vaughan's wheat.</p>

            . I am a police officer of Hatton Garden office. On the 4th of December I went down with Mr. Vaughan to his barn door, it appeared to have been broken open by an iron instrument, by some rust being on the door. I went to Old Hayden's house, he was at home sitting by the fire; I went to search his house; I had no warrant; I asked him for the candle that was on the table, he said he would be d - d if I should have it; he said he had killed many men in his time, and he would not mind killing me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Hayden the elder has been a soldier.</p>
               <p>Cook. I sent to the next door and got a candle, I then went up stairs, I found a bushel of flour; I found the wheat in the back kitchen, or washhouse, it was in sacks, and covered over with two or three trusses of straw. I asked his wife in his presence how it came there, she said she did not know, she was sure it was not there at six o'clock the night before. He said nothing to it. I told Old Haydon he must go to town with me; he said he would not go; I then went to Young Hayden's house, there I found this crow, it is an implement of husbandry, and a sack of Mr. Vaughan's.

Yes, by the Chase side, near Windmill hill; I saw two persons, they were going the same way as I was. I was walking my horse, it was about three o'clock, it was a light morning; I asked them what o'clock it was; they gave me no answer. They had a sack each. One was a short man, he had a lighter load than the tall man. I think I have seen one of them since, I think it to be young Hayden. I saw him when he was examined about a week after, he had the same coat on then I think.</p>
               <p>Q. You were to have been here the last Sessions - A. Yes. I have been obliged to stop away from Enfield ever since. I have been threated by the prisoner's wife, not by either of the prisoners. At the magistrate's I had no knowledge of the man, only the dress.</p>

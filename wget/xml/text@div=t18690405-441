               <p>not know it—Harvey asked me to call again on the Monday—I did so, and he paid me the money he owed me—I had some conversation about the cheque at that time—shortly afterwards Harvey removed from his place—he told me he should want me to move his goods from Norwood—he subsequently owed me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he gave me a sovereign and a cheque for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which has not been paid—it was on the Union Bank at Croydon, I think—I know Gosling's handwriting—the signature, "Harvey," in this signature-book is not Gosling's handwriting—I should imagine it was Harvey's—I know Harvey's handwriting—I have seen him write—the endorsement on the cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is not Gosling's, it is Harvey's, decidedly, and so is this cheque for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., given to Mr. Biggs—the body of this cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is not so distinctly Harvey's as the endorsement—the endorsement is his, decidedly, and so is this letter, written to Mr. Biggs—on 22nd August, I met Gosling between the Strand and Pall Mall—he hailed me, he was in a cab—I left him at Pall Mall, at the Bell public-house, kept by Mr. Prowse—there was a fight there—Goswell was one of the principal performers in it, and he got a bloody nose and a black eye, I believe—he had a tremendous blow in the eye—he was struck over the partition in the bar, by a tall Scotchman, who gave the name of McDonald—he gave me his name to go up for him as a witness, as he was going to summons Gosling for an assault—I saw Gosling again two or three days after, he then had a black eye, and a scratch down the side of his nose; his face was a good deal marked—he complained of his wrist—I don't think it was io, a sling—he complained of its being stiff.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Hether the pawnbroker. On Thursday the 8th of November, the prisoner came into our shop, and offered six silver thimbles to sell between two and three o'clock; seeing them new thimbles, I carried them into my master; and I asked the prisoner when I came back again, where he got them, he said he found them; seeing them to be new thimbles my master ordered me to send for an officer, and he was taken into custody; when the officer came and he was searched, and a chain and seals were hanging at his watch pocket; the officer took all the things, but the thimbles. I have got the thimbles, they have been in my custody ever since. (The thimbles produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say, only that I found them.</p>

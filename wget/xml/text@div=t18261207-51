This property was locked in a box in my second-floor room; Smith, the prisoner, and another, came to lodge in that room on the 16th of November - they had all come to town by the Birmingham waggon - the prisoner was the only person who slept there on the 19th - Smith, I understood, had lost himself - when the prisoner came down in the morning of the 19th to breakfast, he had two large bundles - he went away with them; I sent my wife up-stairs, and then fetched him back with the bundles; I asked if he knew any thing of a box being broken open; he said he did not; I gave him in charge - the bundles contained the property stated in the indictment, with other things; Smith returned next day, and claimed them - his box was broken open.</p>

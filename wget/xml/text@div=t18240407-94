            . I am a coach-finisher, and live with Mr. Elder. On the 22d of March, between two and three o'clock, I was in the workshop, near the staircase of the dwelling-house. There is a private-door leading to the dwelling-house, and another from the shop, which is generally open, the street door is kept shut. I heard some words on the stairs, looked up, and saw the prisoner behind the cook, who was coming down stairs - she asked him what he did there; he said he was sent there by a gentleman; she then asked what he had in his apron; he said</p>
               <p>"What is that to you?" she said she insisted upon knowing, and put her hand on his shoulder to stop him from going out - he gave himself a twist, I directly collared him, and insisted on knowing what he had got; I put my hand to his apron, which was tied up round him, something rattled, he said,</p>
               <p>"Well, come, I will shew you, do not hold me in this way." I took him into the counting-house, and found a sugar-bason, two table-spoons, a fish-slice, a gravy-spoon, a fork, and two salt-spoons on him; he afterwards sat down by the side of the desk, and there I found a seal.</p>

            . I am cook to Mr. Elder. I was going down stairs, and saw the drawing-room door open; I went in, (as I knew it was shut not an hour before) and saw the prisoner coming out of the adjoining room, where part of this plate was kept. I asked him how he came there - he said a gentleman below had sent him up. He asked if some gentleman lived there; I do not recollect the name. I went down stairs before him, keeping him behind. I stopped him at the bottom of the stairs. Summers came - he has stated what passed correctly. Part of the plate was kept in the adjoining room too that in which I saw him, and the other locked up in the room where I saw him. I knew it all to be my masters'. I missed it from where it was taken.</p>
               <p>MR. ELDER. It is my property; most of it is engraved with my initials; it would take 30 l. to replace it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Are you aware that your door was open - A. It must have been, or he could not have got in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I will leave it to the mercy of the Court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Camden Town post office—a letter posted at Aldershott in the morning would be delivered at Camden Town in the afternoon, but I have nothing to do with them—on Thursday, 3d June, about 1 o'clock in the day, the prisoner came, with another woman, and presented this order—I had that morning received a letter from Alder<lb></lb>shott, advising the transmission of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner had a letter with her which she offered me, with the order—the order was not signed—I said, "Is this for you?" she said, "Yes," and I gave it back to her, with a pen which had blue ink in it, to sign it—she attempted to sign it, but I went away to dinner, leaving her and the other woman at the counter, and a clerk named Day went into my desk—the prisoner was agitated, and I should say, that she had been drinking.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer, of 430, Oxford Street—the prisoner was in my service as messenger and porter up to the time of this charge—he had no authority to open letters and receive money without positive instructions—on 14th November I received a communication from Mr. Sears, of Lee Green, in consequence of which I went to a post-office at 26, Oxford Street (I had previously been to another), and there saw Mr: Lee, who made a communication to me and described a person; in consequence of that I gave the prisoner into custody—Mr. Lee showed me this Post Office order; it bean my name—it is not my writing—I could not swear it was the prisoner's—I have never received the money for it—I never gave any one authority to receive the proceeds.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prisoner was sent out on Wednesday evening, 12th November, after 4 o'clock—he had a small brown paper parcel with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the post-office at 26, Oxford Street—I had seen the prisoner several times before 12th November—he came in on Wednesday, the 13th, with this order, and wished to have the money for it—I told him it was too late, it was after hours—I told him to come next morning—he came next morning—the order was signed when he brought it—he did not sign it in my presence—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—on the Thursday Mr. Hopkins came to the office—I gave him a description of the prisoner, and showed him the order—I afterwards saw the prisoner in the yard at the back of the Police Court with five or six others, and I picked him out—he had a brown paper parcel with him on the Wednesday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said before the Magistrate that to the best of my belief the prisoner was the man; that is what I mean now—I don't mean to go further than that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have no moral doubt about his being the man except this: that a great many persons present orders to me, but his coming late and my answering him rather sharply drew my attention to him, and his coming again on the Thursday morning and my paying him the order was further proof that he was the lad.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday, the 3d of this month, about four in the afternoon, the prisoner, North, came to my shop. She desired my boy to shew her something for a waistcoat: he reached her several Manchester silks, and silk and cottons; the piece I lost he in particular recommended to her, as a handsome pattern. While he was shewing her these things, Davis and Cook came into the shop. I immediately went to them,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170019"></xptr> to know what they wanted. They asked for some brown linen. I reached them some brown cotton; I cut them half a yard. They then asked me if I sold flannel; I told them I did. They desired I would shew them some; I went to the other end of the shop to shew them some flannel. In the mean time, while I went to the back part of the shop, North fixed on a pattern that was in a book; and the boy came to the back part of the shop where he was to fetch it, and the prisoners were all three left together during that time. I returned to Davis and Cook with the flannel, and he followed me with the piece which Mrs. North desired to see. The counter being rather full, I desired Davis and Cook to walk to another counter, which they did, where I served them with the flannel they wanted, leaving North and the boy together. As soon as I had served Davis and Cook with the flannel, and they had paid me for it, and the brown cotton I had cut them, and they were gone away, I returned to the boy, who was then serving Mrs. North with half a yard of stuff, and likewise a yard of dimity. She paid for what she had cut off, and I was talking to her for some time concerning a piece of silk that lay on the counter, for which we could not agree; she told me she would consider of it, and went away. The instant she was gone out, the boy began to put the things in the window. I believe the fourth piece he had occasion to put in the window was the piece he recommended to her, and which was lost. He called to me immediately, and said there was a piece of silk lost; that was within three minutes after Mrs. North had left the house. There was no person came into my house during that time, but a person I was very well acquainted with, whose name is

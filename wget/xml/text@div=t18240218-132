            . On the 29th of January, about five o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in and looked at some ribbons. She described a ribbon to me - I fetched another drawer and shewed her; she said she wanted one with a flower. Mr. Cross came and asked me a question, and as I turned my head, I saw her put something under her child's clothes - her child was on the counter. I said I had not got what she wanted - she immediately left the shop. I missed a piece of ribbon from the drawer, followed her into the street, and told her she had taken a piece of ribbon - she said not. I said it was useless to deny it. She was then taking a piece from under her apron - I took it out of her hand, and have it here. It was in the drawer when I shewed it to her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did she not appear a little intoxicated - A. No; I did not see what she put under the child.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was the child's birth-day - I had drank rather too much, and went to buy a yard and a half of ribbon, like some I had bought there before. The child took the ribbon up, and being rather in liquor, I went out without perceiving it. The child dropped it on the step of the door, and before I could turn to take it back, the gentleman came.</p>

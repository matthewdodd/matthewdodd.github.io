I am a ship's chandler, and live at 1, Sidney Street, Stepney—on 21st August, about 2.30 a. m., I heard a noise—I was in bed—I saw the prisoner lying stretched along the floor—his hand was stretched out, and he had drawn my trousers out from my other clothes, and had them in his hand—I said "What brings you here this time of the morning?"—he said he had come after 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I owed him—I did not owe him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said "You young rascal, you have got my trousers there"—he said "No, I have not"—I said "Get up," and I took my trousers and pulled the money, 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., out of the pockets—he had worked eight months for me, and left without notice about four weeks before—I called my son up and sent him into the yard to see if there was anyone else there—I went down to the street door and called a policeman in—the prisoner said he got through the wicket-gate with the knife and went in the office in the yard, at 11 o'clock at night, that he watched us all to bed and saw my son come in at 12. 15, and he made his way to come through the sheds at 2 o'clock into the house—he had unlatched the door next to the yard and got over two stacks of iron in the sheds, and into the kitchen—they all communicate with the inner door of the house—there was also a door in the kitchen which leads to the stairs—he had pushed that door open—I always found him very honest—I have sent him out with cheques to get changed, and he has fetched them all right—I never found anything against him—after he left my service I sent my son round to his lodgings, and he sent a message back by my son—he said "Tell your father I have got a place for 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and I don't want to come back to him, "</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 337). On 10th November I was on duty in Oxford Street, and about 5 p.m. saw the prisoner in Castle Street, near Tottenham Court Road—I said "Have you been in Tottenham Court Road V—he said "No"—I said "You answer the description of a man who is wanted for uttering counterfeit coin"—he said "You are labouring under a great mistake; I am not the man"—I said "I shall take you in custody on this charge"—on the way to the station he put his hand in his pocket, and when he pulled it out he had some money in it which looked like silver—I wrenched it from his hand, and found these six bad florins, one wrapped in newspaper and five loose—I searched him at the station, and found on him a screwdriver, a black lead pencil not cut, a bottle of blacking, a new collar, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and bronze—he gave his name Morris—he was taken to the Court next morning; I gave him into the charge of another constable, and he escaped—on the Saturday fortnight afterwards I saw him in Rupert Court, Russell Square, and said "Is your name Mitchell?"—he said "No"—I said "You are the man," and took him in custody—I after<lb></lb>wards went to his lodging in Anerley Street, Battersea Park, with Inspector Angier.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I was told that some coin had been passed at Messrs. Buck's in Tottenham Court Road—I went there, but did not find that any coin had been passed there—a woman joined you as I. walked up to you—I said nothing to her—I saw her outside the station door, but not in the station—I went to Parker Street, Westminster, between the 10th and the 29th, to keep observation, because I received information that you were likely to go there—I saw the landlord there—I inquired about a woman who, I understand, was living on the top floor—I had no charge to make against her; my object was to reapprehend you if you should be in her company—I kept observation on her and traced her to Oxford Street, though I had nothing to allege against her—on the night of your reapprehension I found two women in your company, one of whom was, I believe, the woman who was with you on the 10th—I had seen her at 5, Anerley Street on the 11th—I was present when a bad florin was found, in a cupboard of that house where food and crockery are kept—a woman.</p>

               <p>with a child in her arms was there and another woman—they both saw it found, I believe—I asked them if they lived there, and told them we had come to search the place—we searched both rooms thoroughly, and after we found the florin we asked them how it came there, and they both said that you had put it there—the one with a child in her arms said that she was living with you—she did not say that she was your wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was not the woman with the child who followed us to the station—the same woman was with him when I arrested him on the 29th, and she was also at Anerley Street; we watched her there from the station—the place was searched that night, and both the women were then—I am positive he is the man whom I apprehended on the 10th, and who escaped.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I spoke to the woman at the station on 10th November—I don't think she made any remark about the florin till we found it—I saw her and spoke to her several times during the three weeks that elapsed—I watched her many days, thinking you might be with her, and I should get a chance of apprehending you—I spoke to her once in the Seven Dials, and many other times—I think I saw her once at the end of Tottenham Court Road—I object to tell you the nature of the conversation between us—I did not cause her to be searched on the night she came to the station.</p>

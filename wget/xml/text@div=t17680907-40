            , sen. I live at Staines, I am mother to the child that has been used ill; about the 24th or 25th of August in the evening, the child complained she had a pain in her groin; I searched her, and found she had a little scratch there; the next day I saw her shift, there was a yellow matter upon it, I did not know what was the matter with her; I sent for Mrs. Purnel, she asked the child what she had been doing, that her shift was in such a condition; she answered, she had been doing nothing; Mrs. Purnel told her she was in a very bad condition, and that some man had had to do with her; the child then said,

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Egham; I was called upon to examine this child, on Friday the 26th of August, about noon, I found there was a very great discharge at her private parts of the venereal kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was venereal?</p>
               <p>Barrel. I am positive sure of it, I have attended her, and given her medicines ever since till she came to town, she is not yet quite well.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of medicines did you give her?</p>
               <p>Barrel. Such as I generally give in venereal cases, and they have had the effect as they have in venereal cases, and the child would (I believe) have been quite well, had she been at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not children sometimes runnings from these parts, occasioned by strains and other occasions, that are not venereal?</p>
               <p>Barrel. Had the discharge been from any laceration, it would have been of a different quality.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the inside of the part?</p>
               <p>Barrel. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any extention of the part?</p>
               <p>Barrel. There had been no laceration made, the internal part was affected with the disorder.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it possible for a man to lie with a child of eight years old, without an extension or laceration of the part?</p>
               <p>Barrel. No, it is not possible.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176809070030"></xptr>Q. Do you think a man's applying his prepuce to a girl of that age, might give her the foul disease without penetration?</p>
               <p>Barrel. Yes, the disorder is communicable, if the two parts touch one another, the disorder may be emitted by that means.</p>
               <p>Q. If the child had been penetrated two months ago, must not her parts have been so uneasy, it must have been discovered by the weakness of the parts?</p>
               <p>Barrel. Yes, it would.</p>
               <p>Q. If a child had been forced by a man, must it not be immediately found out?</p>
               <p>Barrel. Yes, it must.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>place, Old Kent-road. On Tuesday, 19th July, I saw Labat against the World Turned Upside Down, a public house in the Old Kent-road—there was another person with him, not Sauge—he was pointed out to me at the police court—Labat had a youth with him, and the youth asked me if J could get a truck to carry 8 cwt.—I said it was a very hard thing to get, but I knew where I could get a horse and cart—he said he would go and see the gentle<lb></lb>man, and when he saw the gentleman, that is, Labat, he came with him—Labat asked me what I would take six cases over to Fulham for with a horse and cart—I told him if be would come along with me I would tell him—he went along with me to my master's, and I agreed to take them for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he bid me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but agreed to give me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I went with him to the South Eastern Railway, and loaded six French cases—both Labat and the other were with me at the station—we got six small cases there, and took them away—we stopped outside Mr. Brown's door, and Labat desired me to open one of the cases, to give him a sample—I did so—it was something of the shape of the bottle produced, but it was wrapped in white paper and straw, and I could not say what it was—I then took the cases to Walham-green, Fulham—I do not remember the direction—it was on a piece of paper which have lost, but it was just opposite the Swan brewery—it is six or seven miles from the Old Kent-road—I left the case there—I put them into a stable, as I was directed to do by a female there—it was a stable belonging to the gentleman of the place, I suppose—it was a private house—it looked to me like a villa—I saw the gentleman at the police court who was with Labat that morning—I think Potier is the name of the gentleman who lives at the villa, but I would not be certain—the female paid me for this, and gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for myself—Labat did not go with me—he left me in the Kent-road, by the Deaf and Dumb Asylum—it was from 11 o'clock to half past 11 in the morning.</p>

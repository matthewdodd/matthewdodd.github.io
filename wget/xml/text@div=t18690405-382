                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, at 13, King Street, Cheapside—I was acting as solicitor for Mr. Cohen and the defendant in the matter of their partnership—I saw the defendant and Cohen execute this deed (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they both called upon me and gave me instructions to prepare it, on the terms stated in it—before its execution Benjamin required some little time to see as to the connexion of Cohen, and he subsequently called and expressed his satisfaction; the deed was then executed in duplicate—some short time after, Benjamin called upon me alone and represented that the connexion of Cohen was perfectly satisfactory to him and that they were doing very well indeed, that, in fact, they had scarcely touched the capital, having been enabled by the discounting of Cohen's customer's bills to con<lb></lb>tinue their trading—by the sixth paragraph of the deed a capital of 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be provided—Benjamin was to bring in 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the stock-in-rade, fixtures, and good-will, contained in a statement marked A, was to be esti<lb></lb>mated as the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be brought in by Cohen—I did not see the statement marked A—I asked for it at the time of the execution of the deed, and I was told by both that it had been left at their warehouse.</p>

               <p>his debts would amount to about the same as his assets, and that Benjamin was investing his money on the one hand and Cohen his connexion and good-will on the other—Benjamin represented that he could not trade in his own name and that Cohen's business was the business he wanted, he finding the capital and Cohen the connexion—I did not understand that the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be procured by Benjamin from his friends—I undertook that he had the money in hand—I do not know that a member of my family introduced them to each other—I think Mr. High, sen., was known to Mr. Cohen for the same period as myself—he is not here—I should say Cohen was not indebted to him for some considerable amount—my father was simply an agent, Cohen was indebted to his principals, some Yorkshire people.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived at 22, Union Street, Spitalfields, at the time in question; I do not now—I carried on business as a woollen ware-houseman since October, 1867, not in Union Street, but at the West End—I have been in the trade twelve years—I think I went to Union Street, about August, 1868—I had been bankrupt about two years before that, I then handed over 950<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property for 1100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and got my discharge—I never paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—six years ago, I was in partnership in Regent Street, and we paid 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound; that was through my putting my hand to accommodation paper for other persons—I had got quite out of my difficulties, and was carrying on this business with success—I entered into this partnership in September, 1863, with Benjamin, he was introduced to me by his brother-in-law—a statement was prepared before the deed was executed, it was written by me, and checked off by the prisoner, and handed over to him—we went through the stock and books; that paper contained a true statement of my affairs at that time—this is a copy of it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) here are two papers, one is the statement checked off at the time; and the other was made at the time we went through the stock and marked it down—(<hi rend="italic">William Henry Randoll proved the service of a notice on the defendant and his attorney, to produce this and certain other documents in his possession.</hi>)—This is a copy of the summary which he had—the stock and fixtures amount to 425<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and debts 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., total 595<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; then there is rent and taxes paid in advance, making a total of 607<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. assets, and on the other side, there is a list of creditors amounting to 672<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., there is 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be deducted, making 652<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when the prisoner returned the paper, it had this memo<lb></lb>random on it, "The above is the statement mentioned in the partnership deed, clause 6; the difference between this amount of 562<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

               <p>money—there is an entry of another 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but whether paid or not, I can—not tell; it might arise from shipping transactions—we continued to carry on the business till 7th December, 1868—I went about and took orders, and also bought goods—the prisoner did nothing except in the counting house—he attended to the business in town, and made inquiries—the week before 7th December I went to Yorkshire at the prisoner's request, to buy goods at Leeds, Huddersfield, and the cloth districts—I gave orders for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods, most of them were sent—on 7th December, I went on one of my rounds to Colchester, Cambridge and Oxford—when I left, the stock on the premised was, I should say, over 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I got to Cambridge, I got this telegram—(<hi rend="italic">the original wet produced by Robert Melbee</hi>)—this is the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "10th December, 1868. I have seen the solicitor and arranged satisfactorily.

                  </hi>. I lire at 11, Alice Road, Grove Road—I was porter to the prisoner and prosecutor from the 5th October, 1868—I used to open the warehouse—it was ordinarily opened on the Saturday, in the morning—at the time Mr. Cohen left town, about 7th December, the ware-house was very full—there was no room to put any more stock; I did not know where to put any—in consequence of the fullness of the down stain room, I had to move some stock up stairs—I remember some heavy sales being made after Mr. Cohen left town—that was the same week the shop was closed—the prisoner told me, if I was asked if any goods went out I was to say I did not know anything about it, and I should not get into any trouble—he did not give me anything at the time he said that—he had given me a pair of boots before, but he did not give them to me for anything; he said they hurt him—I remember a sale being made by the prisoner to a Mr. Samuels, on 9th December—he paid me 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—I put it into the drawer, and afterwards gave it to Mr. Benjamin—he said, "You had better run down with it to the bank," and then he said, "Never mind, I will take it myself"—I recollect the notice being put on the door—I had only seen it put on on one occasion between that and the holidays—there were some pieces of goods that went to Mr. Spires, of Houndsditch, and the prisoner said to me, "You need not enter them in the delivery book, as they will pay for them."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and was in the service of Mr. Hill—in December the prisoner ordered an overcoat at my master's—he came on the Saturday, in a cab, and said he should want it by 6 o'clock, and if it was not done by 6 o'clock it would be of no use to him—he had ordered it before—I can't quite recollect what Saturday it was, but I believe it was about the 12th—I don't know whether it was the day he was taken into custody.</p>

Bank of England notes"—he then asked the prisoner what he had to say, and be then said my wife had given them to him—the sergeant said, "If that is so there is no charge"—I said, "Do you think it is likely that she would give four 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes to him?"—we then went home to see whether she had given it to</p>

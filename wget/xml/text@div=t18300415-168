            . I am footman to the Earl of Chichester. On Friday, the 26th of March, I was attending the carriage in the Park, about half-past three o'clock; Lord and Lady Chichester were in the carriage - there was a gig with a gentleman in it; I did not observe any thing till we came up to the gig; the prisoner was driving master's carriage - I cannot say he was exactly drunk, but he had had something to drink; the accident happened <placeName id="t18300415-168-crimeloc937">between Grosvenor and Stanhope-gate</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know how long his Lordship had had these horses? A. Only one day; they were not very spirited; I never saw the prisoner or the horses till the day before; the gig was not going very fast, nor were our horses; about seven miles an hour I should think - I was on the box with the prisoner, and do not think he saw the gig; it appeared to me a pure accident; he did not attempt to urge the horses- there was a carriage passing on the other side, which he appeared looking at - he appeared to drive with as much care as he could; if I had thought him not capable of taking care of the horses, I should have told his Lordship.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say he was not looking at the gig, but appeared to have his eyes on the carriage passing on the other side; the gig was before him, was it not? A. The gig was on his left, and the carriage on the right - the gig was on the left, but we had not passed it.</p>

            . I was in the carriage with my lady - I saw the gig about half the length of the carriage before me; the road is about twenty yards wide - it happened immediately opposite Stafford-gate; the impression on my mind was that the <rs id="t18300415-168-deflabel938" type="occupation">coachman</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe the prisoner came from Lord Cardigan's service, recommended to your Lordship? A. He was a job coachman - he had driven Lord Cardigan and Lady Chichester last summer, when Lord Cardigan was in a feeble state of health; these horses had only been out two days.</p>

            . I am a serjeant in the Guards. I was about thirty yards from the gig; I saw the carriage coming along regularly towards me - the gig was eight or ten yards from his Lordship's carriage when I first saw it, and it was nearly in the centre of the road; I did not perceive any irregularity in the coachman, till I heard some person give a Halloo - I suppose it was the deceased; I immediately turned my eyes, and saw the carriage and gig in contact - the gentleman fell forward towards the hind-wheel of the carriage, which went over him; I assisted in taking him up and taking him to the hospital - the prisoner remained on his box, and in lifting the gentleman up I asked where he felt most hurt - he said his ribs were broken, and he felt great pain in the body; he did not speak loud enough for the coachman to hear.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he tell you his own gig was in the centre of the road? A. I do not recollect that he told me any of the circumstances of the accident.</p>

               <p>LORD CHICHESTER. I saw the carriage on the other side of the road - it was as close as possible it could be to my carriage, without touching it, within two feet - and meeting mine, not passing it, the gig was on the other side within three yards of the carriage, and before it - I saw my near-horse touch the wheel of the gig, and the near trace got over the wheel; the coachman's duty was to have pulled up - he might have gone a little nearer to the carriage, but very little; he ought to have seen the gig - it was very nearly in front of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you hear any shout? A. I do not remember it - there was a considerable noise; as the carriage was meeting mine, it was necessary for the coachman to be on his guard.</p>

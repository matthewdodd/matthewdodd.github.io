I live at 44, Castle Street, Long Acre, and am a wheel<lb></lb>wright—on the afternoon of December 27th, about 4 o'clock, I was in Hart Street, Covent Garden with my son when I saw the prisoner and another man on the top of a third man, and he asked the other man to hold him down—I distinctly saw him break the chain away from the old man; an old-fashioned silver guard—he then said "Cut it, Bill," or some expres<lb></lb>sion of that kind, to his companion, who ran away—I immediately went up to the prisoner and said "You vagabond! you have been robbing that man"—he said "No I haven't; its all right, isn't it Bill?"—the man who was robbed was going away; slipping away as if he were afraid of anybody looking at him; but to make it appear all right he said "It's all right, isn't it Bill?"—I said "I will not allow you to go"—he went down Long Acre and I followed him—when I said he had been robbing the man he threw his coat back, "You say I have been robbing the man, search me"—I have since seen the prosecutor Buck.</p>

               <p>the 27th December, I was in the Fountain public-house in Edwin Street, Long Acre. I called for a pint of beer, and as there were some persons in there drinking, I asked the company if they had any objection to my singing them a song. They said "Not the least." I sang a song and gave a recitation, and received 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers and some whiskey, and the mad man (<hi rend="italic">the prosecutor</hi>) gave me two pieces of broken chain, and he called for a pot of ale. He followed me out and said "Will you have another?" We went to the corner of Long Acre into another public-house. He said "One more pint," and while there a gentleman came up and spoke to Mr. Buck, and then said to me "I will speak to you outside." He said "Do you know who you have got in your company?" I said "No". He said, "That man is mad." I said "You don't mean that?" I showed him the two pieces of chain, and he said "If I were you I should not keep his company. "This man's name I don't know. Mr. Buck left the house and I returned the chain and said "Here is your chain." He pulled me into the middle of the road, and the man that was with me rushed at him and the three ran into the road and the man who tried to get him from me ran away. He (Buck) made another rush at me. I stood in defence, and he then walked away. I was then accused of robbing him of his watch and chain. That is the explanation I have to give.</p>

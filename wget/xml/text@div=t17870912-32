               <p>Let us know what complaint you have against the prisoner at the bar? - On the 2d of August, I went to Florida gardens with Mr. Peacock, who I now live with; it was in the afternoon, about six o'clock to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Who did you go with? - With one Mr. Peacock.</p>
               <p>Who is Mr. Peacock? - I have lived with him these three years.</p>
               <p>What happened there? - I went there in company with him, when I came there he had business at North-end; he lived there once in business; he had some business to do there, and he went across the fields to North-end.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120063"></xptr>Did you go with him? - No, he left me there.</p>
               <p>In company with whom? - With nobody at all but myself; I went in there, and he said he would meet me at nine o'clock at Florida Gardens tap.</p>
               <p>Then for these three hours you were left there by yourself? - I went into the garden, and staid a little bit, and then I went home.</p>
               <p>How came you to go home before the time appointed? - Because I was rather tired of staying there.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay in the gardens? - I cannot say, to the best of my knowledge about half an hour, then I went home, when I went home I drank tea.</p>
               <p>Alone by yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But you need not give us this history, come to the point at once? - About half past eight I went out with an intention to meet Mr. Peacock at Florida gardens tap, and when I came up by <placeName id="t17870912-32-crimeloc155">the Bell and Horns, near Brompton</placeName>

               <p>Where abouts is the Bell and Horns? - In Brompton road.</p>
               <p>How far is it from Florida gardens? - It is at the crossway before you come to Florida gardens.</p>
               <p>Is it in the way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far is it from the gardens? - It is a good way.</p>
               <p>As you came into that field you saw the prisoner? - No, it was as I was going by the road; there is a corn field on the left hand side.</p>
               <p>Were you going through the corn field? - No.</p>
               <p>Then where did you see the prisoner? - He stood on the outside of the rails in the path, with his back against the corn field.</p>
               <p>Just by the Bell and Horns - Yes, when I came there he forced me very much to go with him, and what he had he had out; he tried very hard to go with me.</p>
               <p>You must explain yourself more, what you say at present is unintelligible; what did he say or do? - He catched me fast round my middle without speaking a word, and he tried very much to go with me.</p>
               <p>To do what? - To be connected with me.</p>
               <p>What on the pathway? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In what manner, you must be particular? - He pulled my petticoats up, and forced me very much to go with me.</p>
               <p>On the pathway? - Yes; by that means I strove very hard against him.</p>
               <p>Did he throw you down? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>What did he do when he pulled up your petticoats? - He forced me very much.</p>
               <p>How do you mean? - He tried to carnally know me.</p>
               <p>What when you were standing in the pathway? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were his breeches unbuttoned? - Yes, my Lord, when I came up to him they were.</p>
               <p>When you first came up to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now go on? - By that means my Lord, he tried three times to push me into the hedge; by that means I strove very hard against him, and I screamed out, by that means he upt with his fist, and knocked me down; he hit me in the stomach, and knocked me down; by that means when I was down, he took my petticoats up, his breeches was down; by that means, my Lord, he entered my body; by that means he put his hand across my throat that I might not seream out an longer; from the time he had me down, his hand was across my throat, and I was quite insensible.</p>
               <p>When did you first come to you senses? - When he had me down, and had entered my body, he said</p>
               <p>"damn me, madam, you shall."</p>
               <p>That was the first thing he said? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you recover your senses again? - Not till I came out of the field.</p>
               <p>What did you do when you first recovered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120064"></xptr>your senses? - I found he was got off from me.</p>
               <p>You do not know how long it was? - I was in his hands from the first beginning to the ending half an hour, but I am sensible he was a quarter of an hour upon me when he entered my body.</p>
               <p>How can you tell that when you were not sensible? - Because I believe it was a quarter of an hour before he put his hand across my throat, after he had knocked me down first.</p>
               <p>You were struggling and crying out all that quarter of an hour as hard as you could? - Yes, my Lord, I did, and begged of him as much as I could to desist.</p>
               <p>What time of the night was this? - As nigh as I can tell, it was about half past nine when he was taken.</p>
               <p>You left home at half past eight in Piccadilly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then it might be about nine when you met him? - To the best of my knowledge I think it was.</p>
               <p>You had been to Florida gardens, and was going back to them again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was this the direct way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there much company in the gardens that night? - I did not stay there that night.</p>

               <p>Was it a fine evening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were the gardens pretty full? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>This was in the pathway by Brompton road? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far from the Bell and Horns? - The length of a corn field, it is not a very large corn field, it is no great way.</p>
               <p>Then he first attacked you on the pathway? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was standing in an indecent manner before you came up to him? - I never saw him till I came up to him; he had nobody with him.</p>
               <p>How long might you struggle before he got you into the corn field? - I dare say it was about a quarter of an hour, to the best of my knowledge it was that time.</p>
               <p>You struggled then as much as you could not to go into the corn field? - Yes, I begged of him for God's sake, do not hurt me, do not use me ill.</p>
               <p>What did he say to that? - Not a word.</p>
               <p>You cried out for help? - Yes, I cried out, and said for Christ's sake, do not use me ill.</p>
               <p>How far did he drag you into the corn field before he knocked you down? - Not far, he dragged me through the hedge.</p>
               <p>It was a fine evening you say? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The day-light is not gone on the 2d of August at that time? - The moon shone very bright.</p>
               <p>Then there was both day light, and moonlight at the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After he got up from you, and you came to your senses what did you do? - Some people came up, and cried halloo.</p>
               <p>Were they in the path, or in the field? - They were coming along the path from Florida gardens.</p>
               <p>Then it was that you got up? - Yes,</p>
               <p>Was that before or after he got up? - Before he got up.</p>
               <p>Then he got up? - Yes, he got up immediately when he heard them cry out; he had not satisfied himself.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether he had or not? - I be not sure.</p>
               <p>Do you understand the question? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You are not sure of that? - I think so much, but I cannot swear that, because at that time I was insensible, but I am sure he entered my body.</p>
               <p>Then when these people came up and cried halloo, he got up? - Yes, and came out of the field through the gateway.</p>
               <p>What did the people do? - The people asked me what was the matter, or something of that kind.</p>
               <p>Where were you at the time? - I cannot tell whether he pulled me up, or whether I got up myself when he left me.</p>
               <p>Were you up when the people came into the field? - They did not come into the field.</p>
               <p>What did you do then? - I made my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120065"></xptr>way out as fast as I could, and went to the people.</p>
               <p>What were the people and him doing when you went into the road, were they talking to him, or had they hold of him? - I cannot tell which, for when I came out of the field I was quite unsensible.</p>
               <p>Did you tell them how he had used you? - I said if you had not come up to me, this man would have murdered me.</p>
               <p>What more happened, did they stop him? - They stopped him, and my Lord, they asked me what was the matter; matter enough says I, this man has used me very ill, and would have killed me if you had not come up.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said Betsey, you knows me, and I knows you, and for God's sake do not hurt me.</p>
               <p>What did you say to that? - I said, you villain, you know you would have murdered me, I know nothing of you, nor you do nor of me.</p>
               <p>What did he say to that? - Then the watchman came up, my Lord, and took him.</p>
               <p>What you accused him of then, was attempting to murder you? - I said he had me by the throat, and I verily believed he would have murdered me if they had not come.</p>
               <p>That was what you accused him of then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After the watchman took him, what passed? - When the watchman came up to him, they asked me to go to a public house to make it up.</p>
               <p>Who asked you to go to the public house? - He asked them to ask me, I said I would do no such thing, by that means he was taken into the public house, and I gave a written charge over him, because they refused to take him without it.</p>
               <p>The watchman has that now? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>The watchman is here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The watchman took your written charge, and for a ght you know he has it still? - I believe he has I think he gave it to the constable of the night.</p>
               <p>After you had given the written charge, what was done then? - The gentlewoman took me into the parlour, and gave me a smelling bottle to smell to, and he begged very much to make it up.</p>
               <p>What house was this? - Somewhere by, I not know the house.</p>
               <p>Is she here? - No, but the people who came up to my assistance were in the room with me.</p>
               <p>Now what time of the night was this when you were in the public house? - I think it was a little past ten as nigh as I can tell to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did you go home? - No, I told them I was going to meet Mr. Peacock at Florida gardens, and the gentlemen went with me.</p>
               <p>About what time of the night was that? - I believe it was eleven, if not more.</p>
               <p>Then you went with the gentlemen that came to your assistance, to meet Mr. Peacock? - Yes, at the tap, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Did you find Mr. Peacock there? - No, the person said he had been there but was gone.</p>
               <p>What is Mr. Peacock? - He is a lifeguard's-man.</p>
               <p>When you found he was gone, what did you do? - Then we came down as far as the field where he dragged me, and the gentlemen said shew us whereabouts it was that you was knocked down, and I did shew them, then after that we came home; one of the gentlemen lives at Knightsbridge, by that means we went by his door, then the other gentleman went home with me; when I came home Mr. Peacock sat at the door waiting for me.</p>
               <p>What time was that? - I believe it might be twelve o'clock as nigh as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you for disappointing him? - I spoke to him first.</p>
               <p>Were you not afraid he would be angry? - I thought he would be rather uneasy.</p>
               <p>Did not you think he would be angry? - I did not know what to think, I dare say he did not know what to think was become of me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120066"></xptr>Did you not think he would be angry with you? - I thought, my Lord, he would be uneasy about me.</p>
               <p>Were you not afraid he would be angry with you? - For what?</p>
               <p>For disappointing him, appointing him to meet you at Florida gardens at nine o'clock, and coming home at twelve? - I thought he would wonder what was become of me.</p>
               <p>You spoke first to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him? - I said it is God's mercy that I had not been killed to night.</p>
               <p>What answer did he make? - How so? says he; then I told him all I have told you.</p>
               <p>The man was in the custody of the watch, was he not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did he say when you told him all about it? - Says he, the rascal! I wish I had come by at the time.</p>
               <p>You say that you struggled on the pathway for about a quarter of an hour before he dragged you into the field? - A good while before.</p>
               <p>After he had got you into the field, he tried three times to push you into the hedge? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After he knocked you down, he was about a quarter of an hour on you before he clapped his hand upon your throat, and deprived you of your senses? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And that he was about half an hour in the whole? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You were crying out as much as you could for help? - Yes, my Lord, I screamed out very much.</p>
               <p>And nobody came past for half an hour? - I never heard or saw any body till those people came by.</p>
               <p>If they had they must have heard you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How came you not to tell the lady of the public house? - Because she did not ask me any questions.</p>

               <p>What injury you might receive in those parts would not hurt you know, you had tried that before; the moment you saw his breeches down, it must alarm a lady of your nice feelings, why did not you run away? - Because he laid fast hold of me.</p>
               <p>So that he was standing there to catch any that might come that way? - Very likely.</p>

               <p>Which way were they undone? - You knows if you please.</p>
               <p>No, I would rather have it from you, be so kind as to describe how they were undone, was the waistband unbuttoned? - No, Sir, that was not.</p>
               <p>Not all the time? - Yes, Sir, after he got me into the field.</p>
               <p>Was it before you were insensible? - Yes, Sir, when he knocked me down, and when he was upon me.</p>
               <p>Did you complain of the buttons hurting<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120069"></xptr>you, were there any marks? by your account, they must have been uneasy to you? - He unbuttoned his breeches when he was upon me; he knocked me down, and got upon me, and when he was upon me, he unbuttoned his breeches.</p>
               <p>What before he had connection with you? - Yes, it was before that he did that.</p>
               <p>You saw him unbutton his breeches completely? - When he knocked me down his breeches were unbuttoned.</p>

Pray, says I, to him, what have you done with the goods? says he, I beg you will send for my father, and I have no doubt but he will settle the matter; says I, are you a son of Mr. Gibbs? yes, says he, I am; I immediately sent for his father, and begged to see him; the message came back that he could not wait on me; I felt a good deal of alarm for the circumstance, I thought it was an extraordinary one, and immediately left my dinner and went to Mr. Gibbs in Fenchurch-street, and told him I was shocked to understand that it was his own son that had these goods, and wished to know whether he had these goods on his account; he said he had not; then, says I, you not owning these goods; I must commit your son.</p>

               <p>Mr. Hancock. My private opinion of the business is, that the cruel inhumanity of the father has inclined the son to do what he has done; I have heard the story, and understand the circumstance of his having married, and having married a young woman who was a servant, has occasioned the father's displeasure to such a degree, as to send this young man, woman and child into a garret, and to send eighteen-pence at a time to support him, the poor woman and the child; and he knew the situation of the case, he knew that his son had no other mode of getting his bread, but in that line of business. The moment we told Mr. Gibbs, his suspicions led him to his son; the son acknowledged the fact, but in his distress I think he pointed at the right object; I am sorry for the young man's situation.</p>

                  </hi>. I was cook on board the <hi rend="italic">Garland Grove</hi>, now lying in the East Country Dock. On Monday, 25th Nov., I had had a little drink, and was charged by the mate with an assault on him—I was taken before the Magistrate on the Tuesday—on the Sunday I had seen the prisoner at the ship, and we had some drink together—on the Tuesday I was ordered to find bail—the prisoner came to the station, and said he had tried to get two men as bail for me, but the Magistrate would not take them—he asked what I was going to do with my wages and my things—I said I would send to Mr. Eldon, who I lodged with, to look after them—I told him, as he had been a friend to me, under my mattress he would find a belt, with two half-crowns in it, which he was to bring to me—he did not bring them—I did not see him till he came to me at Horsemonger-lane—I was discharged, went on board the ship and received my wages, two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes—I gave the prisoner one 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a piece for the two <hi rend="italic">bailers</hi>, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for himself—he got out of the ship, and said, "Come on, I will show you where your things are"—I said, "Who told you to take them out?"—they were the things I had left in the vessel—we went to a public-house to get change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note—the master said he could not change it, and the prisoner and one of the <hi rend="italic">bailers flew</hi> out—the other stopped, and I</p>

I am a sailor, on board the <hi rend="italic">Garland Grove.</hi> The day after Hush was given in charge the prisoner came on board the vessel for the belt to find some money to get the cook something to eat—I went with him to the forecastle to the cook's bed-place, and saw him take the belt, but nothing else—he left it and said, "There is something in it, that is what I want"—he came again next day, and said he had come for the cook's things—I went with him to the forecastle, and he told me to see he did not take anybody else's things—he took the cook's new white bag, which appeared full, his chest, the fat, and some dirty things, which he put in an old bag, the bedding and blankets—he left the ship, and I saw no more of him.</p>

On the Thurs<lb></lb>day before I was before the Magistrate, the prisoner came to my house, and brought a chest, mattress, rug, and a lot of dirty clothes and cooking utensils—I did not see any blanket—I cannot tell how many bags there were—he said they belonged to the cook—I had seen him before, and understood he was in trouble, and the prisoner asked me for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the clothes, which I lent him—he said it was to pay his expenses, and the <hi rend="italic">bailers</hi>, and to get the man out, and bring him down again to the ship—the things were locked up in our store-room, the key of which generally hangs in the bar—the cook came with the prisoner that evening, and was shown the things: he looked over them next day, and missed some of them—I cannot say whether the room had been locked all the time between.</p>

            . I am a constable of Coventry. On the morning of the 7th of January, about eight o'clock, as I came out of a private lodging-house, at Coventry. I met the prisoner coming in enquiring for a lodging - the coach comes in early in the morning - he had no bundle. I saw he was rather intoxicated, and advised the lodging-house keeper to let him have a bed. I stopped with him a few minutes; he was telling the lodging-house keeper that he had paid 17 s. for a chaise from London to Barnett, to take the coach. I took no notice, but thought his statement not correct. In the evening, I went to the house again - he was then in the kitchen. I said I would go with him to the coach-office, which I did, with the landlady. I asked the clerk if he knew him; he said he believed him to be the person who came down by the coach that morning, that the coach had gone to Liverpool without him, for he was so intoxicated, and they had had much trouble with him on the road. I asked what money he had about him, as he was going to Liverpool; he said as much as would take him there. I took him to the watch-house, searched him, and found a purse in his pocket containing eight sovereigns, seven half crowns, five shillings, two sixpences, and an old coin, and in his waistcoat pocket was another half crown. In his coat pocket I found a silver snuff-box, and in his breeches pocket a small silver hunting-watch, and in his great coatpocket, two pair of stockings, two white pocket handkerchiefs, a coloured handkerchief, and a night cap. The hat he had on was claimed by Burk. I have had them ever since.</p>

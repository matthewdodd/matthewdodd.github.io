               <p>I am a pawnbroker, No. 39, Green-street, Liecester-fields; I produce a sheet, a riding habit, and a bed gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get these things? - Of the prisoner at the bar. On the 11th of February, she brought the riding habit for six shillings, to pawn; she said she pledged it for one Mrs. Byot, in St. Martin's-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did she give herself? - Harrison. On the 19th of February, she brought a bed gown for eighteen-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before this? - Not to my knowledge. She brought that for Mrs. Byot. On the 21st she brought a sheet for five shillings, for Mrs. Byot; that was the day she was taken up; I see her when she was in custody.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The riding habit I know to be mine, it is rather old fashioned; the sheet is marked, the bed gown is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't know of any thing but that one sheet and the bed gown.</p>

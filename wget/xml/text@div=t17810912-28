               <p>- DEVERELL sworn.</p>
               <p>I was coming from the Maze-Pond, on the 27th of August: I came over <placeName id="t17810912-28-crimeloc143">London bridge</placeName>

Coming by Mr. Gill's, which is the first house on this side London bridge, at about eight in the evening, I saw the prisoner stoop down, and take the carpet off the window of Mr. Gill's house, and conceal it under her cloak, and go away with it. I was about three yards from her. I instantly laid hold of her. She threw it down upon the very place she took it from. When I stopped her, I saw her throw it down.</p>
               <p>How many steps did she go befor e you stopped her? - Three or four. She went off the curb stone. I laid hold of her, and took her into the shop. She first said she did not do it: afterwards she said to the constable, that it was her first offence.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I took charge of the prisoner. She denied the fact: I never heard her own it. I received the carpet from Mr. Gill's servant: he is not here.</p>
               <p>(The carpet was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was stooping down to buckle my shoe. This man came and laid hold of me, and asked me, If I was going to steal any thing? I asked him what he meant by asking me such an impudent question; and then he shoved me down into the shop, and the servant said he would keep me till his master came home.</p>

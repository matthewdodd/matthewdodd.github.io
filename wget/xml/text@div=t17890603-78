               <p>On the 18th of May, I was drinking about twelve o'clock at night, at the White Horse in Carnaby-market; I came into Oxford-street; I should have gone home but I went the wrong way; I was not in liquor, I had had liquor, but I was sensible; I was vexed its my mind which made me not know where I was going; I came to <placeName id="t17890603-78-crimeloc382">Charles-street, Oxford-street</placeName>

I said I want nothing with you; they said I should go with them; I went with them to Bambridge-street, when I came there they asked me up stairs, I went up two pair of stairs; then they must have some gin; I gave the prisoner Miller six-pence to get some gin, she fetched it, and they drank it betwixt them, I had none of it; they said I should go to bed; and one tumbled in on one side, and one on the other; and I put my breeches under the bolster with five guineas and fifteen shillings in my pocket, in less than half five minutes I heard the money chink, and I caught hold of my breeches, and said you have robbed me; I saw the breeches in Miller's hand; after I heard the money chink, I put my hand in my pocket and there was only five shillings, I directly caught hold of Miller, and said, you hussy, you have robbed me; I put on my things, and pulled them out of bed and searched them as well as I could; but I found nothing, I locked the door and fell asleep; and when I waked they were gone, and I found an old woman in the room; it was five o'clock; I was vexed in my mind and I had been walking about before I met with them; I was not drunk, but capable of walking and talking, I am certain I had my money after I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Did you count it? - I am very certain I had the money when I gave the woman the six-pence, I counted it in my hand, I do not know how I did it, I very often count my money, my hand being in my pocket; I counted it then, and I gave them one shilling a piece; about half an hour after I had fifteen shillings besides them two shillings.</p>
               <p>Did you search the bed head and bolster to see where it dropped? - It never dropped, it was all in a minute, I heard it cannot, and I thought I heard the window go up, but I am not sure; it was day light.</p>

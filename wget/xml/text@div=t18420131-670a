                  </hi>. I am footman to Mrs. Charlotte Caroline Wilkin<lb></lb>son, a widow lady, living at No. 7, Upper Montague-street, Montague-square, in the parish of St. Marylebone; Mr. Cromellier, her nephew, resides with her. I have known the prisoner rather better than a year and a half, and have employed him to clean my mistress's plate—on Tuesday night, the 11th of January, I went to his residence for the purpose of procuring his assist<lb></lb>ance to clean the plate, as my mistress was to have a party next day—that was without my mistress's knowledge—he lives at his father's, No. 31, or No. 32, in a mews at the back of Montague-square—I saw him, and asked if he would come and assist me to clean some plate—I went to a public-house with him in Montague-street, and had a pint of porter—we went to other places, and then went home to clean the plate, about half-past eleven—Emma Pearce, the cook, let us in—I was sober—the prisoner went into the pantry with me—I took out the plate, and began to clean it—there were some spoons, forks, a butter-knife, and a pair of sugar-tongs among it—after cleaning for a short time, I had occasion to leave the pantry—I left the plate there—I was not absent more than six minutes—on my return, the prisoner was gone, and the pantry and area doors were open—he could not have gone out at the street-door, because that was fastened—the area-gate was locked—if he went out by the area-door, he must have climbed over the area-railings—I did not miss any plate that night—I did not look for it when I returned—about eight next morning, I missed nine tea-spoons, five large spoons, two small spoons, five large forks, five small forks, a butter-knife, and a pair of sugar-tongs—they were my mistress's property, and were worth considerably more than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it all had my mistress's crest on, which is a fox's head, and a goose's wing, projecting from the mouth—directly I missed it, I called my fellow-servants, and told them what I had missed—I then immediately went to the prisoner's mother's, in the mews—he was not there—I told his mother what I had missed—I then went to the public-house where he had taken me the night before, and from information I got there, I went to a brothel, No. 18, Little, or Great Carlisle-street, I do not recollect which—I had been to that house with him the night before—I could not find him there—I then returned home, and told my mistress's nephew of the loss, and he told the police—I offered 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward of my own money for the ap<lb></lb>prehension of the prisoner, and my master offered 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward also—I have seen any of the plate since—the robbery was on Tuesday night the 11th—on Monday, the 10th, the prisoner had come to my mistress's house, and asked me to purchase a knife, which he produced, for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told him it was of no use to me, I would give him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, which I did,</p>

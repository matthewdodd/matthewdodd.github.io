I lost some paper from a room behind the carpenter's shop; I mentioned it to my warehouseman, and afterwards found the paper at the shop of Mr. Knight; it is called deny paper, and had been printed in my house - it was in the same shape at Mr. Knight's premises - they were all Latin grammars, and I know there is not such in the world, besides we print them for the trade, and they were not completed for delivery, because the party whose name was to it had become a bankrupt - it was folded in sheets, fit for binding. I enquired about the prisoner, and found he bears the best of characters.</p>

            . I am a cheesemonger, and live in the Strand. The prisoner brought some paper in sheets to my house, and asked if I bought waste paper; I gave him 4 1/2 d. per lb. for 13 lbs, of it. Mr. Wood's son called upon me, and asked if I had bought any waste paper; I said I had - the officer came and took it to Bow-street. It was in printed sheets. He said it was misprinted, and to be sold as waste.</p>

I am an engineer in the fire brigade—I was sent for, between 9 and 10 o'clock, to the police-station at Highgate, and saw the prisoner—I was at the fire between a quarter and 20 minutes to 3—it was a rick, in a place called Potkiln-field, belonging to Mr. Baker—it broke out about half-past 2—I attended there until it was extinguished—it was burning pretty well the whole of the night, and part of the next day—the stack consisted of about forty-five loads.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside with my father, a farmer, at North-hill, Highgate—on 23d October a stack of hay belonging to him was burnt, the most part of it, in the rick-yard—it took fire soon after 2 o'clock—most of it was consumed, and what was left was of no account—it was valued at 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is in Hornsey parish.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had a little family quarrel with my friends, and left my home; I had been drinking freely for nine or ten days; I had spent all my money, and did not know where to go; I was strolling about and saw this fire burning, about 2 o'clock; I asked some man what it was; he said some one had set fire to a haystack; I had no money; I did not know where to go, and I started away back to Highgate, and thought I would give myself up for having done it, as I did not know where to lodge, and had no money or anything else; I never saw the stack, and did not know the man it belonged to; I was not near the fire; I was in the road when I saw it.</p>

I believe it was the north-east corner that the prisoner pointed out—it was on the right-hand side of the road going from London, and it was the further corner of the stack—he pointed to the corner next the road; the corner away from London—that was how he described it to me—he was not seen by any one in the neighbourhood—there were two stacks close together—there were thousands of footprints round the rick in a very short time—he was cool and collected when he came to the station; not at all excited—his boots were very wet and covered with a clay, loamy soil; the same as in the wood.</p>

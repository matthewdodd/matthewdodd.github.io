I had seen it on the 21st of November, about ten o'clock in the evening, and about seven next morning it was gone. I saw it at the watch-house, and compared it with what remained; it matched exactly. I certainly think it formed a part of it - there was a cock to it.</p>

            . On the morning of the 22d of November, I was standing by the watch-house gates. I saw the prisoner and another man coming along, each having a bag. I suspected that things were not right - they got on as far as Willow-walk, and turned down there (his companion had been used to come to the town to get rags). I followed them, and beckoned Fowler to follow me. I took hold of Sturn, who was discharged; and the prisoner flung down the bundle and his hat, and ran down towards the Assembly-house - he was pursued and taken.</p>

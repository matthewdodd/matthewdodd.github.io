On the 16th of February I had been with some friends, and was not altogether sober. I met the prisoners a little after twelve o'clock, near Covent-garden - I cannot exactly swear whether I spoke to them first, or they to me; they asked me for something to drink, and said there was a house open in <placeName id="t18250217-151-crimeloc891">Bedfordbury</placeName>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty, and saw the prosecutor about half-past twelve o'clock, and the two girls, knocking at the door, wanting to get some drink; they could not get in - they walked down my beat as I was sitting in my box, and in about two minutes I heard watch called - I went out, and saw Russel running down a court - I caught hold of her; the prosecutor came up, and said, "They have robbed me of my watch - I give that girl in charge." I had seen them both together with him at the door, but I only saw Russel running. I cannot swear to Fleming.</p>

            . I was the night constable. Russel was brought to the watch-house - a third young woman came in, and asked if the charge was taken of Russel - I asked her who sent her; she said a young woman outside; I sent a watchman to fetch that young woman in, Fleming; she took off her shawl, and wrapped it round her left-hand; I said I must search her; she, with her right-hand, began to open her gown; I said I would search outside first. I then took hold of her left-hand, and found the watch in it. Russel was in the watch-house all the time, but not near her. The prosecutor was very much intoxicated, but he knew the girls when he saw them.</p>
               <p>ANDREW REID re-examined. Q. How long before you met these girls had you seen your watch in your fob? A. Just a minute before.</p>

               <p>FLEMING's Defence. We met him in New-street - we went to a shop, and could not get in; he then said he would not have any supper - he would go to have something to drink; that he had no money but half-a-crown about him, but would leave his watch till the morning, in pawn with me, if I could tell him where to go. He was so drunk we did not know how to get him along.</p>

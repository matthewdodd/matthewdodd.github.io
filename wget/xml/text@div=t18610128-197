                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Fox, of Walthamstow, a farmer and dairyman—the prisoner was in our employment as a domestic servant, for between two and three years—it was part of her duty to take milk round to our customers, to receive payment for it, and to account to me for it as soon as she received it—Mr. Charles Dabbs was one of our customers—milk was supplied to him from us, up to the 8th of this month, and sent to him by the prisoner—I have very frequently received money from the prisoner for milk supplied to Mr. Dabbs—a considerable quantity of milk has been supplied by us through the course of the summer—we have been paid for all, except one pint a-day, for the morning's milk, and I never received a farthing of that for the whole twelve months—2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is the price of a pint of milk—Robert Hawkins was a customer of ours, we supplied him with milk by the hands of the prisoner—on 30th December last, the prisoner did not pay me 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on his account—Charles Braham was also a customer of ours, and was supplied by the prisoner with milk on our account—on 30th December last, the prisoner paid me 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which she had received from Braham.</p>

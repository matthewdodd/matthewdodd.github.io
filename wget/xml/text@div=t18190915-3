               <p>SARAH LAWFORD. I rent a house at Enfield. On the 21st of July, I was at tea in the back-kitchen - a person alarmed me. I went to my parlour, found the sash up, and missed two table-spoons, six tea-spoons, and a pair of sugar-tongs. On the 7th of August,

               <p>AMELIA HICKSON. I live opposite the prosecutrix, and know both the prisoners by sight. On the 21st of July, they were at the prosecutrix's house. I saw Stone at the parlour-window - the sash was up; he put his hand inside the window, and took something out, which he put under<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150004"></xptr>his coat; Britton was watching to see if any one was looking; I went over and told Lawford. Stone ran away - Britton ran about three steps, and then stopped; I called Stop thief! I saw them the next day, before the magistrate, and am certain they are the persons; I did not know them before. Britton stood looking very hard at the house, while Stone was stealing the things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BRITTON. Q. How can you swear to me - A. He had a green apron on; I saw his face for about five minutes afterwards. I did not see Stone's face, but the right shoulder of his coat was torn; I saw that coat on him the next day. He is the same size and figure - I am certain they are the same persons.</p>

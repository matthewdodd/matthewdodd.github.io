            . I am a watchman. On the morning of the 29th of August, about half-past two o'clock, I was sitting in my box and received information of some persons robbing a house in Phoenix-street; I went there but saw no one - there was a ladder against one of the houses, I went up it, and went down the middle house of the three; I there found a door fastened, and broke it open but found no one; I went up stairs again and found in one room a coat, a hat, and a pair of shoes, with a quantity of lead.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110160"></xptr>- this was in the middle house; I wentup the ladder again and heard some one say, "Here they are." I sprung my rattle, and saw the prisoners coming along the parapet. I took Harris, and two other persons took Coltney, he was without coat, hat, or shoes; he asked for them, and those in the house belonged to him; there was nothing found on the prisoners, but a knife was found in the room, and ten pieces of lead.</p>

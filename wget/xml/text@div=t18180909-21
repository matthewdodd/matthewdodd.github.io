            . I am servant to Mr. Edwards, who keeps the Basing House, in Kingsland-road. On Friday the 7th of August, the prisoner came into the stable with a bay mare; he said he had come up with some cows and calves, for Mr. Laycock, of Islington. He said he came to put the horse up there. After he had been there a little time, he said he wanted to part with her, and authorized me to take her to Dixon's Repository, in Barbican, to be sold by auction. I took her there, but could not sell her; I brought her away, and took her to Smithfield the same day; I could not sell her there, and took her back to the stables. The prisoner came next morning, and asked me if I had sold her? I told him I had not. He told me to take something less, and make the best I could of her. He did not come again until the Wednesday following. I bought the mare of him myself for six guineas, I paid him the money, and my master wrote his name and address down for me. He said he came from Deaton Hall, near York, from his brother's - He went away. I sold her the next morning to

            . I am a Bow-street officer. On the 14th of August I apprehended the prisoner in consequence of a letter which was brought to me. I took him in York-street, Pentonville; I told him I took him for stealing Mr. Wilson's mare, of Deaton Hall - He denied it. I told him he must go to the office with me; he then said he would show me where the mare was; he said he had sold her to the hostler at the Basing House, Kingsland-road - I went there, leaving him in custody. I found she was sold to Walker, Baker's-row, Clerkenwell. I went there, the mare was out, it was afterwards brought to the office; I put it up at Dean's livery stables-the prosecutor claimed it, and took it back. The hostler gave me the bridle, which, he said, the prisoner delivered to him with the horse.</p>

                  </hi>. On Tuesday, the 9th of June, about half-past ten o'clock, I was at the Crown and Anchor, in the Kent-road, in the long room—I remained there till nearly half-past one o'clock—I had been drinking—I had two pints of ale and some cyder—I drank with one or two others who I knew—I did not have above half a quartern of cyder—I might drink a glass or two of ale with others—when I got up to go away I was about <hi rend="italic">half-and-half</hi>, not drunk or sober—I was aware of what I was doing, and what was done to me—on coming down stairs, I saw Glannon, whom I have known from a child—I went up to the bar, and told him I was very glad to see him out of trouble, and I partook of a glass of gin from his hand—the other prisoner drank—I do not know him—I knew him by sight before, but not to have much acquaintance with him—I had fre<lb></lb>quently seen him before—he was in company with Glannon—after having the gin, I went outside the door, to go away—I left the house, and was followed by Chappell, who pretended to be very drank indeed—I had seen him in the house, and should not think he was drunk then—he ran up against me, and shoved me about—he shoved me up into one corner—Glannon was there at the time, and I was placed on a bench by him, on my back—my legs were put up in the air by some of them—I believe there were others besides the prisoners there—Glannon was lying on my chest, keeping me down on the seat, and I had something put into-my month—I thought it was a piece of old hat, or cloth—I was trying to call out "Murder," but could not from the pressure against my breast, and my mouth was stuffed full of something, what I cannot tell—I cannot say who did it—it prevented my hallooing and making a noise—at that time Chappell was at my fob, in which I had a silver watch, and three gold seals, a gold key, and gold chain—I made great resistance—I found my chain in Chappell's hands—it broke away in the scuffle—I cannot say whether it broke away, at that time or not—he had removed it from my person—I had a scuffle with him for the chain, and cannot say whether he dropped part of the chain, or I did, but it fell—I was lying on my back, and the chain was found on the bench, between my legs—it was broken, and part of it gone—ray trowsers were torn away to get at my watch—I said at the time that I was robbed of my watch, but it was found in my fob—Whitford, the policeman, was there—I saw both the prisoners in the custody of the police, and was quite positive they were the men, and said so—Glannon said at the station-house, that he hoped I should not press the case against them—I have been an old police-officer of Bow-street and Union Hall, for fourteen years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ladies' shoe-maker, and live in Trafalgar-place, Lock's-fields. On Wednesday morning, I was at the door of the Crown and Anchor, about half-past one o'clock, sitting on a bench outside—Gill came and sat down on the bench opposite to me—he told me there had been an attempt to rob him of his watch—I saw his chain and seals hang<lb></lb>ing out in the usual way—he did not pull his watch out—I gave him some advice, and he shortly afterwards shifted himself from sitting opposite to me, and came and sat down by my side, and he either put his chain and seals inside his flap or pocket, so as to conceal them—Chappell came up and pretended to be very much intoxicated—his hat fell off several times, and each time his hat fell off, he got nearer to the end of the table where the prosecutor was, and then he fell into the prosecutor's lap—he went from one seat to the other, across the table, to fall into his lap—the prosecutor put him out, and then he fell into his lap again—Glannon was sitting on the seat, and when he came, the two prisoners began to hustle the pro<lb></lb>secutor—he was hustled on to a bench, on his back, and his feet upwards—he was surrounded by half a dozen persons—I jumped over the table to get out of the way—his legs were up in the air—I did not see any thing that they did to him—a constable came (No. 156, I believe) and took them—the prosecutor got off the bench, and said, "I have been robbed of my watch"—Glannon, I think, said, "Search him before he goes away from the place, as he says he has lost his watch"—the prosecutor instantly gave part of the chain and seals to the policeman, out of his left hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you known Gill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never saw him before that night—he told me that an attempt had been made to rob him of his watch, before Chappell came and sat by his side—I did not see him laid on the bench—I did not go into the crowd to see him—I was before the Magistrate last Friday week, which was two days after this happened—the policeman asked me to go—I was taking half a pint of por<lb></lb>ter this night—I am married, but it was fair time—I had been at the pub<lb></lb>lic-house about half an hour—I drank a share of two pots of porter—I had not been drinking before in any public-house—I had part of a pint of beer at the County Terrace—I did not go to Greenwich—I did not go to the station-house to state this, because I did not want to lose my time—I did</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoe-maker, and live in Fryar-street. I was at the public-house with Smith—the prosecutor came from the public-house, up to where I was sitting, and pulled out his watch-chain—I told him to put it in again, and he put it into his fob—I could not see whether he put it all in—he pulled it out as far as it would come, so as leave the watch in his pocket—after this he sat down on the right hand, at a little distance from Smith—at that time there were from fifty to sixty persons sitting down in two rows of settles—there were others sitting at the same bench with us—I did not know them—there was one man sitting between the prosecutor and Smith—Chappell came and sat on my right-hand side, then moved round to my left-hand side, and appeared very dronk—he fell with his arm on the table, and his hat came off—I think it was sham, from his manner—he got up once, and appeared to be looking after something, and then he got up quite firm—he did not get up on his feet, but merely lifted himself up—he went towards the prosecutor—I did not see him do anything—the prosecutor moved himself, and Went towards the corner—I saw Chappell go towards him—what he did I do not know—four or five were round him when they were robbing him—I do not know Glannon at all—I got out of my seat, went a short distance, saw two policemen, and told them a man was being robbed—I had turned my head, and Smith said, "Don't you see they are robbing him?"—I saw them rummaging about—the policemen came and took the prisoners.</p>

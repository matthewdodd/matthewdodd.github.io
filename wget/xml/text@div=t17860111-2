               <p>May it please your Lordship and you gentlemen of the Jury, I am councel also on the part of this prosecution, against the unfortunate prisoners now at this bar, who stand there for a crime which it is impossible for any words or any imagination, in my opinion, to aggravate; its heinousness and the pernicious consequences of it, are of such a nature, that every man of common understanding must observe them; this matter has been of very long expectation, it is not impossible, it is more indeed than probable, that many reports, many sayings, many paragraphs in news-papers, may have come to the ears and sight of almost every man; I am clear if it was possible that any prepossessions in point of opinion (I do not say prejudices) should find their way into your minds, you, on this occasion, would naturally dismiss them, because you must know that on this question you, as men, must attend to the feelings of men, and with that attention which, while the lives of you fellow-subjects are in danger, is required from you; at the same time you must know it is your duty to yourselves, your families, your country, and posterity; to prevent the effects which must arise from a subversion of those invaluable rights, which the subjects of this country enjoy, for disposing of their property<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110022"></xptr> freely, and absolutely without any controul on the part of the crown, or any interposition on the part of their fellow-subjects. The free disposition of property will be totally prevented if sche mes and manoeuvres of the kind that will be laid before you should obtain to gain credit before a Jury: Gentlemen, I am aware of the difficulty there will be, as well from the pain that every feeling man must entertain, on such a subject as this, as from the vast variety of matter this cause has passed through, and the number of sheets in which it is contained, particularly in Doctors Commons, I say I am aware it will be extremely difficult so to arrange the matter as to make it completely comprehensive on the first state of the case; I will endeavour, however, so to separate the circumstances attending this matter, as to make them as clear as I can to my own understanding, which is the best way of conveying them to yours, and in doing that I shall try likewise to bring several circumstances together, so as to shew you the view in which they appear to me, in order that it may be better understood both by my Lord and by you. The evidence must in its nature take up a considerable length of time, it must consist, as I said before, of a great variety of matter, and it may possibly be so laid before you, and so put together, that it may be comprehended notwithstanding the extent of the matter and the variety of it: Gentlemen, you all of you know, and must feel, that there are a thousand cases in which the actual fact of forgery, and the fabrication of it cannot be proved; there are others, where that impossibility is taken away, sometimes by the admission of accomplices themselves; and, Gentlemen, give me leave now to observe, with respect to accomplices, that they come, as, my Lord will tell you, always under circumstances of suspicion, and are witnesses, of whom juries always are, and always ought to be, very jealous; I mean those accomplices whose confessions arise either from motives of personal fear in themselves, or hopes of rewards from others, or of revenge or malice towards those persons with whom they were themselves concerned; but, at the same time, you very well know that there is a necessity, which the policy of the laws of this country has admitted, of receiving their evidence in some cases, and that where that necessity arises, accomplices have been admitted; they are what the law calls competent witnesses, and their testimony is to be heard; but the weight it is to have, the credit that is to be given to it is, as one of the greatest blessings of this land, left to the consideration of twelve men on their oaths, to the consideration of twelve men of credit, of reputation, and of property: It will be necessary therefore, by circumstances (and I will add too, in favour of the prisoners, strong circumstances) to lay a foundation for corroborating the testimony of such an accomplice as we shall produce, one who had himself so far lost the character and the duty of a subject of this country, as to be concerned in the transaction itself. The circumstances have, in the opinion of some of the learned Judges, always been thought most proper to precede the testimony of the accomplice, I know one in particular, I mean Mr. Justice Gould.</p>

            . I have also, my Lord's authority to say it is his, though I have not the honour to know it in practice; but although Mr. Justice Gould, from his great experience and his great attention to every point of the law in that situation, which he has filled so ably, has also adopted that practice, yet, at the same time, it is not constant and invariable, you will see reasons why it cannot be invariable, the story is sometimes of such a nature that it must precede the circumstances that are to corroborate it, it will be my duty, therefore to submit to my Lord, for I shall be extremely willing to adopt any conduct he thinks right in this prosecution, having no wish, no desire on this subject, but to do my duty to the public. Gentlemen, there are a vast variety of circumstances that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110023"></xptr> will very often weigh more with sensible minds than the most positive testimony of witnesses; and of that we have had too many fatal instances to doubt, much less to deny; there have been cases where the three witnesses to a will, as required by the law of this country, which is to pass real property, as distinguished from personal; I say there have been cases where all those three witnesses have denied the execution of the real will, where the circumstances have still established that will, and all those witnesses have been punished for their testimony; I mean the case of Mr. Joliff, which I am sure his Lordship must have heard of, where all the three witnesses to his will one after another absolutely contradicted the circumstances that proved it to be a true one, and they were all punished for their false testimony; there have been cases likewise, once or twice in my experience, where all the three witnesses have supported the will, and swore to it with such strength that would hardly leave a doubt in one's mind, yet it has been proved to be totally false, as in the case of Sir

Some time about the year 1780, his attorney, of the name of Falkner, died, on his death he employed a gentleman of undoubted ability and credit in his profession, Mr. Mumford: in 1780, he employed Mr. Mumford to make his will, in which, as well as in the former ones, for in order to look back to former wills, and to collect the intention of the testator, it was necessary to turn back to such as had been made in Mr. Falkner's life, which was done by this Mr. Mumford, in the year 1780, therefore, a will was made, the same executor, the same residuary legatee, in that will of 1780, that had been in the former will in the life time of Mr. Falkner: in the beginning of the year 1782, in February, Mr. Sawtell again wished to alter his will, or, in other words, to make a new will, and to have his will new executed; in February, 1782, he made a will, the same residuary legatee, the same sole executor, that was Mr.

Gentlemen, after this transaction, it will be proper to tell you the story of Underwood. This Underwood, one of the witnesses to the will, and the writer of the will, tells a story, I think from the 18th of December, 1784; in December twelvemonth at the Public Office, in Bow-street, before Sir Sampson Wright, upon an affidavit there made, his story is, that having been concerned for a Mrs. Reeve, sometime antecedent to the year, 1782; because the transactions I am going to speak of, happened in 1781; he had been concerned for her as a woman in poor circumstances, and having a Chancery suit, he was not a man of circumstances, and could not afford to advance, nor had he credit for the expences of that suit; the consequence was, that she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110027"></xptr> was an acquaintance of Mrs.

Goodridge before her marriage with him; for one of them that the testator had provided so much money to put him out apprentice, he had provided for one of these boys, and meant to provide for the other, they do not appear to have legacies in the true will, but in the false they have legacies of three hundred pounds each, Mrs. Goodridge has a gold watch; there are a family of Evans's, (not the prisoner)

             produces this out of his pocket, Mr. Slack never dreamt of such a thing; he went home, in the presence of his partner Mr. Atkinson opened this cover, and there he found the two sheets of blank paper: Mr. Mumford being a man of experience and ability, he was too inquisitive for this kind of business; he wanted the instructions of this will and the draught, this was a pinching part of the business, however they told him they were in Underwood's hands, and would be produced in proper time; without that, I take it for granted, Mr. Gregory would have had nothing to do with the business; upon this occasion, the day after Mr. Sawtell's death there was another consultation, then it was concerted that Underwood should draw up pretended instructions, and copies should be made and shewn to Mr. Gregory, and it was so, and they imposed, as naturally they would, upon Mr. Gregory; these instructions were written at his own house the 16th of February, the actual date when these instructions were written, that was the Sunday following the will; instructions for a will of a man who died on the 9th; in fact they were really, and in truth wrote the 16th, so this man tells the story; and you will see, when I come shortly to open the corroborating circumstances, that they appear to be true: when they came to shew the instructions, and the copies to Mr. Gregory, as he wrote the originals, as will be shewn to you in an incorrect way, and in a loose way, as supposed to be taken before the man himself, in order to imitate that which would be the natural effect of instructions so taken; he wrote them in that way, he likewise made a copy of the real will of the 14th of November, when he had got this, the draught of the true will of the 14th of November, he gave it to his wife to keep, she put them into her pocket; it happened very unfortunately that she being very big with child, was brought to bed suddenly, and the papers were all so extremely dirtied, that they were obliged to be put into a tub of water, and that draught of the 23d of January, seems to me to have been burnt, for this reason, that it was so defaced that it was of no possible use, the other two will be shewn to you; then they wanted a date to these instructions; then Mr. N. Goodridge set his wits to work, let me see, says he, Mr. Sawtell was at my house, the 4th of November, I went with him the 9th, being Lord Mayor's day, to tallow-chandler's hall, therefore the 6th of November will be a proper day, you can say you met him at my house, and he brought the will to you; that he suffered you to copy that will on the 6th of November, and on the 9th, he gave you more perfect instructions how he would have it altered, therefore these are the two supposed times; then on the 9th of November were these instructions to be dated: now gentlemen, with respect to the circumstances confirming this story of the man, I shall call to you one witness, who will prove to you, the consultations about the wife of this man getting Assiotti to write the name; I shall prove to you that when that failed by the journeyman of Mr. Goodridge himself, who was in the shop at the time that he came, on the 21st of January, with Underwood, and they were there four or five hours, Underwood writing, and the other looking over, I suppose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110030"></xptr> dictating, the man taking no notice, but going about his work, making some rail work that wanted to be finished, and which obliged him to work later than usual; this man seeing a part of the writing hang out, after Underwood and Nathaniel were gone, he had the curiosity to see what this Underwood had been writing, and there he read the name of Sawtell, and saw two or three legacies; he likewise was at work on the 22d of January, when he was writing a further part of this will: I shall call to you a witness, that will prove to you, that Evans, one of the prisoners, applied to a gentleman of the name of Hudson, a pewterer, a gentleman of character, as I am informed, to be a witness, supposing that Mr. Goodridge could not be there, however he was there. Hudson did not chuse to have any thing to do with it, and had nothing to do with it; that is a decisive circumstance, to go no further, that there was no true will on the 14th of December, it is of itself decisive; therefore, if that witness is believed, there is an end to be sure, of this matter. Gentlemen, I will confirm it further, on that 26th of January, I will shew, Underwood was writing on the 26th of January, when he was making the will that is now produced, that he was a considerable time, on the 26th of January, a writing, at

               <p>"I am astonished at your sending to</p>

               <p>"it was all well, but as to promises they</p>

               <p>"are all forgot." This he writes to her whom he had not written to on any other transaction than this business. Gentlemen, I shall also prove to you, that Mr. Underwood applied to Mr. Todd, a person who dealt in spiritous liquors, to advance him money, which Mr. Todd could not or did not chuse to do, when he would have pledged this receipt for the bond, as a sort of security for the money, and this long before any discovery had been made: now, you see all these transactions passed in the year 1783, and confirms his story, they being antecedent to the 18th of December 1784, when he went before Sir Sampson Wright, and made this voluntary confession, from some motive that I cannot state to you, no matter what; whatever therefore his character may be, he is certainly such an accomplice in this iniquity, that tho' he could prove it extremely strong, you would not attend much I am sure to his story, but coupled with these antecedent circumstances, you will learn what the real transaction was, and this circumstance as well as the others you will not forget, namely, the application for a witness on the 23d of January, and the application to Eames on the 26th;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110032"></xptr> all clearly shew that these things had not existed in the testator's mind; for Slack was the only person he had the least idea of as is represented: I conclude, therefore, gentlemen, with saying that long as this narration has been, I shall not mind my own trouble at all, if the case is made plain to you, you will therefore judge where the probability is, that this man so circumstanced, and in the situation I have stated him, should ever make that will on the 14th of December: that is for you to try; if he had made it the 23d of January, and dated it the 14th of December; it would be equally a forgery, though the testator himself might have executed it on the 23d of January, and for this plain reason, the antedating it, and executing it when a man might be incapable; that would therefore have been, without all controversy, as much a fabrication and forgery, as the present. Gentlemen, I will call these witnesses before you, beginning with Mr. Mumford, the former attorney; as it seems to be my Lord's wish and directions, that it should be so, to bring the circumstances before the story of Underwood; and it will be all so connected, and so supported, that there can be no doubt in any man's mind of the truth of Underwood's story, and it can hardly then be said, that a man in the situation of Underwood would come in this last stage and give this account, if it was not the force of truth that extorted it from him: the whole will be left to you, it will be made as short as can be; if I was to call the whole train of witnesses, it would lengthen this trial much more, for I know not how many score there are, but I told you before, I paid little or no regard to declarations, but to the acts of a man; we will, therefore, in as short a manner as possible, consistent with justice, lay this extraordinary case before you.</p>

               <p>Did he ever employ you afterwards? - He did.</p>

               <p>How often? - With respect to making his will twice; in February 1782, I prepared another will for him, and another on the 4th of November, 1782, that was the last will, the first was destroyed, that was the will of November, 1780, and the one in February, they were destroyed in my presence.</p>

               <p>Have you the instructions for that will in the year 1782? - Certainly not, they were very immaterial.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. You are an attorney? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did not you take instructions from the testator for the alterations of his will? - I certainly did, but I do not know where they are.</p>

               <p>Did you make any draught? - Yes, that will be produced.</p>

               <p>With respect to November, 1780, did you make no draught of that? - No.</p>

               <p>Did you take down no instructions in writing? - I cannot remember.</p>

               <p>You must tell me one way or the other, whether in November, 1780, when you made this gentleman's will, you took any instructions in writing? - They were merely trifling.</p>

               <p>Will you swear that you never had any instructions or any thing in writing of the will of November, 1780? - Certainly not.</p>

               <p>You never had? - Not to the best of my remembrance, I had not.</p>

               <p>Have you searched for if? - A considerable time ago.</p>

               <p>Have you made a recent search to attend this trial? - I have not.</p>

               <p>Then, Sir, it seems to me rather strange that you cannot swear you have none subsequent? - I do not recollect I had any instructions in writing, about the will of 1780.</p>

               <p>I ask you, if you ever had any instructions in writing from the testator? - I verily believe I had not them in writing.</p>

               <p>If you verily believe that, you must have believed it when it was still more recent; did you search for it, Sir? - I do not say I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110033"></xptr> searched for it; I searched for all papers generally.</p>

               <p>Then you mean to say you have not any such paper that you can prove to the Court, concerning November, 1780? - No, Sir, none.</p>

             a draught of that will, I believe it is in the Commons.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. This you consider now as a draught of the will itself, for the instructions are lost you say; in February, 1782, there was a draught of the will, which was taken from some preceding instructions? - Yes, from his former will.</p>

               <p>Then when you came to make another will, in November, 1782, that very draught was altered? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Then that which is now in the Commons, and which is now called for, is, in fact now, the draught of the will in November, 1782? - Yes, but I believe there may be some little inaccuracy, which I can explain.</p>

               <p>Let me understand you; the draught of the will of February, 1782, when you came to make another will in November, 1782; you made it by altering the will of February, 1782? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Then that paper in February becomes the draught of November, 1782, though it was originally the draught of February, 1782? - Certainly it is.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. My Lord, I object to this being read, either as the draught of February or of November.</p>

            . The draught of February, 1782, when you made the will in November, 1782, was, as I understand you, the draught upon which the alterations were made? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was that will read to the testator? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Are the alterations for November, 1782, now visible on the face of that draught? - I do not know that they are.</p>

               <p>Then look and point them out? - I do not think that I can do so, but I can very near describe them.</p>

               <p>Was the draught, as it now stands, read over to the testator, prior to his making the will in 1782?</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. Sir Thomas, I must beg your pardon, I must really interfere.</p>

               <p>Sir T. Davenport. Was any draught read to the testator, prior to his making the will in November, 1782? - Yes, I believe there was.</p>

               <p>Was that draught read to the testator, before he made the will of November, 1782? - I cannot answer that.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. That would not alter my objection in the least.</p>

               <p>Court. The objection is this, that this being altered, and he not being able to distinguish the alterations that stood originally, he cannot now read it as the draught in February; now you may see how far you can read it as the draught of November.</p>

               <p>Sir T. Davenport. Was any draught read to the testator before he executed the will of November, 1782? - If any draught was read, it was that; but no doubt he was made acquainted with the contents.</p>

               <p>Do you believe any draught was read to him, in November, 1782? - I do not know whether the draught was, but the original will was, from which that is copied? -</p>

               <p>Then is this a copy of the original will? - Most certainly it is.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. My Lord, I submit this cannot be given, as evidence of a draught either in February or November.</p>

               <p>Court. Certainly not, you cannot produce the draught before you shew that the original is destroyed.</p>

               <p>Sir T. Davenport. Have you a release? - I have.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pigott. You released? - I have</p>

               <p>You have no expectations of receiving the money? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>No part of it? - No.</p>

               <p>You have entered into no private agreement about it? - I never mentioned it to any body.</p>

               <p>That will not do for me? - My expectations may be upon my brother, but never while he lives as I know of, my brother has no children, and there is no relation but me.</p>

               <p>Have you no expectation of receiving from your brother, or from any other person on his behalf, any part of that legacy? - No, Sir; are you satisfied now.</p>

               <p>Now Sir, observe, have you entered into no stipulation with any person about it? - I never mentioned it to any person, but what I said was, I had given one thousand pounds away; the proctor mentioned it to me, and I said, I would do it immediately.</p>

               <p>You made no stipulation at all? - Not the least.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. This is a very uncommon examination after a release.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pigott. In answering one of my questions, you used the word expectation from your brother? - My expectations are from him as next of kin and heir at law.</p>

               <p>Mr. Shepherd. At the time that release was executed, he certainly had no claim on his brother, for

             does not appear at present to be the executor of that will, for there is no probate granted, the usual way of doing business will certainly have some weight, nobody yet ever saw such a release without the legacy being released specifically, he released something which did not exist, it depends on executors having effects, it depends on the executor's assent; the only thing in the release is simply, that he chooses to call himself a legatee, he does not call his brother Daniel executor.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord as counsel in this case, in the situation in which I stand, I certainly might spare myself the trouble of arguing this point, because it seems to me to be too clear to argue; but as there is such a great phalanx on the other side, I shall throw in my mite upon this question; and I beg leave to observe, how does this man release his brother? not even in the character of executor; but if he did,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110035"></xptr> it is a character that does not belong to him, he is not executor, there is a litigation in the Commons, in the result of which we say it will not prove that he is so: My Lord, suppose the executor may renounce, the execution will then be committed to the next of kin, he is not in a situation to accept of that release; and your Lordship knows there must be somebody in esse, capable of accepting and assenting to the release; now, my Lord, is Mr. Slack such a person? is he the executor of that will of Mr. Sawtell's? there is no such will known to any body, which the Commons have assented to as a true will, and there is no probate of any such will: suppose the next of kin should, upon the renunciation of this gentleman, Mr. Slack, have the probate, would this be a bar as against the next of kin, why he would say, though I will not bring an action against my brother, yet when it is committed to other persons, I will bring an action; would this be a bar to that action? now observe what does he release? he releases all debts and claims now actually due, all claims and rights of action now vested in him, he releases nothing which he at present possesses, and this cannot be a bar to any future interest he may acquire.</p>

               <p>Court. There is nothing in this objection, it is said this would not be a good release in equity, the person states himself to be a legatee, the general words are sufficient, all suits in equity, quarrels, &amp;c. My Lord Coke says quarrels are the same as querula, the most comprehensive word whatever.</p>

               <p>Was it a custom that his servant used to sit up with him on a night? - No, Sir, not till he was very ill; I sat up with him for about a month, till within three nights of his death.</p>

               <p>When did he die? - He died the 9th of February, 1783.</p>

               <p>Court. You may always shew the testator's kindness to particular persons. - A few months before the 4th of November, before the execution of that will, Mr. Sawtell assigned over some houses with a strange attorney.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pigott. Was you present at this, Sir? - I will tell you presently.</p>

               <p>No, you must tell me first? - I was present at the assignment of a policy at the Insurance office.</p>

               <p>You must not say what you imagine to be his reason however well-founded that may be, but what the testator declared to be his reason? - He assigned over these houses because one man never paid his rent and the other

             might as well have taken my word, for I may have signed something that might have been a will; says he, what does he bring so many papers to me to sign for, probably I may have signed something I should not, I will alter my will, says he, if it be only to alter the date; I saw him sign the assignment of the policy.</p>

               <p>Did he write his name to the instrument? - Yes, he did.</p>

               <p>At what time was this? - That was about two months or six weeks before the 4th of November, I cannot speak to the time, it might be later or sooner, he made the declaration about the 1st of November, and he desired me to bring Mr. Mumford, and bring the will out of the iron chest, Mr. Mumford read the will over to him, and he said, it might be just as it was, and to bring it to him in a day or two.</p>

               <p>Did you ever know that Mr. Sawtell made a mark instead of signing his name? - Never, Sir, he always said, Bob, where must I write it? and then he put his name directly, I never knew him a put mark.</p>

            .</p>

               <p>How soon was it that you had seen him write before his death? - I never saw him write after the 4th of November, I cannot be positive.</p>

               <p>(The two powers of attorney banded to the Jury.)</p>

               <p>When did Mr. Sawtell chuse to do his business? - He was very impatient to do his business, if it was very particular, by ten o'clock in the morning.</p>

               <p>I believe either from infirmity or habit, he was incapable of doing business after dinner? - He never chose it, he was not incapable, but he liked to have his pint of porter after dinner.</p>

               <p>The intimacy subsisted between your brother and him to his death? - I saw him on Saturday night preceding his death about eight, I had no conversation with him about that, the-last conversation I had with him, was very little for a week or so before his death, only shaking hands with him, and sitting with him a little.</p>

               <p>Do you believe from the state of Mr. Sawtell's body, that he himself could have got into this iron chest, without the assistance of yourself or some other person? - For three months before his death, he was not able to lift the lid of the iron chest up, nor for twelve months before his death; on the 15th of December I went to his house, and enquired for him, he was not at home, I went there because I had no idea he was capable of going out, on the 15th of December I did not see him.</p>

               <p>Do you know how the will on the 4th of November was inclosed? - It was wrapped up, and sealed with his seal, a candle in a candlestick, and a circle, in which spermaceti was wrote.</p>

               <p>Describe the cover? - I think it was put up corner ways, I put it into the iron chest myself.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pigott. Mr. Slack, did I understand you to say that the day before this poor man's death, your brother took the will out of his iron chest? - The day before the death of Mr. Sawtell, I saw it in the iron chest, at least I thought it was there, I saw the cover, and had it in my hand.</p>

               <p>Did you go to the chest with your brother? - My brother was at the chest then, I went to it and took up the paper.</p>

               <p>Did you take that paper? - I understood so.</p>

               <p>The day before you was at the chest, and saw that paper? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You understood afterwards your brother took it out? - I did.</p>

               <p>Who did you understand it from? - I never saw my brother till the next morning, then my brother told me that he had taken out the covers, and there was only two blank sheets of paper.</p>

               <p>Now, that cover which you supposed to contain the last will of the testator, your brother told you he had taken out of the chest, did not your brother tell you distinctly, that he took out that cover the day before the man died? - I think he did, I do not know whether he took it out the day before or that same morning.</p>

               <p>Your brother went with you to the chest the day before his death? - Yes.</p>

               <p>For what purpose did he go? - He had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110040"></xptr> a power of attorney to do business, I did not ask him.</p>

               <p>You do not know what he went for? - I do not think he went for the purpose of taking out the will at that time, he did not tell me, I was with him, there is a little closet close by the parlour.</p>

               <p>What were you both doing there? - I cannot recollect what he was doing.</p>

               <p>What did you go to the chest for? - Accidentally, talking to him I went to the chest, and I saw it lay, and I took it up, and laid it down again.</p>

               <p>Were not you present at

            's examination before the Magistrates? - No, I was not, I was at Manchester, I never saw his examination, I never was present at any examination of his concerning that paper.</p>

               <p>You have told us that for two or three months before the death of Sawtell, he was not able to lift the lid of that chest up? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>It was very large? - Yes.</p>

               <p>It required some strength to lift it, did not it? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Had not Sawtell the key? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was there no method by which he could get at any thing in that chest? - I do not know, except it could come through the key-hole.</p>

               <p>Why it is very easy for me to give the key to another person, then it does not jump through the key-hole you know; I may perhaps get at something that is in the chest, without its getting through the key-hole to me? - Certainly, Sir.</p>

               <p>You have been examined in the Commons, and there you have given an account of the conversation that passed before Sawtell, relative to the supposed will of the 14th of November, you have stated that the testator declared to you, that he had signed papers, and that he might have signed a will, and that therefore he would make another will? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Now, I have had the curiosity to turn to your examination, and I will read it to you that I may not misquote it, that the leonent (whom I take to be

               <p>Do I read right or not? - I do not know what my deposition was entirely.</p>

               <p>Do you fancy it is to be got rid of in that way; when I am stating this, that to day you have said here upon your oath, that the tastator in declaring his reasons for making a will, told you, that he might have signed a will brought him by

               <p>All I want to fix is this, that so far from this man having declared that as a reason to you, you yourself was the first person that suggested it? - It certainly was the reason.</p>

               <p>Now, then having sworn in these two different ways, whether the suggestion of his having made a will did not proceed from you, and not from the testator Sawtell? - I do not know, we were talking of it a long while at the King's Arms, in Holborn.</p>

               <p>I say upon your oath, Sir, who began the conversation first? - He said probably he might have brought a will.</p>

               <p>But I want to know who first suggested that circumstance? - Then I say, I posibly might; we had a conversation of an hour and half, and who suggested it at first, I cannot say, but I know that was the reason.</p>

            ) thereupon remarking; now, I ask you as an honest man in the face of this audience, whether you did not first suggest to Mr. Sawtell, that they might have brought him a will; now, answer that as you please? - The conversation began about the Goodridges bringing so many papers, but whether it might or not, I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you believe that you did? - Probably I might.</p>

               <p>Do you rather believe you did? - I might.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110041"></xptr>You said something about a strange attorney who was with Sawtell, when he executed those deeds you have mentioned; be so good as to tell me who that strange attorney was? - I do not know; the attorney at the execution of the assignment of the policy, I believe was Mr. Gregory.</p>

               <p>You was a witness to it? - I think I was.</p>

               <p>Look at that paper, you are a witness to it? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you take that to be a will? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>You saw Mr. Sawtell execute this? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was it executed when it bore date? - I think it was.</p>

               <p>Was it read over to him by Mr. Gregory? - I think it it was.</p>

               <p>Did not you know perfectly well, that Mr. Gregory was the attorney for the Goodridge's? - I never knew Mr. Gregory, not never saw him till then, I never heard his name mentioned.</p>

               <p>Who recommended Mr. Mumford? - I did, after Mr. Falkner's death.</p>

               <p>You say Mrs. Goodridge was a niece to the wife of Mr. Sawtell? - She was.</p>

               <p>You say Mr. Sawtell said he was very glad to get rid of a plague? - Yes.</p>

               <p>That year, in August 1782, he was giving them houses? - I understood he was not giving them at all, he was to receive the rents before the leases were out, that is what he understood I am sure.</p>

               <p>Did you ever happen to hear that Mrs. Goodridge was the natural daughter of Mr. Sawtell? - I never heard that.</p>

               <p>Never by accident? - No.</p>

               <p>Perhaps it is an invention of mine just now occurred? - I never heard it.</p>

               <p>You and your brother kept a pretty constant watch on Sawtell? - We were pretty constantly with him, if I was not with him he was very angry with me, probably once a week I might spend an evening with him.</p>

               <p>Because in your original examination, you said, you and your brother were constantly with him? - I generally called upon him every day.</p>

               <p>Now, as far as you could make it consistent to your respective conveniences, you did look sharp after this man? - My brother was there generally every day.</p>

               <p>May be your brother is a pretty near relation to Mr. Sawtell? - Not that I heard of.</p>

               <p>May be you are a relation to him? - I never understood that either my brother or me were relations to him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. The cover that you took out of the box with your brother the day before his death, was that the cover you put into the chest on the 4th of November? - It was.</p>

               <p>Had it a sufficient mark about it, according to the best of your opinion, so as to enable you to say it was the same? - It certainly was.</p>

               <p>Now, as to the conversation that took place between you and Mr. Sawtell, does your memory serve you sufficiently to say, whether you was the man that first suggested that a will might come among the papers, or he to you? - Upon my word, the conversation lasted so long, I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Who was it that was there upon that occasion? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>Was he the attorney employed by Sawtell? - No, Sir, I heard that he did Mr. Goodridge's business.</p>

               <p>What did Sawtell say about the houses? - He said they were assigned over to

               <p>Mr. Erskine. I apprehend it is premature upon an indictment for forgery to read the very instrument, upon which the indictment proceeds, unless they can establish some fact or other, which fixes the prisoner with it.</p>

               <p>Court. Last night we did it, we called a man who received a bill from the prisoner, then you may call a man to say it is not his hand writing.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. This is the very will that is charged as the forgery on this indictment I apprehend that before you can read this will, you must shew by some sort of evidence fit to go to the Jury, that they are the forgers of the will.</p>

               <p>Court. No, their producing the will, lays the burthen upon them to shew it is not a forgery; suppose it does not bear the resemblance of the testator's hand writing, how can it be seen unless it is read.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. I submit, my Lord, that you are not to taint the minds of the Jury with hearing the instrument read, unless you shew that the thing is in fact forged, no matter by whom; my objection is, you should not read this till you have given proper cause to the Jury and the Court, to believe this is a forged instrument.</p>

               <p>Court. How does the reading it convey a prejudice that it is forged, it conveys a contrary idea; they admit upon the face of it, it is a good will, then they avoid it by saying, though it does appear to you upon the face of it, yet we take take upon ourselves to prove it is a bad will.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. Suppose an action was brought on any instrument, the authority of it must be proved before it is read, the jit of this indictment is the point of authority.</p>

               <p>Court. Here is an instrument coming from the hands of one of the prisoners, it is read to shew, not that it is not the will, but I shall take it as it appears to be, till it is shewn to the contrary.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. Then we have no objection.</p>

               <p>(The will read as in the indictment, and examined by the record.)</p>

             used to be there often.</p>

               <p>Did he set up at nights with the prisoner after you and your fellow servant went to bed? - Yes, Sir, many nights.</p>

               <p>Do you happen to remember the first? - the 14th of December, 1782.</p>

               <p>Was your late master at home or did he go out on the 15th of December? - The next day he went to Newgate-street and dined there.</p>

               <p>Did you go with him? - Yes.</p>

               <p>At that time was he able to write? - That I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>But by his state of health I mean? - I suppose he could, he could handle a knife and fork.</p>

               <p>On this 14th of December, do you happen to remember what time he went to bed? - I put him to bed, but I cannot tell the time.</p>

               <p>I do not ask you as to a quarter of an hour or half an hour? - He generally used to go to bed, at that time, about nine, sometimes sooner, sometimes later.</p>

               <p>Did you that night see anybody or hear anybody in the house? - No, nobody but what I left, I left Mr. Goodridge to set up with him.</p>

               <p>You remember an iron chest that your master had? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Do you remember what keys there were to it? - The key of the iron chest wasby itself.</p>

               <p>Was there more than one key do you know? - There were two, Mr. Slack of Newgate-street had the one, and the other was in my master's pocket.</p>

               <p>Do you happen to remember where that key that was at home was on the 14th of December? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Where was it then? - On the 14th of December, before anybody came into the house, I took care of all the keys out of my master's pocket, and put them in my own pockets, and I put my breeches under my head all that night; the next morning Mr. Slack came, and I desired him to take care that every thing was clear, for I had done with every thing, I told him Mr. Goodridge had set up the night before and then I had nothing to do but to take care of my master.</p>

               <p>Then during his illness and at any time before his death, do you remember his saying any thing to you if he was taken ill, worse than ordinary, what you was to do? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What was that? - When anything rendered him ill, or incapable of his own business, I was to go to Mr. Slack, of Newgate-street, for he was the man that took care of his property.</p>

               <p>Now in what stage of his illness had you received these instructions from him? - I had these instructions for eight or nine years, ever since Mr. Slack was executor always, I do not recollect that he gave me any orders to fetch Mr. Slack in any part of his illness.</p>

               <p>Do you remember any particular day or night that he so sent or ordered you? - I do not recollect.</p>

               <p>Do you remember any thing that he said about Mr. Slack or about yourself? - He always told me Mr. Slack was to pay me my legacy.</p>

               <p>Now, do you remember any time before his death that he said any thing particular to you? - Yes, I remember three days before he died, I went to him, and he opened his eyes and looked at me, and asked me how I did, and I made him answer very well, I hoped he was the same, or I wished he was better, or something of that kind, and he desired me to pray for him for he was not for this world, and he hoped Mr. Slack would pay me what he had left me; that was all he said, it was the last sensible word he spoke to me, that was on Thursday, the 6th of February, he died on the Sunday after that.</p>

               <p>Now, during the time that you lived<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110044"></xptr> there, do you remember who had access to his money and all the valuables that were in this iron chest besides himself? - Nobody besides himself, but Mr. Slack, or somebody by his directions.</p>

               <p>Could he himself open that iron chest within a month or two of his death? - I do not think he could open it since the iron chest was in his possession.</p>

               <p>How long had he had it? - The brother died in 1777, then directly after that the iron chest came into his house.</p>

               <p>Now, when he did go to it he took people always to assist him? - When he went to the iron chest he always called one of the men to help him, I have helped him many times.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110045"></xptr>Where was that writing? - In the writing desk.</p>

               <p>Had you the curiosity to read it? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What was it? - Why it seemed to me to respect a will of Mr. Sawtell's.</p>

               <p>What do you mean by seeming to respect a will of Mr. Sawtell's? - There was the name of Sawtell there.</p>

               <p>Did you make any other observations? - Yes, Sir, I read some legacies that were in the will.</p>

               <p>Can you recollect any of them? - Yes, there was to Mrs. Goodridge a gold watch, chain, and seals, and after her death to her son

               <p>Was this an open desk that was in the compting-house? - It was a desk with a single flap, there was a lock and key, it was not locked.</p>

               <p>So this writing was left open in the desk for all the people to read? - There was nobody had any business in the compting-house except me and Mr. Goodridge.</p>

               <p>What more business had you there than Mr. Hill? - He had no business to set down the things.</p>

               <p>You was in the constant habit of going to this desk? - Yes.</p>

               <p>And so Mr. Goodridge knew that this was your duty; so this paper you have been examined to was left quite open in this desk, where you went to set down things? - Yes.</p>

               <p>After Sawtell's death did you not hear there was a will made in their favour? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was it a week or a fortnight? - It might be more or less.</p>

               <p>Was it within the compass of a month? - I think it was done within the compass of a month, I think it was before Mr. Sawtell's death.</p>

               <p>She was discharged, and her box searched? - She was not discharged, she discharged herself.</p>

               <p>I believe Mr. Goodridge was uncivil enough to search her box? - Yes, she came down to me and told me that, I was at Walton upon Thames, at my father's, I told her, that if so be I had known Mr. Goodridge would have used her so ill as he did, I would have divulged the secret.</p>

               <p>Now, what secret was it? - When I saw this will of Mr. Sawtell's I thought it was an improper place to make a will in.</p>

               <p>How long was this after the will had been made as you say that she came to you? - A week.</p>

               <p>I take it for granted you turned yourself off Mr. Dodson, did not you? - I might have worked longer if I chose, for he offered to raise my wages.</p>

               <p>Why, after you told Miss Nicklin this secret, you kept it still a secret? - Yes, I never opened my mouth to Hill about it.</p>

               <p>(Examined by Mr. Fielding.)</p>



               <p>I knew the deceased Mr. Sawtell, ten or eleven years before his death and up to his death.</p>

               <p>Did you know of any intimacies subsisting between him and Mr. Slack? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Of what nature were they? - Every day Mr. Sawtell went to Mr. Slack's house, almost.</p>

               <p>Do you know either of the prisoners? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Which of them? - Two of them.</p>

               <p>Did Evans ever make any application, and when, relative to the will of Mr. Sawtell? - Mr. Evans in January, 1783, came to my house in the afternoon, and asked me if I was engaged for the evening, I told him no, he then asked me if I would come to his house that night, about eleven, or between eleven and twelve; there would be an attorney at his house, with some few friends, that would go with me from thence to Mr. Sawtell's house in Brook-street, to be witness to his will.</p>

               <p>This you say was in January? - In January.</p>

               <p>Do you know what part of January? - About the 23d, I asked him in whose favor the will was made, he said in Mr. Goodridge's.</p>

               <p>Which of the Goodridges? - He did not mention any christian name.</p>

               <p>Did you know the Goodridges before? - I knew Nathaniel; then I asked him if it would come to the ears of Mr. Slack, in Newgate-street, if I was to be a witness to the will; and he said, he believed in course of time it would, and I was to have a suit of cloaths or a ring, if I would go, and be witness to the will; when I found it was not in favor of Mr. Slack, I told him I hoped he would excuse me, he left me in the afternoon, about three, four, or five, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110048"></xptr> cannot particularly speak to the hour, but it was after dinner.</p>

               <p>Did you see Evans at any time afterwards, and resume the conversation? - I met him a few days afterwards, and asked him if he had got a witness, and he said, yes, the business was done, nothing else passed.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. You are a friend of Mr. Slack's? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I believe Mr. Evans knew perfectly well, you were a friend of Mr. Slack's? - No doubt of it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Evans did not wish that Mr. Slack should know any thing about this will making, as he said it must come to his ears in time; did you gather from that, that this was to be secret business, and that Evans did not wish Mr. Slack should know it? - I took it to be so.</p>

               <p>And therefore he came to you, who was a friend of Slack's, about a thing that Slack was not to know; is not that a very odd thing, that a man, out of five or six hundred thousand people, should six upon you, who he might be sure would go and tell him? - Evans desired me to keep it a secret; I was as much a friend to Evans as to Slack.</p>

               <p>So your evidence appears to day; had Mr. Evans no friends, think you, that were not friends to Slack? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>I ask you this plain question, if you wanted to do a thing you meant to keep a secret from me, would you go and pitch upon a particular friend of mine, above all others, to tell it to in preference to any strangers; would you now? - I do not know whether I should or not.</p>

               <p>Look at the Jury, and tell me whether, as a man of sense, and a man who has not lost his reason, would you, if you wanted to injure me in any such a way, that I should not be able to correct it, would you pitch upon a particular friend of mine, upon one of these gentlemen here; would you be guilty of such an absurdity? - No, not at all, there is no absurdity in it.</p>

               <p>Would you do so, would you conduct yourself in that way? - I cannot tell you any more.</p>

               <p>But I will make you; would you do so, as a man that is not in bedlam; is Mr. Evans a fool; was Mr. Evans in his right senses; is he a prudent, discreet man? - I suppose so.</p>

               <p>Why should you think he is a greater fool than you? - I do not know; I am very happy I acted in the manner I did in the business.</p>

               <p>When might it first occur to you, that this was a material circumstance; did not you go to Mr. Slack directly, and say to him, I would have you be on your guard, things are not going on well here, I have refused a suit of cloaths and a ring; did you tell Slack that? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Then you are not so good a friend to him as you described: when might it first occur to you, to tell any body that you was interested about it? - It was some months before Mr. Slack knew that I knew any thing about it.</p>

               <p>When you was sworn in the commons, you said, you lived with him on the most friendly and intimate footing imaginable? - What kept this in my breast, was the intimacy with the prisoner; he is a relation of my wife's.</p>

               <p>How long was it before you met him in the street afterwards? - I cannot speak to the time in this business.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Had you any greater degree of friendship or intimacy with Mr. Slack than you had with Evans? - No.</p>

               <p>The 23d of January was but a short time before Mr. Sawtell's death? - No.</p>

               <p>Do you know in what condition Mr. Sawtell happened to be in at the time of this application? - I cannot say, I never was at the house, any more than what I have heard, Mr.

            , and then had a pint of purl in the bar, and nearly the same conversation was repeated in the presence of me, Goodridge, and Evans, and on Goodridge saying, that Sawtell was disposed to to alter his will, Evans said, get it done, get it done.</p>

               <p>Upon that occasion did any thing more pass, or did you part? - I made answer that if Mr. Sawtell was in his senses, and disposed to alter his will, he might do it without the assistance of Ned, Betty, or me; I left them and went to Greenwich; on the Tuesday following, Mrs. Goodridge, Nathaniel's wife, met about, fifty doors from my own house.</p>

               <p>Court. That is no evidence, the prisoner was not there? - No.</p>

               <p>Did you know Underwood at that time? - No, I never saw him till I saw him at Hicks's Hall, a year ago.</p>

               <p>Did you ever know Mr. Sawtell in any part of his life time, make a mark instead of writing his name? - Never in my life.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pigott. Mr. Eames, I take this to be the third time that you have given an account upon oath of these transactions? - It is.</p>

               <p>You were first examined in the Commons on the 26th of April 1784? - I was.</p>

               <p>You were examined on the behalf of the Slack's? - Certainly.</p>

               <p>You were examined for the second time on the 9th of August 1785, sixteen months afterwards, is that true? - I believe it is, I cannot recollect the dates.</p>

               <p>Do you happen to know that Mr. Underwood gave his information, and was committed upon it? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was Underwood in custody when you was first examined in April 1784? - No.</p>

               <p>Was not you present at Underwood's examination? - No.</p>

               <p>You heard when he was committed? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was it after you were first examined? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was you or was you not in Bow-street, when Underwood was examined? - No.</p>

               <p>Now Mr. Eames, this conversation which you have proved to day, namely between Mr. Goodridge and you, did you on the first examination in the Commons, say one word about that conversation? - I did not.</p>

               <p>Is there one word of what you have sworn to day in your first examination? - No.</p>

               <p>Not one word? - No.</p>

               <p>Were you sworn, Mr. Eames, to swear the whole truth? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Are not they examined to interrogatories there?</p>

               <p>Sir Thomas. That is the whole.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pigott. The second time you was examined was after Underwood was in custody? - I believe it was.</p>

               <p>When did you for the first time disclose all this you have been telling to day? - I disclosed it at Doctors Commons, and to other people the day it was spoken.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110050"></xptr>Who subpoened you to come into the Commons? - Mr. Slack.</p>

               <p>Did nobody ask you what you could prove? - I never was asked, to my knowledge, one word by the parties concerned.</p>

               <p>Now, observe, you stand here in a public Court of Justice, before a great number of your fellow subjects; how do you reconcile to the character and conduct of an honest man, to have known that transaction, and not discovered it? - It was a matter that hung much upon my spirits, and as such I could not form a resolution to declare it; the examiner at Doctors Commons did not ask me a word about it, it was a matter that I thought would lead to a criminal business, and I was afraid to utter it at first, but when there was a criminal business about it, I knew it must come forward, and I discovered it to Mr. Boucher, of Spital-fields.</p>

               <p>Why must it come forward if you did not disclose it? - I had disclosed it to Mr. Boucher; give me leave to inform you, that is with reluctance that I now stand here, and if I had not been subpoened, I should not have stood here.</p>

               <p>Between the two examinations, did you tell any person, no matter whom, that you had disclosed all you knew, upon your oath? - No, I never did.</p>

               <p>Pray, do you know any man of the name of Lawrence Green? - Yes, I do.</p>

               <p>Now, you never happened to tell him what I say? - He must know that I told him all that I knew after the death of Mr. Sawtell, within a few days after the death of Mr. Sawtell, I did tell Mr. Green the very thing.</p>

               <p>Did you never say to Mr. Green, I have been examined at the Commons, and there I disclosed all I knew of the matter? - No.</p>

               <p>You never did? - I do not know to my knowledge that I did.</p>

               <p>Will you swear that you did not, look at the Jury, and either affirm or deny as you chuse? - I never told Lawrence Green; I had said all I knew in Doctors Commons.</p>

               <p>Do you know a man of the name of Pollard? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Slack is a friend of yours? - No, he is a great enemy,</p>

               <p>Did you ever say to Pollard, that you wished for Mr. Slack to get the day? - I never did.</p>

               <p>You never said that if Mr. Slack got the day, you should get an hundred pounds? - I never did, Mr. Slack is no friend of mine, nor ever was.</p>

               <p>You do not deal together? - Yes, I do.</p>

               <p>What, considerably? - Not very considerably, I deal with him for cotton.</p>

               <p>How does it happen, that in this great City of London, you chuse to deal with a man that is your enemy? - You may make as much of that as you please.</p>

               <p>This is one of the new phenomena of this cause, I want to have it understood, you say,

               <p>How came you to quit the service? - Because I did not like to stay after my mistress died; I saw Underwood and the two Goodridges in the dining room, at Mr. Goodridge's house, writing, about a fortnight before Mr. Sawtell's death, I do not remember seeing them after his death, I cannot say how often before; there was Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110051"></xptr> Evans came in the course of the day, and went into the room.</p>

               <p>Where were your friends? - My acquaintance I had was a fellow servant of mine, that I lived with at Chertsey.</p>

               <p>Where was you between the time that you quitted Mr. Goodridge, and went into service again? - I was at Chertsey.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110052"></xptr>How was it you did not go into place, are you married? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Who is your husband? - Fisher Dodson.</p>

               <p>How long have you been married? - I cannot say to the day.</p>

               <p>About what time was it, and where? - I have no right to answer you to that.</p>

               <p>Court. There is no harm in your answering to that.</p>

               <p>Now, upon your oath, where were you married to Dodson, in what church? - I have no right to tell you that.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard. His Lordship has just told you must? - No, Sir, I shall not.</p>

               <p>Now after you have been telling that story, do you refuse answering that question before the Jury, and do you expect credit if you do.</p>

               <p>Court. You must answer that, where was you married? - I did not come upon that subject.</p>

               <p>That does not signify, you must answer that question?</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Let Dodson go out of Court till she has answered that question? -</p>

               <p>Court. You must answer? - No, Sir, I have no right to answer.</p>

               <p>Yes, you must, you are under the obligation to answer? - Not to that subject.</p>

               <p>Yes, you are.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you mean to stand to it that you are married? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Then you must answer it, there can be no harm in answering, if you do not answer, the consequence is, I must commit you to prison? - That is not what I came upon.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord tells you that you must answer, if you are not married confess it.</p>

               <p>Court. You must say when you was married and where.</p>

               <p>Mr. Recorder. If it is not true that you are married, the sooner you retract it the better.</p>

               <p>Court. Were you married in a church? - I shall not answer to that, for I did not come upon that subject.</p>

               <p>Are you apprehensive of bringing upon yourself any penalty or punishment by answering? - Not that I know of.</p>

               <p>Then there can be no reason for your not answering, if you do not answer I shall commit you presently, if you are not married and you have hastily said that which is not true, you are at liberty to retract it again; are you married? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard. Then I am sure I will not ask you another question.</p>

               <p>You still know that he used you very ill? - Certainly.</p>

               <p>Then how comes it you swore this in the Commons that you did not know or was not aware that the paper you then proved would materially affect him? - I did not know till then, I swore to the best of my knowledge, I should suppose it was his handwriting, I should suppose within myself, by the manner of the writing, it was his.</p>

               <p>When you knew it was to be used against him in a criminal prosecution, how came you to dare to swear that you was not aware it would materially injure him; did you read the receipt that was given to you? - I only looked at the name.</p>

               <p>I know Evans.</p>

               <p>Is that his hand-writing? - So far as the letter I, and the E, and the scrawl at the bottom, I know no further, he has signed bills for me for fires, when fires happened about the neighbourhood, I am engine keeper of St. Andrews.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you believe the whole or do you disbelieve it? - I will not take upon myself to say the whole of it; I believe it is as far as the I and the E, and the scrawl.</p>

               <p>What do you mean to say that one half of it is his writing and the other half not? - If I had his hand-writing in my possession I would not swear to it.</p>

               <p>What is your belief? - My belief, if I was to go so far as to speak the truth is, that it is his.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. Mr. Scott, if I understand you right, you say this, that you have not acquaintance enough with this person's hand-writing to take upon you to swear in such a case as this, that that is his handwriting, and though it may look like it, you have not a firm belief in his hand-writing? - God forbid.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. My Lord, in the most trumpery civil action in the Court of King's Bench, this would not do.</p>

               <p>Court. How often have you seen him write? - I have seen him write very often.</p>

               <p>Are you acquainted with his hand-writing? - No further than what I see here, I verily believe that to be his hand-writing, but I will not swear it.</p>

               <p>You have seen him write? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Are you, by seeing him write, acquainted with his hand-writing? - Yes, I perfectly believe it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. My Lord, I never yet in my life, in a capital case, heard a man permitted to say that he has a firm belief of his hand-writing.</p>

               <p>Do you think this a capital case, and do you know you are examining upon your oath, and will you take upon yourself, in the presence of God and your country, to say you believe that is his hand-writing? - I really believe it is.</p>

               <p>Then how came you to distinguish between the letters I and E and all the rest of the letters? - I see they are all joined together.</p>

               <p>You said that as far as the letters I and E you thought they looked like it? - In regard to the letter E, he always made the head of the E larger than the bottom.</p>

               <p>How long is it since you saw him write? - Eight years ago.</p>

               <p>You have not seen this writing which I hold in my hand now since you said you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110054"></xptr> could not take upon you to say it was the hand-writing, but that the I and the E were, and that you partly believed it; now since you made use of that expression you never have seen the paper, for I have had it in my hand ever since, how came you to swear to the contrary now? - There is the top of the letter I, he always used to make it smaller, I do partly believe it, and I do believe it from my soul; if my child was gone to sea for twenty-eight years I should know him again.</p>

               <p>What are you, Sir; I believe you are the man that declared war with the King of France? - That is not the question.</p>

               <p>Are you the man? - I am.</p>

               <p>How long did you stay in Newgate on that business? - Not at all.</p>

               <p>What gaol was it then? - I was two days in the Compter but very well maintained.</p>

               <p>You are a thief-taker, are not you, Sir? - Aye, if I saw any man pick your pocket I would take him.</p>

               <p>You are so much a thief-taker, that you seem to have caught yourself to day? - No, I think not.</p>

            ? - I do.</p>

               <p>Look at the receipt and tell us whether you ever saw it in the hands of Underwood.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pigott. I object to this, because it is a transaction between the witness and Underwood, neither of the prisoners being present or a party.</p>

               <p>Court. The objection to this evidence is merely to lay a foundation to introduce Underwood, first of all it has been proved to you that Underwood wrote this.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, this evidence cannot at all be received, I say the Court will not do that which is palpably, grossly wrong on the face of it, if they cannot examine into what he has said, can they examine into what he does? he is so bad a witness, he is so little to be credited, that no act of his, no conversation of his, no testimony of his, even on his oath, can be so received as to go to the Jury, they bring this man to shew that this paper was at one time in the hands of Underwood; it would be good evidence if he was to be tried, suppose in a burglary, if any of the prisoners pledge any thing, it is evidence against them: Though there is no doubt about his guilt, the only question is, whether he singly is guilty, or whether he with other persons is guilty, and not the prisoners: he is a man who cannot be received unless most strongly confirmed; if such a witness were permitted to lay his head together with any other person with whom he might advise, to have these things and shew them all about the town, so as to get rid of his own examination, there would be an end of the boasted liberties of the country; I never recollect any such evidence has been received yet.</p>

               <p>Court. It has been proved by other witnesses that this is the hand-writing of Evans, the only question is whether this may be received, now I think it is admissible evidence.</p>

               <p>Mr. Recorder. I am most clearly of opinion with the learned Judge that this evidence is admissible, the objection is not pointed to the witness, the evidence is this, a paper has been produced in Court, which, by some evidence admissible, no doubt but upon the credit of which the Jury are hereafter to decide; is proved to be in the handwriting of one of the prisoners, then the other evidence is to shew that the paper was at such a time in such a place, and that is to be shewn by the evidence of a witness standing unimpeached.</p>

               <p>Did you at any time, and when, see that paper in the hands of Underwood? - I saw the paper in Underwood's hands at the time he was committed to the Fleet, I saw this in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110055"></xptr> the possession of Mrs. Underwood and him together, in September, 1784.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pigott. How happened it that Underwood was in the Fleet Prison? - I do not know what for, but he was committed by my Lord Chancellor.</p>

               <p>Did you never hear Underwood say what it was for? - I cannot say, I dare say he would not open his mind to me on the occasion.</p>

               <p>Was not it about perjury? - I never meddle with any thing that does not immediately concern me, I do not know.</p>

               <p>You recollect you have seen a paper in the hands of Mr. Underwood, the paper subscribed by the name of Evans? - I do.</p>

               <p>Did you read it? - I did, and to the best of my knowledge it is the same paper, I do not speak positively.</p>

               <p>In your examination in the Commons you said thus,</p>

               <p>"This deponent did not then peruse the whole of the said writing, but to the best of his present recollection did observe the name of Evans thereto subscribed." I have asked whether you read the whole of that paper purporting to be a receipt from Evans to Underwood, and you say you did; now I say that previous to this, you were examined in the Commons, and you said, that the deponent did not then peruse the whole of the said writing, but to the best of his present recollection did observe the name of Evans thereto subscribed, but did not observe what his christian name was to it; now observe, you first deny positively that you perused the whole, then you add that to the best of your recollection you saw the name of Evans thereto subscribed, but did not observe what his christian name was; is it true what I have been reading, is your evidence in the Commons? - It is.</p>

               <p>Sir T. Davenport. Did you or did you not read enough of it, so as to be sure it is the same? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pigott. What do you happen to know of this Mr. Underwood? - Some years ago a person of the name of Evans turned swindler in India, and gave my brother a draught drawn on one

            , I found him to be the son of Dr. Underwood of the Borough, a man of the most unblemished character; I saw the young man at that time in very low circumstances, when I urged him to use his industry to get my money, which he did on the swindler's coming to London, this led me to a little kind of respect for him.</p>

               <p>But what I want to know is the general character of this Mr Underwood? - I think it very indifferent, very indifferent indeed.</p>

             sworn on the Voire Dire.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Erskine.</p>

               <p>Mr. Underwood, I shall trouble you with a very few questions before your examination; first, I shall be obliged to you if you will tell me whether that is your handwriting or no? (shews him the instructions he produced to Mr. Gregory.) - This is my hand-writing.</p>

               <p>You are a subscribing witness to this will which you now come to invalidate.</p>

               <p>Sir T. Davenport. That is no question on the Voire Dire, on the Voire Dire the only question is, whether he has such an interest as totally rejects his evidence.</p>

               <p>Court. You may attack a witness two different ways.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. I conceive the rule of Voire Dire is this, that before a witness is examined in chief, he shall be asked such questions as the Court shall think proper, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110056"></xptr> am bound to take every thing that he says to be true under the Voire Dire, I am entitled to ask that man any one question which I think fit, to which he shall think fit to answer, and when I have got all these answers, I say, that upon these facts disclosed by the witness himself, and taking them to be true, he is not by the law of England a competent witness.</p>

               <p>Court. Go on.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. I ask you whether you are not a subscribing witness to the authenticity and truth of that will? - I am subscribing witness to the authenticity, but not to the truth.</p>

               <p>Jury. Then you come to tell us a lye?</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. It is vastly beyond my conception to understand you, whether or no you did not mean to attest that that was such a will? - I cannot say that I did as an attorney.</p>

               <p>Did you sign this will,</p>

               <p>"Signed, sealed, published, and declared by the within-named testator, as and for his last will and testament, in the presence of us who in his presence, and in the presence of each other, and at his request, have signed our names as witnesses hereto? - Before it was signed or sealed I subscribed my name.</p>

               <p>Then, Sir, you thought proper to subscribe your name as a witness before the will was sealed and before it was executed? - When the truth of the business comes out, you will know the whole of it.</p>

               <p>When shall we know that truth comes from you? - When the whole of the business is related.</p>

               <p>Are you acquainted with Mr. Gregory? - I am.</p>

               <p>As there are so many persons present, I may venture to trust you with a bit of paper, though I shall want it back again; perhaps that is your hand-writing? - It is.</p>

               <p>Then I think you delivered this paper which I am now about to read to you, to Mr. Gregory. (Reads.)</p>

               <p>"On or about August, 1781, I first saw Mr. Sawtell, I was sent for to Mr. Sawtell's several times, to the house of Mr. Goodridge, about Mrs. Reeves, and on my informing him of the hardship of the case, Mr. Sawtell advanced five guineas. On the 6th of November, 1782, I accidentally called at Mr. Goodridge's, and there I saw Mr. Sawtell, and, after some time, he asked if I was not the attorney who had Mrs. Reeve's cause, which being answered in the affirmative, he, after some time, said he had made his will, but was very unhappy or dissatisfied, or words to that effect, and then applied to me for that purpose, but said it must be done with secresy, and seemed determined, and desired they would leave the room, they accordingly did, he then produced a will he had made two days before, and desired I would immediately copy it, which I did, I returned the same to him again, and then took his instructions, when I had done, he desired I would meet him again on the Lord Mayor's day, and after making some immaterial alterations, Mr. Goodridge and he went, I think to Tallow-Chandler's Hall, but first desiring I would not bring the will to his house till he sent to me, but on the 14th of December Mr. Goodridge came to me, and desired me to attend him at Mr. Sawtell's house, at a quarter after ten at night, we all went up stairs into Mr. Sawtell's bed-room, who was awake, and said I am glad you are come; I accordingly proceeded to read the will, with which he seemed perfectly satisfied, and said it would be very troublesome in the situation he was to write his name, I told him his mark would do as well; then he executed the will, and, applying himself to Mr. Goodridge, said, God bless you, take care of what I have done for you, or words to that purpose; we all went away." This which I have been reading to the Court and Jury, you have acknowledged to be your hand-writing and delivered as such solemnly to Mr. Gregory? - I did.</p>

               <p>The will was contested in the Commons? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You gave him this account under your own hand? - I did, I believe, before the will was proved.</p>

               <p>Did not you at a subsequent time give that paper to Mr. Gregory? - I did.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110057"></xptr>Now, look Sir further at this paper, and tell me upon your oath (if that makes any difference) whether you did not give that as a copy of the instructions which you took down from Mr. Sawtell's mouth to make his will? - I did.</p>

               <p>Reads,</p>

               <p>"As far as concerning the rest of my estate and effects of what nature or kind soever, I leave to the said

            , &amp;c. for ever."</p>

               <p>You told Mr. Gregory, I believe, that there was some alterations which the deceased Mr. Sawtell had suggested to you at the time of taking the instructions; this is a whimsical situation I am in, to be obliged to take what you say for truth; this you gave as a copy of the instructions which you took down from old Sawtell for his will? - I did.</p>

               <p>You was afterwards examined in Doctors Commons, and you gave a very long and circumstantial account of that business, upon your oath; you positively swore, you was then solemnly sworn upon the gospel to speak the truth? - Not a doubt of it.</p>

               <p>Reads,</p>

               <p>"And is so assured in his conscience, and firmly believes that there was not the least force, fraud, imposition, persuasion, artifice, device or contrivance, used or practised by any person whatever, to prevail upon or induce the deceased to make that will, but the deceased appeared to the deponent to be in his perfect senses, and capable of knowing what he did, the witness never saw him after the execution of the will, and knows nothing of his manner of living." Here then you did declare that this was a true valid will made by yourself, and that you saw it executed, did you swear that or did you not? - I did swear it.</p>

               <p>I believe you was cross examined on forty five cross-interrogatories in that Court? - I was.</p>

               <p>Persisted to give this full account of it? - I did.</p>

               <p>And Mr. Underwood, are you come here in the character of a witness, to tell my Lord and the Jury that every thing you deposed to before, was absolutely false, and without any foundation? - I came here as a criminal.</p>

               <p>That is no answer to my question, you do not come so, I wish you was at the other end of the Court? - I certainly have entered into a base combination with the prisoners, I can only say this, I have done a wrong thing, and that I am sorry for it.</p>

               <p>How are we to know that you are not doing a wrong thing to day, then you come here to falsity your attention to Mr. Gregory? - I am a criminal in the business, and I come here to make all the reparation I can.</p>

               <p>Are you come here to falsify, upon your oath, that which you swore in the Commons, and that which you delivered to Mr. Gregory? - A man that does wrong, has a right to do right.</p>

               <p>Do you, aye or no? - I am come to do right.</p>

               <p>Do you come to falsify every thing you have heretofore sworn? - Not a doubt of it but I am.</p>

               <p>All of it! - Yes, all that I have done on account of this will.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. My Lord, I feel myself in a situation so perfectly new, not because I am inexperienced in the history of judicatures, not because I am inexperienced in the history of civilized society; but because I am unacquainted with any case like this, and therefore, if I should not be able to give all the assistance to my clients, which in humanity and justice I owe them, I hope I shall stand excused; I am so astonished at what I hear and see, as not to be able to recollect the language in which I address your Lordship; I must make three objections to the competency of this witness, and I make them after cross-examination, on the Voire Dire, that I may have an opportunity of taking them collectively, and not separately: the three objections I make to his evidence, are these: first, that he appears on his own confession, and upon the statement of the counsel for the prosecution with respect to him, to be an accomplice in this crime, with which the prisoners are charged; and I mean to contend before your Lordship, that there is not a sufficient foundation laid in evidence, such as would induce your Lordship to leave the guilt or innocence of the persons to be decided by the evidence of such a witness; and that your Lordship cannot consistent with your conduct, receive this witness after the foundation you have laid down: I think that if even Mr. Underwood stood under none of the circumstances which are stated, that simply he is an accomplice: my second objection, which I beg to be added to the other, is, that he is a subscribing witness, which is one of the most solemn and deliberate acts, that any man can do to society; he is, upon his own confession, a subscribing witness to that will; that he says under that attestation, he saw the testator execute, and he has confirmed the truth of that attestation to Mr. Gregory in the most solemn manner, that no fraud, imposition, or device whatever was used in obtaining that will, and now in order that the prisoners may be taken away from the face of the earth, this man is to contradict the whole of his former evidence; there is a third character in which he stands, he has attested upon his oath in the Commons, as to his subscribing of this will, he stands as an informer, he stands convicted of perjury, on his own confession, and there is no judgment of record required against him; you have previously said, as a guide to the rules that we are to govern ourselves by at the bar, that you expect an antecedent foundation to be laid before an accomplice is admitted; the meaning of that is evidently this, an accomplice shall not be called before the foundation is laid for his evidence, for first, it operates as a snare to the Jury; secondly, it wastes the time of a Court of Justice, and no Judge would say to a Jury, you are to pay no respect to this man, unless he is corroborated by other circumstances: the crimes with which the prisoners at the bar are charged, are simply these; that they have forged or caused to be forged, the will in question; it is not for the uttering and publishing, but for the act of forging; and I beg leave to say no evidence has been yet given to impute that crime to the prisoners: it appears that Mr. Slack was not connected with the testator, Mr. Sawtell, in blood; and by every witness it appears that Mrs. Goodridge was his wife's niece, and it appears that he was extremely intimate with him, and he assigned him lease-hold premises<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110060"></xptr> and dined with him: my Lord, presumptions do not weigh in criminal cases, those which are of great avail in civil cases, are of no avail in criminal; but, says a very experienced lawyer, there is such a superior presumption in christian charity, that the presumption is much stronger in the innocence of prisoners than any presumption that can arise of their guilt, until the contrary is proved; if I am to examine the evidence, what does it amount to, that Mr. Slack is a stranger, and that Mrs. Goodridge is a relation, that Mr. Slack is a friend, and Goodridge another; now, suppose they had got at the residuum, and that the legacies did not swallow up the whole, God forbid probabilities are to put men on their defence, charged with the perpetration of a criminal offence, but that is not the case: as to Mr. Price in his evidence he has laid no antecedent foundation for the evidence of an accomplice; Mr. Price has proved nothing, and Price says this, that for some time before his death, this

             had set up with the testator, and attended him in his sickness; it seems to me the strongest reason in the world, why a man is not to be neglected by the sick man in his will, for there is no object that can operate on the heart of a good and benevolent man, like the man who chuses to sit in a dark loathsome chamber with a sick man, rather than go out into the open air, and a man must have a great friendship for another, when he chuses to trust him in an office like that of sitting up all night with him, so that Price states things that may lead your Lordship to believe that he was the person who by his own choice he took to; and Price also says, that he remembers his going once or twice to the iron chest.</p>

               <p>Mr. Recorder. I know some of the first criminal lawyers receive the evidence of the accomplice first, that is no ways contrary to law, it is a matter of discretion; but I conceive the principle of law is, that accomplices in all cases are admissible witnesses, but witnesses so discredited that unless there are some circumstances proved by witnesses deserving of credit, to confirm their testimony, it shall not even be left to the Jury, whether they will or will not believe them: with respect to this man, I must say, that from what has come out from the Voire Dire, he stands by no means in the light of a common accomplice, the objection to him is an objection to credit, a man's coming to unswear what he has sworn before, if he were not an accomplice it would be a much greater objection to his credit, and no Court or Jury can rely at all on his testimony, beyond what is proved by other witnesses.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. My Lord, this man stands in a situation so very different from a common accomplice, so contaminated with guilt, that I venture to say he cannot be believed; why is he to be believed? The only reason why a witness can be competent, and is to be received, is, that the Jury are to suppose, that the man comes under the sanctions and solemnities of religion, that he is influenced, not only by the fear of that punishment which the law can inflict upon him here, but stands much more in awe of that greater punishment, which it is in the power of the Supreme Being to inflict upon him in a future state: Why cannot a man convicted of perjury be examined as a witness? Because he has shewn that he pays no regard to the solemnities of religion, and though liars may often speak the truth, the life, the same, and the property of any individual must not depend on the testimony of any man that is not fit to be believed; and though to be sure it would not be once in a hundred times, that you could get a gentleman of so steady a countenance, as Mr. Underwood, to tell you all this is false, because he is the first man alive that ever did so; I cannot bring such another instance, there were many instances on the restoration of King

               <p>Court. What cases were those.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. I did not bring down my books with me, but in our day a witness never can be permitted to say one thing upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110061"></xptr> his oath, and then be permitted to tell a Court and Jury that the whole of that was perjury, because there is no degree of competency due to him; does your Lordship wish to have such a witness examined? can you tell the Jury that such a man is to be believed? Why he might be indicted upon his own examination; for if a man swears to two contrary propositions which are not true, you may indict him upon that; and would it not be a hard thing, that those three men at the bar should suffer death on the evidence of such a witness as Mr. Underwood: I cannot conceive any thing more distressing to your Lordship sitting as a Judge, than that such a man as this should be examined, that the time should be consumed, and that a snare should be laid for the consciences of the Jury, only that you should let them loose on that snare; but I am sure that the Jury have too much good sense, too much humanity, and too much christian charity to condemn any man upon such evidence: If I have offered any thing that does not meet with the opinion of the Court, I am sorry, I am sure I stand in a case perfectly new, it is no wonder I do not know better in such a case.</p>

               <p>Mr. Pigott. My Lord, if the situation in which your Lordship now stands, was a situation in which a Judge ever before found himself, I think I should have discretion enough not to repeat any thing that Mr. Erskine has said; but I think that from the first moment that jurisprudence has been known, and from the first crime in the world down to this time, there never was such a cause as this in a Court of Justice; there never was a witness offered to a Court under such circumstances, and therefore, I do assure your Lordship, that with the utmost respect to the decision of your Lordship, I speak of the accomplice Underwood. It is of great importance to every citizen in the world, I do not say of this free country only, but I say on the face of the earth, that, that witness should be rejected as incompetent; for if he was to be received, unless God Almighty was to make a new revelation of his will, I protest I do not see how any man's property can be safe, if a witness comes into a Court of Justice, uttering the first word, he says, I did, (not in some other time, not in some other case, not in some other period, I did) commit perjury, but upon this very subject, upon this subject whether this was a valid will or not, I delivered the copy of the draught to the attorney, and after all I deposed deliberately making my solemn appeal to God for what I said, and I stood a cross examination of forty-five interrogatories, which were calculated to draw forth what I now call the truth of the case; but all I deposed was false. My Lord, there is no crime so great as high treason, yet if there existed persons base and wicked enough to conspire against that life, precious as it is in the eye of the law, and a witness had been called who could prove that crime of high treason, if that witness at any other time had been convicted of perjury, though he should have committed it in the earliest period of his life, though he should have lived half the life of man in the course of amendment and repentance, though he should be received in all societies with respect, yet he cannot be received as a witness; why? because he has once shewn, that in one instance, he has disregarded the sanction of a solemn appeal to God! if that man,

            , whom it is this moment my misfortune to see, had perjured himself a hundred thousand times over upon all the subjects on which he had ever deposed in a Court of Justice, would he stand (I ask any man in conscience, and in reason, and in common sense) would he then stand in such a predicament as he does in this very case; he says, in that way I did depose, now the very first word he utters is, it is all false! Now, my Lord, upon what principle is it that a perjured man is unworthy of credit? why, because he has sworn falsely, not upon the subject that relates to this question, but upon any subject whatever; he has once sworn falsely, and what has once happened may happen again: consider, my Lord, the predicament in which this man stands, he is one of the three witnesses to this will, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110062"></xptr> has also been called upon by process, therefore I am sure it is a case totally new, for if any of your Lordships are of opinion that any thing like this has been decided upon any principle that reaches it, then I am perfectly content to say that my time has been mispent; this case is perfectly new, and I humbly submit it would be, of all situations, the most singular for the Jury, and singular for your Lordship to tell the Jury, to receive that man's testimony; but God forbid that such testimony should be received, if it should, I am sure that any twelve men picked out of the cells of Newgate would not sentence three of their fellow creatures to death upon the evidence of such a man.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard. My Lord, I shall confine myself entirely to this question, whether Mr. Underwood can be a competent witness, and, my Lord, the evidence by which competent or not competent is to be tried, is this, whether it is possible that any man, on any occasion, can give any credit to the witness that is to be sworn; that I take to be the distinction between competence and credit: if there is any thing which can lead the Jury to hesitate whether they shall believe him or no, then it becomes a question of credit; but if every body would cry out it is impossible to believe his evidence, it then strikes me it is as impossible to take his evidence, as if there was a record of perjury: When a man is convicted of perjury, no man can give credit to him however probable the story he tells may be, however, confirmed otherwise, still the man himself, in that situation, deserves not the smallest degree of credit; now can any man who has heard Underwood confessing that he first attested to this will, and afterwards upon mature deliberation he deposed in the most solemn way that the whole was true; and now he comes here into Court and admits he has perjured himself; can any man who has heard all this doubt whether he can be convicted of this perjury or no? he stands to all the world a perjured man; does not he stand as infamous as if he was upon record? If there was the smallest circumstance in his situation which could induce a Jury to doubt whether he was perjured or not, it might go to the Jury; but he is not competent, as, upon his credit, not the smallest discretion can be exercised.</p>

            , who comes here to swear that he has been perjured though whole volumes of depositions? My Lord, permit me to say, where there is a verdict only for the crime of perjury there may be a doubt; a late case, which made a considerable noise and was attended with very powerful arguments, seemed to falsify some persons that those who had penned certain affidavits, had not employed all the correctness they might, and it is still in some men's minds a doubt whether that man was fairly and strictly convicted: Is it so here? Have you any doubt whether he was guilty? have you any doubt whether he was corrupt, have you any doubt whether he was wilfully perjured? when he states now that he did that on the most mature deliberation, and added new forgery to forgery, and on the most mature deliberation sat down to make new minutes of instructions, as if they were old ones, and thus adding guilt upon guilt; Mr. Underwood, it is said, cannot be convicted of perjury by confronting his two depositions, I am very sorry to hear it, I am bound to believe it, the danger to society becomes infinitely stronger, because Mr. Underwood having heard that, and knowing the tendency of his deposition to day, is to go all the length of it; he is not like a witness coming into Court swearing as the woman did this day, first that she was married and then that she was not; I say he comes here tonight to perjure himself, I can demonstrate that; I assume that this will, which is now the subject matter of this indictment is a true will, that it was executed under the circumstances described in the Commons, I am supposing (and I beg pardon again for the supposition, which is an insult to your Lordship) how can there be any evidence offered to the Jury to confirm that testimony which was given in the Commons, to contradict that which he should give to night? there may be cases of persons being bought off by wicked persons: the argument was pressed by my friends that preceded me with all the ability that can be, and I contest that, in this case, Mr. Underwood cannot be received as a witness: I wish I could ask the Jury if they have nothing before them, it is a sheer question of competency, and it no longer can be pretended to be a question of credit; the question of credit can no be supported against a man who stands here, I repeat, it as a monster of human deformity.</p>



               <p>Court. I think there is sufficient ground to admit the accomplice generally, when the attesting witnesses are called, they are constantly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110064"></xptr> cross-examined; it is admitted that in cases of wills attesting witnesses may speak to the sanity of the testator: put the case of duress, suppose a man makes a bond, a subscribing witness is called, suppose a man puts a pistol to his breast and to the witness's breast, should it be said that that matter should not be unravelled? as to the other case, whether the witness is competent to be received, or whether his swearing differently in the Commons to what he has done, is an objection to his credit, I have always understood that the incompetency of a witness is founded on a disability of law which can only go to the record, the other only goes to his credit.</p>

               <p>Mr. Recorder. However painful it may be to be obliged to hear the evidence of a man standing in the situation of Underwood, I cannot help entirely concurring in the opinion of the learned Judge as to his competency; this matter has been ably and ingeniously argued, and it would tend very much to confound the distinctions between credit and competency, if those distinctions were not maintained: can any man say that a man confessing himself guilty of every enormity that can disgrace human nature, is intitled to any degree of credit? and yet I am clearly of opinion that such a man would be competent; the question of credit is a question that always rests with the Jury, that of competency always rests with the Court; the objections to credit are infinite, as infinite as reason, philosophy and the workings of human nature can suggest; the objections to competency are few, and clearly defined by law, they are absolute disability of the person to give evidence, that he is a person convicted of perjury; I conceive it has been mistaken that the testimony of that witness is rejected, because when he is examined the Jury ought not to believe him, that is not the reason; the reason is, that he has been convicted of a crime to which the law affixes a disability to give evidence, therefore the man who is convicted of perjury, or any other crime to which disabilities are anexed, though many of them if examined would deserve the protection, and the credit of the Jury, for instance, a man convicted of a rape under particular circumstances, might be entitled to belief upon his oath, if it were not for such conviction; the perjured man is not rejected because he cannot be believed, but from his situation: now, no relationship however near and dear, disqualifies a person from giving evidence, except that of husband and wife alone, and that arises from their being in consideration of law one and the same person, they are not either of them permitted to give evidence for or against the other, but father for a child, or child for a parent, may give evidence; you cannot weigh the degree of interest, but any interest however small, disqualifies the party from being examined as a witness at all; because men should not be exposed to the temptation of giving evidence: the objections to credit and competence are perfectly distinct in their nature, the objection in this case is an objection to credit merely, and the Court may be bound by the rule of law to hear such a witness, though they may not believe him, for he may be under circumstances in which no man alive ought to give the smallest belief to his oath, that is for the Jury to consider; but I am of opinion he is a competent witness if offered to the Court.</p>

               <p>"You know old Mr. Sawtell, who advanced you the money on that business, he is ill, he has made his will, but has not mentioned either Goodridge or his family in it, and he has made a will, and has left it all to those d - d rascals he Slacks, who are no relations to him, and it is a pity so much money should be lost:" Evans said,</p>

               <p>"Old Mr. Sawtell often comes to my house to spend an evening, and if you will draw a will, I can get him to sign it, as if he was a witness of mine, as he has done before, and if you will call in occasionally when he is here, and will draw up such a will, we will give you a hundred pounds;" and he immediately went up stairs, and brought down his will which Mr. Sawtell witnessed, to shew me Mr. Sawtell had done it; he then desired me to call occasionally, and leave my address in case he should come, they did not know then where I lived, I did call several times, but Mr. Sawtell had not been out from home; at length Mr.

            ; Mr. Goodridge told me I must go to Mr. Gregory, for he was the party concerned, and we agreed among ourselves how we should make up a case to speak to Mr. Gregory thereon: and I went to Mr. Gregory's house, and told him the whole of the case as agreed between us: Mr. Gregory desired I would bring over the papers, and make a memorandum of all I had told him in writing; and, agreeable to several meetings we had had, I drew pretended instructions for the will of Mr. Sawtell, at my own house, and we examined the instructions with the draught to see that it was all fairly transcribed, I then left these supposed instructions and the draught of the will with Mr. Gregory, these are they: Mr. Gregory also desired him to bring him a copy of the real will, of the 4th of November, of Mr. Sawtell's, and afterwards I went to Doctors Commons, where I gave this unfortunate<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110068"></xptr> testimony; about the 2d or 3d of April, Mr. Evans came to the public-house in Queen-street, in my neighbourhood, and sent for me, I lived then in America-street, he said to me, I think, Underwood, it is very proper we should be secured for this business; says I, what do you think of it Mr. Evans, says he, I think we cannot have less than one thousand pounds, and we ought to have security; I said we must have a bond if we have any security at all, we can have no other; he told me to come over to Mr. Goodridge's, and he would back it; I came to Mr. Evans's, and Mr. Goodridge was sent for, I opened the business, at length Mr. Goodridge agreed we should have each a bond for four hundred pounds; accordingly on the 7th of April, I went over with two blank bonds to Mr. Evans's house, which I filled up for four hundred pounds each, and they were executed, I witnessed Evans's, and Evans mine; after they were so executed, Goodridge said he should not like to have his bonds exposed, and proposed for Evans to keep both, and proposed that they should be sealed up till the probate of the will was obtained; and as a security to myself I wrote a memorandum or undertaking, whereby Mr. Evans undertook to deliver me up a bond as soon as the probate was signed; this is the receipt Mr. Evans gave me for my bond, after which we had several meetings, I had at least, and Mr. Gregory once or twice, at the house of Mr. Jenner, and I gave the evidence that has been stated in the Commons in support of that will.</p>

               <p>What became of all these papers afterwards? - Those papers that were executed on the 7th of April, the receipt for the bond and the undertaking I gave to Mrs. Underwood as soon as I brought them home, to put by, and she unfortunately put them in her pocket, and she kept them in her pocket till she was brought to bed, and they were spoiled as they appear now; the receipt I gave to her on the 7th of April, the moment I came home, and I never had it in my custody till November was twelvemonth, then I gave it up.</p>

               <p>Are these the two sheets that were in the cover? - They are, there are two pencil marks, under the seals, this is the cover that contained the true will.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. After what I have said of you, Sir, and more especially of what you have said of yourself, you may be very sure that I shall not waste many words upon you, and I hope it will be the last time I shall ever speak to you; you know very well these unfortunate gentlemen at the bar have no opportunity of contradicting this business; how comes it you swore to the truth of this will before? - It is an unfortunate circumstance that ever I became acquainted with the prisoners at the bar.</p>

               <p>How do you think, as you did not swear the truth then, that the Jury can tell whether you swear the truth now? - That is to be left to the opinion of the Jury.</p>

               <p>I believe you was in very great distress about the time this new light began to shine upon your mind? - I was in distress; I have a large family.</p>

               <p>That is an excuse that some other people have made in this country you know, you applied to Mr. Goodridge? - I did.</p>



               <p>You wanted money? - I did.</p>

               <p>But as for Mr. Slack, you never had any promises of money from him? - No, never.</p>

               <p>Nor any expectation? - I cannot say that.</p>

               <p>Then you have some expectation? - I had no expectation at all at the time I laid the information, the expectations which I had from Mr. Slack, were, they promised me they would go to my father and see what they could do for me.</p>

               <p>Why you had an expectation of an advantage? - They told me if I would come along and tell the truth, they would do all they could with my father to serve me.</p>

               <p>Nothing at all said about money? - No, nor I never said so to any body.</p>

               <p>Do you happen to know a person by the name of Jacques? - I never heard of such a man.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110069"></xptr>Perhaps there is no such man living, you shall know presently? - With all my heart.</p>

               <p>You never said that Slack offered you a thousand pounds? - Never in my life.</p>

               <p>And that God knew that you had not a shilling, and you hoped he would direct you for the best? - I never said so, as to God directing me for the best, I wrote a letter to Mr.

               <p>Might you be at Mr. Goodridge's house about the 24th of November? - I was.</p>

               <p>Do not you know that Mr. Jacques lived in that house of

               <p>Was there not a promise from Mr. Slack and several other gentlemen that they would go to your father and get things set right if you would come in and swear this? - No, if I would do the thing that was right.</p>

               <p>What was that? - To let the right owner have the property.</p>

               <p>What conversation had you with Mr. Slack and other gentlemen? - No promises of pecuniary assistance whatever, they promised if I would come forward and do what was right, they would speak to my father.</p>

               <p>I think you say that this receipt for the bond you first wrote over on the 6th of April, when Mr. Goodridge was sent for and came, what time of the day was it? - I believe it was in the afternoon, it was the day before the bonds were executed, and the bonds were executed on the 7th of April.</p>

               <p>Goodridge came over to Evans's house on the 6th of April, and you saw Evans and Goodridge at Evans's house, was it in the afternoon or forenoon? - I cannot say which.</p>

               <p>What time was the bond executed? - It was as soon as the candles were lighted.</p>

               <p>Now suppose it should turn out that it should be utterly impossible that a syllable of this should be true? - I cannot think that.</p>

               <p>You shall see in a minute, you was examined before Dr. Ducarell? - I was.</p>

               <p>Now here is a third deposition that contradicts both these, here is your affidavit before Dr. Ducarell has no reference to either, you have been pleased to say to night that the old will was copied at Sawtell's? - Yes, that I positively swear.</p>

               <p>Did you always swear that now, even when you got into the right path, and was to do what was right under those promises? - I am perfectly aware of what you have got in your hand.</p>

               <p>But I am not perfectly aware of what you have got in your head; you have said just now to the Jury, you positively swore that you are positively sure that the old will was copied at Sawtell's, now this was when you began to be a good boy; mind, your affidavit runs thus,</p>

               <p>You did, you knew from the beginning to the end, that there was a wicked contrivance to defraud Mr. Slack, and you was quite happy and contented at all this? - Not very contented, I was affraid to divulge it; on Sunday the 16th, Mr. Underwood wrote the instructions on a sheet of paper.</p>

               <p>You think yourself bound to obey your husband more than you are to obey God or any other man? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Then perhaps that operates a little upon your mind to day? - Yes.</p>

               <p>It would not have been very pleasing to your husband if you was to give the lie to every thing he said, you would have a battle at night? - No, I do not think that, I wish always to go with my husband, and would not tell an untruth.</p>

               <p>How came you not to tell about this forged will? - I was not asked.</p>

               <p>What was the greasing of your cart wheels, did not your husband at the time he gave information about this will, say, whether he was not reduced to the very lowest distress in the world? - He wanted money to carry on his business.</p>

               <p>Was not he reduced to extreme poverty, almost in great distress, it surprises me that you should be so glib about the dates of these wills, the 23d of December, and the 14th of November, had not you these circumstances from your husband? - No, Sir, they are circumstances that I was intimate with, I knew the 23d of January from other circumstances.</p>

               <p>How came you to be so certain about the day that the will was dated? -

               <p>Can you take upon you to say, that he remained at his own house during the time that you was there? - He never was out of the house, I dare say, I can take upon myself to say he never was in his yard, I cannot say, but he never was in the street.</p>

               <p>Who dined there besides? - There was one Mr. Collier, Mrs. Collier, and Mr. Collier's wife sister.</p>

               <p>Then you are sure of the day? - Yes, I am sure, I have a book in my pocket that will give you a good satisfaction about it.</p>

               <p>When was the entry made? - The next morning, I have made entries for twenty years.</p>

               <p>Let us see what you have got in it (Reads) dined at Goodridges? - I positively do say it, that on Sunday the 9th of February, I dined at Mr. Goodridge's, with Mr. and Mrs. Collier, and I do not think he was out once.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect going on the 6th of April any where? - Yes, I do, very well.</p>

               <p>Where did you go on the 6th of April? - I went to Barnet, beyond the twelve mile stone, Mr. Evans the prisoner went with me, I breakfasted at Mr. Evans's house, about eight on Sunday morning the 6th of April, as I went with him to Barnet, we went to Hendon, and dined by Finchley church, and slept at the Mitre, at Barnet; I was employed to measure a piece of ground, and tell the value of it, for him to make a purchase off.</p>

               <p>At what time did you set out to return to London? - We dined on Finchley-common, and we came to London between ten and eleven at night.</p>

               <p>You are sure you did not get to town till that time? - Yes, we went to his house, we walked all the way, and I staid till near twelve at night on the 7th.</p>

               <p>Now, I will tell you a thing that will surprise you a little; it has been said here to day that Mr. Evans executed a bond on that day at his own house? - I can say nothing to that, I know he was along with me from Sunday morning eight o'clock, till Monday night twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>Have you any more doubt about what you have been telling the Jury, than you have of your own existence? - No, Sir, it is as true as I stand here.</p>

               <p>Jury. Have you that in your diary? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Now, Mr. Pollard, where was this ground you was measuring? - The ground belongs to Mr. Emmery, I am positive sure I was in company with Mr. Evans from eight o'clock on Sunday morning, till near twelve on Monday night.</p>

               <p>Did you meet any body coming to town or see any body? - No, not that I knew, but there was a man overtook us somewhere on this side Finchley-common, he was a stranger to me, but the man spoke to Mr. Evans, and he came along with us.</p>

               <p>Sir T. Davenport. As you are so very regular, can you tell the day you committed the first act of bankruptcy? - I cannot tell you, I never was a bankrupt in my days.</p>

               <p>No commission? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Never any taken out? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Do you remember the day your creditors met in order to make a composition? - I suppose I may.</p>

               <p>When was the day you made a composition with your creditors? - I never made a composition with my creditors in my life.</p>

               <p>Did you ever meet them? - Yes, it was in the year 1781, I suppose.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110076"></xptr>In what month in 1781? - It might be somewhere in November or December; I was arrested several times, and I called my creditors together, and great part of them are paid, and all the money I owe in England, is not above eighty or ninety pounds.</p>

               <p>Will you be correct to the month you met your creditors to compound with them? - I cannot.</p>

               <p>Have you no memorandum of that? - I suppose I may at home.</p>

               <p>Have you or have you not, have you your books for 1781? - Yes, I will shew you something about it; on the 13th day of December 1781, I was arrested by a Dr. Bull, for eighteen pounds seven shillings, and this Doctor I gave him some money, I paid him the remainder since, I I have no entry of the compounding, for the lawyers run away with all the cash.</p>

               <p>Will you shew me in this book any entry of your dining at any other place besides this time? - I do not know that I can, but you may see by the complection of my countenance that I am not to be brow beat; I am a man that do not dine very often at a private house.</p>

               <p>Now I will give you the whole year of 1781 to find me another entry except that.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. You made that entry about the 6th or 7th of April, on the spot? - I made it in the field on the spot.</p>

               <p>Sir T. Davenport. It was very material to enter this dinner, you can tell exactly what you had for dinner at Goodridge's? - We had a haunch of mutton, and boiled beef, and there was a pye, I believe it was a damson pye, I am not sure.</p>

               <p>How many minutes walk is it from that place to Underwood's house? - I do not know where Underwood lived, it is in the Borough, it would take an hour and a half to walk there and back.</p>

               <p>When was you first called upon, and did first disclose this matter? - I suppose it may be four or five months ago.</p>

               <p>Who applied to you? -

               <p>Have you been frequently in the prison to see them? - I suppose I have been there forty times, I am intimate with them all, and if you was there I would go to see you.</p>

               <p>Why did you enter that dinner? - My reason is this, I had some business to do with Goodridge, I have no entry about any other dinner, there is another entry in that book of dining with him on Tuesday the 7th of January.</p>

               <p>Had not something passed on the 7th of January about a will? - I never heard any conversation about any thing being done about a will.</p>

               <p>Mr. Erskine. I observe, on the 7th of January you lost a shilling at cards, and on the 9th of February, you gave a shilling to the servant.</p>

             to do any business for you as a carpenter? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What was it? - To make a pair of cellar stairs.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect at what time that was? - In November 1783.</p>

               <p>You are perfectly sure it was in November 1783? - Quite sure.</p>

               <p>Are you sure it was not in January 1783? - No, Sir, it was in November, I recollect the time, I expected a gentleman out of the country, that was going to America, and he was to be with me a month; about the 18th of November, on a Saturday evening, they were finished; Mr. Goodridge and both his men worked till twelve at night.</p>

               <p>Who were both these men? - Hill and Fisher.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Are you sure it was in November? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Now, was it not in the year 1782? - No, 1783, I will shew the bill.</p>

               <p>How came you here to day? - I was subpoened three days ago.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sheppard. Was that the first time you was ever spoke to about it? - I was told some time ago, I might be called on, it may be six months, it may be seven months.</p>

               <p>HARRIOTT CLOSE sworn.</p>

               <p>I am daughter to the last witness, I recollect Mr. Goodridge being employed to do some business for my mother perfectly well, making a set of cellar stairs, altering a bedstead, and some other work, as near as I can recollect, it was about the middle of November 1783.</p>

               <p>Can you possibly have made such a mistake as that it might have been in January 1783? - No, Sir, I am very sure of that, I recollect that the work was finished on the Saturday night, the lottery beginning to be drawn on the Monday, I know the stairs were made, because we expected a gentleman out of the country about that time, who was going to America, he did not come, he altered his plan; I have no doubt at all about the time.</p>

               <p>Who did the work? - Hill was one and Dodson the other, Mr. Goodridge and his two men all attended together to finish the work.</p>

               <p>Sir T. Davenport. How long had Hill been with Goodridge? - I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Had these men worked for you any time? - Yes, that was in the December before, both Dodson and Hill, particularly Dodson, I remember him, and I remember Hill too.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110079"></xptr>Mr. Garrow. You are sure that the business of the stairs was done in November 1783? - I am perfectly sure of that.</p>

               <p>- GREGORY sworn.</p>

               <p>Have you been in Court to day while Mr. Underwood was examined? - I have.</p>

               <p>Have you attended his examination? - I did.</p>

               <p>You attended particularly to his evidence, where he says, he held in his hand a draught with the seal torn off? - If it had been as he represented it, I must most certainly have seen it, any clerk to an attorney that had not been six months with him, must have made the observation; I want to see if that which Mr. Underwood brought into the Commons is the draught, (looks at it) I verily believe this is the draught he shewed me, and not the draught he spoke off, the draught he spoke off, he told me he had torn off the seal and the name, is it possible that that could have escaped my observation.</p>



               <p>You think it could not? - It could not upon my oath, I verily believe he did not shew me such a paper as he mentions, on the contrary, I believe this to be the draught that he shewed me, for this reason, he pointed out to me that when he attended Mr. Sawtell with this draught, Sawtell made mention to him that he had made a mistake in two or three of the legacies, particularly that he had altered them with pencils, and that he had inserted maintenance and clothing, and struck out education, in my office he pointed out that to me; says he, here Sir, I have done it with a pencil.</p>

               <p>Then Mr. Gregory, how can it be true that he shewed you a cancelled will, with the name and seals torn off? - I do not believe it.</p>

               <p>At the time that Underwood came to you, to give you an account of what he had done, did he give you a clear account? One of the clearest accounts that ever was given by man.</p>

               <p>Could you have had the least idea from his declaration, that it was not a fair and just will? - No man could have had a shadow of doubt.</p>

               <p>And he gave you this paper which he acknowledged to? - He gave me a copy of instructions, which he told me he took himself from the testator's own mouth at

               <p>Mr. Silvester. You was, I believe, originally the attorney to the Goodridge's? - I was for Nathaniel.</p>

               <p>In short you did all his business as an attorney? - For the two brothers, for some years.</p>

               <p>When was the last time you did any business for them before this will was made? - I cannot say that.</p>

               <p>Did not it strike you as very odd that they should employ Underwood to make a will? - The very reverse, Sir, I understood it was Mr. Sawtell himself that employed Underwood, and not Goodridge, for the very moment Sawtell was dead, Nathaniel sent to me, to come to his house on the morning he died, which was the morning of the 9th of February as represented to me, and sent a parcel by Fisher Dodson, it was this will of the 14th of December 1782, I cast my eye over it, and he desired me to come to Mr. Sawtell's I stepped there directly,

               <p>On having the copy of them in your hand, it was examined by the original will he had in his hand? - No, Sir, the copy against the genuine instructions, not the instructions against the will, if he had held that in his hand I must have seen it, I had no suspicion at the time, I believed it to be as fair a transaction as any in the world, I supposed Mr. Sawtell was in possession of it; another circumstance, I saw Mr. Underwood many times upon this business, and when it was given out that

               <p>Have you ever had any conversation with Eames about his examination in the Commons? - Yes, I had once, I have spoke with him several times, I think the defendants had been in custody three weeks, it was reported that Mr. Eames had had an offer of five hundred pounds to be concerned in this forgery, I went to him, he declared to me that it was not true, and that what he said, and that what he had sworn in the Commons, which was on his first examination, was all that he knew; I was acquainted with Sawtell, I had dealings with him, the last money I paid him was the 2d of April, 1782, I paid him between one and two, I went to his house in Brook-street.</p>

               <p>Who was there with him? - Mr. Slack's brother was there, he counted the money and wrote the receipt by the desire of Mr. Sawtell, Mr. Sawtell said I cannot see to write, Robert, write for me, and he wrote the receipt which I have here, and

               <p>I knew Mr. Sawtell, I am an attorney, but my principal business is receiving the rents for particular estates, to the amount of seven or eight thousand pounds a year, I have met Mr. Sawtell several times, I have met him two or three times a week coming up Hatton-Garden, but in particular one morning, some time in the latter end of 1781, it was a Sabbath morning, when I got down my steps I saw Mr. Sawtell then nearly on the pavement, and I over took him, and I asked him how he did, and he said to me, as near as I can recollect, how do you do, he then took me by the arm and said I should go with him to Sagoe's coffee-house and have a dish of coffee, I told him I was particularly engaged, I said to him he was late, he said he was vexed, he said he wished I would go with him to the coffee-house, for he wanted to consult with me about his will or a will, I told him I hoped he had not lived to that age without making a will, he said no, but he could not get one to his mind, he said he wanted to do something or to provide for a daughter or child, I then said I did not know he had any children, he said he had one that he respected or considered as a child, he said she was married to one Goodridge or Goodwich, and he was a carpenter and undertaker, and as hard-working a dog as any in England, there was some other little conversation, but by this time we had just got to Sagoe's coffee-house, I wished him a good morning, but he took me by the hand and asked me into the coffee-house, I told him I could not, but would call upon him another time, he said if I would not go with him then I might be d - nd, he also said, talking about his will, that they would not let him make a will to his mind, I do not know who he meant by they.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. Where do you live? - In Hatton-street.</p>

               <p>A housekeeper? - Yes, Sir.</p>

               <p>What are you? - I am an attorney; but my principal business is, I am employed by a gentleman at the bar to receive rents; it struck me, as we were not vastly intimate, I had no kind of respect or regard for Mr. Sawtell, I had no wish to have done it if he had chosen it.</p>

               <p>When was this? - I rather think it was about the month of September, 1781.</p>

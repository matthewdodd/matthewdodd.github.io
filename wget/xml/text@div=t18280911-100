            . I am an officer. I have two certificates, which I have compared with the parish registers of Hackney and Chatham and found them correct - I apprehended the prisoner on the 27th of July; he was given in charge by his first wife, at Chelsea; I told him the charge - he said he had long expected it, and the reason he had married his second wife was that he had a respect for her, and did not wish her to be called a prostitute - his second wife is not here.</p>
               <p>JANE DAVIS. I was at Chatham, at the prisoner's marriage, on the 19th of September, 1812; he is a pensioner, and belonged to the same regiment as me - I witnessed the register: I never saw his second wife.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I have known the prisoner two or three years, and was at his marriage at St. George, Hanover-square - I knew his first wife, when she lived with him, about three years and a half ago; I saw her alive last Saturday week; she was a neighbour's child - this prosecution is not at her instance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He urged me to marry several times; I objected to it, but he persuaded me - my first wife and I agreed to separate and never speak: I never could live at peace with her; I understood she had been married before, but the witnesses who had informed me of it were dead - she has prostituted herself in my own bed; she had money allowed by gentlemen she formerly lived with; she has had 4s. a week from me, and obtained money from three or four different parishes.</p>

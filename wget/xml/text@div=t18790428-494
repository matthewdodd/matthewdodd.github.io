He contended that there was no conspiracy between Barrett and himself, but that a conspiracy had been laid in another quarter, not very remote from the prosecu. tion. He stated that he had never obtained a shilling or any goods by false pretences; that he had now been in prison for two months, and had had to fight single-handed against the weight and power of the Treasury. Barrett pro<lb></lb>duced a written defence reviewing the evidence, and denying any conspiracy between Toler and himself.</hi>

I believe the words were - the will was his own hand writing, I believed there was no difference, notwithstanding the long time I had known him, or to that effect; I do not exactly remember the reply he made; I think the effect of it was, that it was his hand writing; he said words to that effect.

               <p>Q. Do you know the reason of his going away. - A. No, he went away and came back again to lodge with me after that. He came after the woman, and he lodged with me again about a week, and then he went away, and the woman together.</p>

               <p>Q. For what purpose. - A. I could not tell his reason.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say why you were not to go in the city for this half year. - A. I do not know why.</p>

               <p>Court. What did he talk about. - A. He talked about my gaining a few shillings at Christmas, it would be better to buy a quarter of a hundred and accumulate a little more stock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner know that you had any stock. - A. I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bosanquet. Did he at that time say any thing about receiving any dividend. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he advised you to let this accumulate and buy in another quarter. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it to accumulate. - A. He thought I should get a little at Christmas by Christmas boxing, and a little by my labour.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him. - A. I said it was of no consequence to him when I meant to go in the city; I went in two or three days after that.</p>

I said, Mr. Almond, my master has three hundred pound in the four per cents; I said it innocent enough, I did not expect a small family of children to be wronged out of it. Then he asked me if my name was in it, or only my husband's, I said it was in my husband's own name,

               <p>Q. Do you remember his applying to you on Saturday the 13th of June last. - A. He left a note at my house, I cannot be positive of the day, it was in June; the purport of the note was, that on Tuesday, that must be the 16th I think, there would be some stock to be transferred, and that he, the prisoner, had left the probat at the bank; that was for the purpose of being registered.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I shall first begin by saying, that I am innocent of the charge, and they have not produced the probat against me; there is a piece of paper they produce against me that is a will; I am indicted with publishing; how could I publish that will when it was in Doctor's Commons. If I am convicted I hope your lordship will arrest the judgement, that probat not being brought against me.</p>
               <p>Court. Do not be mistaken; it is not necessary in point of law for them to exhibit this probat against you, it is enough to prove that you forged the will. The will is here; the probat has been proved to be delivered to you, and by that witness the will has been proved to be your hand writing, therefore do not be deceived about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Howell does not say positively that the will is my hand writing; there is a person of the name of White, if he was here I am confident my trial would take a different turn.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the jury, it matters not whether the probat is produced or not; if you believe that this man forged the will for the purpose of making a probat, and for the purpose in reality of getting this man's money in the stocks, there is the fraud; and being committed with that sort of intention, it is a clear forgery in law; every part of the evidence proves to a demonstration, that the prisoner at the bar has forged this will; and in consequence of that, he has sold out the stock of

Somebody or other has forged the will; therefore the hand writing being proved to be the prisoner's at the bar, and the witness tells you that he did got a probat of this will; his selling out the stock, and transfering the stock, are facts that prove every thing as clear as ever I saw any thing in my life, the charge in this indictment. Gentlemen, in this case, as I do in all cases where a man's life is at stake; I have looked every way, if there was any thing that occured to me as a fair groud in his favour to state to you, I would state it to you; but I never saw a case more clear in a court of justice; and it would be but trifling with you to suggest a doubt; if you can find out a doubt you will let me have the benefit of it.</p>

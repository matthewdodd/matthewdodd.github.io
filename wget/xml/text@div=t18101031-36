            . I am a dealer in household furniture. On the 20th of last month the prisoner came to me; he said he had some goods to dispose of. I went with him to No. 6, Off Alley, in the Strand, to look at them, he took me up to the attic story; he shewed me a number of houshold goods that he had to dispose of; I took an inventory of them: a field bedstead, three mahogany boards, some odd pieces, six deal ends, a portable desk, two mahogany pillars and claws, a mahogany two-leaved table, five mahogany chairs, and one arm ditto, a wainscot table with a drawer, eighteen locks and keys, ten table castors, a table latch, and a thousand brass nails; he asked me eleven pounds for them; I asked him if that was the price he meaned to sell them for; he said yes; I told him they were worth more money; if he would make an inventory of them and bring it over to me at one o'clock, I would buy them of him if I could; he came at half past twelve, and said he had made a grand mistake; he asked twenty pounds for them; I offered him nineteen pounds; he went across the court, came back again, and said I should have them for the nineteen pounds.</p>
               <p>Q, Went across what court - A. Old Round Court in the Strand. He left me the key of the room where the goods were deposited, and I was to take them away on the Monday morning, and pay him for them. I suspected they were not come honestly by, I went to Mr. Sheppard, and he found out Mr. Cox; Mr. Cox came to me on the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with Mr. Cox to the room where these goods were deposited - A. I went with Mr. Cox and Lack, an officer of Bow-street, to the place where he had shewn me the goods. We went to apprehend the prisoner. The goods were left in the care of the officer. I was there when he took part of them away after the prisoner was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any feather bed there, mattress and pillows - A. No, there was not, they were at No. 10,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310043"></xptr>Charles-court.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner never sold you them - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the value of the held bedstead - A. Two pound six shillings, the mahogany boards and pieces might be worth about four pound, the deal ends, half a crown each, the portable desk, two pound eight shillings, the tea tray, five shillings, the mahogany pillars and claws, a pound each, the two leafed table, a pound, the five mahogany chairs together with the arm shair, five guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the arm chair worth by itself - A. Thirty-six shillings, the wainscot table and claw five shillings; eighteen locks and keys, and ten claw castors, a guinea and a half, a thousand brass nails, about four shillings and sixpence.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go with the last witness to Off-alley - A. Yes, and Lack the officer; I went with them on the day he was apprehended to the house in Off-alley; Mr. Aker took me up into a garret, and shewed me some furniture that had been offered him for sale; and the whole of the furniture in that room was mine except one article that belonged to the landlady.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of it - A. It was part taken away and part taken to a room in St. Martin's-lane, part of it is here; this desk is part of it; I can swear to it being my property, it cost me forty-eight or forty-nine shillings, this is a reception table, this was in the same room, it cost me I think two guineas, I am sure it did not cost me less than two pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the circumstances that enables you with certainty to say that desk is yours - A. From its general appearance it had been cleaned up by the prisoner while in my employ. I also examined my stock book after the prisoner was apprehended; I looked at my stock and saw it was missing, the reception table is particularly marked, it was rubbed by going in a cart to a gentleman, and the tea-board has my own private mark upon it; the knife tray is mine, the bottom part was made out of a slab, a slab is the outside board, and part of the slab remains. The other things were found at his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. The things that were at Off-alley are the things that we are now enquiring about - When did you go to his lodgings - A. The same afternoon; they were in Charles-court very near Off-alley leading out of the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know it was his lodgings - A. I went to the master that he had lived with before. This pewter jug, a clothes horse, and a hearth-broom, was found there; the jug is worth four shillings, the clothes horse five shillings, and the hearth brush two shillings and sixpence; that is all we brought here, the magistrate did not think it necessary to bring the whole. We found numerous other articles at his lodging in Charles-court, a feather bed, bolster, and pillow; I have no hesitation of the tick being mine, there was no mark on the feather-bed, I had missed the article, a feather pillow, a bolster case, and a mattrass. The bed and mattras were wrapped round with two pieces of wrapper that I could speak to.</p>
               <p>Q. That might be, he might have your wrapper about some other persons bed - A. There were some carpets, there was a mark upon one, a remnant of Kidderminster carpet of five yards, a card table, I can positively speak to, there was my own writing upon it, and a number which I referred to my stock book, it cost me, I believe forty-five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the elbow chair - A. I did; that was in Off-alley; that was part of a set that I had not mark upon that; I found the set defective; I suppose that cost me forty-five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all these taken from your shop - A. They were taken from the former house that I inhabited in <placeName id="t18101031-36-crimeloc222">St. Martin's-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Your dwelling house is in the Haymarket - A. It is now; I went there soon after midsummer.</p>
               <p>Q. That has been your dwelling house during the whole time this man has been in your service - A. It has.</p>
               <p>Q. What is this house in St. Martin's-lane - A. It is a house that I formerly inhabited; I have two people that sleep there, and have ever since I left it; I have used it since that time as a warehouse and workshop.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no intention of returning there, and your family, I presume - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there are two servants sleeping there what was the purpose of the servants sleeping there - A. To guard the house; they are two of my work-women.</p>
               <p>Q. What parish is that in - A. St. Martin's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. You have left this house as a dwelling house entirely - A. I have, and it is used as a warehouse and workshop.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no servants there, but them that work in your trade - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There were other persons as workmen and warehousemen in the warehouse - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he empowered to sell any goods in the warehouse - A. No; my clerk was and my apprentice.</p>
               <p>Q. When goods are sold do you make a point to erase the marks - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Have you any reason to believe that any one article that was found in the garret was sold by any person in authority - A. I am confident not.</p>

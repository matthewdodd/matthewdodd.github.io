On Sunday, the 12th of March, I was at the Black<lb></lb>wall ship-yard—after I had cried two o'clock, I heard a noise in the mast-house—I went in with my light, and sung out twice, "Who is there?" and got no answer—I then heard a voice on the roof—I came out, and got into the East India Dock-road, and met the prisoner with this lead on his shoulder, and the basket in his hand—I told him he was the person I had been looking for, and that he had been on the mast-buildings—he said, "How do you know but that there was somebody else there?"—I said,</p>

On the Sunday morning early, in consequence of a noise, I went to where I found the watchman and the prisoner truggling—I left them, while I ran for Mr. Guy—I then went to assist in taking the prisoner to the top of Robin Hood-lane—he tried to get away, and we called the po<lb></lb>liceman—he said, "I will not go, you shall carry me," and we were obliged to carry him.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you deliver up the note?</p>
               <p>Dawson. The 25th of June to Mr. Jacobs, to get it discounted; I went about three days after to see for him, he promised to come to a certain time, which he did, then he went away and sent me a letter with an engagement that if he did not come, I was to enter his house and take the goods again.</p>
               <p>It is read, in which he engages to return the note in a week or pay the 40 l. or in case of default, then that it should be lawful for him to enter his house in Great Russel Street and take his goods again.</p>

               <p>Q. You gave him the note before he sent you this engagement without any undertaking at all?</p>
               <p>Dawson. Yes; in order to get it discounted, and he not being able to get it discounted sent that engagement.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he deliver the note to you?</p>
               <p>Dawson. On the Wednesday following: I went down to Westminster-hall to see him, I saw him there; he pulled out his pocket book and gave me the note again.</p>

            . About last May, the prisoner told me he had arrested Mr. Grey for Mrs. Jackson, and that he had recovered a 40 l. note, he said it was a very good security.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this note for?</p>
               <p>Allen. I understood it was for Mrs. Jackson; Mrs. Jackson owed me some money upon bond, I had it in my hand; I understood she would give me part if she could, not all; my bond is for 31 l. 10 s. I desired him to write out his bill, and I would pay it; that I would take the note, pay myself, and let Mrs. Jackson have the remainder; he promised to do it; I desired Mrs. Jackson to call upon him to push him on with the bill; Mrs Jackson told me she had called; he wrote me a letter; he had seen Mrs. Jackson, I understood the night before; she desired when we were all three together, that I might have the note. He sent me this letter in a few days. ( 't is read).</p>
               <p>Sir, I have been so extremely busy, that I could not get Mrs. Jackson's account ready; I will however do it this afternoon and you may rely upon seeing me with the account; I have no objection, should you chuse it, to let the poor woman have a few guineas upon the credit of the security till it is paid.</p>

               <p>Allen. He told me so; I had this letter a week or ten days after the conversation I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in May?</p>
               <p>Allen. I think it was some time in May; he prosessed a great deal of love to her, and said he might have had a good deal of money and a gold watch from the other side.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did you see him in May?</p>
               <p>Allen. Only once at a public house; Mrs. Jackson was then present.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand from what Jacobs said then, when he had seen her before?</p>
               <p>Allen. I understood he was very glad to see her; I am not very sure, I do not know but that he saw her the night before; think he did say he had not seen her a good while before, I think he said he was sorry he could not hear from her to have given her some support.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he say it was?</p>
               <p>Allen. He had not heard from her for some time.</p>

               <p>Fleural. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not recollect how the conversation began, or any thing about it?</p>
               <p>Fleural. I suppose it began by Mr. Priddle's asking her if she could write.</p>
               <p>Q. And then she told the story immediately?</p>
               <p>Fleural. Yes, that she could not write, but made her mark.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say she made her mark to?</p>
               <p>Fleural. To the note.</p>
               <p>Q. What note?</p>
               <p>Fleural The note in question.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she say she made her mark to it?</p>
               <p>Fleural. When she paid it away I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a very treacherous memory?</p>
               <p>Fleural. I will not say any thing but what is true.</p>
               <p>Q. Jacobs was then in gaol for forgery?</p>
               <p>Fleural. Yes.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Henry Humphries, who keeps a wine vaults at No. 118, High-street, Borough. I saw the prisoner there on the 2nd of December, about ten o'clock at night—he had two women and a man with him—he called for a quartern of gin—I set it on the counter with a glass—I had to go back to serve another customer with some vinegar—I turned</p>

               <p>and was informed that the prisoner had gone oat—I went out, but did not see him—I met an officer and went after him—we caught him by the Town-ball—we brought him back to the house, with his friends, and he gave me the glass into my hand into the shop—when he got in he put the I measure behind him on the form—I saw him do so—he took it from behind I him—I do not know whether it was in his coat pocket or not, but he took I it from behind his coat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I gave him up the measure and glass, but if I had been a mind to have gone off, I could—my friends had gone off who I were to pay for the liquor, and I went after them—I had no thought of Í stealing the glass or the liquor, and I said so at the time. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. The people went with him—when we brought him back, he said be meant to go and get some more money, but he had got a hundred yards off, and that was not his way home—his friend paid for the liquor after we brought him back.</p>

I saw the prisoner standing at the door of the prosecutor's house—he had the measure in one hand, and the glass in the other—I did not follow him, but passed on to the end of King-street—I waited there, and the prisoner and the other passed me—I returned, towards the shop, and met Jackman, who said someone had carried off a measure and glass—I told him the way they had gone—we started in pursuit of them, and stopped them near the Town-hall—the prisoner denied having any tiling of the kind in his possession—I brought them back, and he delivered up the glass—he took the measure from somewhere behind, and placed it on a seat behind.</p>

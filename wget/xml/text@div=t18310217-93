On the 29th of January, about eight o'clock in the evening, I saw a hand put inside my door, and in a moment the hand and the shoes disappeared - I went to the door, and saw no one between me and the prisoner; I went up to him - he threw the shoes under a window; the officer came up, and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. This was at dark? A. Yes; it is a place of great thoroughfare; I was at the back of my shop - I saw no one passing but the prisoner, when I got to the door - I distinctly saw the shoes fall from his hands; there were three pairs, and a bill attached to them, of my own making - they were caught off a hook, and the remainder of the string was hanging to the hook - I sent out a little girl to see who took the shoes; she stood at the door; she said the prisoner was the person, and I ran up to him.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Did you see the shoes in his possession? A. I saw him throw them under a window, three shops off - I was in my shop, and saw a hand come in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Bluck, who lives in Hampshire-court, Whitechapel-road. I work at tailoring—the prisoner came to work for me on the 26th of June—I did not know her before, but she said she was recommended to me—she came on Thursday, the 27th of June—I went out of the room before eleven o'clock, leaving her up stairs, and my mother-in-law ill in bed down stairs—I have only two rooms—the prisoner called to me about twelve o'clock, to ask if she might go to dinner at half-past twelve o'clock—I told her "Yes," but she went away at twenty minutes after twelve, and did not return—I went up stairs to see if all was correct, when her dinner-hour was over—I missed nothing till twenty minutes after two o'clock, when I looked into the box to see if my husband's clothes were right, and missed the coat from the box under the band-box—I went to the pawnbroker, but could not find it—I gave information to the police—I went in search of her, and found her by the public-house, about twenty minutes after six, very tipsy—I asked her where my husband's coat was—she said she had not got it—I gave her in charge—this is my husband's coat and waistcoat (<hi rend="italic">examining them</hi>)—I made it myself—I put it in the box that morning.</p>

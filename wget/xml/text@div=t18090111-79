            . Q. I am an officer. On the 28th of December I went to Mr. Wright's, in company with Hewit and Martin. On Mr. Wright's premises, there was one anchor lying in the yard, and one in the shop; I took the anchors and Mr. Wright to Shadwell office. The same day I went back to Mr. Wright's, there I found the prisoner, I took him to the office; he was committed for re-examination, and Mr. Wright was admitted as an evidence. I have had the anchors ever since in my possession.</p>

On the Saturday they brought it again into the shop; master told them the price that he would give - eleven shillings and nine pence; he gave them twelve shillings, because he had no small change; it weighed three quarters and eleven pounds; that is the anchor they brought into the shop.</p>

I weighed the anchor, it weighed three quarters and eleven pounds, at three halfpence a pound; it came to eleven shillings and nine pence, old iron price. The other man did not like that price; they went away; the other man came back, the prisoner did not return the second time. That is the anchor that the prisoner brought the first time.</p>

            . I am an anchor smith, I live at Limehouse New Cut, by the river side; the prisoner was one of the men that came on the Friday night before Christmas day; I asked the prisoner and the other man where they got the anchor; one of them said (I do not recollect which) they got it at Bow in the gallions, they picked it up with their barge's anchor; they told me they would not take my price, which was fourteen shillings a hundred, three halfpence a pound; they took the anchor away and returned on the Saturday night, and I gave them the money; this is not the man that received the money from me, the other man received the money.</p>
               <p>Q. The anchor that you bought in this way was found on your premises - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. There was another anchor found, how did you get that - A. I do not know, it was thrown over my pales on the Wednesday morning; I saw it at nine o'clock. This is the anchor that I purchased; it is a temporary anchor, the stocks are both deficient; one is temporary, and the other is broken. That is the one that was thrown over.</p>

On the 29th of September, I went with my brother and brother-in-law, to the Three Crowns, public-house, Mile-end, about nine o'clock at night. I then lived with my brother at Stratford; we staid there till between eleven and twelve o'clock. I had been drinking, but was not intoxicated, but my brother-in-law would carry me on his back - I was not too tipsy to walk, but he said I was. My brother stopped behind. The prisoner asked my brother-in-law if he should take me; he had been in our company drinking. My brother-in-law left me in his possession, and went back to my brother - I did not object to his carrying me; he took me down a lane, and asked for my watch; I said I had none; he took me a little farther, threw me down, put his hand over my month, and took my watch and money. I tried to cry out, but his hand was over my mouth. I asked him the way to Stratford, as I was never in the lane before. I met three men, who took me down the lane into the road. When I asked the prisoner the way, he took me up, and threw me down violently, and said that was the way. He ran one way and I the other. I did not mention what had happened till next day, except to the men who shewed me the way home. I got home about twelve or one o'clock, and told my brother. I have recovered my watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Neither of your brothers are here - A. No; they live at Stratford. It was Stepney-fair time. I have been living with Rolfe since, and not with Ellis, the officer. My brother went to Whitechapel office next day, and Ellis came to our house in the evening. I did not tell the prisoner's attorney that the examination would be at Bow-street. The prisoner's father-in-law returned me my watch last Sunday week, and I received 2 l. before that. I was as sensible as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that the watch was taken from you because you was so beastly drunk you could not take care of it; did not your brother tell you so - A. No.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bow-street. About the 1st of October, I heard of this robbery, and apprehended the prisoner at the Three Tuns, public-house, at Bow, last Thursday night, and said I wanted him for robbing Baxter. He said he was very sorry for what he had done, and blamed his wife for urging him to do it. He said he had pawned the watch. The prosecutor had recovered it before I took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your business lays at Bow-street office - A. No; not particularly. My station is principally in Whitechapel. I take my charges to Lambeth-street, generally.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. We were all in liquor. This lad's brother-in-law took him on his back, then asked me to carry him, which I did, and we both fell down. I know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220042"></xptr>nothing of taking the watch, but found it in my possession next morning.</p>

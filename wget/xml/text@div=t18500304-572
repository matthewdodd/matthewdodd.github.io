                  </hi>. On Monday night, 18th Feb., about seven o'clock, I was on the Bloomfield-road, by the Regent's-canal—I saw the prisoner on the towing-path with a baby in her arms, and two children in her hands—she put the baby into the water, then the second child, then she went in herself, and dragged the other child with her—I cried out, and Boyle and another man came—one of them plunged into the canal, and brought out the prisoner insensible—he then brought out the eldest child, and then the baby—after some time the second child was found—I went with them to the doctor's—the prisoner was still insensible—on being placed at the fire she recovered—two of the children were removed to another doctor's—on going to the work-house with the prisoner, she said I was a foolish woman for giving the alarm, for she wished she and her dear babies were gone to heaven—I asked the reason—she said she led a wretched life with her husband.</p>

On Monday night, 18th Feb., I heard a cry; West ran to me, and I saw four persons floating in the middle of the water—I pulled off my coat and hat and jumped in instantly and rescued the prisoner—I brought her to the shore quite insensible—I handed her to the bank, and returned and brought out the eldest child, handed her to the people on the bank, returned, and found a baby—the water was ten or twelve feet deep—I was swimming all the time, and did not touch the bottom at all—I got out, and then heard that there was another child missing—I rushed into the water, and swam about some time, and at last some object struck my foot, and I rescued the third child, apparently dead.</p>

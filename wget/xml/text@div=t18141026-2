               <p>Q. On the day of her decease, at what time did you come home to dinner - A. About twenty minutes past one, on the 4th of October; I staid at home three quarters of an hour, or an hour, as near as I can guess. When I went away from dinner, I left the deceased there, she was at work when I came out from home; she had the linen about on the tubs in rotation for the woman to come to work the next morning; the linen was in the room below. there is a little bit of a passage from the door of that house to the room where that linen was, and a door in the passage to that room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you work at that time with a man of the name of Clark - A. Yes; he asked for some water; I told him to go to the house to get a mug. I said, I did not care if I had some myself. This might be a quarter after three. I was then by the barn door, at that time, about fifteen yards from the house, as near as I can tell; we were taking out tools out of the barrow into the barn; they belonged to the Company, and were deposited in the barn.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of something that Clark told you, did you go home - A. Yes; when I came home, the door was wide open, the outer door was wide open, and the inside door too. When I went in, I saw the deceased laying down by the side of the copper, growing; I went to take her up; I could not; I ran back, and called for Clark to assist me to get her in a chair; Clark came immediately, and we lifted her into a chair.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was the deceased - 
               <persName id="t18141026-2-person67">A. </persName>
            Her head was cut open entirely; the brain I believe was in the head, but the bones were scattered about the place, and I saw my poker standing up by the side of the copper, bent, and all bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ever speak afterward - A. No; she lived about a quarter of an hour, but never spoke.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Was she a single woman before you lived with her - A. A widow; she went by the name of Buchanan.</p>

            . I am a labourer, in the employ of the Hampstead water work Company. I returned to the barn about three o'clock, with Dobbins; I asked for some water; I told him I was dry; he sent me to his cottage for a mug. I went to Dobbin's cottage; I found the door fast; I spoke twice, I called Mrs. Dobbins; I received no answer; I thought I heard something groan. I went and told Mr. Dobbins so; he said, he would go himself, and get a pot for the water. I stopped at the barn, and put my tools in, while Dobbins went to his cottage.</p>
               <p>Q. How much time might elapse from your getting from the door of the cottage, and his return there - A. It might be ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing any body to have been in Dobbins's cottage and wanted to go away towards London, would he pass in the same direction as Dobbins would come, or go the contrary way - A. The contrary way. After Dobbins went to the cottage, Dobbins called me from the barn to the cottage; he remained at the cottage, hallooing out for me; I went to the cottage immediately. When I got to the cottage, I saw the woman lay by the copper hole; the cottage door was open; Dobbins was in the house, and the woman laying by the copper; she was not quite dead then; she never spoke; her head was very much cut, and bleeding I set the chair, and helped to put her in the chair. A docter was sent for; he sent me to the pond where I had been working, after the other men.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, and tell me whether that is the man that you saw at the cottage - A. That is the man that I saw standing at the post of the gate of the cottage; his back was towards me; he turned as I went by, and I had a view of his face; he had on a fustian jacket, and a black handkerchief round his neck, seeing a stranger made me notice him. I saw him again as soon as he was in custody, at half past three or four o'clock the same day; I am clear he is the same man I saw at the gate at half past two; I was clear of it then; I know it was the same man directly I saw him.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM TYLER. On the 4th of October, I was at work at Mr. Whitehead's, about twenty-five yards, from Dobbins's house. In the middle of the day, I went to Dobbins's cottage, to borrow a wheelbarrow, about three o'clock; I saw the prisoner eating a large piece of bread and butter; he was standing about two feet in the house, by the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a gateway fronting of Milfield-lane - A. Yes, it was in the inner door of the house; I saw him he was eating a large piece of bread and butter. Mrs. Dobbins was in the house; she said, I might have the barrow and welcome. I went away without saying any thing more to any of them; this was about three o'clock. I saw the prisoner again the day he was in custody, about half after six o'clock, I was sure he was the same man that I had seen in Dobbins's house; and that is the man at the bar.</p>

            . I was working with the last witness. I saw the prisoner Sharp, in the road; I observed him coming down the same side of the road where I was working, that is the left hand going from London; I observed him bringing a bundle of linen loose, with the sleeves of the shirts hanging out; he came near us; he crossed down the road; it appeared as if he turned out of the road; on seeing us, he got up a bank, through a gap in a hedge, opposite where we were at work; I thought that was done to avoid our observation. Bremmer first went into the field after him; I was close to Bremmer. The prisoner was kneeling on one knee packing up the linen. Bremmer asked him what he had got there; he replied, he had got some things he had bought of a gypsey man, with a donkey, within a mile of Edgware, he gave nine shillings for them. I told him that was a poor story to tell; he said, that was were he got them from. I told him I thought he must have stolen them some where near the spot; I was sure he had not come honestly by them. He said, he bought them, they might be stolen, or they might not; he bought them of a gypsey man, with a donkey. I pursuaded him to go back to the place from whence he had stolen them, and the people might probably forgive him; he still persisted that he had bought them, that he had not stolen them. We took him down the road; then he said, for God Almighty'-sake, young man, do not bring me to any hurt, or trouble; I bought the things; it would be a sad thing to bring him to any trouble; he said, he was the eldest I think of eleven children. When I talked to him to go back, I offered to go with him to where he took them from; he said, he could not go back, he did not know where they came from: any otherwise then he had bought them of a gypsey.</p>

He took it himself down the town; I took it over the hedge; he was taken to Mr. Iver, of Kentish Town the bundle was given into Mr. Bush's the constable's care.

            . I am a constable. This is the linen that was taken from the prisoner Sharp. I packed them up after the different owners had sworn to them; it is what I received from Bash.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. to Dobbins. The linen found is only a small portion of what was lost; had you taken any account of what was lost - A. I did not then; I did in the course of the day, in the afternoon; I found there had been shirts and handkerchiefs taken away. This shirt is my own; I am sure this shirt was in my house that day, and when I searched for it, it was missing. I had seen the shirt on Monday morning; Tuesday was the day of the murder; and the other linen was gone.</p>

            . I am a servant at Mr. Christopher's. Mrs. Dobbin's washed for me. I delivered my linen to her on the 23rd of September, there were five shirts, two pair of stockings, two pair of socks, one pocket handkerchief, one half silk handkerchief, and a pocket handkerchief, in which it is tied; I had delivered her more linen than in here; all that is there, was left with her.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen Mrs. Dobbins - A. On the Saturday, and on Saturday she gave me part of the linen; I could not take the whole then.</p>

            . I worked for Mrs. Dobbins. I ironed all her linen, and have done it all for twelve<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260006"></xptr>years; every thing here I ironed on the Friday and Saturday previous to her death; on Saturday evening at ten o'clock, I parted from her.</p>
               <p>GEORGIANA COLLINSON. Q. Did you employ Mrs. Dobbins as a washerwoman for any body - A. Yes. I delivered Mr. Longham's things to Mrs. Dobbins on Monday, the 3rd of October. This is Mr. Longham's parcel; this is part of the linen I gave to Mrs. Dobbins on the Monday to be washed; I never had it from her; it is dirty now, in the same state as I delivered them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. to Dobbins. When you left your wife on Tuesday about half after two o'clock, did she complain of having been robbed, and her things to be gone - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. That is the case on the part of the prosecution; I have not called the surgeon.</p>
               <p>COURT. No. When the pieces of the scull bones are found about the place, and the scull beat in, there is no occasion to call the surgeon to say that was the cause of her death.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have nothing to say, only I bought the things.</p>

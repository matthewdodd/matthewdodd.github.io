            - the prisoner was in his service. On the night of the 17th of April, about nine o'clock, he asked me if I had seen any letters - I said No; he asked me if I had washed the plate- I told him I had; he asked if that was all, taking the plate up in his hand; I cannot exactly say what it was - it was but little; there were silver spoons and forks - he left the kitchen, and I heard the street door shut very hard, in a few minutes after; I went into the pantry, in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, to make the prisoner's bed, and found the pantry all in confusion, as if it had been much robbed - I found the cupboard and drawers all thrown wide open, and the plated articles scattered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110004"></xptr>on different shelves in the closet; I saw the prisoner's box pulled out in the pantry with a Scotch plaid thrown carelessly over it - I went from there to the street door; I found the street door open, but the middle door shut too - I came down stairs, and went part of the way to the kitchen, and called Nunn, my fellow servant; we went up, and told Lady Beechey - Mr. Jackson, her son-in-law, came to the house immediately, and Captain Beechey followed him in a few minutes; there is no key-hole outside the street door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is it your duty to wash the plate? A. Yes, and the prisoner's to put it away; he is generally engaged in the pantry: Sir William dines at six o'clock - the plate I washed had been used at dinner; some time before he came and asked for the plate, I went into the pantry to look for dirty plates - he was then in his knife-house, and appeared to be-cleaning knives; he could see me in the pantry - this was after dinner; the things are brought down about seven o'clock - the pantry is open to all the servants, but I believe the prisoner locks it when he goes out; I was in the pantry between seven and eight o'clock - every thing appeared as usual then; it was about nine o'clock when he left the house: all the silver articles were selected from the plated ones - there was no ring or knock at the door after he left; the door shuts with a spring.</p>

             - we and the prisoner were the only servants. On the 17th of April, in consequence of something Memory said, I went into the pantry, and found all the drawers and cupboards open, and his box in the middle of the floor, that was about a quarter-past nine o'clock - the prisoner went out about nine; all the things were strewed about the room - I went and alarmed Lady Beechey; Mr. Jackson and Captain

             came to the house soon after - when Mr. Jackson came into the parlour, he had his watch in his hand, and said it was then twenty minutes past nine o'clock; the prisoner had left the house between nine and that time: I observed a handsome damask table-cloth on the table by the door in the pantry, unfolded, and another in the press: there was no key-hole to the street door - it cannot be opened outside; I saw the doors and windows below stairs after missing the property, they were all fast - it was not possible for any one to come in from below stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had the prisoner lived with Sir William? A. Nearly four months; I know he had a letter to deliver to Mr. Bell, in Oxford-street, and another in Long-acre, and I know he did deliver them; I was at needle-work in the kitchen from the time he went out till the plate was missed - I heard the street door creak about six minutes after the prisoner left; I had heard it shut, as I thought, when he left; the cook went up a minute or two after the door creaked, and found it open - the prisoner was absent an hour and twenty-five minutes - he seemed a little confused when he came in, but not particularly so; I believe every thing taken was silver, except two butterladles.</p>

            . I am son of Sir William Beechey. I received information, and went to my father's house - I got there at twenty-five minutes past nine o'clock; Mr. Jackson, my brother-in-law, got there before me - the house is in Harley-street; I went into the pantry and found the drawers pulled out - the prisoner's box pulled out in the centre of the room, and his clothes were out of it; Mr. Jackson was looking over the cupboard where the plate was kept - we had some plated wine-coolers, I found them in the cupboard; I should not think a person could tell they were plated without examining them - they were at the back of the cupboard; any person looking into the cupboard could not avoid seeing them - I knew pretty well what plate my father had.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any person in the space of six minutes separate the plated articles from the silver? A. I should think not, nor in three times that time; I found a pen-knife in the prisoner's box - I saw the prisoner after he came home; he appeared very much confused when Schofield spoke to him - we took him down to the pantry; he was asked if his clothes were gone - he looked towards his box in the middle of the room, and said they were gone; he was asked if he had any thing else in his box - he said he had five sovereigns, and that they were gone too; the box was about eight or ten feet from him - he could not tell whether the sovereigns were gone or not, without looking into it, and did not examine the box before he said they were gone; he took up a plated fork out of the tray, where he said he had left the plate - he was told to look into the tray where the plate had been left, and asked if it was all gone; he took up the fork without examining the other plated things, and said all the plate was gone - he looked into the tray, took up a fork, put it down again, and said it was all gone; I should not have known the silver from the plated articles without a strict examination: there were some papers, two or three small books, and a pen-knife left in the prisoner's box - he was asked what the sovereigns were in, and he said they were wrapped in a piece of sugar paper; he examined the box after he said they were gone, and was asked where he had left the sovereigns - he described the particular part of the box in which he had left them; after he said they were gone somebody in the room asked how he knew that without examining the box - I do not recollect that he gave any answer, but he went to his box, put aside some of the papers, and said they were gone, but even then he did not examine sufficient to ascertain it, in my opinion; Mr. Jackson showed him a penknife, and asked him how that penknife came on the landing-place or near the door - the prisoner said, "You did not find it there;" Mr. Jackson asked him how he knew that - the prisoner said, "Because you took it out of my box;" Mr. Jackson said, "How do you know that?" he replied, "Because I saw you;" I saw Mr Jackson find the penknife myself - the prisoner was not there then; he was asked if he had shut the street door after him when he left at nine o'clock, and said he did, and tried it; I observed that the pantry windows were shut and barred, and the area door shut - nobody could come in from below stairs: there was not less than 40l. worth of silver articles - the plated articles, to purchase them, were worth 20l.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are your father or Mr. Jackson here? A. No; a silver skewer and wine-strainer were left behind - Lady Beechey missed no plated articles but two butter-ladles; a person could not tell that the wine-coolers were not silver, without examining them.</p>
               <p>Q. All the answers given by the prisoner were to questions put by Mr. Jackson? A. Yes; he found the penknife in the prisoner's box - he did not say he had found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110005"></xptr>it elsewhere, but asked how it came there; that inferred that it had been found up stairs - he is a solicitor: the prisoner, in answer to several questions, was rather impudent, and Mr. Jackson said, "You need not answer unless you like;" he denied all knowledge of the plate - he came home at twenty-five minutes past ten o'clock - it might be an hour before he was taken to the watch-house; his box had evidently been rausacked - it was not turned over on its side; he might see that a greater part of his clothes were gone, but I should think could not see to the bottom of his box - he said the sovereigns were on some of his clothes, but I should think he could not know whether the money was gone; he might have seen that some of his clothes were gone - there might have been a waistcoat or some small things which he could not see: considerable search has been made for the plate, but without success; the pantry window looks into the area, but the shutters were closed and barred: he said he had received the sovereigns from Lady Beechey, which is true.</p>

            's; I concealed myself behind the door, when the prisoner returned, and the moment the door was open, he said to Nunn, who let him in, "For why was the door bolted?" (meaning the street door) she made no answer, unless she spoke very low; I then came forward, and said to her, "Go forward with him, and let him remain with the gentlemen below;" I then watched him down - I particularly remarked that he was very much agitated, and seemed very much alarmed; I had not at that time taken him into custody, or told him I was an officer - Nunn took him down below; I overtook them at the foot of the stairs, and on entering the pantry the prisoner said,"What is the matter?" I said the plate was missing, and he was suspected of taking it, and leaving the street door open when he went out - he said he had shut the door, and tried it after him; I asked where he had been since he went out - he told me I might ask Lady Beechey, for she knew; I then told him I was an officer, it was my duty to ask those questions, and he might do as he pleased about answering - he paused for some moments, and at last said he had been out with three letters, which Lady Beechey had given him, that the clock struck nine as he went through the hall to go out - he then said he had taken one letter to Bell's, the chemist, in Oxford-street, and another to a chemist in Long-acre, and then he came straight home- then he corrected himself, and said he had been with another letter to George-street, Montague-square, and then returned home, and then remarked "It is only half-past ten o'clock," which was correct by Mr. Jackson's watch; I asked him where he had left the plate - he pointed to a large press cupboard behind the door in the pantry, gave me a key from his pocket, and said he had locked it up in that cupboard, which cupboard was then open - I examined the cupboard directly; there was no appearance of its having been forced - he gave me an inventory of the plate, which I produce; the plate and plated articles are distinguished in the inventory; he said the inventory was correct - I asked what part of the cupboard he had left the silver things in, as the cupboard was in such a confused state; he at that time was very much confused, and could give me no answer: I asked him where he had put the spoons he had fetched from the kitchen a short time before he went out - he pointed to a tray where there were about eight plated forks, and said he had put them among them; I then took up the plated forks - he said they were all plated; I said they were so well plated that I should not have known them from silver: I afterwards searched him, in consequence of Sir William Beechey coming in and giving him in charge, and found two sovereigns and two shillings on him; he afterwards stated, in answer to some questions from a gentleman, that he had lost five sovereigns out of his box - he had not at that time examined the box; he was about three yards from it at that time - I could not have discovered what was in the box without examining it - I told him so; he was very much confused, and said, "Oh, it was wrapped up in some sugar-paper," and then he went to look - it was a middling sized box. I examined the plated articles which were left behind - there was a great quantity in the cupboard; I found those articles correct with the inventory, as far as I compared them - I was present next day with the inventory, when Lady Beechey looked over the articles, and they corresponded; he said Lady Beechey paid him the five sovereigns - I asked him if the two sovereigns were part of the five she had paid him; he said, "What is that to you?" and he would not answer another question. I examined the street door - there was no key-hole at which a skeleton-key could be introduced; I examined the back of the house - there was no where that a thief could get in; I asked him particularly if he had fastened the house up before he went out - he said he had fastened up every place: I should think it would take a stranger an hour to open all the drawers, pack up the things, and take them away, from the confused state the pantry was in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long might he be under examination? A. I should think half an hour; Mr. Jackson was alone with him about ten minutes; I did not particularly attend when Lady Beechey compared the plated articles with the inventory. The prisoner was excessively insolent to the gentlemen in the house, and would not answer - he said, "I have no business to answer; I will not answer," and so on; I consider that insolent - I was absent about the house a good deal, and did not hear all he said; I think he said his money was at the bottom of the box, but I cannot say - he said something was at the bottom of his box, I know; I found all he said was true, except saying he had no relations.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If he had shut the door after him, and tried it, was there any possible way to open it without breaking it open? A. None.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did he produce the inventory? A. When I asked him what plate he had under his care, he produced the inventory from a drawer.</p>

             re-examined. I found the cupboard open - I cannot say it was forced open; there was no bolt to it, and a little thing put into the key-hole would have pulled it open - the bolt of the lock was out, as if it had been locked; there are two folding doors, and no bolt to either of them - the first was only pushed too, and the other locked; I pushed the bolt of the lock back myself -I was in the pantry about half an hour before he went out; I saw nothing in confusion then.</p>

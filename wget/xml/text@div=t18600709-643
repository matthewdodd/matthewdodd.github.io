                  </hi>. I am a gunner in the 8th battalion of the Royal Artillery; the depot brigade—on Sunday, 24th June, about half-past 2 in the morning, I met the two prisoners and another marine, in a street near Woolwich—I had not known them before—I went with them towards Plumstead, and past Plumstead church—we went on to a hill near Welling—being Sunday, there was no public-house open—I found a beer-shop open ultimately, and I treated the prisoners to three pots of beer—I left them—I was proceeding back towards Woolwich—Dougherty was the first that overtook me—he reproached me with having left them without having given them notice—I said I had given them notice—presently afterwards, another marine and the prisoner Johnson came up to me—they walked with me some short distance—I proposed to go through the wood, as a nearer road into Plumstead—after I got up into the fence, I saw there was a deep ravine, and I wished to go back by the road; and Johnson said, "No, certainly not; go through"—I went to the bottom of the ravine, and when I got to the opposite side, Dougherty seized me round the neck, with his left hand in front of my throat, and his right hand behind—the other man seized me round my waist, and they then threw me down—I tried to remonstrate with Dougherty—he said that if I spoke a word, I had not one moment's life in my body—they got me down on the ground—they took my watch and searched my pockets—I only had a trifle left, and I had that in my mouth—my watch was in my pocket, and my watch guard was round my neck—it was a silver chain—I had it safe before these men took hold of me—I saw them take it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my my watch and chain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Dougherty.

                  </hi>. I keep a wardrobe-shop at Woolwich—on Sunday, 24th June, about 2 o'clock, Dougherty brought this watch and chain; I asked him what sort of a watch it was—I found that he did not know, and there<lb></lb>fore</p>

On Wednesday the 13th of May, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the shop alone, to match a piece of Norwich crape; another person attended to her; she went out and came in again five minutes afterwards, and I cut her off half a yard of Norwich crape. I shewed her other things; she bargained for a yard of French cambric; I began to cut it off, and I saw her put a whole piece of cambric in her pocket; she stood right opposite to me; I charged her with it - she denied it; I reached over the counter and took it from her pocket, and asked her how she came to do such a thing; she still denied it - we sent for a constable; it was one of the pieces I had been shewing her - it measures five yards and a half, and is worth five guineas - it cost my master that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What did you pay a yard for it - A. Thirteen shillings. I have been eight years in the business.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Your employer paid that, subject to 35 s. per cent, discount - A. There is a discount, but it is not so much as that.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM C - . I am an officer. I was sent for and took the prisoner is charge. The cambric was delivered to me.</p>

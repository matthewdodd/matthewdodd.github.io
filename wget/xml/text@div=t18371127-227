                  </hi>. At present I am in the Queen's Bench.

               <p>on the 25th of February—I went to the coffee-house in Chancery-lane, and directed the prisoner to convey my wife to Grosvenor-street, and then return to me, which he did, and then I told him to put the chariot into some livery-stables for safe custody, and return again to me—he returned in about an hour—he continued in my service till May, when I discharged him—I did not make any inquiry where he had put the chariot, but I sent him twice to see whether it was clean and in proper order—he returned and said it was—I should think the last time was about five weeks previous to his leaving me—I did not know the place to which he had taken it—on the day of his leaving my service I asked him to give me the address of the livery-stable-keeper where the chariot was, that I might write to Messrs. Beaumont and Taylor, telling them where it was, that they might tend for it, as I had no further use for it—the prisoner opened his pocket-book and wrote on a leaf of it, with his pencil, "Mr. Smith, livery-stable-keeper, Albany-street, New-road "—I had no reason to suppose that the chariot had been improperly dealt with—I never gave him any authority, directly or indirectly, to part with it, or pledge it for any sum whatever, I most so<lb></lb>lemnly swear—I owed the prisoner something under 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the hiring of the chariot had not expired while I was in the Bench, and before he left me he brought the imperial cap-case and carriage-box belonging to the chariot it contained my clothes and my wife's, and I have them still—I discovered the chariot had been improperly disposed of soon after the 18th of May by answer to a letter, I directed my solicitor to write to Messrs.

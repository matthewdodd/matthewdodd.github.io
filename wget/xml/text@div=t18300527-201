On the 16th of March I asked the prisoner up to breakfast - he said as Mr. Sutherland was stopping in the house he preferred dieting with him, as he was only going to stop in the house a few days; I had given Sutherland apartments in my house. I asked the prisoner on the 17th for some oil of lavender; he pointed to a drawer in the shop where it was kept - I did not go to ascertain if it was there, as he was out when I first wanted it: we had some conversation about alterations in the shop that afternoon, and he suggested to me the propriety of locking the door between the shop and parlour every night, to prevent the shopmen handling the medicines in the shop. On the 18th a person called for citron ointment - the shopman reported to me that there was none; I told Marshall of it that evening - he said he thought there ought to be some, but where it was he could not tell; he always intimated to me that he was going to leave on the 18th, and as he did not quit, I asked him next morning why he had not, as I had a young man coming that day: he said he should quit directly, and would endeavour to take apartments to remove his things - the 19th was Friday; I had invited Sutherland and a friend of his to dinner that day - they did not dine with me; I had seen Sutherland and the prisoner that morning having private conversation over the counter - Sutherland had no business in my shop then; this excited my suspicion, and about dinner time that day my servant gave me information - the prisoner attempted to remove his trunks off the premises that day (19th) - I told him they should not be removed till Mr. Sutherland came home, and I had an explanation with him about the things I missed: Sutherland came in between eleven and twelve o'clock that night, and I told him what had taken place - the prisoner was not present; about six o'clock in the morning of the 20th, on hearing a noise when in my bed-room, which is over the surgery, I went down, and found the prisoner and Sutherland there together; I had had the prisoner's trunk conveyed into my shop the night before, and know it was there then - the prisoner and Sutherland applied to me for the chest, and observed that there was no property in it belonging to any body but the prisoner; I said I would not give it up - I desired the prisoner to leave the house directly, and Sutherland observed that as I had allowed him to have apartments in the house, he thought it very hard he could not have a friend there: finding I would not give up the trunk they called down Mr. Davision, a friend of theirs, and the three began to threaten me, saying I had no right to detain the trunk, and endeavoured to alarm me; I was determined to keep the trunk till I got advice how to act; they went for their adviser, or some attorney's clerk, or something of that kind.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. By threatening, you mean they threatened legal proceedings? A. Yes; a Mr. Rolph came and had a conversation with the prisoner - Sutherland and Davision, as I suppose, but I did not hear it; Sutherland and the attorney came down to my parlour - the attorney asked on what ground I detained the prisoner's chest; I said on suspicion that some of my property was in it - the prisoner was not present; Rolph had come down stairs from where the prisoner was, and demanded the trunk -I refused to give it up, and immediately after breakfast had a Police-man called in - when Rolph came down to my room there was an acknowledgement that there were drugs in the chest, but the prisoner was not present - the officer came, a smith was sent for, and the trunk opened; I do not think I asked the prisoner for the key - it was opened by Sutherland's direction; the prisoner was not present - in the trunk were found forty-seven different articles, drugs scales, weights, and things; the scales had been mine, and my shopman can prove they were in the shop - I had seen such things in the shop, but I had taken a very casual survey - I cannot say that any of the drugs had been in the shop; there had been citron ointment in a large earthen pot with the name painted on it- that had been removed from the shop, and put into the trunk there was oil of lavender found - I had asked the prisoner for oil of lavender; he pointed to a drawer, and said it was there - I went to the drawer afterwards, and there was none.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever given him or Sutherland leave to take these things? A. During my engaging with Sutherland he said, "In case of my requiring any little medicine for my own personal use, I hope you will let me have it?" I answered if he would point out any thing he wanted he should have it - neither he nor the prisoner had ever asked me for any; the prisoner left the house -I went in search of him several times, but could not find him; I at last had Sutherland taken up and taken to the watch-house, and the prisoner appeared at Bow-street by Sutherland's desire.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. So you took up Sutherland for robbing you? A. Yes, for aiding and assisting in stealing the drugs and things contained in the schedule - he was discharged, and has brought an action against me since; when he was taken up the prisoner was sent for on his behalf - I cannot say whether an officer was sent for him or not; I saw him come into the office - I cannot say whether he came in custody or not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270095"></xptr>- the office was full of officers and Police-men; I did not agree with Sutherland to leave him a portion of the medicine which he was to select, not beyond what I have mentioned that he was to have for his personal use; that is Mr. Sutherland by you - he was to pay the rent up to the 25th of March by agreement, but I took possession on the 19th, and might have put him out of the house that very day - I gave him permission to stay; the prisoner set up business in Greek-street - it may be one hundred and fifty yards from my shop, or it may be more; I never measured it - I should say it was not four hundred yards; it is not nearer than I wish - I do not think he will in the least injure me; I cannot say whether he interferes with me - I do not know his business; I should not care if he lived next door - he may or may not interfere with me; I cannot form an opinion one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Sutherland tell you at the time that he opened the trunks at Marshall's desire? A. I do not recollect it; he desired the locksmith to open it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Marshall himself desire you to open the box in the presence of Mr. Sutherland? A. I do not recollect it; he did not desire that the box should be opened to my recollection - I remember his applying to me for his keys; I had not seen them - he asked for them for the purpose of taking away his box and keys.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he did not say, "Since the keys cannot be got at, I insist on your opening the box?" A. I never heard such words expressed, nor any thing of the kind; I never heard him give any instructions about the box being opened - I told him I had a warrant to take him up; I had not one - it was in consequence of the Police-officer telling me I might have one by applying for it; I cannot now tell who the officer was, I had occasion for so many times - I had not applied for a warrant; Mr. Sutherland was to have dined with me on Friday; I took him up on the Monday - he did not dine with me on Friday; he made a false representation to me - I did not invite Marshall.</p>
               <p>Q. I should not wonder if Marshall was kept in prison ever since this charge of robbery - has he been kept in prison by the Magistrate, in consequence of this charge? A. I understand he has; I know he was in prison - he has been bailed; I have met him in the street - I did not understand your question before; I thought you meant to say if he was taken out of prison - I know he has been in prison; in consequence of receiving a document from his attorney I know he has been bailed, but did not understand your question - but I have since reflected on the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not Marshall brought an action against you? A. That was dropped; he brought an action - my attorney has told me it was stopped; the action was for this trunk and some of the goods in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any proceedings against Marshall till after Sutherland had brought his action? A. My mind was made up in the morning of the 20th; I declared the business must take its course - I cannot say when Sutherland instituted his action; Marshall was taken up after the action was brought - the indictment was found after the action was commenced, and he was not taken till after it was found - Marshall brought his action before I preferred the indictment, but I declared on the morning of the 20th, before Sutherland and Rolph, that the business must take its course; he had set up business against me before I began these proceedings.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was there a written agreement, or was it by your verbal permission that Sutherland was to remain in the house? A. It was a verbal permission, by invitation from me, thought he was to pay the rent to the 25th - that was provided for by what I paid him; I do not know of any person not employing me on account of the prisoner having set up - I should not have interfered to prevent his setting up even next door to me; he did not desire that his box should be opened on the 19th; when I asked him what was in it, he never told me there were drugs in it, but they were Sutherland's; Sutherland desired it should be opened by a smith - it was at that time in my custody, and nobody could get it away; Sutherland and his friend had told me they were going to Godstone on Friday for a few days, and were very sorry they could not dine with me; but I unexpectedly saw Sutherland in my house the same night - Marshall appeared at Bow-street for Sutherland; I then said I should take criminal proceedings against him - and before that; it was on Tuesday the 23rd March, they served writs on me in Easter term, which was after that; I have never seen the declaration - I gave Marshall up his trunk and clothes, and was informed his action was put an end to; I only know that Sutherland sent for the prisoner to the office; after going before the Magistrate, I came here the first Session and filed my bill; I went with the officer to point him out, and saw him taken; and two or three days after I was served with notice of a habeas being applied for, and heard he was bailed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The prisoner was sent for to come to Bow-street when you accused Sutherland? A. He was, and came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then make any charge against him of this kind? A. I threatened to give him into custody; I did not charge him before the Magistrate with taking these things.</p>

               <p>JOHN HINDE. I am patrol of Hackney parish. On the 18th of November, about a quarter past eleven o'clock at night, I met the prisoner, Lowther, he had a green bag on his shoulders; I asked him what he had got, and he said, some pears, that he had brought from the country. I took him to the watch-house, he then said, they were given to him, and then that they came from Walthamstow; after he was locked-up, he said, he had them from Mr. Collins's gardener; he said, that he had met the gardener at the Queen's Head. I took him to Worship-street Police-Office, before Mr. Giffard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. I did not know him before.</p>

            . I have a house at Stamford-hill; the prisoner, Kellaway, was my gardener - He had the care of my tool-house; on the morning of the 19th of October, he asked leave to go out for an hour, which I gave him; I then came to town, and about twelve o'clock the same morning, he came to my office, in Spital-square, and told me, that a countryman of his had called, and he had given him a few pears, and that the patrol had stopped him; he wished me to write to the magistrate, to say, that I did not object to it; he said, he might have given him half a peck. I was sent for to the Police-Office directly after, the prisoner, Lowther, was at the bar, and Kellaway standing by him, the peas were produced, and I knew them to be mine. Kellaway said, he took them from the tool-house. The magistrate committed them both.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. The prisoner, Kellaway, had lived with me two years and a half.</p>

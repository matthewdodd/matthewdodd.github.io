                  </hi>. I am one of the City police—on the evening of 29th September I was on duty in King William-street—I saw the prisoner there, and saw him attempt to pick several gentlemen's pockets—I saw him take hold of one gentleman and abstract a handkerchief from his pocket—he then turned back and ran away—I pursued and caught him—I found this handkerchief upon him—I said to him, "You have some more about you"—he said, "I have not"—I took him to the station, and there found these four other silk handkerchiefs concealed under his dress—the gentleman went away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was walking along with two of these handkerchiefs in my hand, and the policeman came up and asked how many I had, and I said, "Five." He said, "Give them to me." I would not, and he put his hand in my pocket and took out this handkerchief, which he says he saw me take from a gentleman's pocket. I bought the handkerchiefs, and have had them four weeks. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> One of these handkerchiefs was under his guernsey, and the others in different places—I had watched him for about an hour previously, and saw him try several gentlemen's pockets—there was another in his company.</p>

On Tuesday the 5th of February, between five and six, I was standing in the shop, I observed a person go by whom I knew to be the person that had broken the window that day week, I said to a young man standing by, that I knew it to be the person that had broken the window that day week, that I had no doubt but they were then about it. On my standing in the shop, I saw a person in a white apron before the window, and I heard the window crack, and when I got nearer the window, I saw another person standing looking in at the door, whom I had also seen on the Tuesday before breaking the window, I then withdrew behind some packs of goods which were in the shop, and as soon as I saw the men go away I ran over the packs to the window, then I observed a person put a hand through a hole which had been made in the glass, and take a piece of handkerchiefs out, I cannot positively swear to the prisoner's face, it was rather dark, but his person and manner was seemingly the same, I ran out of the door, I saw the prisoner standing two yards from the window, putting something under his coat. After the window had been cut the Tuesday before, we took the precaution to put a string to the handkerchiefs, which string had gone out of the window. I saw a string hanging down under his coat, there were two others standing there with him, I believe there were two, one I am sure of, and seeing the string hang in front of his coat, I went in the front of him, I knew him to be the same man that took them out of the window, I took hold of him by the collar, he then immediately took them from under his coat and threw them on the ground, and asked me what I wanted with him, I told him that I was sure that he had taken the handkerchiefs out of the window, he immediately then pointed to the handkerchiefs on the ground, and desired a person to take them up, and in pointing to the handkerchiefs on the ground, the prisoner sprang from me, and ran away, I pursued him, I collared him again after he had ran about a dozen yards, my next door neighbour came to my help, we brought him in, the constable was then sent for, he was then committed to his custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Will you swear that I did take the handkerchiefs out of the window. - A. Yes, I can from your person.</p>

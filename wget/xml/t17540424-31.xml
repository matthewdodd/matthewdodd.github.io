On the 28th of this month I went to put in an advertisement at Mr. Jenour's, the printer of the Daily Advertiser, near St. Dunstan's Church, Fleet-Street, about half an hour after eight at night. After I had been there I went in at an auction of books in Fleet-Street, and staid there about ten minutes; there I saw the prisoner at the bar, who asked me what it was o'clock, I pulled out my watch and told him it was about half an hour after nine; my watch was then too fast. We came out and walked together, I was going to Lombard-Street to put in letters at the post-office, we there wished each other a good night, and he left me. Having done my business there I went to St. Miles's-Lane to inquire at a coffee-house when the ship Phillis would go to Jamaica, and did not stay there a minute. From thence I came directly homewards, and when I came into <placeName id="t17540424-31-crimeloc154">Fetter-Lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. What did he strike you with?</p>
               <p>Stent. I can't tell what it was. As he struck me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175404240012"></xptr> he spoke, and I understood hi m, You dog, deliver, or such like words. I was surprized, and taking out my watch gave it to him; he took it and ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you before told him where you lived?</p>
               <p>Stent. No; he asked me how far I was going, and I told him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing in his hand when you were walking together ?</p>
               <p>Stent. He had a little switch in his hand, but I do not apprehend the blow was given with that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Stent. I am; after he struck me he stood before me, holding his hands out towards me, as in a posture of defence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Stent. It was very dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any lamps near you ?</p>
               <p>Stent. There were none.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you discern his face ?</p>
               <p>Stent. I could see him standing before me in the same dress he had on when he walked with me before, and I recollected him then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say at the time you walked together, where he was going ?</p>
               <p>Stent. He said, he was going to Fenchurch-street; after he had got my watch he ran away across Fleetstreet: I called out, stop thief, and followed him, but he ran down Mitre Court, and I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q Did you see any watchman ?</p>
               <p>Stent. No; I did not. Then I went home, and it was advertised to this purport: [That whereas a young gentleman in a laced hat was assaulted by a fellow, and robbed of his watch; he, by applying to justice Fielding, might hear of it.] As soon as I heard of it I went to justice Fielding, and he examined me; I was ordered to come again, which I did, and then saw the watch; [the watch produced in court by Mr. Hine, and deposed to by the prosecutor.] The prisoner was at this time in custody; he was brought to the justice's house; I knew him to be the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect the exact time you was robbed ?</p>
               <p>Stent. I believe it was about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said, he would not take upon him to swear to me.</p>
               <p>Stent. At first when he was brought in I said, I would not take upon me to swear directly that he was the person; but when I had heard him speak, and seen him a very litle time, I was positive he was the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he brought in amongst others, or singly ?</p>
               <p>Stent. He was brought in single.</p>
               <p>Q. From the prisoner. How came you to know me when I stood before you in the dark?</p>
               <p>Stent. I knew him to be the same person that had been with me before, by his voice and his cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Were they the same I have on now?</p>
               <p>Stent No; he then had on a sort of a white fustian</p>

               <p>Hine. Nokes said, he had put him off for that night, and ordered him to come again the next morning at eight o'clock. I went along with him in order to apprehend the man; going along we called upon Mr. Norden to take him with us. I said to Nokes, you had better go on, and we will follow you; Nokes described the man and left us: as we were going along we saw Nokes and the prisoner together, going towards the New Church in the Strand; we secured the prisoner, and in searching him there, found this silver watch; he was so terrified that his water came from him. We took him into the Barley-Mow, near justice Fielding's, there he was very uneasy, and desired we would go and sell him or any thing we thought proper, and he would go and sign any thing; justice Fielding not being at home, we carried him before Barwell Smith, there he confessed what sized young man he had robbed of the watch, and that he had a laced hat on. The advertisement was put in the paper according to the description he gave before the justice; he also owned he struck him with a little stick, and that he had seen him before at an auction of books that night, but said nothing of his going with him to the post-office.</p>

            . The first time I saw the prisoner was on the 28th of March; as nigh as I can guess it might be at about a quarter, or half an hour the outside, after seven at night.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Harding. I am a paviour, and work for Mr. Matthews, in Butcherhall-Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prisoner stay at your house that night?</p>
               <p>Harding. He staid there and slept in a chair all night; when I went out to work next morning he was then asleep; that was at six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his business at your house?</p>
               <p>Harding. We were just removed from one room to another; my wife washes for gentlemens servants, and they said they would have a sort of an house-warming; he came in with one we wash for; the prisoner had no business there, but came with the other man who had told him he was going to mother Harding's house, that other man is gone into the country now.</p>
               <p>Here the court ordered the evidence's wife out of court while he was examined.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you to drink?</p>
               <p>Harding. Beer; about twelve or thirteen full-pots.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of you?</p>
               <p>Harding. Five or six.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you drunk or sober when you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Harding. I cannot say I was very sober, for I never went to bed at all; I only sat down upon it; I did not sleep at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How had you your beer ?</p>
               <p>Harding. We drank from about half an hour after seven o'clock; in the first place we had half a gallon of beer, and when that was out we had another, and drank successively 'till near four in the morning; we pour'd it out into full pots.</p>
               <p>Q. Did all the company stay 'till that time?</p>
               <p>Harding. There were three went home; the prisoner and a young woman that was going into a service (and is now at the Red-Cross in Newgate-market, she is a Scotch girl) sat and slept 'till morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the names of the persons?</p>
               <p>Harding. One was a man that lives at the Saracen's-Head, in Friday-street, he went away; the other was a woman, and the third a boy-like person that went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else stay besides the prisoner and the Scotch girl?</p>
               <p>Harding. Yes; there was another man staid.</p>
               <p>Q. How many rooms have you?</p>
               <p>Harding. We have but one; I was all the time in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the young man's name that brought the prisoner to your house?</p>
               <p>Harding. I do not know, he was an utter stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Consider what you say.</p>
               <p>Harding. I am upon my oath, I speak the truth, I came here on purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. How often has your wife washed for that man that brought him?</p>
               <p>Harding. About twice.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the prisoner dressed?</p>
               <p>Harding. He had on a fustian frock, I believe with mohair buttons on it of the same colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what colour was the frock?</p>
               <p>Harding. It was of a lightish brown or drab colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it a cape ?</p>
               <p>Harding. I believe it had.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in that place?</p>
               <p>Harding. I have lived there about three quarters of a year.</p>
               <p>Q. to Stent. What cloaths had the prisoner on when he walked with you?</p>
               <p>Stent. It was a white fustian, a little dirtyish, I think it was trimmed with black.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it a cape?</p>
               <p>Stent. I think it had.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hines. What cloaths had the prisoner on when you took him?</p>
               <p>Hines. He had on a fustian frock that had been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175404240014"></xptr> white, but it was dirtyish, and I believe buttons of the same colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a cape to it?</p>
               <p>Hines. I cannot swear whether there was or not.</p>
               <p>Q to Harding. Was your wife with you all the time?</p>
               <p>Harding. She was, excepting the time she fetched a pot or two of beer</p>
               <p>Q Who fetched the rest of the beer ?</p>
               <p>Harding. No body fetched any but my wife.</p>

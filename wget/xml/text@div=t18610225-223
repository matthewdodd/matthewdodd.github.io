I was on duty, walking on the near side of Her Majesty's carriage, on 5th February, upon the opening of Parliament—in Whitehall I saw the prisoner step out from the crowd, from the left hand side of the way, going towards the Houses of Parliament—he had this envelope (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with a string round it, as I thought, hung</p>

               <p>round his neck, and he had his hand up to his throat—knowing him previously I fell out of the procession and went up to him—I found that his throat was bleeding, and a knife was at his feet in the dust—Flawn, another constable, laid hold of him—I directed him to be sent to the station—he was at the hospital a week or so.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, A</hi> 424). I was on duty on 5th February, as Her Majesty was proceeding to open the Houses of Parliament—I saw the prisoner step out from the crowd as the Royal carriage was passing—he was, as near as I can guess, about four yards from the carriage—he had this envelope in his left hand, suspended from his thumb with a string—he was holding it out in his left hand—he made use of some words which I could not distinctly understand—I thought it was, "Me no protection, me justice"—I did not perceive where his right hand was until I seized hold of him by the shoulders and turned him round—I then saw his right hand sawing at his throat with a knife, cutting across his throat—I knocked it out of his hand immediately—the knife was at his throat at the time I turned him round—he was then bleeding from the throat; he bled more on the way to the station—I took him at once to the King-street station, which was close by—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the knife; I picked it up—on searching him at the station I found this quantity of papers in his coat pocket—this small hone was rolled up in the papers—I afterwards took him to the Westminster Hospital—his wound was dressed at the station-house; he was bleeding at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Charing-cross Hospital—on 5th February the prisoner was brought there—he had a superficial wound of the throat, about two inches in length across the throat—it was such a wound as would have been produced by a knife—it was not a dangerous wound—I apprehended no danger at all from it; it was very superficial indeed—it was not bleeding at the time, it had been dressed previously—it had been bleeding—he remained at the hospital till 11th February—I saw him three or four times a day during that time—I saw nothing at all to lead me to suspect any aberration of mind during the time he was under my care there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Elbow-lane, Shadwell. On Friday evening, 9th July, I and my father were at the Ship and Star—we then came along the street—I saw the prisoner—the first thing I saw of him was, he came and struck me, and said, "You b----r, you are the person I have been looking for"—I struck him again, and we had a round—I fell, and I was not allowed to get up, there were so many round me—the prisoner got up, he ran to my father and knocked him down—he struck him somewhere in the face, on the ear—about that time a brewer's dray passed me while I was lying on the ground—the brewer's man helped me up, and set me against the wall—I recovered myself and went to look after my father—I found him lying in the road bleeding from the back of the head and the ear—he was not sensible—I asked for assistance to get him to a doctor's—he was taken from the doctor's to the London Hospital, I helped to carry him there—I sat up with him three nights—he died on the 13th—he was not sensible the time he was there—I was there with him every night—he endeavoured to speak, but we could not understand him—he knew me, but could not speak to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 44, High-street, Shadwell. On 9th July I saw the two Scotts, the father and son, coming from Gold's Hill—I also saw the prisoner—young Scott went up to the prisoner and struck him—he said, "You had a b----y lot of talk about me last night," and struck him—the prisoner said, "I don't know that I saw you last night"—Scott then "struck him—they had one round, and both fell; the prisoner was under<lb></lb>neath, and Scott on the top—they both got up again, and were in the act of fighting—the father was in the act of striking some person with the canteen; I cannot say who—he did not strike anybody with it—the prisoner then turned round and struck him somewhere about the ear—he knocked him down—he fell on his back in the road on the stone pavement—I think he had a cap on—I walked away and did not see any more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When the prisoner struck the deceased man he had a canteen in his hand, and was in the act of striking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the deceased was standing behind the prisoner, and young Scott in front of the prisoner—the prisoner turned round in the midst of it, and struck the deceased—I swear that the deceased's hand was up in the act of striking some person, but I could not say who—the prisoner and young Scott were the only two that were fighting—the canteen is used to carry their food in—it is a sort of tin dish with a lid over it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital. The deceased was brought there on 9th July, and put under my care—he remained till the 13th, and then died—he was suffering under concussion of the brain, and fracture of the skull—he was insensible when he came—he did not become sensible at all—he spoke in a random manner—the fracture was on the base of the skull, just above the upper jaw—I examined the head after death, and found a bruise on the back part on the right side, and effused blood in different parts, particularly under the right lobe of the brain—a violent blow near the ear would produce those appearances, and a blow on the pavement would produce the fracture—I attribute his death to the blow and the fracture—the fall on the pavement would be more likely to produce the fracture.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What was the cause of death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Concussion of the brain, and effusion of blood—I made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination a day and a half after death—it was my impression when he was brought in that he was intoxicated.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Shadwell Market. On 9th July, I was going to Shadwell High-street—I saw the two Scotts and the prisoner—when I came up, young Scott and the prisoner were both stripped, and in the attitude of fighting; both squaring at each other—the deceased had the canteen, and as the prisoner was going over to Scott, the old man stood with the canteen in his hand, with the intention of striking some person—I should say the prisoner was not more than two yards from both the Scotts, in a triangular manner—he had the canteen up with the intention of making a blow—he did not make a blow—the prisoner struck him, I could not say where—the old man fell, and the prisoner and James Scott came in contact—I could not say what the old man had on his head—he fell backwards, and the back of his head came on the stones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were not there when the deceased's son first came to the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the first I saw was they were in a fighting attitude—when the prisoner struck the deceased I consider he was about two yards from him—I believe he made two steps towards him—the deceased had the canteen in his hand—he turned round from the place where he was, and took the canteen from under his arm and held it up—he moved towards the prisoner.</p>

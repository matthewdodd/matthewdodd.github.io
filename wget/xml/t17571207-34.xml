            . The prisoner and I lodged together. On the 17th of last month she went out of the room, and fasten'd me in. She took away with her my stays, and an apron from off the bed. I found them again at a pawnbroker's, named Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go there?</p>
               <p>E. Honour. Justice Welch ordered me to go to all the pawnbrokers, and enquire for such things. I took her up, and she confessed she stole them.</p>
               <p>Q. What were her words?</p>
               <p>E. Honour. She said she did not know how she came to do it, and that the devil was in her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She lent me the stays and apron to go to market with.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Upon your oath, did you lend her these things?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I did not. I am a poor girl come up from Scarborough, in order to get a service.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give her authority to wear them?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. How many beds are there in the room you lay in?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. There are two, but nobody lay in that other bed that night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were a woman and two children lay in that other bed, but they were beggars.</p>

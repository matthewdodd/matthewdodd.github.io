                  </hi>. My father, John Lloyd, is a livery-stable-keeper and corn-chandler, in Gray's Inn-lane—our yard is in Liquorpond-street—the prisoner was our carman. In consequence of something on Saturday afternoon, the 7th of June, I directed Lawrence, the officer, to be on the look out—he came to me on Sunday morning, about half-past nine o'clock, and told me, in the prisoner's presence, that he had seen the witness, Na<lb></lb>than, come out of the yard with a sack—that he followed him into Liquor pond-street, to see where he went to, and he went into Mrs. Isaacs'shop, that after he had put the oats down in the shop, he told Nathan he wanted to speak to him, and brought him up to our house—Nathan was present, and Lawrence asked him where he got it from—he said, "Mr. Lloyd's"—he asked whether he saw any of Mr. Lloyd's family, me or my mother—he said, "No," he did not—the prisoner said he had served him with a sack of oats, but he had not received the money—Na<lb></lb>than said he had paid him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said so two or three times, and said it was in four half-crowns, he was not certain what other money, two shil<lb></lb>lings, or one shilling and two sixpences, he did not know which—upon that the prisoner was searched in my presence, and four half-crowns, one shilling, and two sixpences, were found on him in a bag by itself, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in another pocket—other money was found in different parts—the prisoner made no remark on its being found, only that he had not received the money—his duty on Sunday morning was to clean the shoes and the horse—he had no authority to sell corn on the Sunday—I have the prin<lb></lb>cipal management of the business—it is not our practice to sell things on a Sunday—he had made no communication to me about having sold these oats—if anybody wanted anything, the prisoner should come and ask the permission of myself or my mother—if it was a regular customer, I should not object to serving them—he had said nothing to me about this sale—we had strictly forbidden him to serve anything on the Sunday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the nephew of Mrs. Isaacs, of No. 27, Liquorpond-street—I went to Mr. Lloyd's yard on Sunday morning, about a quarter to nine o'clock—I saw no one there then—I went again, and saw the prisoner—I said, "Can you let me have a sack of corn?"—he said, "No, I can't now; you must come up in about a quarter of an hour's time, when Mr. Lloyd is up—I went away, and went again—I am not sure whether I went two or three times—the prisoner sold me the corn and two trusses of clover—I got the corn, but he told me to come up to-morrow after the clover—I paid him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., four half-crowns, but I cannot say whether it was one shilling and two sixpences, or two shil<lb></lb>lings—I am certain I paid the money to the prisoner—I paid it before I took the oats on my back—I saw a man up the yard cleaning the horse.—I did not see anybody in the street—after I got home with the oars I was fetched back again to Mr. Lloyd's—the policeman called Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd down—the prisoner was called, and Mrs. Lloyd said to him, "Did you serve this young man with any oats this morning?"—the prisoner said, "Yes, I did, but he has not paid me any money"—I said I had paid him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Mrs. Lloyd asked did I know in what coin I paid him—I said "Yes," and told them—he was then searched, and the money found on him—I had not applied for the oats before that morning.</p>

I paid you 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said, "Are you quite certain you paid my man?"—he said, "Yes, I am"—I asked the prisoner if he really had not received the money—he declared solemnly he had not—Nathan positively said he had paid it—I asked what money he was paid in—Nathan said, four half-crowns,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carrier. On 29th Jan., about a quarter to 7 o'clock in the evening, I was in Newgate-street, with my cart—a boy was driving it, and I was following behind—I saw the prisoner first in the Old Bailey, loitering about, and I saw him following my cart, from two to three yards behind, the whole way down Newgate-street—he took the chain from under the cart behind, and moved a box which had been chained on—he moved it a little way first, found it was loose, and put it on his shoulder; and I took him by the collar—he took it off the cart, and was going to put it on his shoulder—I collared him, and gave him into custody.</p>

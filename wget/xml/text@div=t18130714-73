               <p>Q. Did you at any time lose a horse and cart, and cart harness - A. Yes, on the 22nd of June. It was a mare that was in the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the horse and cart at the time it was stolen - A. Standing in <placeName id="t18130714-73-crimeloc426">Chiswell-street, Moorfields</placeName>

               <p>Q. How long did you stay with your brother - A. Not long. I came out, and perceived that the mare and the cart were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there in the cart - A. Three casks, the apron with a peck of peas in it. They were empty casks that I had brought for yeast. The two casks that I lost were worth about one pound, the cart and harness three pound ten shillings, my apron sixpence, and the peck of peas ten pence. The mare was worth five pound: she was old, but in good condition.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the mare, cart, and harness again - A. Yes, on the next evening I saw the mare and one cask in the cart. I think it was about half past eight. I saw it in Mile-end-road. There were two men in the cart, driving it with reins.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 22nd of June, the day the cart was taken away from Chiswell-street, do you recollect seeing the prisoner that day - A. No, I did not; he was a perfect stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were these two men in the cart, was the prisoner either of them - A. No. My neighbour went on and stopped the cart, in consequence of seeing my cart going along. They said that somebody had it at St. Giles's. These two men brought me back my cart. It was the same mare that had been taken away my apron and peas, and two casks were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of your own knowledge you do not know any thing that leads you to say the prisoner was the man that took it - A. I do not know any thing of the prisoner taking it. It was the same mare.</p>

            . I am an ostler at the Maidenhead inn, George-street, Bloomsbury. The prisoner brought me the mare in on the 22nd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. No, I never saw him before. I am quite sure of his person. The prisoner came in with the mare and the cart between six and seven in the evening; he asked me if I would take the horse in. It was a mare in the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there in the cart - A. One cask in the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any green pease in the cart or any apron - A. No. He asked me if I would take the mare. I took it in, the same as I would any other horse. I took in the mare, and he went away. He never came near it until the next morning about six o'clock. The cart was left in the yard, and the cask. I am sure the same man returned in the morning as he came in on the evening with the mare. He brought another man with him in the morning. In the evening he was by himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid for what the mare had - A. The prisoner that brought her in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner act in all respects as the owner of the mare and the cart - A. Yes; he told me that he had given ten pounds for the mare and cart. He asked me what he had to pay for the mare's keep; I told him eighteen-pence; he paid me; he and the man went out of the yard with the mare and the cart; they both went away together.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you saw him again - A. He came again twice towards the evening; he said he had lost his horse and cart; he came to know whether the other man had brought it back again, and he came again the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard that this had been a stolen horse and cart - A. No; I never heard it until afterwards. He came again the third day to know whether I had seen any thing about the horse and cart.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose the prisoner was a stranger to you - A. Yes; I had never seen him before to my knowledge.</p>

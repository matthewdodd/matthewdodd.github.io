On Friday the 6th of December, in the evening, as I was going round my dye-house to see if every thing was safe, I discovered some silk in a private place under the stairs, with a brick over it. I saw it belonged to a parcel we had in hand t day; it was not dyed, but in a state which we call took-off; the gum was taken out of it, and it was wet, ready to dye. I laid it there again, and the brick on it. The next morning I put a little lad,

I went into the place about nine o'clock in the morning, and staid till six or seven in the evening: then the prisoner came down with a bit of candle, went to the necessary, and after he had been there a minute or two, I saw him stoop down and take the silk from under the stairs, and put it in his breeches. He went up stairs; and then I went up, and told Mr. Pilgrim the foreman, and he told my master.</p>

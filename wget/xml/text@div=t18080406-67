               <p>Q. On the morning of Tuesday the 29th of March, did you and the prisoners get up early to wash. - A. Yes, we got up between two and three o'clock,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060045"></xptr>we made a fire and had a cup of tea; we had agreed to go on the over night, we brought away four bundles; I brought away the things that were given me to wear in the house, and my own things in the same bundle, we had tied them up on the overnight. Shipley locked the door; we all got out of the laundry window and got over the garden wall, and went to Shipley's sister in Sugar loaf court, Whitechapel Shipley's sister was not at home at first; we we found her out and took the bundles into her room; the shirts were taken out of one of the bundles; Vessey picked the initials out and it was washed; Shipley and her sister went out to pawn it, and there was a sheet taken out; they went into the pawnbrokers, I stood at the step of the door while Shipley went in; the handkerchief was taken out of the bundle afterwards.</p>

               <p>Vessey's Defence. I left the Penitentiary on the 29th of March, the day before I had been washing. I mangled this piece of dimity, I had been damping some things; I intended to iron them, on Monday night. In the morning I had a couple of Mrs. Stibb's half handkerchiefs, and in my hurry I put them things in the dimity with my own things and the handkerchief, being damp in the bundle; and as I brought them away so I found them.</p>
               <p>Shipley's Defence. I was very happy in the Penitentiary house, till Law asked me if I would leave the house; and after asking me several times I agreed to go. I took nothing but my own.</p>

I live at 17, Cornwall-road—on Sunday night, 17th May, I went to bed about half-past 11 o'clock—the parlour table was close to the window, and my work-box was all right there when I went to bed—my husband's likeness was at the bottom of the box, wrapped in paper—there was also another likeness in a case—that was taken out of the case and pot on the table, and there was stationery, and a few sheets of writing-paper, and three stamps—the landlady came in the morning and knocked at my door, and I saw the likeness on the table and took it up—this is my paper—I know it by the blots—that was in the work-box—I remember it having been blotted just in the same way—the window was a little way open from the top—I think I opened it, and in the morning it was right wide open from the bottom—it was not wide enough, as I left it, for anybody to get in—in the morning it was open wide enough to admit a person.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 1st of July had you received a note from Mr. Noone - A. I had, about ten o'clock; Mr. Noone lived in the duchess's house. In the course of the day I put the note in my left hand breeches pocket: I had two shillings and a sixpence in that pocket. At one o'clock I went to the prisoner's house to get a pot of beer, I had my child upon my arm, I stood by the side of the bar; when I was served with the beer I paid the prisoner; I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out a sixpence, which was refused; when I took out the sixpence I felt the note then; I put my hand in my pocket and took out a shilling and got the change; went strait home with the beer.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you got home did you discover that you had lost the note - A. About half an hour after I put my hand in my pocket, I found I had lost my note; I went back to the public house, I saw the prisoner and his wife; I said to them have you picked up a ten pound bank of England note, they said they had not seen any thing of it; I said I was afraid I had pulled it out of my pocket as I took the money out for the beer, as I had been to nowhere else; I said I will thank you to be doubly cautious for whom you change a ten pound note, and I will bring you the number tomorrow. On the 2nd of July I took the number before one o'clock, I gave him the number in writing, he took and chalked it up in the bar, I saw he put up the right number; I said now Mr. Davidson I will have this note advertised and offer a guinea reward for it, to be brought to his house, and I desired him to pay the guinea, which he said he would; I applied to him every day for a fortnight, to know if he heard any thing about it. I had notice from the bank; I had been to the bank for them to stop it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the number, did it tally with the number you gave to the prisoner - A. It did; I went to his house and produced the note that I got from the bank; the prisoner examined it, and said true enough, that is the number of the note you gave me; I said it was very odd that I had traced the note back to the very place that I lost it; he said he did not know how he came by it, he had taken it, but he did not know how he had taken it. I thought it a hard case that he should not know from whom he had taken the note, as he had the number chalked up in his bar. On the Sunday following I asked him whether he had found out who he took the note of, he said he did not know. On the Wednesday following of the Sunday, I said have you heard any thing more concerning of my note, meaning who he took it of; he said no; his wife said you should proceed farther in it; I said I will; - in consequence of that I went to Marlborough street, and an examination took place.</p>

            . This is the ten pound note that I gave to the prosecutor, I know it by the number and the date; I gave him this note between nine and ten o'clock on the 1st of July.</p>
               <p>COURT. Had you taken the number and the date - A. I had not; when I looked at it I saw the number and the date; I told him I knew the number, but I would tell him the number and the date tomorrow; I was very busy at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the number - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You ought to have given it him that day - A. I was busy; I ought; I went to the bankers the next day to get the date.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not that day to give him the number - A. I had no reason.</p>
               <p>Q. I can guess the reason - you was not perfect in the number - A. I was not certainly perfect.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you should not have spoken so positively - you learned the number and the date from the bankers - A. Yes, from Messrs. Biddulph and Cox.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not depend upon it by your own recollection<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140061"></xptr>- A. I could not.</p>

On the 28th. of July, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner come down the area steps and open the kitchen door. I heard the spoons rattle in the scullery. I saw the prisoner shut the door. I immediately went to look for the spoons I saw they were gone. I followed the prisoner and brought him back into the kitchen. I searched him, and found the spoons in his waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How does that kitchen door open - A. With a bolt; it was only shut; it was not bolted, it was latched.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you tried the door yourself in the course of the morning to see whether it was latched or not - A. I had just shut the door about ten minutes before that I tried the door, and the latch had caught.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you continued in the kitchen from the time you shut the door to the time that the prisoner came - A. No; there was nobody in the kitchen; the three maids were in the washhouse. I was sufficiently near to see that none of them had been to the door. The prisoner could not come in without the latch being lifted up by him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot maker of Cambridge-road. On the morning of 10th Oct., about 2 o'clock, I was disturbed by a noise like something filling—I listened a little while, and then called to my lodgers to know if they were moving, but received no answer—in about ten minutes there was a violent knocking by a policeman—I got up, and the prisoner was in custody—I found my things disturbed, and missed a pair of boots and a shoe, which I had seen safe at half past 11 o'clock on the previous night—the shoes were half a yard from the fan light—a person could reach them by breaking the fan light.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). On 10th Oct. I was on duty in the neighbourhood of the Cambridge-road, and saw the prisoner loitering outside Mr. Shepard's shop, about 2 o'clock—I watched, and saw him get on the sill of the window shutter, and reach his arm over the fan light—I then heard the breaking of glass—he went away for about two minutes, then got up again and reached his hand up—the goods were within reach of his arm—I went up to him and said, "I want you," and he threw the articles away and said, "It is only an old slipper I have just found, I do not want it"—another constable found the boots.</p>

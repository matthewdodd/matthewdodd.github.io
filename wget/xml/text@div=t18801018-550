                  </hi>. I reside at 30, Queen's Road, Upton Park, Essex—on 22nd September last I changed a cheque at the Union Bank, Princes Street, and received for it three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes—I paid one of them away on the following Saturday to a wine merchant in Aldgate—on 29th September, soon after 10 a.m., I went to the post-office receiving house at Upton Park, which is kept by Dr. Budgett—the prisoner was not there at first, he came in soon after—I said to him "I wish to send 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Deal, I think I shall require two post-office orders, one for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the other for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner left the shop for a few minutes and then returned and said "You are right, Mrs. Hankin, will you have the kindness to sit down a few minutes? Mr. Ansell will be in"—Mr. Ansell is the station-master—he did not come, and after waiting a short time the prisoner took a small box from a shelf and said "We often send small boxes of this kind in different directions, and they always arrive safely; you have only to pay 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for registration"—at first I rather objected, but he reassured me, he said there would not be the slightest difficulty, that boxes were often sent, and always arrived safely so long as they were registered—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for registration—I then put the two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes on the counter, with a sovereign, a half-sovereign, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—the notes were two of those I had received. from the Union Bank—I wrote down on a piece of paper my address and that of Mr. Lush, Alfred College, Deal, to whom they were to be sent—the prisoner then said "I will take the numbers of the notes"—I replied "If you will give me a pen I will do it"—however, he looked at the notes and wrote something down, which I concluded was the numbers of the notes—he then took up the notes and folded them both into this small box, he then put the sovereign and half-sovereign in, and was pro<lb></lb>ceeding to add the small change, when two persons came in in a great hurry and wanted something immediately—the prisoner went to the bottles and seemed to be in a great hurry to mix something for them—it is a chemist's shop—he said "Mrs. Hankin, will you oblige me by calling in this evening for the receipt?"—I said I would, and left—I called again in the evening; I found the prisoner was very busy in the shop—he looked up and said "It is all right, Mrs. Hankin, will you oblige by stepping in in the morning?"—he did not ask me for any money for postage—I sent a letter of advice to Mr. Lush the same day, but did not post it at that office—next morning, Thursday, I was not</p>

               <p>able to go to the post-office—I went in the evening, the prisoner was then very busy counting out money, and there were several people in the shop when he saw me he looked up anxiously and said "Oh, Mrs. Hankin, I am very sorry, will you oblige by coming in the morning for the receipt—I did not like the delay, but I had no objection, and left, rather un willingly—I called again next morning, 1st October, saw the prisoner, and asked for the receipt—he said "I am very sorry, but to tell yon the truth, I forgot to register the box"—I said "You forgot I that is not business please to give me a receipt, you know I paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a registration"—he said "I will give you back the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I refused to accept it, and demanded a receipt—he laid he could not give me a regular receipt, but he would give me a receipt, so he accordingly gave me this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was not in the state it is now when he gave it me, there was no signature to it, nor was the amount of the money written on it—I wrote the amount, 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and then demanded his signature—there was no stamp on it, it was affixed afterwards—the signature now is "E.H. Billing, pro G. Williams," but Mr. Williams was not there, he had left; he was in the same position as the prisoner, an assistant to Dr. Budgett—before I left the shop I asked the prisoner to give me the numbers of the notes he had written down—he said he had lost the paper—I noticed on the counter the sheet of paper on which my address and that of Mr. Lush was written, and I lifted it, thinking he had perhaps put the numbers on the other side, but he put his hand On it and said u The numbers are not there"—I said "It is of no importance, I can get the numbers at my bankers"—I then left, and never saw him afterwards—I went straight to the telegraph-office at Plaistow and telegraphed to Mr. Lush, and received a reply—I then went to Dr. Budgett the same day and repre<lb></lb>sented the case to him, and next day I went to the Bank and stopped the notes, and then went to St. Martin's-le-Grand and represented the case to the secretary—the prisoner did not say to me "As you have not the numbers of the notes, for safety I will change them," nor did I say to him "You can do as you wish"—I did not desire him to change the notes, for the evident reason, had he changed them the box would not have contained the money, it was too small; besides, it would have made the box heavier.</p>

                  </hi>. I am travelling clerk attached to the miss<lb></lb>ing letter branch of the General Poet Office—on 11th October I was in the Waterloo Road shortly before 10, and saw the prisoner there—I was on the look-out for him—I stopped him and said, "Mr. Billing, I believe "—he said "Yes"—I was accompanied by Police-constable Lord—I said, "We belong to the Post-office; I wish you to accompany us there with reference to a registered letter irregularity which occurred at the Upton Park receiving-house on the 29th of last month"—he was put into a cab and taken to the General Post Office, and saw him in a private room there—I said, "Mrs. Hankin, of Queen's Road, Upton Park, has stated that she came to your office on the 29th and wished to take out two money orders for 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and you advised her to send the money in a registered letter"—he said, "Yes, I did; I enclosed the money in a small box, packed it up with brown paper, and addressed it to J. Lush, Sty, Alfred College, Deal, but I omitted to register it"—I said, "Did you enclose the two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes in the box which Mrs. Hankin gave you?"—he said, "No; I said to Mrs. Hankin, 'As you have not the numbers of the notes, for safety I had better change them;' Mrs. Hankin replied, 'Yon can do as you please,' or something to that effect. However, it was by her desire I changed them. I afterwards went out and changed one at Kemp's, the oilman, and the other at Folkard's, the draper's, and came back and made up the box, put the money in the box, and sent it my with the 12.30 collection"—I said, "Do you wish me to believe Rich an incredible statement, for you had the numbers of the notes before you, and could have taken them at the time?"—he replied, "Well, I must confess it don't appear feasible, but what I have stated about dunging the notes is quite correct"—I said, "I shall have to make one further inquiry, and shall charge you with stealing the money, the property of Mrs. Hankin"—he said, "Don't do that; I know what the law is as well as you do; I know I am liable, for I took the money, and what I shall have to do will be to make it good, of course"—I had this note with me, and I put it down before him and said, "This is one of the notes which Mrs. Hankin gave you"—he said, "Yes, I think it is by the number, but it wan not like that when I changed it," pointing to the cancelling—I said, "I shall charge you with stealing the money, consisting of two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and the rest in cash, the property of Mrs. Hankin—he said, "Very well"—he said he had sent it away without being registered, and he had endeavoured to trace it.</p>

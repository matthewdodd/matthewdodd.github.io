                  </hi>. I belong to the Police Office, Hatton-garden. On the 15th of March I was in Church-street, St. Giles's in company with Hall, Reynolds, and Palmer, all belonging to the police—I went to No. 8, Church-street, to the one pair of stairs room, and found the door fastened—I was followed by Reynolds—we endeavoured to force the door, and after some difficulty did so—I saw the female prisoner standing in the middle of the room, and the male prisoner on the right hand side, near the fire-place, in his shirt sleeves—they were tucked up—I had heard the woman call, out, before I got in, "What do you want?" or something of the sort—previous to seeing the man, I heard something rattle like money—it was just about the time that I forced the door open—the prisoner hands were very black—I took him away from the past where he stood, near the fire-place—the fire was very brisk indeed—I proceeded after that, to search the fire-place, and observed a iron spoon in the fire, red hot—on a chair very near the fire-place I found a metal spoon, with the end of it partly melted off—on the table I found a pair of scissors, and also a small piece of mental, which had been melted—on the right hand hob of then hob of the fire<lb></lb>place I found two shilling, and on the left hand bon one shilling—they were quite warm at the time I took them off the hob—the two are dated 1817, the other 1820—I afterwards proceeded to search the fire-place more particularly, and up the chimney, on a ledge, on the right hand side, as far as I could reach with my arm, I found a mould for shillings, which I handed over to Hall, to take care of—I searched farther, and on the same ledge of the chimney I found another mould, for half-crowns, which I produce—they are made of plaster-of-Paris.</p>

I found some pieces of plaster of Paris mould I picked them up—they were quite warm at the time—in</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to his Majesty's Mint, and have been so nearly twenty years. I have examined the articles produced—there are three plaster-of-Paris mould; one for the casting of half-crowns one for a shilling, and one for a sixpences—they all appear to have been used for the purpose of casting coin—the date of the sixpenny-mould is 1816—there are two counterfeit sixpences produced which correspond with that mould, and, I believe, have been cast in it—they correspond in all respects with the mould—there are one or two trifling accidental marks on the coin, of which I find corresponding ones on the mould, which enables me to be<lb></lb>lieve they have been cast in the mould—here is a mould for casting shil<lb></lb>lings, the impression of which bears the date of 1820; and I find, among twelve conterfeit shillings produced, eight of them correspond with that mould in all respects—the half-crown mould has been used, but there is no coin of that date—the coin is made of Britannia metal, which is a mixture of tin and antimony; and the spoon is of the same metal—here is an iron spoon, which appears to have been on the fire, and to have some white me<lb></lb>tal in it similar to the spoon—it is possible it might have been used for melting the white metal—this plaster-of-Paris is the material of which the mould are made—the scissors night be used to clip the superfluous metal.</p>

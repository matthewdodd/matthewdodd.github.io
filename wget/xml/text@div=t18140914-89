I lost the shoes on the 28th of July; the prisoner and another woman came into the shop. I fitted the other woman with a pair of shoes. The prisoner kept taking the shoes out of the window; she took one shoe out of the window, the other was tacked to it. The prisoner went out of the shop with the shoes; I went after her, and lost sight of her. The publican sent to our house, and said, a woman had left a pair of shoes in his house, with our name in them. At last, I saw the prisoner; I told her she had stolen the shoes, and had her taken up.</p>
               <p>CATHERINE REEVES. The prisoner came into Mr. Moore's public-house; she asked leave to go into the yard; she said, I shall leave a pair of shoes with you until I come back, but do not tell your master; I said, why not; she said, she expected some money from a gentleman, and if he saw her with the shoes, he would not pay her. I took the shoes to my master; he sent to the prosecutrix. These are the shoes.</p>

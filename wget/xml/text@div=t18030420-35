             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.Are you the daughter of Salmon Handfield? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you receive any money from your father on the 2d of April? - A. Yes, I received twenty pounds from my father; he took an account of it, but I did not; I put it in a bag, carried it up stairs, and locked it in a little drawer inside the bureau in the one-pair-of-stairs room.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you do with the keys? - A. The keys are on a bunch; I put the bunch in the top drawer in the bureau.</p>
               <p>Q.When you had so done, what did you do with the room door? - A. I locked the room door, and put the key of that room door upon my bedroom table, which joins the other room; they are both backwards.</p>
               <p>Q.How near to where the prisoner's room is? - A.She lodged in the two-pair-of-stairs.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see her about the time you went into that room? - A.No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you see the key of the room door again? - A. I came down stairs again.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you receive any more money from your father on the Monday? - A. Yes, about five in the afternoon, 3l. 10s. five seven-shilling pieces, and thirty five shillings, all in shillings: I took them up stairs, and put them in the same bag with the others; I locked the bureau, locked the door, and put the key upon the other room table.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon afterwards did you discover any thing respecting this property being missing? - A. About a quarter of an hour; my sister called me up stairs; I went up, and observed both bed-room doors open, and the bureau open, and the drawers in which the money was open.</p>
               <p>Q.Having been all locked when you left them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And the money gone? - A. Yes, and the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do then? - A. I desired my sister to stay there, and I setched my father up; I then went up into Mrs. Hunt's room, and I asked her for the money; she said, what money, she knew nothing of it, I was joking; I told her I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200045"></xptr>was not joking; it might be a very good joke for her, but it was a very bad one for me. My father then went up, and asked her, and said, you had better give it me, for if you do not, I will send for, Mr. Armstrong. Mr. Armstrong was sent for, and came almost immediately; he came up into the two-pair-of-stairs; we were searching about the room in different places, and saw the money lie upon the hearth in the bag, and Mrs. Hunt was sitting close by it upon a stool; the bag had been untied; she was sitting on a stool blowing the fire, and she sat as it might be by the side of it.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it in the ashes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else there? - A. Yes; I found the three keys belonging to the double chest of drawers which were in my bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you find them? - A. Lying by the side of the bag.</p>
               <p>Q.Should you know the notes again? - A. Yes; there is my hand-writing upon one of them, of the name of Jones; I put it on when I changed it for a person of that name. Two of the three keys that I found will unlock the bureau; Mr. Armstrong tried them in my presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood. Q.You had other lodgers in the house? - A.There are single men lodgers in the house.</p>
               <p>Q.How many? - A. I cannot exactly say how many there were then; I believe two or three.</p>
               <p>Q.Had not the prisoner and you been out together just before? - A. No, we had been out at nine o'clock in the morning, and this was five in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.Who are the men that lodge in your house? - A.Working men.</p>
               <p>Q.What time do they go out? - A.Four or five o'clock in the morning, and come home at nine at night; they went out in the morning, and had never been home till after this happened.</p>

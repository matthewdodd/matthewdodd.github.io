                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 8). On 29th Aug., about 8 o'clock in the afternoon I was on duty at London Bridge wharf, and saw Mrs. Kircher come from a steam boat on to a lighter, carrying a bam) box in her hand—I saw the prisoner Bushie put his hand into her pocket—I saw the other prisoners—I saw them all three standing talking together for two or three minutes before, and when Bushie left to go to the lady, one on each side closed on to Bushie so as to take off the attention of any one behind—I was in front—I saw Bushie put his left hand into the prosecutrix's dress, and take it out again—I laid hold of his hand, and asked him what be had there—he made no reply—I opened his hand, and took this purse out of it—I then told the prosecutrix—I had first seen the prisoners about five minutes before, when I was on the Hull boat—Mrs. Kircher came from a Gravesend boat, the passengers from that boat had to pass over the Hull boat—the lighter was outside the Hull boat, and the Gravesend passengers had to cross over the lighter—when I first saw Bushie and Nicholls, they went across the Hull boat on to the lighter—I saw Nicholls go and feel a lady's dress in front, the lady was with a gentleman—Nicholls left, and then Bushie went and felt her—I saw them leave in a hurried manner, and go to Pickett—that was the first time I saw Pickett—he was about two paces from them, on the same lighter—I then saw them all return, Bushie and Nicholls went and stood in front of the lady and gentleman with their hands behind them, Pickett went before the lady and gentleman pressing before some more passengers that were waiting to go on board the boat—there were about fifteen or sixteen persons on the lighter at that time, or there might have been twenty—the lady and gentleman moved away in consequence of being pressed, and then the prisoners went to the prosecutrix in the way I have described—when I took Bushie into custody, Pickett went on one side of the lighter and Nicholls the other, but I pushed them into the gangway, they could not get off—I knew them all.</p>

               <p>not with the rest of the crowd, away from the crowd—I swear they were talking together, because I saw the motion of their mouths—I have been a detective officer twelve years—I am not paid anything additional for these cases—I have had a great many of these sort of cases.</p>

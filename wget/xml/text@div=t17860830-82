               <p>I am a labourer belonging to the India Company; I was ordered to attend by one Mr. Barley, to watch the warehouse where the chest of tea was placed: about a quarter before three, the prisoner came whistling in, he passed me twice, the third time he came to the chest, it was piled three high, there was another stood by the side of it, the top chest was open, and the third time he put his hand and took out some tea; the chest that stood by the side he put his foot on, to reach the tea from the upper chest, he put it in his coat pocket, loose as he took it, after he had done that he put the lid down again very carefully, and walked about three yards, and then I collared him, and he said, for God Almighty's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300125"></xptr> sake, let me go! I shall lose my bread: and so shall I, says I, if I let you go: I took him down to the compting-house, and there he was searched by Mr. Howell, and the tea taken from him, it was hyson tea, I saw him with his hand to his pocket, to throw out the tea, and I prevented him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. Mr. Barker, was you here last session? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you know the prisoner? - I did not at that time.</p>
               <p>Now, Mr. Barker, did not your rubber down prevent your going out Crutched-friars way? - No, I never was refused going out that way.</p>

               <p>The first time the prisoner came into the warehouse, he came in whistling? - He did.</p>
               <p>Did he see you? - No, he did not, nor would you neither, if you had been there.</p>
               <p>Where was you hid? - I was behind six chests.</p>
               <p>What was the value of this great quantity of tea? - Two shillings, weighing six ounces and a half.</p>
               <p>You are quite sure it was worth two shillings? - It was so valued.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know the prisoner's person? - I did not know him, but he told me he was an excise locker, and that it would be his ruin if I stopped him.</p>
               <p>You say he had nothing to do with you? - He had not; we must have leave from the elders, and the prisoner is a <rs id="t17860830-82-deflabel411" type="occupation">rubber down</rs>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You say, you lockers have nothing to do with the loose teas, but to acquaint the elders? - We have not.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, you say he was a young locker, in course he had a right to take that tea to the elders? - He might do so, but Mr. Barker stopped him upon the spot.</p>

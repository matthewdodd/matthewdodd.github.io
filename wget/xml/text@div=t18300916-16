A "Staymakers' Benefit Society" was formed and held at my house; the prisoner was a member, and he lodged at my house for two months before the 10th of September - the society's cash-box was kept in the club-room, and was left there on the Thursday evening, and about a quarter past five o'clock next morning the Police alarmed me; I looked out of window, and saw the prisoner standing by the Policeman - a coach was there; the Policeman said, "Here is a man with a box and great coat," and that he said he was a lodger of mine - I asked who it was; the prisoner looked up and said, "It is Windsor," which is a nick-name he went by, as he had resided there - I said it was all right, and shut the window down, but on recollection I was not certain whether he had brought a box to the house; I immediately went to the club-room and missed the society's box - I dressed, went down, and gave notice to the Police; I saw the box again the same morning, about seven o'clock, at St. James' watch-house - it was then broken open; it was under my care.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The club was held at your house? A.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had the prisoner been a member? A. Altogether about fifteen years, and contributed to the funds during that time; he has made claims which the club have resisted - he was excluded for breaking the articles; he was on full pay and had no right to be out of his house, but two men went down to Windsor, and found him, after nine o'clock on a rainy night, shutting up his shop - he contributed 4s. 6d. quarterly.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is it a rule that a member to receive full pay should be so sick as to be unable to leave the house? A. Yes, except into the yard.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 10th of September, at five o'clock in the morning, I was near the North Pole with my serjeant, and saw the prisoner coming from there with a coat and box; I alarmed the landlord, who said it was all right - I let him go into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160020"></xptr>coach and go away; in about half an hour, in consequence of information, I went to No. 36, Brill-row, Somers'-town, and saw the same coach stopping there, and from what I learned from a lady and gentleman there, I went into the kitchen, and found the box which I had seen him with, broken open, and one of the smaller ones in it also broken open - I went and found the prisoner the same night, about eight o'clock, in the same row; he was pointed cut to me by one of the society - he told me to take him and do as I liked with him, for he knew he had done wrong; he said he did not expect to get away with the box, for he thought Hill would have given him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He never denied taking it? A. Never, he said he had been to Mr. Harmer's to inquire if he had acted legally in taking it, and found he had done wrong; there was 25l. 18s. 11d. in the box which was not broken open - any body shaking it could tell there was money in it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARRSON. Q. Did he state he had consulted Mr. Harmer before he did it? A. No - he took it and then went to consult Mr. Harmer; here is the box - I found a poker laying by the side of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his defence stated, that he had been expelled from the society for not leaving his employment, but was reinstated - that he was afterwards on the books on account of illness, and had been expelled for putting up his shutters, his wife being unable to do it; he had produced to the society a certificate from his surgeon, but they refused to attend to it, which irritated him, and he took the box, not from dishonest motives, but that they should reinstate him.</p>

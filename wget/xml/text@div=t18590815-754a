                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Horne and Co., of Haydon-square—the prisoner was their wool foreman—his duty was to receive orders for wool and to superintend the calculations, and pay such charge as might be asked by the warehousemen—if a bale of wool was ordered in Lancashire an order would be sent to Chaplin and Horne, at Haydon-square, or it might be sent to the prisoner as the superintendent of the wool department, who would enter it in an order-book kept for that purpose—we must have a delivery order addressed to the warehouseman where the wool is kept—if a bale of wool is in the possession of Gooch and Cozens, the first step is for us to receive an order for its delivery, which is given by the owner or the broker—that would be entered in the order-book at Haydon-square—or one of the other depots—orders are frequently put into the prisoner's hands, and his duty then was to make an entry in the order-book—Gooch and Cozens had a separate order-book—after the order is entered in the order-book the next step is to lodge it with the warehouseman of the wool, say Gooch and Cozens, who then make arrangements for the collection; the wool foreman directs a van to call at the different warehouses for the goods, and they are brought to Haydon-square—before they are put in the van, and before the order is lodged, a payment is made, called <hi rend="italic">the paid on,</hi> which is a charge of 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per bale for marking by the warehouse keeper, or for warehousing, as the case may be—if it has been over the prescribed time another charge is made for warehousing—the charge is made by Gooch and Cozens to Chaplin and Horne—it would be paid by the defendant at the time, or at periodical times by the foreman of the wool, and occasionally by the collector of the bales, and he would receive the money from the foreman; the party that pays it taking a receipt—Chaplin and Home get their money back thus; the bale of wool on its arrival at Haydon-square is accompanied by what is termed the cart note, which is given by the warehouse keeper, and contains the particulars of the wool delivered; so the carman and the cart note being presented to the defendant he registers the number of bales in a book called the number or receipt book, which entry contains the consecutive numbers</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150043"></xptr>
               <p>of the wool bills—each wool bill contains only the wool that is brought in by the separate loads, and after it is registered in the book the defendant makes out the wool bill, giving the sender, the consignee, and the residence, the number of articles, with their marks, and the amount paid on; he then hands it to the invoicer, who makes out an invoice to the station where the goods are consigned to, and the corresponding particulars, with the amount paid on, are thereupon placed, and with that invoice the goods are forwarded from Haydon-square, which finishes the transaction and finishes the duties of the foreman as far as the transit of that single bale is concerned—he has nothing to do with the carriage to be paid afterwards; but before the invoice leaves Haydon-square it is compared with the wool bill by clerks termed referencers; the invoice and wool bill are brought in together, given to the referencer, and he compares them before the goods are sent away—it is his duty to see that they correspond in every particular—when the wool bills are cleared they are checked by the referencers and given into the hands of a boy, who pastes them into a skeleton book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), a reference is made on the wool bill and the invoice—at the termination of each wool sale it is the foreman's duty to make up his account by bringing each bill forward to the last bill of the day, making a daily total—the skeleton book is accessible to the defendant; the place for it is in the down or outward office, and he uses it for reference in case there is any enquiry about wool from the country—he makes demands for payment from that book—he gets back the 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a bale by means of it—he makes out an account of his advances on paid<lb></lb>ons at the end of each sale and gets paid by the cashier, Mr. Castleman—those entries wave made by the defendant in a book called the wool book, which was kepi by him, and was called his book—nobody else made entries in it—I have examined to-see that—this represents money which he has paid out—the wool-book that contains the summary is missing—a search has been made for it—I saw it last in the defendant's possession in the rack in the wool office—there were a dozen or more books there—all the clerks have access to the wool office—it is left open for business—it is not exclu<lb></lb>sively the defendant's office—I never saw anybody but the defendant in possession of that wool-book; nobody else has a right to make entries in it—it is kept for the summary.</p>

Hargraves, of Bradford; number of articles, 24 bales of wool," which was originally two bales—the total as altered is fifty-five bales, because there is another alteration in the bill—the third case is Wright Whitnam, of Huddersfield, on the same day—the order-book is in the son's writing, the reference also, and the receipt-book also—the reference, 516, in the cart note is in the prisoner's writing—the wool-bill now stands, "Messrs. Gooch and Cozens, consignors; consignee, W. Whitnam, of Huddersfield, 12 bales marked W. W. H.; amount paid on 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; reference to invoice 1068"—the figure 2, making the bales 12, is in the prisoner's writing, and the figure 1 placed before the 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the stroke after it, making it "11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—the cart note only contains one bale—this entry in the order-book, "11th December, Brown and Eagles to Glover, of Kirk-stall" is by the son, and this entry in the receipt-book also—there is no cart note for this; the cart notes are missing—they were last seen during the prisoner's examination at the Mansion-house—the prisoner was allowed to search for the missing wool-book, and it was immediately after that that I missed them—I left him in the wool office with the notes and books; whether there was any one else there I cannot say—this wool-bill, No. 518, December 11, is in the defendant's son's writing, "Consignor, Brown and Eagles; consignee, G.

Wool paid ons in November and December sales, 89<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—it is impossible for me to recollect entries in the wool-book for 2 months—I recollect one because my attention was drawn to it, and because I have looked at other documents—the entries were about paid ons, and they were principally small amounts of money, line after line—I do not recollect, without referring, any particular item existing in that wool-book at the time I was comparing it with the wool bills with the prisoner—I have memorandums to refer to—I did not make them at the time, but when I was investigating this matter.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> 12 months—I believe a clerk named Whitmore, who has since left the establishment, was in the habit of checking his accounts—Castleman is the cashier—he was not present when the prisoner and I checked the wool-book, but I after<lb></lb>wards carried it to his office to compare it with his—I did not remain in his office 5 minutes—I saw the amount in a moment.</p>

It was part of my duty to receive the paid ons for Gooch and Cozens—this amount on the 10th of December is in my writing—I received 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for Benjamin Crowther for 31 bales, which is at the rate of 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a bale—that appears from the account—I did not receive any money that day in respect of wool for them—I received from Whitwen 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. but received no other money that day in respect of wool for Gooch and Cozens—here is another entry on the same date of money received by me for Gooch and Cozens, in respect of wool for Hargraves; it is "2 bales 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 10th December"—I received no other amount that day in respect of wool for them—I cannot speak positively as to who the payer of</p>

               <p>those sums was—I sent the account in to Mr. Strickland, and he generally paid them, but sometimes Mr. Castleman; the rule was that Mr. Strickland paid—whoever paid these sums to me paid them on account of Chaplin and Horne.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's employ as cashier—there are periodical wool sales every year—the last sale before 10th February closed in December—it is the prisoner's duty during the sales to pay certain charges for paid ons, and at the conclusion of the sales it is my practice to settle with him for what he has paid for the paid ons—I advance him on behalf of my employers, pending the sales, certain sums of money, and take his 10 U's; and when I settle with him he produces to me a wool-bill, containing a summary of the amounts said by him to be paid on—I gave no directions to Fox to check his wool-book with his wool-bill—he brought in his wool-book on 10th February, and there was a general settlement between us—I looked at his wool-book, which showed an amount of 891. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which he represented that he had paid on during the previous two months—I recollect the amount by taking credit for it, and making a note of it in my own book at the time—on settling the account I debited myself with the amount, tore up his I O U's, and paid him the balance, about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have seen that wool-book since in the prisoner's possession—it was a wool-book that I settled with him in March—it contains the summary for March—I do not know where the wool-book that was paid in February is now—when I last saw it I believe it was in the prisoner's possession—I have no items in my cash-book, only the 89<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

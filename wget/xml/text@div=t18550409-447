               <p>20 minutes before 8 Fahle came, and drove up a horse and cart to Mr. Teede's premises—I did not see him go in the premises, but go to the rear of them—it is a yard or alley, but no thoroughfare—I did not go up the alley—the cart went up the alley—I remained in view of the top of the alley—the back of Mr. Teede's premises open into that alley—Fahle came out again in about ten minutes—he had the cart with him, and two hogsheads in it—I could not see where he got them from—the alley goes from Bishopsgate-street into the yard, and turns to the left, so that I could not see where he went to—it is at the back of the warehouse—I still watched the top of the alley—when he came out with his cart, he went towards Bishopsgate Church—he stopped at Mr. Barker's public house, and I saw Good come to him and join him—it is about two minutes walk from Mr. Teede's—I saw where Good came from; he came from the premises of Mr. Teede—Fahle got up the alley first, and when he got to the public house Good came behind—I saw them speak together, and they went into the public house—Good came out of the public house and returned to the warehouse, and Fahle drove on to Cannon-street—I and Balchin followed him—I there saw Telchader with his pony truck—he backed up to the cart—it did not stop at any particular house; it was in the open street—I saw Telchader and Fahle together shove a hogshead from the cart on to the truck—Telchader drove the truck to Union-street—I and Balchin followed him—we left Fahle altogether—Tel<lb></lb>chader went to Ryall's house, No. 29, Union-street, with the truck, and Ryall came out and took the two bags into the shop—the bags were in the hogshead, and Telchader pulled the cask over, and assisted Ryall with the two bags—the cask was not taken off the truck, but merely tipped over by Telchader, and he took out the bags, and helped Ryall with them—he took them in front of him and carried them into the shop—it is a sweet stuff shop—Ryall was inside the shop when the truck came up—I was not near enough to hear whether anything was said before Ryall came out—Telcha<lb></lb>der drove away, and Balchin went and brought him back—I was in at Ryall's at the time—I went in as soon as Ryall took the two bags in—I asked him what he had got there—he said, "Waste," or "Dirty sugar"—I believe the word was "Dirty sugar"—I told him I must take him into cus<lb></lb>tody for receiving that, knowing it to be stolen—he said he had not bought it nor paid for it, or words to that effect—the bags were not open at that time—they were tied up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor—I went out of town on the Tuesday morning—I had given instructions to the police on the previous day—I came home on the Friday evening—on Saturday morning a policeman called, and requested me to go to the Mansion-house—I went there and saw two gunney bags of sugar—these samples are the same description of sugar that was in them—I have been in business almost fifty years—I consider that I am well acquainted with sugar—this sugar is certainly not scrapings of casks—it is clear from a hogshead—such as this could not be scraped from a hogshead—this is foreign sugar—the sugar melted in this country would be quite different to this—I had a hogshead of sugar in my ware-house precisely of the same description as this—I took a sample of it with me to the Mansion-house, and I found that it exactly corresponded with that in the bags—I have the samples here—this sample was from the bags, and this was from the hogshead—in my judgment they exactly correspond—I believe them to be from the same hogshead—there is a peculiar smell about this sugar that I know it by—the smell is very much gone off from the small sample—the sugars that come from Porto Rico have this smell—I have not detected it in any other—we never put sugar loose into gunney bags—there is a small kind of bag used which comes from the Mauritius—we pack parcels in gunney bags, but do not pack sugar loose in them—here is a gunney bag which has been in wear for some time—the hogshead from which I believe the sugar was taken did not come from the Docks till the Wednesday evening while I was absent—I have the Dock weight of that hogshead—these hogsheads are not always full—they are subject to drainage—they do not waste 200 lbs.—they are usually full—when I came back I examined this hogshead—I directed it to be weighed—supposing it had been a full, and making every allowance for drainage, there could not have been a deficiency of from 2 cwt. to 21/2 cwt.—the hogshead was nearly empty—th e weight of it from the Dock was 103/4 cwt.—from my knowledge of these hogsheads it would have held about 91/2 cwt. or 10 cwt., but that would depend on the quality of the sugar put in it—it would have contained from 9 to 10 cwt. of this very kind of sugar—when I saw it on the Saturday morning it was three parts empty—there was rather over 4 cwt. and 12 lb. including the weight of the cask, which would weigh about 1 cwt.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have looked at this sugar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it came from Porto Rico—I cannot tell from memory what quantity comes from there to the English market; it is a large quantity—many of the sugars that come from that colony have this smell—the lower qualities have—I have not noticed a smell similar to this in sugar from Jamaica, or the Mauritius—this is a sugar I should not sell out for retail purposes with out mixing—if it were sent out for wholesale purposes, I should not gene<lb></lb>rally send it as taken from the hogshead; more generally mixed—I do not remember giving directions to Good to send out some sugar; he was not ordered by me to send any to Brentwood, nor anywhere else—I have a customer named Coggleshall, at Waltham Abbey—I do not recollect giving directions to Good to send any there; but it would not have been out of that hogshead—Good's sole employ was in the warehouse—I am not quite certain as to the time he has been in my employ; it may be more than five years—he had not a first rate character when he came to me, but it was one which, with explanation, induced me to take him—the waste on the voyage might vary from one cwt. to one quarter of a cwt.; but in a very dry sugar it might not waste 7 lbs.—if the ship were leaky it might wash half the sugar out—the sugar at the bottom is called foots—the syrup drains down—there may be twenty or thirty kinds of sugars in the English market—there may be six or seven West India islands which send sugar, and the Mauritius sends sugar.</p>

            . I took a second handkerchief to the prisoner on Wednesday, the day after the first; she gave me 6d. for it - this is it; she told me it was not a good one, she could not get more for it - I laid out the 6d., and bought a pint and a half of beer, and 5 lbs. of potatoes - we drank the beer between us; there was the prisoner, her two sons, her daughter, and I - I received nothing else for the handkerchief; she took it out, and brought me the 6d. back - she told me she sold it to a young man in the street, and asked 1s. for it, but he would not give more than 6d. for it; she went towards her father's, and was gone about a quarter of an hour - I had stolen the handkerchief from my mother; I gave it to the prisoner - she took it, and said, "That is right," and then she took it out; I had my dinner there, a herring and some potatoes; I never went up stairs - there is only one room on the ground floor; I did not see her husband that day - I do not know how old her daughter is; she is married, and, I believe, she was present the day before, when the conversation took place about taking the man's watch who was hanging in the forest - Fulbrook, who went with me the first time, is here.</p>

             came to me, and said he had a nice silk handkerchief to sell - I asked where he got it; he said he found it - I went into the prisoner's house; he came in, and asked the prisoner if she would buy a nice silk handkerchief - she said she did not want one; he showed it her - she asked what he wanted for it; he said 3s. - she said she had no money, but she could get it; he said, "Get what you can;" she went out, and brought in 2s. - I did not introduce him to the prisoner; I went to her house one day, when he was sitting there drinking gin - I was never present when any conversation took place about thieving; I never heard any conversation about a man hanging in a forest with a watch in his pocket - they were talking, but I do not recollect about what; I was a neighbour, and used to go into the house - when he offered the prisoner the handkerchief for 3s., he said his mother had a box at home, with silver spoons and money in it, and if she liked he would bring it to her; she said, "For God's sake boy, don't do any such thing;" that is all that I heard pass.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, on your solemn oath, do you mean to state, that in your presence, no conversation took place respecting a man having a watch in his pocket? A. No, and no conversation took place about thieving.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite certain when he offered the handkerchief, that he said it was one he had found? A. Yes - there is not a word of truth in the statement of the prisoner desiring him to go and steal any thing from his mother, nor did she say if a man was hanging in a tree with a gold watch in his pocket, she would take the watch, but if there were any halfpence she would not take them.</p>
               <p>RICHARD HARLING re-examined. Q. Is this the boy who was present when the conversation took place about the watch in the man's pocket? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who were present at this conversation? A. Her husband, her son, Fulbrook, her daughter, and the child; Fulbrook was there listening to the conversation about the watch in the man's pocket; my mother had some silver spoons at home in a box - I do not know whether she had any more silver, nor whether there was any money in the box - I never looked at that time; I had looked into it last winter - that was the first time I looked at it, and then I stole a sovereign out; I proposed to the prisoner to go and steal some silver out of that box, and she said, "For God's sake, don't take the box, but bring what is in it if you can get it;" she did not give me a reason for not taking the box; I do not know whether Fulbrook was present at the time, nor whether her daughter and her husband were listening - I will not swear that Fulbrook was not there; I never was accused of stealing any thing but what I mentioned in the last trial - I was accused of stealing a loaf of bread - that was after I stole the sovereign.</p>

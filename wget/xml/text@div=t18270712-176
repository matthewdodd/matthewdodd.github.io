I have known the prisoner twelve months - I met her on Monday morning early, in New Tothill-street; she asked me to give her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120065"></xptr>something to drink; I said there was no house open - we went to her lodging, No. 52, <placeName id="t18270712-176-crimeloc970">Old Pie-street</placeName>

I put my watch and seals into my stocking, and put them in my hat, and we went to bed together; I awoke between four and five o'clock in the morning - my things were then safe; she was then gone down stairs - she came up, took them out of my hat, and was out with them in a moment. I have not recovered them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long have you known her? A. Six or seven years; but I never was at her own home - another girl was in the room; they were both in the bed. I was not much in liquor - I had some beer there - I had not time to stop her, nor to cry out.</p>

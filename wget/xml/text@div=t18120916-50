On Thursday, the 23rd of July, about noon, my apprentice gave me information that a man was taking some mahogany from my back door. I went to the back door, and found the man tieing up two pieces of mahogany. I asked him, what he was going to do with it. He pointed to a man, and said, that man told him to tie them up, and follow him. While he was telling me that I looked at the rest of the mahogany, and found that some had been gone before. I asked him, where he had carried what he had taken away before. He said, he had not been there before. He saw that man sell two pieces of mahogany for bed posts. He took them to the place where they were sold, which was Mr. Mullett's shop in Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Mullett - A. A broker. I went and looked in Mr. Mullett's shop, and saw the two pieces of mahogany stand. I told Mr. Mullett that he had goods that were stolen from me. While I was talking to Mr. Mullett my lad came and informed me, that they had got the other man. I asked Mr. Mullett to go with me, and see if that was the man that he had bought them of. Mr. Mullett came and saw the man. He said, he gave him a pound note for the mahogany.</p>

            . I am a broker. I live in Moorfields. On the 23d of July, between eleven and twelve in the morning, the prisoner came and asked me if I should like to purchase the bed-posts. I said, no, I was not in the want of any. After some little time he asked me if he should bring them, and let me see them. I said, he might if he pleased. He and some other man brought, I believe, the two pieces of mahogany that is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon the prisoner, is he the man - A. Yes. I paid him for them. He brought one, and some other man brought the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the same bed-posts that you shewed to Mr. Taylor - A. I cannot say exactly that they are.</p>
               <p>Q. You know it was the same day - A. Yes. Mr. Taylor came within half an hour after. I did not take particular notice of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not shuffle. You must know where they were put - A. Mine is an open shop, and they were put against the story post.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have you any doubt - A. I have not much doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt - A. I certainly have no doubt, but I cannot undertake to say they are the same posts.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you bought any other posts that morning - A. No, sir.</p>

Yes, six or eight weeks; I asked him if he was at work, he told me he was not, nor had not been at work all that week: he asked me if I would give him any thing to drink, I told him yes, and went into the Dundee Arms, I told him to have what he liked and I would pay for it; he made choice of a glass of rum, I told him I drank no spirits except it was mixed, and then he said he would have a glass of rum and water; we came out, I was wishing him a good evening, he said he would turn back with me and go no further that way he was going. We came up Whitechapel, he took me into a back place of a public house, and there we had a pint of beer, as we were coming out he called a man out that was in there.</p>
               <p>Q. You were joined by another man, were you - A. Yes; and he said that poor man had not drank a drop of any thing that day, would I give him a pint of beer, accordingly we went into another public house, and I gave him a pint of beer, and then he would come to see me part of my way home. We walked from the side of Whitechapel where the butchers have their stalls, and coming to Somerset-street, I cut across to go down Petticoat-lane to go to Bunhill Row. I had three dollars in my pocket, I stopped to hinder them from making a noise, I stopped in the street, I took the three dollars out of my pocket and the pound note, and was rolling the dollars up in the one pound note, the prisoner came up and struck me on the side, in <placeName id="t18101031-60-crimeloc372">Whitechapel</placeName>

               <p>Q. Where had you been that day - A. I had been in Rosemary-lane finishing my job, and received my money, and went to Mile End to see a friend. I was perfectly sober when I met him, I had nothing to drink before I met him, and then I had a glass of rum and water, at the second public house I had a pot of porter, and at the third a pint.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always given the same account of this transaction: you never said to any body that he took the money from you at the Seven Stars - A. They have told me so, but I never said it, if I did I never meaned it, I told them I did not say so, I never meant it, because that is the man that knocked me down in Whitechapel, I never did say it, nor meaned it, I said I got the prisoner at the Seven Stars. I slept in the watch-house all night, they would not let me go because I was no house-keeper. They offered me five pound last Saturday.</p>

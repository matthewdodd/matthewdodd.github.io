On the 11th of April, about five o'clock, or a little after, I returned home with a pocketbook and 1/2lb. of tea, tied in a white handkerchief - there was a sovereign, seven half-crowns, some shillings, and 6d. in halfpence, in the pocket-book; the prisoner was at the door, and he began in his foolish way, as he does when he is tipsy - I said, "Let me in;" he played tricks and molested me in the passage, and on the stairs he began violence; it continued till he got up to the landing-place: he then said, "I will have none of your b-y soup; I will have what you have got here;" he began to beat me, and snatched it by violence from me - he had not beaten me before that, only pulled me about; the handkerchief came untied, but I held it, and received more violence than I should have; the door opened, and I threw them on the bed - he got the pocket-book, but the tea went on the bed- I then swooned away: I said nothing more that night. but next morning I went to his room, about five o'clock - he did not appear sober then; I asked him to give me the pocket-book and papers; he said, "I don't recollect, she is not at home; but if you want a few shillings, I can lend them to you;" he cohabited with a woman of the name of Parker - I never got my book or money: he followed me down, and gave me three blows on the back of my neck, he said, "Where is your b-y pocket-book now?" and mentioned such words as I cannot repeat.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Grove, at Ealing. I am no relation of the deceased Elizabeth Wallis—she was a daughter of the prisoner by her first husband, and was about seventeen years old—they lived in Ealing-grove opposite to me—the prisoner had six children living by her second marriage—she is a laundress—the deceased died on Thursday night, 8th Aug.—I saw bruises on her—I saw her ill-treated by her mother about six months before her death, but not much since that—she was ill five weeks—she had been attended by the medical man of the parish—about six months before she died I saw the prisoner give her a blow at the top of the stairs, from the effect of which she fell down the whole flight, about ten steps—she followed her down, and beat her again with her hand for about a minute—she cried out—she was perfectly healthy then—I have not at other times seen her beat her more than is usual with mothers—about twelve months ago I saw her beaten with a rope across the shoulders, as if to correct her—she was not allowed to take her meals with the rest of the family when I have seen them—I have seen her have a piece of dry bread where they had meat—I have seen her mother throw her a piece of bread in another room where she was at work, when the others were eating their dinner, potatoes, or perhaps bread and meat—she did not complain to me till the day before her death—I was with her when she died—I tried to impress upon her mind that she was dying, and said I hoped she would pray to Almighty God for pardon, for I thought her time in this world would be very short, and if she had committed any faults she had better pray for pardon—she said she hoped she should be forgiven—I put several questions to her about trifling things which I was aware she had done, and asked her with regard to the truth of them, and she satisfied me so far that I told her if she made confession of it openly she would not have so much to answer for, and I hoped she would pray to Almighty God to pardon her—she repeated the Lord's Prayer, and some part of the Creed—I asked her if she realty felt she should die, and she said yes, she did think so—she then complained of being very hungry—I said, "Have you any meat?"—she said, "There is a mutton chop in that basket, but you had better not cook it, in case mother may not like it"—I said, "Never mind, the blame shall be laid to me"—I cooked half of it, which she ate, and some potatoes—I then said, "I do not think you will get the better of your illness"—she said she thought she was going—I said, "Going where?"—she said she did not know—I asked her if she thought that she should go to heaven if she died—she said she did not know—(<hi rend="italic">Thc Court did not consider there was ground for thinking she knew she was dying, and therefore excluded her statement</hi>)—the Inquest was on Saturday, the 10th—the body was at the mother's house—I heard the prisoner say, in the tap-room of the King's Arms, that if she got her liberty she would go home and throw the b——r out of window,<hi rend="italic">box</hi> and all—the coffin was there at that time—I had helped to put the corpse into it before that—I do not think she was called in at the Inquest, she was in the tap-room—in going to the station she told her husband he was not to follow the corpse to the grave; if he did, she would remember it when she came out; and if any one was suffered to go into the house, she would not live with him any more when she</p>

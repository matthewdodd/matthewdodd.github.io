                  </hi>. I live at Millwall, Poplar, and have a mill there. On Friday, 21st April, a person came to me, about 9 o'clock in the morning, respecting the purchase of some wheat—in consequence of that, I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Cokimbo</hi>, in Oarter's-dock, Millwall—I saw the prisoner—he told me he had a quantity of sweepings and damaged wheat for sale—I went down to the between decks, and saw two heaps of wheat lying at the extreme ends of the vessel, and in the wheat there was a quantity of linseed cake, bits of wood, and rubbish of different descriptions—it was evidently swept up from different parts of the vessel—I asked the prisoner how he came to have this—he told me it was his perquisite, for sweepings, and it had been cleared at the London-docks, by the Dock officer and the Customs officer, on the previous Tuesday—I agreed to give him 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a quarter, or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a bushel, for the wheat, and to send men down to remove it—I sent down two men in the course of the morning to measure the wheat, and bring it home to the mill—when the second load came I found, from the statement of my men, that there were 142 bushels, which, at 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a quarter, would amount to over 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not feel satisfied About the right of the prisoner to sell so large a quantity of wheat, and, having to go to the Corn-meter's Office, I ascertained who were the consignees of the wheat, and made it known to them—I had paid the prisoner a deposit—he sent to ask for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I sent down by my man—this wheat was brought to my mill in sacks—it was never opened afterwards till the officers came and took it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Harris and Bassett—we had a quantity of wheat consigned to us by the <hi rend="italic">Cokimbo</hi>—we expected 700 quarters or thereabouts, and we got only 428 quarters of sound wheat and 1 quarter of damaged—it was wet—the sound portion of the wheat we had was worth 86<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 90<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a quarter—I have looked at the samples of</p>

               <p>wheat produced, I should think this would be worth about 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a quarter—there are some few damaged grains in it—some portions get injured by sea-water.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tide surveyor—I went on board this vessel on 19th April—it is my duty to go to see that the cargo is cleared out—I examined the whole of the vessel, to the best of my knowledge every part was examined—I found three portions of wheat, one was in the bottom of the vessel, in the hold, another was between decks, and another was in eight casks, in the store room, in the cabin on deck—I sent it on shore before I would clear—there was about eight quarters in all—the loose wheat was put into bags and sent on shore—there was about sixty-four bushels in all, and I would not clear the vessel till it was all removed—I examined the wheat, it was so good that I conceived it to be part of the cargo—I sent it on shore that the merchants might receive it—of course the duty would be paid—I sent it to the same place that the other part of the cargo went to—in my judgment this other was not on board at that time—I believe it was not—there was a small portion dirty and wet at the bottom of the hold, and there was water in the hold—I saw afterwards some dirty wheat, perhaps two or three quarters—perhaps that might come from the vessel: I cannot say—no person whatever had any authority to remove any wheat without the concurrence of the Custom House officer till the duty was paid.</p>

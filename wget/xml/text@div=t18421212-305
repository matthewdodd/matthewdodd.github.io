                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Smolt Smallty, a watchmaker, and live at No. 16, Spencer-street, in the parish of St. Mary, Islington. On Monday, the 5th of Dec. I left my parlour, leaving the top sain of the win<lb></lb>dow two or three inches open—the bottom sash was down—I returned in half-an-hour, and found the bottom sash wide open—I missed the articles stated, which are worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw them again that same night.</p>

Last Mon<lb></lb>day evening se'nnight, between six and half-past six o'clock, I was on the footpath near my house, about 300 yards from the prosecutor's house—I saw a roan standing still on the footpath, with a largo white bundle about a yard round—I cannot swear to the prisoner being the man, or whether he is like him—it was between dark and light—he asked me if there was a thoroughfare, and the name of the place—I told him—he said he had tumbled down, and broken his knee.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. Last Monday se'nnight, about half-past six o'clock, I was going up Pleasant-row, and met the prisoner—I had known him for six or seven months—he had nothing with him at that time—I asked his business there—it was no thoroughfare—he said he had been on a message to No. 9 in that row, that he had fallen down, and had like to break his knee—he was rubbing his left knee with his hand at the time, and I saw that his trowsers were torn—I was quite close to him—I stopped him, and then let him go as he had nothing with him—he was able to run after I let him go—I went between thirty and forty yards further, and found the bundle lying on the footway, between Nos. 10 and 11—that was in a direction from which the prisoner was coming.</p>

               <p>and six next morning, and went with them to the prosecutor's premises—I found two foot-marks about a yard from the window, which had been partially left open—they were marks of a right and left foot—there was the impression of three nails in the right foot, and I found three corresponding in the pri<lb></lb>soner's right shoe—the mark of the left foot also corresponded with his left shoe, and they were the same size—I measured them—according to my judg<lb></lb>ment those two foot-marks corresponded with the prisoner's two boots.</p>

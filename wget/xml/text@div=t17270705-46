            , Son of the Deceased depos'd, That on Monday the 16th of May, between 11 and 12 at Night, he, with his Father was going home, when over against Suffolk-street they met with Mr. Clifton; who gave them very ill Language, which his Father could not take; upon which they immediately fell to Blows, his Father saying, he could use a Cane as well as Mr. Clifton could use a Sword: But this Deponent being kept back by the coming of other People, he was not an Eye-witness to the unhappy Accident, and though he heard his Father say he was wounded, he did not see any Pass that was made with Mr. Clifton's Sword. This Deponent being asked, if he was certain his Father did not Strike Mr. Clifton when he endeavoured to pass by him? Said, he could not tell; being asked, Whether his Father did not thrust Mr. Clifton out of the way before a Blow was given? Said, he believed he did.</p>

             depos'd, That he coming by and seeing several People together, he went to see what was the Matter, when he saw the Deceased strike Mrs Clifton in a Violent Manner, and that the Noise of the Blow sounded like the Noise of a Whip, but that he did not then see Mr. Clifton strike the Deceased; neither was there any Obstruction in the Way, but that the Deceased might have passed about his Business, and that the Son of the Deceased would have perswaded him to come along, but he obstinately refused it, and continued to insult Mr. Clifton with the utmost Violence, not only before he drew his Sword, but afterwards; all which Time Mr. Clifton's Back was towards the Pastrycook's Shop in a leaning Posture, using his Sword only as a Guard, not offering to make a Pass, but that the Deceased beat down the Sword, and being in Drink, fell forwards, and ran the Sword in his own Body, without the least Motion from Mr. Clifton.</p>

             depos'd, That he saw Mr. Clifton with a Cane in his Hand and a Pinch of Snuff between his Fingers of the same Hand, and the Deceased at the same Time flourishing a Stick or Cane, saying, D - n you for a Scoundrel, draw your Sword Rascal, I don't value your Sword of a Farthing; I can use a Cane as well as you can a Sword, giving Mr. Clifton a hard Blow on the Shoulder, till at length the Prisoner drew his Sword, but did not make a Pass, and striking with more than ordinary Violence, he hit Mr. Clifton on the Shoulder, which beat down his Sword, and the Deceased being in Drink staggered forwards and fell upon the Point of Mr. Cliston's Sword, running at him like a mad Man. This Deponent further depos'd, That after the Deceased had received the fatal Wound he struck a desperate Blow at Mr. Clifton, but missing him hit this Deponent's Arm, which was not well for a Month after.</p>

             depos'd, That he coming by at the Hour, mentioned in the Indictment; against Suffolk-street End, saw Mr. Clifton learning against a Pastry-cook's Grate, when the Deceased coming along, Mr. Clifton said, take Care; upon which the Deceased said, What must I take care of D - n you, do you think I am afraid of a Sword, and flourishing his Cane struck Mr. Cliston on the Shoulder, and that then Mr. Clifton Struck at the Deceased, but reeling<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172707050006"></xptr> miss'd him, upon which the Deceas'd struck Mr. Clifton again, and that then Mr. Cliston drew, but did not make a Pass at the Deceased, only striking, at him, as was mentioned by the other Evidences. This Deponent endeavouring to part them by running between them, was push'd away by the Deceas'd.</p>
               <p>After the Hearing of these Evidences Mr. Clifton made a moving Defence, in which he express'd himself under the utmost Concern for the unhappy Accident that brought him before the Court, saying, he should think his Life too short to lament the fatal Necessity he was brought into of preserving it at the Expence of that of his Fellow-Creature. My Grief, said he, on this Occasion, would have been far less supportable had it been attended with the Consciousness of Guilty; but this I can affirm with Truth, that though my Hand was Guilty, yet my Heart was entirely free: He observed, that through the whole Course of the Evidence already given, nothing had been laid to his Charge, that carried with it the least Colour of malice against the unfortunate Man; That the very Blows he gave him with his Sword were a plain Indication how little he had Mischief at Heart. He then observ'd, it was unanimously agreed, notwithstanding the several Blows he receiv'd, that he never made the least Attempt upon his Life: On the contrary, that Mr. Gilliere, Cameron, and Lambert were in this Point all agreed, that the Time at which the Decased receiv'd his Wound, he forced himself upon the Point of his Sword; this, he said, was a Circumstance that offered him no small Comfort under this Misfortune, and he doubted not but it would have its just Weight with the Gentlemen of the Jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clifton then giving the Court a short Account of his spending the aforesaid Day, and the Particulars of the Tragical Scene, desired Leave of the Court that he might have the Liberty to call two or three more who had seen the Beginning of the Affair, and as he said, might lay it still in a clearer Light than had been done by the other Witnesses, at the same Time he took Notice, that hitherto there had not appeared one positive Evidence to prove him the Aggressor; even Mr. Ehnes himself, (the Son of the Deceas'd) Mr. Clifton observ'd to the Court, was so far from being clear in this Particular, that he own'd he could not pretend to say, but for what he knew, his father might have struck him first. That such Language from the Son of the Deceas'd, seemed, in his humble Opinion, to be so far from weakening the Evidence given in his Favour, that confirm'd it beyond Contradiction. And then Mr. Clifton call'd the following Witnesses.</p>
               <p>

             depos'd, That the Night on which this unlucky Accident happen'd, he had been at Cavendish Market-place, and that standing to make Water, the Deceased came by, and rushing against the Prisoner, almost flung him down, and upon the Deponents's only saying, Who is there, the Deceased turning about, said D - n ye, what do you stand there for, and gave him the most opprobrious Language on this trivial Occasion: After which, this Deponent followed the Deceas'd, and saw him overtake the Prisoner, and seemed as if he would have taken the Wall; upon which some Words pass'd, and the Deceas'd behav'd himself according to the Deposition of the forementioned Witnesses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fitzgerald depos'd, That he was with the Surgeon who dress'd the Deceased's Wounds a Quarter of an Hour after it happen'd and that then the Deceased confess'd he was drunk when it was done, of which this Gentleman desired the Company to take Notice.</p>
               <p>After this Mr. Clifton intimated to the Court that there were several Persons present, who had done him the Honour to come on this Occasion, and might convince their Lordships of his Character, and accordingly several Persons of the first Rank and Quality appeared in his Behalf; who severally depos'd, That they had known the Prisoner, some 5 or 6 Years, others more, and that he had ever behaved himself with the utmost Civility and good Manners, being of a very peaceable Behaviour, and not given to commit Disorders; even when he was in Drink, his Mirth was attended with Modesty, and not then inclin'd to Quarrelling or Extravagance. After this Mr. Clifton begg'd Leave to mention to the Court, what appeared to him upon this Evidence to be the Result of the whole: To this End he observ'd, That as the Deceas'd was proved the Aggressor by the Depositions of several unexceptionable Witnesses, as well those who appear'd in Behalf of his Majesty, as those other Gentlemen which were more immediately concerned in Behalf of himself. It is not insinuated, says Mr. Clifton, even by the Son of the Deceas'd, as if he believ'd I ever made a Pass at his Father; and that by the Depositions of Mr. Gilliere, Mr. Cameron, and Mr. Lambert it was positively affirmed, That the Deceased was the immediate Occasion of his own Destruction. If the Case stands thus, as I humbly conceive it does, I question not but your Lordships, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, will be more inclin'd to compassionate my Misfortune, than condemn the Action. Upon the Whole, the Court judiciously weigh-every minute Circumstance, gave their Opinion, That the greatest Stress which could be laid on the Action could make it no other than <rs id="t17270705-46-verdict226" type="verdictDescription">

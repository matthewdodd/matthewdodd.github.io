             . I lost a silk handkerchief on the thirteenth of February; Mr. Tredway, my opposite neighbour, told me that my pocket was picked, and I had lost my handkerchief. I asked which way the fellow went, and a butcher said run round and you will meet him, and under the gateway, which is under the East India Company's warehouses, the handkerchief was dropped.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Platt. In the new opening where the herb market was to be; he fell down on his knees, and said, if I would forgive him, he would never do so any more.</p>

            . Last Saturday was sev'night in the morning between eight and nine o'clock I was behind my counter pretty near the window, the street was remarkably thin of people, and I saw Mr. Platt cross the way; the Prisoner at the bar and another person followed him at a little distance, and before he came to his own door, within four or five steps, the Prisoner stepped up to him, and I saw him take the handkerchief out of his pocket; the Prisoner turned about very suddenly, and I believe he put the handkerchief into his breast .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Prisoner take the handkerchief out of his pocket?</p>
               <p>Tredway . I did, I am positively sure of it; and I said with a little vehemence my man, that fellow in the blue coat has got Mr. Platt's handkerchief. The Prisoner ran into the beef-hall, and I ran to Mr. Platt's door, and said, Sir, you have lost your handkerchief, and he said so I have: we went under the gateway, and about half way under the gateway there his handkerchief lay. My man had given out the cry of pick-pocket, pick-pocket, and a butcher said if you go such a way you will meet him, and my servant got him secured, and delivered him to Mr. Platt and I, and then he fell down on his knees, and said he was a young man, and if Mr. Platt would forgive him he would never do so any more. He was in a blue coat, I cannot say it was that blue coat he has on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They say I acknowledged the thing, and said if he would forgive me I would never do so any more; but I said I never was guilty of picking any body's pocket, but I desired him to forgive me.</p>

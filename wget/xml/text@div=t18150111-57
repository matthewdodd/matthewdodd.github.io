            . I am a cabinet maker. On the 29th of December, at half after eight o'clock, the woman prisoner knocked at my door, and asked to speak to Mr. Jacobs; the servant answered at the door she is within; I said walk in; when she came in, she said she had brought a glass to sell, for a woman that was very unwell; I asked her how long she had had it; she said she had it a twelvemonth; I then said this glass has not been compleatly finished a month; she replied if I did not like to buy it to give it her back again; I said the glass had not been hung up a twelvemonth, glasses that have, have always dust on the back of them. I then asked her how she could knock at my door, and ask me to buy a looking glass; she said that she was sent by a person at Temple bar, that said I was in want of a looking glass; I detained the glass. I went myself to the office; I told her to bring the person who belonged to it, and while she was gone I went to the office; I brought Mr. Upton the officer, home with me, he had not been in doors above half an hour when a knock came to the door the door was opened, and in came the woman, with an elderly man; she said this is the man that belongs to the glass; I said do you claim it as your property; he said he did, the officer told him it was stolen property, he then said it was not his property, he was authorized by the woman to come and claim it, and then he should have it; he then said it was not his, he knew nothing about it, he was to come and claim it as his property. Being an elderly man, the officer asked him how he came to claim it; he said he was employed by the two prisoners to come and claim it; the woman prisoner said she would point out the two thieves. We lodged the pie-man in the watchhouse; the officer and I went with the woman, into Charles-street, Drury-lane, there she pointed out two little boys; one of these little boys went with the officer, to shew him where the thief had done the robbery; I knew nothing about the prisoner Wells.</p>

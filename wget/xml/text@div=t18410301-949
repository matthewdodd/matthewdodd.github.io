                  </hi>. I am a haberdasher, Jiving in Whitmore, Hoxton. On the 10th or February, about a quarter-past five o'clock, Taylor came into my shop for a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece of white tape, which I gave her—she gave me sixpence—I suspected it was bad—I laid it by itself in the desk, and gave her 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which she went away with—soon after, I took the sixpence in my hand, marked it, and put it into my pocket by itself—I then went to look after Taylor—I saw her about fifty yards off—I followed her—she joined Johnson, and they seemed in conversation—they then separated, and Taylor went into another haberdasher's, kept by Clark—I saw a policeman on the other side, and told him to take John<lb></lb>son, who was four or five doors off—when Taylor went into Clark's he remained there waiting, looking into a window—I then went into Clark's shop, and told Taylor I wanted her—she said, "What for?"—I told her she must come along with me—I saw Emma Louisa Clark with a sixpence, that she was in the act of bending—she gave it me, I put it into my pocket with the other sixpence, where I had nothing else—I took Taylor into custody myself—she said she was very sorry, would I let her go that time—I took her to the station—I saw Johnson searched, and the piece of tape</p>

On the 9th of June I found his hat on the counter in the shop; he was then outside the door, hanging up some coats - there was a handkerchief in his hat; I found in the hat six waistcoats folded up, and crammed in; I sent for Mr. Nicholson, our foreman - he called the prisoner, and asked what was in his hat - he said nothing that he knew of, if there was, somebody had put it in; I then went for an officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When the prisoner appeared before the Magistrate, did he not give an account of a pair of shoes, which turned out to be correct? A. Yes, Mr. Nicholson said it might be the case - if these shoes are in the indictment it is a mistake; he said this knife was his own - I cannot swear to that; he said one of these brushes was Mr. Wissett's, and the other his own; he never had Mr. Wissett's clothes to brush - he had Nicholson's, but he could not say he brushed them with this brush; I will not swear he said he took this brush home with Nicholsotn's clothes- the hat was on the shop-board half-way behind the door, and the waistcoats were covered with a handkerchief - I do not know how long the hat had been there; I had not been in five minutes - I did not hear Nicholson say if he would confess he took them he should be discharged; the shopmen have been on good terms with the prisoner as far as I know - there was no question about which of the five was to leave; he sometimes went home without his hat, sometimes without his coat, and sometimes with it on his arm - I never heard about one of the five persons having to leave because the baker's bill was too heavy; I never heard Mrs. Wissett say that - I will not swear she did not.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. When I went the prisoner was in the shop, and the waistcoats on the counter; in going to the office he said some one had been playing a trick, and put them into his hat - I went with the shopman to search his room, which I found by the landlord's account; I found these shoes and brushes there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you been making any search in the neighbourhood? A. No - I have not heard of any thing but what I have produced; the search was made as soon as I had locked him up - these shoes were under the bed; I do not know how they came to be in the indictment - Mr. Nicholson said they were Mr. Wissett's, and then we found they were not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had the whole charge of the shop for three months, and had opportunities of robbing to an immense extent, but I never did; I do not know how these things came into my hat - it had been in that place from the Tuesday morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Red House, at Barking-side. Mr. Ingram serves me with bread—a young man drives the cart—the prisoner was at my house after the baker went away, on the 26th of December, and being tipsy, he began to make a disturbance in the tap-room—I put him out, and asked a young man to give me the prisoner's fish-basket out of the tap-room to prevent his going in—when he set it down a 2lb. loaf rolled out—I found these two 2lb. loaves, and one 4lb. loaf, and two small cottage loaves in it—I told him I was afraid he had stolen the bread—he said he had not—he went away, and came again in half an hour—I let the baker know, and he identified them.</p>

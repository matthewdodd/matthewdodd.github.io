               <p>Prisoner. Q.Where did I first meet you? A.By St. Luke's church - Mitchell-street is close by the church; I did not put any questions to you, nor stop you at all - I did not ask you the way to Brick-lane; I was not drunk - I had but one pint of beer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Your face was bruised very much - was it cut at all? A. Yes, under my nose; the skin was broken, and the blood flowed very freely; there was a great deal of blood to be seen on the wall - my skin was mostly cut by my lips; it was broken a little about my eye.</p>
               <p>JOHN THWAITES. I am a private watchman of St. Luke's. I heard a cry of murder in Mitchell-street - I went to the place, and found the prosecutor down, and the prisoner with his left-hand over his mouth, trying to stop him from hallooing; Masters was on the ground, all over blood; he was not able to stand when I picked him up - he said he had lost his watch, but it turned out that he had not; there was a great deal of blood about his mouth - he appeared very much injured indeed.</p>

On the 8th of April I was on duty in Gee-street, about a quarter to one o'clock in the morning; I heard the cry of murder, and ran towards Mitchell-street - I saw the prosecutor, and the watchman picking him up; the prisoner was running - I followed him round St. Luke's church, and took him; he said, "It ayn't me - there he goes," but there was not another soul in the road; I brought him back, and the watchman said he saw his left hand over the prosecutor's mouth; I got a light, looked at both his hands, and found them covered with blood.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor says I met him in Old-street, took hold of his arm, and knocked him down, intending to rob him: the truth is, I overtook him at the top of Bath-street, when he asked me to show him the way to Brick-lane, and accompanied me - he stumbled down; I attempted to raise him up - he called out murder; I tried to get him up, and being intoxicated myself, I fell over him, and trod on him with my foot; I put my hand over him to endeavour to lift him - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110008"></xptr>called out, and I endeavoured to make my way home, thinking I should get into trouble.</p>

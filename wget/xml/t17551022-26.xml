I have from time to time been very suspicious of somebody going into them, besides myself; my two vaults are one on the side of the other; and there are others have vaults there, which all go in from one common door. I believe I have now the quantity of 18 hundred gallons of spirituous liquors in them, but I never sell any wholesale, but by drams and in punch in my house. I used not to send any body there when I wanted, but went myself and fetched perhaps a couple of gallons at a time; the exciseman had several times told me I had an extreme good trade, that I must get a great deal if I used so much as he found gone out. I knew I had a tolerable good trade; but being a little suspicious, I took a broom and set it up behind the door when I came out, that it should stand within side, and fall against the door when I lock'd it. When I went the next time, I, at opening the door, put in my hand to feel for the broom and I could not find it; then I went in and found it set a considerable distance from the place; then I was certain somebody had been there besides me; after that I took a stick that I used to gauge my vessel with; it was mark'd with figures; I gaug'd the two casks on tap, and observ'd exactly the depth; by this, the next<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175510220023"></xptr> time I went, I found a deficiency of an inch in one, and an inch and half in the other.</p>
               <p>Q. What do your casks usually hold ?</p>
               <p>Crossland. From a hundred to a hundred and 15 gallons. I tried the broom also a second time; and when I went the next time it was gone from the door again. Thus, I have at times, guest I have lost four or five gallons out of both vessels on tap at a time. I have tried to find it out by this method of gauging, and the third and fourth times, on the 11th of this instant, I look'd upon it I had lost 1.5 gallons and upwards, from these four observations. I had also a stock-lock and a padlock, both on the door; the stock-lock did not answer well. I bought a new padlock of a particular sort, and I was told it was a very safe one; after some little time I found the new lock fail in the opening; that is, it would not open without forcing it, but it would lock very well. I was at a loss to contrive how to detect the thief. On the 11th of this instant I went down occasionally for a bottle of brandy; coming to the outward door, (that outward door used to stand open all day, and was usually lock'd in the evening;) there

             came to me, he said, are you going down in the cellar; I said, yes, and it is a wet night, will you go down with me and drink a dram of rum; he went down and I gave him a dram, and coming up with him I went to lock the door; I ask'd him if he had got the key to lock it, I having things in my hand. We had all keys to the outward door, who had vaults within. He said, he had not his key, then I lock'd it. Something struck into my mind that this was one of the very men that robb'd me. Then I went and carry'd my bottle of brandy into York-buildings, and went and got shav'd, and return'd to the outward door. I look'd in under the door, there is a cavity that a dog may go down, and there I saw a light within the vault, with the padlock, and the bar off the outward door.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was this after you had lock'd the door?</p>
               <p>Crossland. It was about 20 minutes, or half an hour after; I, by looking in, saw a man like a miller, but I did not see his face; he had the lighted candle in a wooden candlestick in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How look'd like a miller?</p>
               <p>Crossland. He had meal on him?</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the vault was this?</p>
               <p>Crossland. This was in the place that leads to all the cellars. Then I went to Mr. Steward's cellar, in hopes to find somebody; but finding nobody, I went to Mr. Harrison, who is steward to that estace; he lives within 50 yards of this place; I told him I was certain I had been robb'd from time to time, and bid him go and look in, and watch about, and see who brought any thing out, but not detect them; he went, what he saw he'll give an account of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look any farther that night?</p>
               <p>Crossland. No, I did not. After Mr. Harrison came and told me they were gone out, I desired him to go down with me to see what was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to watch at the door?</p>
               <p>Crossland. The persons whom I suspected all knew me, and I did not want they should see me; so desired him to see what they brought up and where they lodg'd them. On the Sunday after I apply'd to captain Jones to let me have two men to put into the cellar, who sent a sergeant-major with two soldiers. I put the two soldiers into my cellar on the Monday morning; we went in at Mr. Steward's door; they were there till Saturday night, at different times; we took them out to refresh them a little in the daytime, and put them in again.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell how much you have lost in all?</p>
               <p>Crossland. I can't; but I believe I have lost ten times the quantity I have mention'd. On the 18th of October the two soldiers brought the evidence Woolf to my house; we ask'd him who were with him, he immediately declar'd who they were; I went to Mr. Fielding and he advis'd me to go immediately after the people he had impeach'd, (he had impeach'd all the prisoners at the bar.) We went and took them all up; they all denied the fact, only David Davis, he own'd he had altered a key, (producing a key, with part of the work filed away, so that it would open divers different locks.) This is the key he own'd before the justice he alter'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say for what purpose he alter'd it?</p>
               <p>Crossland. No, he did not positively say for what purpose, but that he gave it to one of the prisoners; I believe it was to

               <p>Q. How came you to go through Mr. Steward's vault to your own, when you say there was one common door to them all?</p>
               <p>Crossland. I never went that way before that time, and the reason was, fearing if we went in at the public door our intention would have been known, and we should have been disappointed in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you never sell rum by the gallon in these vaults?</p>

               <p>Q. Who do you rent the vaults of?</p>

               <p>Q. Have you writings drawn between you?</p>

               <p>Woolf. He brought one the very next morning and delivered it to his cousin; I was present.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to him when he delivered them?</p>
               <p>Woolf. He said, I deliver these keys into your hands; don't you deliver them to any one, for I trust my life in your hands;

               <p>Q. What quantity do you think Doyle took away?</p>
               <p>Woolf. I can't say what quantity; he took rum away a great many times; sometimes one, sometimes two, and sometimes three quarts; sometimes he lock'd the outward door.</p>

I said, I did not want a great deal, he brought me 20 gallons more. I gave him four guineas in part. I gave the money before he brought me the rum, to go and meet the man with it, as he pretended at Deptford, and last Saturday Mr. Crossland came, and told me he had discovered a thing that would be of service to both himself and me. I went with him to his house, there was Woolf taken, who said, my man was concerned with him. I said, I had bought 40 gallons of rum of my man.

            . Mr. Crossland gave me a hint that he had lost goods about a fortnight ago, he said he suspected this evidence Woolf to be one concerned. On the Saturday following he came to my house, and said, now I b elieve they are at it at this time. I wish you would come and assist me, for if I go about the place they'll suspect my watching them, and so I shall not catch them. I went to the cellar door about eight o'clock that evening, the door was shut but not lock'd up. I saw a light down at the bottom. I pulled the door an inch or two open, and saw a light going backwards and forwards, presently I saw the lower parts of two men, that is two pair of legs, and higher, one of them was in a lightish dress. I stood there some time, presently I saw them shake hands together, then one of them came up, that was the prisoner Doyle, he had a glass bottle in his hand. I took no notice of him, or he of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the other?</p>
               <p>Harison. I don't know who it was. I ran home thinking Mr. Crossland was there, to tell him what I had seen, but he was not there. I returned, and then the outward doors were shut up and lock'd, and the evidence Woolf and Doyle were standing near them. I heard Doyle say to Woolf, Have you done it? if you have not, I'll come and lend you a hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Harison. This was in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your house from that place where they stood ?</p>
               <p>Harison. It is as far off as it is cross the Sessions-house yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, when you returned, observe the bottle in Doyle's hand.</p>
               <p>Harison. No, I did not. I only walked on, not to give them the least suspicion that I was looking after them. I then went to Mr. Crossland, and told him what I had seen, then we went to Mr. Steward's, to ask leave to go his way into the vaults, because they thought to open the great doors would carry a suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Woolf after he was taken?</p>
               <p>Harison. I was at the prosecutor's house, and after I had mentioned to him, that I saw him and Doyle there that night, then he said Abraham Davis persuaded him into it, and said, he would procure him a man to make him a key to let him in, and that was a smith named

We went there on Sunday was se'nnight at night; he told us he had been robb'd of several quantities of rum, but could not tell the whole. We were plac'd in the vault at 4 o'clock on the Monday morning the 13th, and continued there till about six on Saturday morning. We were out at times for three or four hours for refreshment at the middle of the day. On Saturday morning the 18th, about 6 o'clock, I was in the vault standing behind a punshion of rum; my partner was also in the vault, but was laid down backwards to go to sleep. I saw a light and heard the vault locks undo; after the locks were undone, the man went back again to the door, I suppose to call the other; he came again in about two minutes, and came into the vault; there I took him; it was

               <p>Harison. I have. If he means my seeing him bring the bottle out of the vault, he is right. I have known Doyle some time, he has behav'd very well. I was sorry for him. I said to Woolf, at Mr. Crossland's that morning, don't go to charge an innocent man, if he is not concerned; he said, Doyle was the least concerned. If Downs means any private conversation, or persuasion of mine, it is utterly false.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Woolf continue always to charge Doyle?</p>
               <p>Harison. He did; he said, he had been with him several times, and had had several bottles, but always denied he had any of the money; he said, he never had a shilling; and since that, he has said, Doyle had a share of it. I never had any intimacy with Woolf; I knew him at Mr. Hide's, a servant. I heard Mr. Fielding and Mr. Welch, divers times, order him to charge no innocent person, and to be very careful what he did.</p>
               <p>Q. to Woolf. Were Downs and you together at the Barley-mow ?</p>
               <p>Woolf. We were, he asked me if Doyle was innocent, I said no he was not. I said he had none of the money, but he had rum, and that he had gone down in the cellar several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Wooley?</p>
               <p>Woolf. I don't know Wooley, I never spoke to him in my life to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know that some person came about it?</p>
               <p>Robertson. I do'nt know that any person did.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know?</p>
               <p>Robertson. I know I did the key.</p>
               <p>Q. What key?</p>
               <p>Robertson. The key they charge my master about.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this key, (the false key.)</p>
               <p>Robertson. I can't really say this is the key or not, but to the best of my knowledge, I think it is.</p>
               <p>Q. It is what?</p>
               <p>Robertson. It was alter'd by me.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Has that key (look well as it) received any alteration since you altered it?</p>
               <p>Robertson. I think it was whole here (putting his finger to a place in the wards filed away to a large opening.) and it was not so bright as it is now.</p>
               <p>Q. By whose orders did you open it?</p>
               <p>Robertson. I opened it by my master's orders.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what use the key was for?</p>
               <p>Robertson. No, I did not at all. I asked my master if it would do, and when I had opened the wards of it, he said yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether this is not a picklock key, and not for opening a lock in the common way?</p>
               <p>Robertson. I never did many keys before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever make a key in your life?</p>
               <p>Robertson. I never did make many, that can go through all locks quite.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see a key made in this kind but what was made to be a picklock?</p>
               <p>Robertson. Upon my word I do not know. I can't say I have seen many made in that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a lock by you to make it by?</p>
               <p>Robertson. Not as I saw.</p>

               <p>Robertson. He worked for me in the smith's way, in making grates and such like things. I would have trusted him with any sum of money, but for this transaction I can't say.

I never heard any ill of him, I really look upon him to be a man hardly capable of doing this. So far from scheming any thing base, if he knew of it, I think he would rather sooner divulge it, there is not a more inoffensive person in court.</p>

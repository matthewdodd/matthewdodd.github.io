On the 24th of October, I washed out my gown, and hung it to dry just outside the wash-house door in the back garden, between three and four o'clock; I missed it between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; it was worth 10s.; it cost me 15s.; this is it.</p>

            . I am shopman to a pawnbroker at Kingsland. On the 24th of October, about a quarter past seven o'clock, the prisoner came and offered a gown to pawn; I knew him before; it was a gown similar to this, but I did not take it in, because it was wet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you open the parcel? A. No sir; I did not, for directly I felt it was so wet, I would not take it; I don't recollect whether there was a wrapper round it or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to swear, that it was a gown similar to that, when you cannot tell whether it was covered up in a wrapper or not? A. I took very little notice of the gown, but I saw it was wet; I don't recollect opening the wrapper; I cannot swear it was not in a wrapper.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How did you know that it was a gown? A. I saw the gown on the counter, but whether there was a wrapper or not, I cannot tell; but the colour was brought to my recollection by the young woman coming to inquire about it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Will you swear that the outside wrapper was not black, blue, or brown? A. I did not take any notice of the wrapper, but I saw the gown; I cannot tell anything about it, whether it was covered up or not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You swear you saw the gown, now if it had been in a wrapper, it must have been opened by yourself, or some one; do you swear that if it was in a wrapper it was opened by some one? A. Yes, and it was a gown similar to this one; it appeared darker than this, but being wet made it appear darker.</p>

             (police-constable N 202). I received information, and went to Charles-street, where the prisoner lives with his father and mother; I saw the prisoner's brother come out of the house with a bundle, and the prisoner followed him immediately; I was in private clothes; I walked down Dalston, and they after me; I knew them but they did not know me; I stopt, and when his brother came up, I asked him where he was going; he gave me no answer; I then asked him if he knew any body who had any rabbits to sell; he said, "My brother William does;" the prisoner then came up, and I seized him; I made a snatch at the brother also; he escaped, but I caught the bundle which contained this gown.</p>

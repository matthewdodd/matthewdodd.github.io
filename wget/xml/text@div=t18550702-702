                  </hi>. I am the son of William Langford—he lives at No. 53, Broad-quay, Bristol, and is a chronometer and watch maker—I was living with him in Feb. last—I was at home on the night of 21st Feb.—the property, a portion of which I have since seen, was all safe that evening—in the course of that night the premises were broken open, and in the morning we missed property to the amount of from 2,700/. to 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—it consisted of 120 gold watches, 100 silver watches, and 100 or more gold chains, and seven gold job watches—my father offered a reward of 200.—we did not succeed in obtaining any information between that time and 21st April—about that time I came to London, and went to the house of Henry Webster, a watch maker, No. 7, Albert-terrace, Camden-town—in consequence of an application of mine to him, he showed me some watches, and amongst them was one that I knew—after some conversation with him, I agreed to purchase that watch—I got it into my possession; I paid 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—this is it—it is one that was stolen from my father's house on the night of 21st Feb.—in this part, where the maker's name is usually placed, the name has been taken out, and a new number put on it—there is no name on it now—the plate has been reduced—the name on it was "William Langford, Broad-quay, Bristol"—I did not see any other of the watches we had lost at Mr. Webster's then—having purchased this watch, I came away—I went again on the following Tuesday, the 24th; I went alone—I did not find any more of my father's property on that second occasion—I went again on the following day, and by my instruction Jack<lb></lb>son and Mason followed me in and searched the house, and in a little nest of drawers on Mr. Webster's work board, I found two gold cases and two movements belonging to the cases—these are them—I have put them together since—the original names have been taken out, and other names put on, and the numbers have been altered, by making "1" into "4," and "2" into "8"—that was all we found—Webster was taken into custody, and taken to the police court—he was afterwards admitted to bail, and then examined as a witness—on Thursday, 26th April, I went with Jackson to the house of a watchmaker named Bartman, No. 50, Compton-street, Clerkenwell—I there found five gold cases and four parts of movements—I am able to identify them as a portion of the property my father losfc—Bartman gave an account of where he got them from—these are them—I have here got the watches and parts of watches that we found at Bartman's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185507020035"></xptr>
               <p>—all of them except one are deficient of the parte on which the names are usually put, or at least where they were put on these cases—I am able to Bay that these watches have had my father's name on them, "William Langford, Broad-quay"—one of them was deficient of the pillar plates, but they were found at Webster's—from what I learned, I went the same night to the house of Gray—Bartman and Jackson went with me—Gray lives on Clerkenwell-green—he carries on the business of a jeweller's tool dealer—he has a shop—there seemed nothing but tools—Gray was at home—Jackson and I and Bartman went as far as the end of the churchyard, iind left Bartman in custody of a constable—Bartman had the watches in tin boxes—Jackson and I went to the iron sate leading to the side door of the house, and Mr. Gray answered it—Mr. Jackson said he wanted to speak to him—he opened the gate, and I said, "I want to buy some crossing files"—that was to get into the shop—he showed us into the shop, and Jackson put the following questions to him: "Have you any watchest" he said, "No"—"Have you had any lately?" he said, Not for many months"—I then gave him into the custody of Jackson—Jackson put the questiont to him again, and told him he was an officer, and he gave the same answers, negatives to all the questions—Jackson then told me to open the front door—I opened it, and called Bartman in, and Jackson said, "Mr. Bartman, from whom did you have those watches you have in the box?" he said, "From Mr. Gray"—Gray said, "Oh, I remember now, I did give then to him"—we then searched the house, but found nothing else—he was then taken to the police court—all the property produced is a portion of what we lost—there are six watches from the north of England, which have been altered—they were sold by Mr. Webster.</p>

I accompanied Mr. Langford in search of this property—on Wednesday evening, 25th April, I went to Mr. Webster 8, in Albert-terrace, Camden-road—I have seen the property that the last witness has identified—that is the property found there—I assisted in searching Mr. Webster's premises, and brought away the pro<lb></lb>perty identified by Mr. Langford—on the evening of the 26th 1 went to the house in Compton-street, occupied by Bartman—he produced this property to us, and gave an account of it—in consequence of what was disclosed there, I went the same evening to the house of the prisoner, about 9 o'clock—I went into the shop with Mr. Langford, and saw Mr. Gray—I asked him if he had any watches altered, or sent any to be repaired in any way—he said, no, he had not—I was in plain clothes, but I disclosed to him that I was an officer—I said, "Be very careful, Mr. Gray; I am an officer belonging to the police; I will ask you again;" which I did, and he said, no, he had not had any watches in his shop for four months—Mr. Langford then undid the front door—the shop was shut at that time—I called Mr. Bartman in—he came, and brought in this tin box—I asked Mr. Bartman of whom he had those watches—he pointed to Mr. Gray, and said, "I had them of Mr. Gray"—I then told him he must consider himself in my cus<lb></lb>tody—I asked him if he had any bills or invoices of either of them—he said, no, he had none—I asked him of whom he purchased these watches—he said, "I bought them one or two at a time, over the counter; I do not know who I bought them of—I took him to the station, and he was after<lb></lb>wards taken before the Magistrate—he was bailed after the examination, and after he got outside he gave a description of a man of whom he said he bought them—from the description he gave me, I told him I knew the man</p>

I was with the last witness on the occasion when we went to Webster's—I did not go to Gray's house—I went with Gray and the last witness and Symons to Bethnal-green, on Friday, 27th April—we met at the Spital-square station, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon—we went to a public house where sergeant Jackson and Gray agreed we should meet—we then went into the neighbourhood of Bethnal-green-road, I think Cambridge Heath-road—we went to a public house——I think the man's name that kept it was Hunter—I think it was the Red Deer, or Rein Deer—I am a perfect stranger in that neighbourhood—Gray left us, and went into the house—it was arranged that if he saw the person there that sold him the watches, he should come outside and speak to him under the lamp in front of the house—he went in the house, and remained a few minutes—it was about 9 o'clock at night, or getting towards 9—we were waiting and watching for him and the man to come out—presently he came out to us—we were a short distance off—he said, "I saw the man in the house, but he has disappeared; his place is vacant, and he has left his glass of what he was drinking standing on the table"—we then remained some time, and he was making inquiries with regard to a person named Day—that was the first time I had heard the name of Day—he said he kept a small tea shop, or was a dealer in tea—I went with him, and he made some inquiries with respect to finding this person named Day—he found the address of the man Day, and after waiting some time it was agreed that Gray and Symons should go to another public house to look for Day—I think the public house was the sign of the Panther—I do not know the name of the street—he was to look for Day, or the person he had first named to us—sergeant Jackson and I followed him, and passed the public house, and near the public house we saw three persons in conversation, the prisoner and Symons, and a third person unknown to us—I was very close to them; in fact if I had put my hand out, I could have touched them—we went about twelve paces beyond them, and turned the corner of a street—after remaining there somewhere about a minute, I should say, Symons came round the corner, and said, "That was one of the men"—Jackson and I followed in the direction where Gray and the other person were going—they went in the opposite direction to that in which we had come—I then started and ran—I could see two persons walking, perhaps sixty paces ahead of me, and they were very near the corner of the street at that time—I ran to the corner and met Gray coming down the street—I turned the corner—they had disappeared from my view; and I met Gray coming to<lb></lb>wards the corner—I said, "Where has the man gone to?"—he said, "He</p>

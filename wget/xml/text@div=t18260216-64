            , who was a stranger to me, and several other persons there; I did not see any dispute between him and the prisoner in the course of that evening; I saw the prisoner go into the tap-room, and take John Murphy under his arms; he carried him from the fire to the street door, and threw him down the steps; this was about half-past ten o'clock - I had not been in the house half a minute - there was not a word said, and no blow struck by any one - John Murphy seemed very quiet - he was standing by the fire, and appeared a little in liquor, but he did not say a word - I came out of the tap-room when he was brought out - the prisoner threw him down the three steep steps at the door - he fell on the curb stone, and the blood instantly flowed from his head - he groaned three times hitterly, but did not speak - he lay there about twenty minutes, when I saw him taken to Mr. Westbrook's, the surgeon, I did not hear the prisoner say any thing all the time -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160047"></xptr>>he went into his house, and brought two rummers from the parlour to the bar - when the man was taken up the prisoner brought out a pail of water to wash away the blood from the door - there was a great quantity of blood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. You did not know the poor man's name? A. Not till I heard it mentioned in the tap-room; the watchman came by, crying eleven o'clock, when the man was lying there; while Mr. Norton was putting him out I went and stood at the door - the deceased did not try to get hold of the door - he had not power to do it - there were very few people there, and no noise in the tap-room while I was there; I went there, at first, to see if my husband's brother was there, and then I stopped at the door to see the man in that state - a great many people stood there, who said what a pity it was.</p>

            . I live in North-street, Globe-lane, Mile-end, and am a stone-mason. I have seen the prisoner two or three times at his own house - I knew the deceased by seeing him on the building where I work - I never spoke to him - I went to the Masons' Arms on the 17th of December, about a quarter past nine o'clock - I went into the parlour - I went out in about twenty minutes or half an hour, and saw the prisoner rush from the bar into the tap-room - I opened this door and looking in saw two men scuffling - one was a labourer - I cannot say whethere they were fighting or not - I did not see the deceased then; I then saw the prisoner take the deceased by the collar and by the back, carry him to the door, and send him off the steps into the street - he had not time to resist nor did he offer - it was done in a moment, and the door clapped to - some persons came in and said there was a man dead at the door - I then went out and spoke to him, but he could not speak; I then lifted him up, but he could not stand; the watchman then came up; I went and got a candle, and saw two streams of blood running from him- one of which was as wide as my hand; I had heard the prisoner say, a few minutes before, to one of the labourers, I will give you sixpence to take him home. The prisoner then called a servant to get a pail of water - he and the servant washed the blood from the door, while I and some others took the deceased to the surgeon's, and I held him while the surgeon examined the wound; the prisoner came there about ten minutes afterwards, and brought a handkerchief, to tie up his head - I suppose some person had been to tell him of it; I staid there while the doctor dressed the wound, and then some persons went away with the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. Was the door shut as soon as the man was put out? A. Yes. Upon notice being given that he was injured, Mr. Norton said he would give sixpence to a man to take him home. It was not by Mr. Norton's desire that I took him to the doctor's - he did not desire to be taken home - he could not speak - I do not know whether Mr. Norton paid the man who took him home - there were several women there, and I know Mrs. Pitman was one - he was certainly very much in liquor - he had been drinking from ten o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the man appear alive when you went to him in the street? A. Yes, but he could not speak; when the wound was probed he groaned - that was all the noise the made.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at Mile-end. I was at the public-house on the 17th of December, and saw the deceased and another drinking together, between seven and eight o'clock, but there was a bit of an objection between him and the prisoner about paying the reckoning; the deceased paid him 1s. and then 6d., and afterwards Norton and a man named Green took hold of the deceased and pushed him out of doors, but that was not when he met with his accident. I was coming home between ten and eleven o'clock, when I saw the watchman, who had got the deceased up, and he was sitting on the step of a door - my master was there, and told me to lend a hand to take him to the doctor, I took him there on my back; Mr. Norton came in shortly, and asked if there was any thing the matter; the doctor, said it was a very serious matter - my master asked if there was much the matter; the doctor said the man's blood-vessel was broken; Mr. Norton said, "If you will take him home I will satisfy you;" I said I would if he could get another sober man, which he did - we took him, but we could not make him speak, and could not find his home; two watchmen came, and we took him first to Ratcliff watch-house, and then to the hospital. Two or three of the doctors came, and said he was very bad.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. The deceased was quite tipsy? A. Yes, when he was first put out, and when I came up the second time he was in the street.</p>

            . I am the deceased's brother. I was at the Mason's Arms that night; my brother was drunk when he came into the house; he and another man had gin and beer till the reckoning amounted to 20d. each - there was a dispute between him and the prisoner about the reckoning; there was a difference of 6d., and I told the prisoner I would pay the 6d. if he would say nothing about it; a man, named Green, then came, and pretended to be an officer. I then went away, and left my brother there. On the Sunday evening following one of the carpenter's came and told me my brother was taken dead to the hospital - I then went to the hospital, but they would not let me in; I went to the prisoner's house, and said I heard my brother was dead, and it was a very sad thing; he seemed very well satisfied about it, as if he had a bullock to kill in Smithfield. I went to the office to get a warrant, but could not. I went afterwards to the hospital, and saw my brother dead; an inquest was held on the Friday, but the Coroner would not examine me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Do you know John Maynard? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, did you not tell him to ask the prisoner to give you some money? A. Nothing of the kind came out of my lips. I never proposed that if money was given I would not prefer my indictment, nor propose not to appear when the bill was found. I preferred the indictment as soon as I heard of the Session coming on. I went to a solicitor down Whitechapel - I did not take my brother away from the house, because I had other business to mind.</p>
               <p>Mr. BARRY. Q. What am I to understand from your going for a warrant directly? A. Directly I heard of my brother being dead I went to Lambeth-street.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Collet-place, Commercial-road. On the night of the 17th of December, John Murphy was brought to my house by three or four men; he appeared to have been intoxicated. I found a confused wound on the upper and back parts of the head, which was flowing with blood; his clothes were very bloody. I conceive that the confused lacerated wound had taken place from the severity of the fall or a blow - he could not speak, but when I probed the wound he made some noise - I was convinced the skull was not fractured; I said no doubt serious mischief to the brain must ensue from the wound; he was taken from my house to go to his home, but the persons could not find it. Mr. Norton came in when he had been in the shop about ten minutes - his house is not more than two hundred yards from mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Are you a surgeon? A. I have not a diploma, but I have served a regular apprenticeship - I have walked the hospitals and practised as such for seventeen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on good terms with Mr. Norton? A. I do not know that I ever saw him before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Supposing there had been a recent fall, were there any symptoms which made it likely that death would ensue? A. No. I said he would never be able to get his bread again; there was no indentation or injury on the skull that I detected; the wound was laid open to the skull, and it was quite visible.</p>

            . I am surgeon of the London Hospital. John Murphy was brought there on the 18th of December - I attended him, but did not examine the head, as it was already dressed. I heard the account of it from the pupil, and I thought the man would certainly recover. I examined his head after death, because his death was to me rather unexpected - he died of apoplexy, which, I presume, took place a few hours before his death - I should think it was occasioned by intoxication and the blow; I should not think the blow alone was sufficient to have occasioned it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was it apoplexy alone, or the effects of the blow? A. The united effects of both.</p>

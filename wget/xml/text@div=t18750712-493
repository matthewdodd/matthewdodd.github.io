                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the Prisoner</hi>). I have Pleaded Guilty to this indictment—Bolwell has been living with me as my wife for about seven months—our banns had been published at the church in the Waterloo Road, and we were to have been married at the time I was taken into custody—I arrived at the Edgware Road Station, about 1.45 on the day in question, and saw Mr. Campbell looking at me—I went from there into the Edgware Road—I was there about twenty-five minutes—I came back and looked into the loophole where they take the tickets and I took a ticket—I came out again and went and had my boots cleaned and walked about for another quarter of an hour—I went down on the platform—I had the coin on me and I went</p>

               <p>up and put it into the watering place and waited there about a quarter of an hour, knowing that Bolwell was going to her sisters and I thought if she had a bag with her I would put them in her bag and ask her to take them with her—she arrived there when I had been there a quarter of an hour and I hung about for a quarter of an hour because I saw Mr. Lucas watching me—I went into the closet and brought them out and asked her for her bag and I put them into her bag and locked it—it had a key to it and I said "Take that for me and go and wait for me in the Edgware Road"—she said "I am going to my sisters"—I said "But you go and wait for me in the Edgware Road—Mr. Campbell then followed her and I came up about five minutes afterwards, and Mr. Lucas was following me, but when he saw I was looking at him he turned back and went on the platform again—we then went into the Uxbridge Road, where I took the bag from her, and had it with me until 8 o'clock that evening when I came back to the Edgware Road, and put it under a gateway and told her to go home—I then went to the office window to Keen and asked him whether he would take the things—he said "No"—I afterwards went home to Millwood Road, and when I got to Loughborough Junction X met Bolwell, and gave her the bag—I then went home and found the constables in the house—she came home afterwards with the bag—she did not know what I had given her—the packets were done up in paper and she did not see them when I made counterfeit coin—she generelly used to go to my aunts and while she was out I used to do it—she was in the habit of paying visits to her sister—she knew nothing about the coin which was found under the mattress—the bed was not made—there are two beds besides the mattress and it was under the second one—right in the middle and when I came in I found somebody had been there before me and the constables knew the exact spot where the things were.</p>

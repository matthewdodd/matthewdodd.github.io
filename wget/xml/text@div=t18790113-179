                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, now residing at Wallington, in Surrey—prior to Midsummer last I was occupying Cambridge Villa, Watford, under the defendant—I quitted at Midsummer, and went to Wallington—the defendant commenced an action against me in the Watford County Court for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for wilful damage and dilapidations—the action was Bet down for trial on 21st October—I instructed my solicitors to defend that action—on Saturday, 19th September, I received this letter through the first post—the name "Owen" on the envelope was doubly underlined—it was not true that I did wilful damage at Cambridge Villa, or that I ever kept a bawdy house—it is a wicked falsehood—I am not aware that the action has been removed into another Court—I think it is in abeyance, I don't know—I know the prisoner's handwriting—this envelope and letter is his writing.</p>

               <p>in it this letter, at least my lawyer did—the action is pending now in the County Court—I am not aware that it has been removed into the superior Court—I did remove it—I have no idea when the case is likely to come on—I attended at the County Court—I believe my solicitor applied that the action should not be heard until I had summoned Mr. Chaplin to the police-court, and it stood over for that reason—I did summon Mr. Chaplin to the police-court at Croydon—I cannot say how long after that it was that the application was made to remove—I was five years at Cambridge Villa—Mr. Chaplin was not my landlord when I went there—he became so during the time I was there—we did not have a good deal of dispute—we were most friendly at first—there was a difference previous to my leaving—my wife did not quarrel, his wife did, and he came to blackguard my wife—it was owing to his wife not keeping her word—I defended the action partly on the ground that difficult questions of law might arise under the agreement made with Mr. King—I believe my solicitor sent a surveyor to Cambridge Villa—I did not go with him—I don't know the surveyor's name, I trusted it to my solicitor—I lived next door to Mr. Chaplin, under the same roof—the houses were semi-detached—the regular postman handed this letter to me; I opened it and read it, and handed it over to my solicitor, and then got the action adjourned.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of light was it? - A. It was rather getting dark; he had the same coat on that he has on now; he told me to deliver my money, and presented a pistol at my breast; he was so near me, that I could have touched him; I put my hand in my breeches pocket, and gave him all the silver I had, which was three shillings; he told me that was not enough, and in case I did not give him more, he would fire at me; I told him it was of no use to fire, or ill use me, I had no more but two or three halfpence, and if he chose to have them, he might have them, and I put my hand in my pocket, and gave him a handful of them; he directly turned round to a poor woman that I had in the carts and told her, if she did not deliver her mo<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140026"></xptr>ney, he would fire at her; the poor woman begged for mercy, and told him she was but a poor beggar woman, if he wanted any thing of her, he must take her matches, and that was all that I saw of him that night.</p>

               <p>Q. How long might this take up? - A. I dare say, five or six minutes, I cannot say particularly, I had never seen him before: On the 16th of December, I saw him go by my window, at Barnet, and I watched him up and down the town, he had a woman with him, they went into several shops; I spoke to

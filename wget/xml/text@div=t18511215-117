                  </hi>. I am a shorthand writer. I was present in the Court of Exchequer on 24th and 25th Nov. during the trial of Boulton <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Healey—I took a shorthand note of the evidence which the witnesses gave on that occasion—I remember the prisoner Boulter being examined as a witness on that cause—I have my notes here (<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>): "<hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS BOULTER</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEA</hi>. You are the plaintiff in this action, Mr. Boulter?—Yes, I am. And you carried on business in the month of June last, and have done so for many years at your house, No. 53, Albany-street, as a fruiterer and greengrocer, I believe?—Yes, Sir, I did. You are also one of the inspectors of weights and measures on your district?—Yes, I am. Now how long had you lived in that house, No. 53, Albany-street, pray, from twenty to twenty—on e years?—Yes, about that time in March last it was. When you first took that house, what rent did you pay?—80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, sir. And had you at that time some back premises which you have not had lately?—Yes, Sir, there were some back premises at that time. Was the rent altered to 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year when you gave up those back premises?—Yes, it was altered from 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year. How long was that since?—Six or seven years. Since that time, since six or seven years ago, your rent then has been 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?—Yes, that rent. How have you been in the habit of paying your rent?—Generally I sent it every quarter; my wife generally paid. Now we understand that a distress was put into your house in June, 1851, in June in the present year, for rent said to be due, amounting to 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.?—Yes, that was it. Now was there any rent at that time due?—Yes, there was one quarter due. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON PLATT</hi>. Was there rent amounting to 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due at that time?—No, my Lord; there was only the rent for one quarter due at that time. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEA</hi>. Do you remember getting this receipt for rent to Christmas, 1850? look at it.—Yes, this is it; it was given in February last. Now did you receive that receipt from the defendant, or was it handed to your wife by him?—My wife paid that money to the defen<lb></lb>dant. Had you just before then given your wife 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay this quarter's rent?—Yes, I gave it her on that day. Whose handwriting is that receipt?—It is in the handwriting of the defendant, the whole of it. Do you remem<lb></lb>ber the words of the receipt? <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON PLATT</hi>. Mr. Pollock had better read it. The receipt was here read as follows: 5th Feb., 1851, Received of Mr. Thomas Boulter the sum of 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the amount of one quarter's rent for a house, No. 53, Albany-street, due at Christmas, 1850. George Healey.' <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON PLATT</hi>. Is it to Christmas last?—<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUMPHREY</hi>. No, to Christmas, 1850, and it may be explained the way in which it came to be so written. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEA</hi>. Now then, do you remember in the month of Aug. last year, 1850, having any application made to you by the defendant, by the defendant's son?—You are right, by the son. Where was that appli<lb></lb>cation made?—In my shop. What was it?—The son called and said that his father had a large sum to make up, and he asked me if I could pay a part of that quarter's rent in advance. When the son made that application to you in the month of Aug. last, what did you pay him?—10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON PLATT</hi>. For the rent pot then due, but for the quarter then running; is that what you mean?—Yes, my Lord; the rent was not due at that time. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEA</hi>. When the quarter's rent became due, what did you pay?—I sent 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the balance of 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and have a receipt for it. Is this the memorandum which Healey, jun., gave you when you gave him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?—Yes; this is the memorandum (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—'Memorandum. I have this day received of Mr. Thomas Boulter the sum of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in part payment of one quarter of a year's rent, for which I intend to give a stamped receipt on pay<lb></lb>ment</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185112150063"></xptr>
               <p>of the balance, Henry Healey, for George Healey.' When the Michaelmas rent became due, was the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the balance, paid?—Yes; my wife took the money; Healey was not at home, and she left the money, and a few evenings afterwards he sent the receipt. Do you know what became of that receipt?—I do not; all the desks were turned out at the time of the distress, and I suppose I must have lost it when the brokers were there. Do you recollect the contents of that receipt?—I think so, very nearly. What were the contents?—It was this: 'Aug. 10th, 1850. Received of Mr. Thomas Boulter the sum of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in part payment of one quarter's rent to Michaelmas; 'and then it went on:' Nov. 4th, 1850. Received also the sum of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the balance of 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a quarter's rent due Michaelmas, 1850. George Healey.' Well, when that receipt came, did you see it, or did your wife take it?—No; I was in the parlour; my wife was gone to bed; she was confined. Was her brother there, Bushell?—No, Butcher. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON PLATT</hi>. Have you searched for that receipt?—Yes, my Lord, but we cannot find it anywhere. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEA</hi>. That receipt came to you in an envelope, did it not, can you find that envelope?—Yes, but we cannot find the envelope. Was this letter with it, did this letter come in the envelope?—I really think it did; I have seen it before, and it is in the handwriting of Healey. Now when the distress took place, did you find some papers strewed about the place that had been in the desk?—Yes; I believe I picked up that paper on the shop floor. Did you know enough of Healey to know what speculation he was in?—No, I never heard from him anything about it. Had Healey at any time prior to the distress being put in, or within three or four or six months of that time, ever made a claim upon you for arrears amounting to 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?—He has never asked me for rent this side of Christmas; I never paid the rent; my wife paid it. Now just before this distress was put in did Healey make any application to you for any arrears?—No, not for any at all. Did he ever claim or say a word about arrears when your wife paid the money?—He never hinted about it, nor did I have any letter. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON PLATT</hi>. He never applied for any arrears of rent, then?—I do not know that he ever asked for a quarter overdue; I do not recollect his calling for any arrears of rent. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEA</hi>. Not any?—No. Now about the time that the last quarter became due, had you seen Healey?—Yes; about four times, I should think, before the distress came in. Had you on any or all of these occasions any conversation with him about the payment of the money?—No, nothing of the kind. Had Healey obtained a tenant for the back premises after you gave them up?—When he took the back premises my tenant was in them, and he remained there for one or two years. Well, did Healey ever get a tenant afterwards?—No, he never did afterwards? Now tell me, had Healey ever given you notice to quit?—Yes; he had done so twice. When was that?—In the year 1848 or 1849, I cannot say which, but I could tell if I saw the notice. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON PLATT</hi>. Why did you not go out in accordance with the notice?—Because, my Lord, he came and asked me to remain. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEA</hi>. Is this the first one, Michaelmas, 1849?—Yes. When was the second?—This is the last notice to quit, at Lady Day, 1851. There was a second notice; this one of 28th Sept., 1650, gives the plaintiff notice to quit and give up his possession at Lady Day next; so that there were two notices of six months, one to quit at Lad; Day, 1850, and the other to quit at Lady Day, 1851; now after having received both of these notices to quit, you, at Healey's request, remained?—Yes, I did. Now when the distress was put in, had you received any notice of it?—No; I was away from home</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185112150064"></xptr>
               <p>at the time. Who was there?—My wife and the lodgers, and my children. What age are your children, and how many have you?—There are four of them, and their ages are from one to four years. How long have you been married, then?—I have only been married six or seven years. Your wife was there when the distress came in; were there any lodgers there also?—Yes, several. Was a Mr. Vasey there, one of your lodgers?—Yes; he has been a lodger of mine sixteen or seventeen years. He occupied the upper rooms?—Yes; he paid 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week. Was there a lady of the name of Buxton a lodger also?—Yes; she occupied the drawing-room and two bedrooms, for which she paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week. Was there a lodger of the name of Nesbit?—Yes; he had gone out as the lady came in; he had been there six or seven years. Has he made application to you since to come back?—Yes; he wanted the floor he had had if I could let him have it. Well, now did the brokers, when they came in, take everything?—Yes; they left scarcely any<lb></lb>thing. As to the furniture, you purchased that from time to time, I suppose?—Yes, we bought it as we wanted. How much did it cost you?—It must have cost me as much as 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Had you any occasion at any time to consider what the value of it was?—No, never. Did you insure it?—Yes, always. For what amount?—For 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of which 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was on my stock-in-trade. Then the whole of this furniture and stock-in-trade were taken away by the distress?—Yes, everything. Have you ever heard what they were sold for?—Never. Have you ever received any part of the money, any part of the proceeds of the sale?—I have never received anything. Were there any things taken which are not in that notice if—Oh, yes. a great many things. Was there any inventory?—I made a memorandum of the things. You say you made a memorandum of the things?—Yes, I did. Have the goodness to look at this paper, and tell me how or when you made that list; was it after the distress?—It was immediately after the distress-van had gone. Now tell me the things that were taken that were not in the inventory? (The witness read a long list of articles which he stated had been taken, but which had not been included in the inventory). Now I understand that those articles you have named were not in the broker's list?—No; there were 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—worth of things taken away which were not in that inventory. What condition was your furniture in?—In very good condition. Now tell me what became of the lodgers?—They, my wife, and all the family, had to get other places, while Mr. Vasey remained with me till the people had removed all. Did this proceeding injure you in your business?—My business! why, I have no business at all now; it has ruined me, and I under<lb></lb>stand my landlord has been to different persons, and been telling different things against me. When these things had been taken away, what had you and your wife to sleep upon?—Nothing but a bag of straw, which we have sown up in a canvas bag; we have nothing else. Do you mean to tell us that at this long period since the distress you and your wife have had nothing more than a bag of straw to sleep on?—Yes; we have had nothing else. And your children, what have they had to sleep upon?—Hay put into a lemon-bag; they get in, and have my old clothes to cover them up with. Then everything that was necessary for comfort was taken away?—Yes, everything. Had you a good business prior to this distress?—Yes, a very good business. Now, before this distress, what was the value of the good<lb></lb>will of your business?—I was offered 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it some time ago, which I told my landlord of.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUMPHREY</hi>. Now, Mr. Boulter, you have occupied this house twenty years, you say?—Yes, Sir. And when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185112150065"></xptr>
               <p>you have paid your rent you have had a receipt for it?—Yes, always. Have you any of those receipts here?—No, I never kept them; I never kept more than two or three by me. No! you have had notice to produce your receipts; have you any of 1848 or 1849; have you any of those receipts?—No, not one of either year. Except the last receipt which you have produced, then, you say you have none?—No, not one. Have you given any receipts or any writings to your attorney?—None but that one. What then has become of the others, may I ask?—I cannot tell. But you have given in one, and have kept the notices to quit, and the other little bit of paper; how comes it, then, that you have none of these receipts?—I do not know; I have not got them; if I had any of them in my possession, they were lost out of the desk at the time of the distress. Have you no book which will show your pay<lb></lb>ments?—No, no books, but a sort of day-book for my customers. lack you any books in which you kept an account of your payments; suppose you paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to any one, in what book did you put that disbursement down?—No, I kept no account of that sort. And you have no book in which you enter what you pay?—No, only what I kept my customers accounts in. Are those books at your house?—Yes, those I saved. Now you say you paid your rent regularly each quarter?—Yes. Now will you undertake to swear, take care, whether since the year 1848 you have paid one single quarter, the whole of the rent for the quarter at once; take care, for it is very important you should mind what you say; have you from the month of Aug., 1848, ever paid your full quarter's rent at one payment?—Yes, certainly, every one. Now, then, let me call your attention to another matter; you have had an action, in which a Mr. Davis was your attorney; now did you not enter into an agreement with Davis to pay his bill of costs by instalments, of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month?—No. Be cautious bow you answer; had you any agreement with that gentleman to pay the costs by instalments?—No. Have you paid them all?—Yes, in twelve months, as I agreed. Where does Mr. Davis live?—In Boswell-court. Did you give a consent to give a Judge's order?—Yes. Now I ask you was not that a Judge's order to pay 52. a month?—I do not know; I paid it all at once. What, do you mean to say that you paid it all at once?—Yes, except what was paid as the case went on. Now you had an action of false imprisonment?—Yes. Now I ask you did you not give a Judge's order to pay the costs due to Davis by instalments of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month? (no <hi rend="italic">answer</hi>) Well, how much was it; was it 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?—Say about 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Was it as much as 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?—Yes, it was. Were you not to pay the amount by instal<lb></lb>ments?—How? no; I paid it all at once. Now attend; did you not, in the year 1848, agree to pay Davis his costs by instalments?—No. No; why, did you not agree to a Judge's order?—Yes, something of the sort. And that Judge's order was given in order for you to pay Davis's claim by instal<lb></lb>ments of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month; was not that it?—I cannot say; I was to get the bill paid in such a time, and I paid it all at once. Now we have been speaking of the year 1850, when your landlord gave you a receipt for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?—Yes. Well, he sent you the receipt you stated, and did he not at the same time write to you this letter? (<hi rend="italic">no answer</hi>) Was not this before Michaelmas?—I think it came after Michaelmas. Was this inclosure to you a notice to quit?—No; I did not receive one. Why, attend; the letter says: "I must beg you to pay attention to the notice I sent you, as I am so pressed by the result of my speculation;" was not that notice here alluded to the very notice?—No. What was the notice to which he begged to call your atten<lb></lb>tion?—I suppose that was a notice to bear in mind that there was an inten<lb></lb>tion to get rid of me; I suppose so; that never came with a notice to quit</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185112150066"></xptr>
               <p>the place. You were so good a tenant that you paid your rent beforehand?—That was what he said. Was that what he said when he gave you notice to quit; had he not remonstrated with you over and over again upon letting your rent get into arrears, and told you he could not permit it, because he had nothing else to look to but his property?—I never heard him say so in my life. How comes it that you have this memorandum of his son's, which is comparatively unimportant, but that you have not any of the receipts?—I cannot say, Sir; it is a hundred to one that I had those. And still have them?—Yes; I picked them up in the shop. Will you swear that every single quarter's rent from Aug., 1848, has not been paid by portions, every single one except this one?—I cannot swear; I will not swear; I do not think it was in instalments previous to that. Will you swear that every single one was not?—Swear it, yes, I will swear that the last five or receipts were not paid by instalments. I will give you the dates. Dec. 1848, 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Jan. 4th, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; March 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,;—May 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; July 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—; Oct. 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; Dec. 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—; Jan. 1850, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I ask you whe<lb></lb>ther every one of these was not paid by instalments?—Let me hear some more of that; I do not recollect anything of these instalments. Upon every receipt you had, was it not entered as he speaks of here; that he entered on the receipt the time at which it was paid?—I cannot say he entered it; I know it has all been paid, and paid in quarterly payments, not by instalments. Upon the receipts he gave you, were there not entered the very days and times at which you paid the money, whether altogether or in portions?—Perhaps there might. Have you any doubt?—I have no doubt he has made an entry of all the sums I paid. I want to know whether upon your own receipts there was not entered the same as on this which you have sent in; whether he did not put on each the day when it was paid?—As they were received they were written; dates put upon them, but there were no instalments paid in 18.50, but the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; all the others were paid quarterly. I have not asked you of 1850, I ask you of 1848?—I do not recollect 1848. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON PLATT</hi>. He swears that the last five were not paid by instalments. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUMFREY</hi>. are quite sure of that? <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON PLATT</hi>. The in<lb></lb>stalments might have been the other way. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUMFREY</hi>. I only want to know whether they were paid in one sum or not. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON PLATT</hi>. He says they were, except the one in August. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUMFREY</hi>. Did he explain to you how it was he gave you notice to quit?—He told me he was a dam<lb></lb>nation fool for doing it, and his friend told him so at the same time; a gentleman of the name of Beale. A damnation fool for doing what?—Giving me notice. He gave you two notices?—Yes, he did. Although you paid your rent, as you describe, always regularly?—Yes. Did your landlord, Mr. Healey, in the month of April, 1851, call upon you, and ask you to pay him some money on account?—He did not. You are sure of that?—Yes. Did he tell you he had made a mistake, he found, in writing the receipt, and that the receipt which said up to Christmas, 1850, should have been Christmas, 1849?—No, never mentioned it to me. He never asked you to pay any money on account to reduce the amount you owed him?—I never knew there was any. Did he or did he not ask you in April, 1851, to pay some money, and reduce the amount you owed him?—No, he never asked me anything of the sort, or any one else from him. You paid his son in August, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which you say was beforehand; I want to know whether after that August his son did not apply to you frequently to reduce the amount of rent you owed his father?—No. You will swear that?—I will swear that. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON PLATT</hi>. I think you say you did not pay the rent with your own hand, but your wife</p>

Did he ever give you any reason for giving you notice to quit?—No, he did not; no more than when I asked why, he said he was a d—d fool, and he was told so at the time; that something struck him at the time that he would do it; that was the only reason. How long have the back premises been unlet?—Since I gave them up.

I have a few houses in Albany-street; amongst other tenants, the prisoner was the tenant of No. 53—the rent, when the premises behind were attached, was 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—after they were detached, the rent was 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was payable quarterly—up to 1846, the prisoner paid his rent pretty well, and in quarters—after 1848, he ceased to pay so regularly, and was getting more and more in arrears—at Christmas, 1849, four quarters rent was due—at Christmas, 1850, before, I was paid 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in Feb., there were seven quarters due.</p>

               <p>that, and I had better go to mine—I then replied that my course was clear—I saw nothing but proceeding by distress for the rent; and in June, I caused a distress to be levied on him for five quarters' rent, the last of which was the March quarter, 1851.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, on the solemnity of that oath you have taken, did you ever receive any money whatever for those quarters from Christmas, 1849, down to March, 1851? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never; not any sum, either in whole or part by him<lb></lb>self, his wife, or any person on his behalf, not any sum nor in any way—10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to my son, on account of the quarter due at Michaelmas, 1849—I did not often send my son to get these arrears—I pretty generally went myself—I received the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which completed the quarter to Michaelmas, 1849, on the 4th of Nov. 1850.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M'MAHON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you explain how you have written in your own book to Christmas 1850, and changed it to 1849? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was what I did write, but I made a mistake—on the 5th of Feb. 1851, receiving one quarter's rent due at Christmas 1849, I put it by mistake 1850—the last entry previous to that was on the 4th of Nov., "Received from Mr. Boulter, the balance of one quarter, due at Mich. 1849, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "—it is not the fact that instead of four quarters being due at Christmas, 1849, there were only three quarters—there were four quarters: I will swear that—I swear that on the 25th of Dec. 1849, there were four quarters rent due to me; I am positive of that, there is no mistake about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In you own book here is "Dec. 22nd, 1849, 53, Albany-street; received 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on account part payment of one quarter due at Lady Day last"—do you now swear that to Christmas, 1849, there were four quarters' rent due? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I should suppose there were three quarters and a part due—the next item in my book is 11th Jan.—it was written on 11th Jan., 1850, or it might be the 12th; it was about that time—on 11th Jan. 1850, there were three quarters rent due from Mr. Boulter—I received 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on 19th March, 1850; 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 10th Aug.; 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 4th Nov., and 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 5th Feb. 1851—when I distrained there were only five quarters due, it was pretty near on to a sixth, but there were only five due—when I distrained on 21st June, 1851, there were five quarters due, and no more; I am sure of that—I have no entries in the cash-book that apply to this matter except such as I have transferred into this book—there are no other memorandums as to the amount of rent due at Christmas, 1849, or 1850, than what you see here—the rent has generally of late years been paid by Mrs. Boulter.</p>

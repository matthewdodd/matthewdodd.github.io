The prisoner came up to me in Church-lane, and said I had got a heavy load, and offered to assist me. Another man walked by his side - he went a good way with me, and I saw him put his hand over the truck. I stopped - he said,</p>

               <p>"Go on," - but I said I could do it myself, and did not want any more of his help - he said if I gave him a pint of beer, he would assist me all the way. I refused. I walked round the truck, and a ham was almost off - I replaced it, went on, and when I got to Tower-hill, in the alley, they were right, but on getting twelve yards further one was gone. I found it at the office - it was about two o'clock in the day.</p>

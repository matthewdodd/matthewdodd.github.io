                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Robert Huggins, a fish-salesman in Lower Thames-street—the prisoner is my cousin—he came to me on the 22d of February, about twenty minutes past 5 o'clock—he told me he was out of work; and while we were talking together I counted some money, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which I put into a canvas bag—I put the bag on a board, and put a book over it—I then just turned my back—I did not speak to any one—when I turned back the prisoner was gone, and the bag and money was gone—I don't think any one could have taken it but the prisoner—I never thought he would have done such a thing—he did not return—I gave notice to the police—I never saw any more of the prisoner till he was in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I did not wish to go into the shop but he asked me. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Yes, I did; you stood outside some time.</p>
               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">EVANS</hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police officer</hi>). In consequence of information, I went after the prisoner—I found him last Thursday evening in Great Suffolk-street, about 8 o'clock—he was leaning against some palisades—I asked him if his name was "Walker, or Holly well?—he said it was not—I told him I thought it was, and I said, "Well, go with me, and if I have made a mistake there will be ample apology made"—I took him to a public-house where the prosecutor was waiting, and he identified him as Richard Walker, who had stolen 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told him the charge—he said, "I know nothing of it; I had heard of it, and I was going to see my cousin in the morning"—I asked him where he bad spent the previous evening—he refused to tell me, or to give me any account of himself or where he had been employed—I took him to the station—he said he thought I wanted him for something else—I found 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, and live at Reading. I think the prisoner was an engineer also—I remember his being married to my sister by licence, in 1842, at the parish church of St. Giles, Reading, in my presence—he had no money with her that I am aware of—I saw her on Monday last—I saw the prisoner in her company three years ago, at my house at Reading—they had a child—he lived with her seven or eight years and left her, and then lived with her again for about a year and a half or two years.</p>

            . The prisoner worked for me fifteen months. Salmon took him from my work on the 1st of December. I am a carman; I have only known him fifteen months, which appears to be all the time he has been in England. I never had a better servant, and would willingly take him again; he was particularly attentive and honest. I believe he has two children, and his wife is pregnant.</p>

I am a foreign importer, carrying on business with my partner at 4, Milk Street—I knew the prisoner—he was in the employ of Peter Jackson, belt and brace manufacturer, of Aldermanbury—on the afternoon of 28th June he came to me and said, "Have you got any of the ribbon in stock the same as the pattern I had a fortnight ago?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I shall not want much to-day; I will only take three pieces"—(I knew that he was in Peter Jackson's employ when he came for the pattern)—I made out an invoice for the three pieces, and said, "Is it Peter Jackson or Peter Jackson &amp; Co.?"—he said, "Peter Jackson"—three pieces are 108 yards, and the value is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I handed him the signature book—he signed this entry (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave him the parcel and he left; but before he was out of the house I went after him and said, "I will come with you to Mr. Jackson, and see if this is correct, because I have heard you have left there"—he owned at once that it was not for Mr. Jackson, and I said that I would give him in charge—he begged me not to do so, and said that he would pay me for the goods—I told him I must give him in charge for the sake of the trade—I thought I was parting with the goods to Peter Jackson—I do not think I should have credited the goods to the prisoner if I had known that they were for his private use.</p>

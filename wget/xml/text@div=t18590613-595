                  </hi>. I lire in West-street, Neckinger-road, Ber<lb></lb>mondsey—on 5th May, I was on a visit at 2, Howard-road, Kingsland, for part of the day—my daughter was with me—a little before 4 in the afternoon we were going to Abney-park Cemetery—I did not know Martha Page before that day—I saw her that day—she was servant at 2, Howard-road—she was not going with as to the cemetery that afternoon, she was only going a little way to shew me the road—just before we were going to start, there was a knock at the door—Martha Page went and opened the door—I did not see who it was until I went to the door to leave; I then saw the prisoner standing talking with Martha Page at the door—he was talking to her when I went out—that was full ten minutes after the knock came, or it might have been a little more than that—I asked the prisoner to let Martha Page show me the road to the cemetery—I am not aware that he made any answer—she left with me and my daughter—we passed between them—she shut the door after her and we all three went on together—I did not see that the prisoner was following us until I heard him speak—I could not judge of the distance we had got—it was across the main road; we had crossed the road from the house, and then crossed the main road—we had been walking about 3 or 4 minutes—when the prisoner came up, he said to Martha Page "Will you tell me where she is?" she answered "No, I will not"—no more passed; he made a step before her, forward, and stubbed her with a knife—he took the knife out of his breast coat pocket with his right hand, and made a thrust at her and stabbed her at the lower, part of her person—he made a thrust at her with the knife three times—I did not see whether the knife touched her more than once, I did not see whether it touched her at all, but I saw the mark through her clothes afterwards—she was standing—she said, "Oh, he has stabbed me"—the prisoner made use of some very low words, I am not aware what they were, they were bad words—I could hear what they were at the time; it was something about his wife being a bad woman; they were very foul words—I could not now on my oath speak the words; I do not remember what they were—he said something about his wife and about her sister as well—after Page had gone one or two steps she was not able to go any further—a policeman came up and she was taken in a cart to the German Hospital at Dalston—I went with her—I never left her until I saw her in bed at the hospital—I saw her undressed there, and observed a wound on the groin; that was in the same part, of the body at which I had seen the prisoner make the thrust with the knife—the policeman took the prisoner into custody on the spot when he came up.</p>

When the knock came to the door, I heard the prisoner talking to Page; there did not appear to be any angry words—I was inside the house, in a room—the conversation between the prisoner and the deceased was at the street-door—I heard them talking, but they were not talking loud or angrily—I cannot tell the subject of their conversation—I did not listen to them—I did not hear the prisoner make use of the words, "My wife" at the door—I don't at all know what they were saying at the door—when he spoke to her in the road I did hear him—he did not repeat the words, "Will you tell me where she is?" two or three times over, only the once—it was not said in an imploring beseeching tone—all he said was, "Will you tell me where she is?"—he made no comment upon the words—it did not strike me from the manner in which the question was put that he had been previously begging of her to tell him where his wife was—I did not know anything of either of the parties—I was not aware that it was his wife that he was asking after—he displayed no anxiety whatever—I am not aware that the deceased's answer was given in a very determined way—there was no appearance of any determination—she did not appear to speak in any way angrily—she spoke very kindly to him and he to her—it was immedi<lb></lb>ately after she said she would not tell him where his wife was, that he made this blow at her—he did not say, "I begged of you to tell me where my wife was; why have you kept it from me?"—nothing of the kind—I am quite positive I never heard those words—he said something about his wife keeping a whore's shop—I do not remember anything more—that was after the blow—I did not mention that before; I did not wish to tell it—he did not say, "This has been all your fault; why have you not told me where my wife is?"—nothing of the kind—he was not excited or in a passion when he struck her—he was in no passion—he did not seem to be in the least passion when he struck her—there was not the slightest manifestation of feeling, passion, or excitement, that I perceived—he did not appear to me as if he was at all under the influence of liquor—he did not appear in an excited state when he made use of the bad words about his wife—I think those words were habitual to him—he did not appear excited in the least—I had never seen him before.</p>

I and my mother were on a visit in the Howard-road on the day this occurred—I did not know the deceased before that day—she was servant at that house—it was arranged that she should accompany my mother and I to the Abney-park Cemetery—when we were about to set out there was a knock at the front door—we were then in the back parlour attached to the house—I could not see the door from there—as we passed out I saw the prisoner talking to the deceased at the door, or just outside the door—I should sup<lb></lb>pose they were standing at the door about ten minutes—I only saw them about one or two minutes, or something like that—eight or ten minutes had elapsed from the time of the knock—I did not hear any part of their con<lb></lb>versation—judging by their appearance they did not appear to be at all quarrelling or angry—my mother asked the prisoner if he would allow the young person to go with us—I did not hear him make any answer—we then all three set out—we walked all three abreast—my mother was in the middle, the deceased was on her right hand side, and I on her left—I did not observe when we left the house that the prisoner followed us—I could not exactly state what distance we had got before my attention was called to him; we left him standing at the door, and had walked about five or ten minutes I suppose; and as he spoke, I turned and saw him behind us—he spoke to</p>

On the afternoon of 5th May, between 3 and 4 o'clock, I was standing at the door of my shop—when I came to the door of my shop the prisoner was standing at the door of No. 2, talking with somebody at the door, which was on the jar—I could not see from the position in which I stood who he was talking with—I saw him there ten minutes—I heard him swear at her, and ask her where his wife was—I believe he called the person he was speaking to a d—b—I could not catch what he said about his wife no more than asking where she was; that was all I heard about his wife—I saw the servant,</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Mary-street, Hoxton Old Town, and am the wife of Samuel Stovell—he is a labouring man—I know the Howard-road—I could get there from our house in about twenty minutes—I lodged at the prisoner's house—he was the landlord of the house—I think I had lodged there about five months before this happened—I knew his wife—she lived with him until a week before this happened—it was through the drink that she went away—he continued to live there—they have no chil<lb></lb>dren—the prisoner used to work at home very hard when sober—he was a very hard-working man when sober—I remember his going out on the morning in question—the first time I saw him was about 9 o'clock in the morning—I came down stairs and found him below—I saw him sharpen a knife—it was a knife like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he was sharpening it on a hone such as he used for that purpose—after he had sharpened it he put it in his left breast-pocket—I had known Martha Page, the deceased, for a short</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185906130043"></xptr>
               <p>time—before he put the knife in his pocket he put a email cork on the top of it, on the point—before he sharpened the knife I had told him that I had seen his wife's sister the night before—he asked me if I had seen his wife—I told him that I had not seen his wife, I had seen his wife's sister—he said, "What did she have to say for herself?"—I said, nothing much to say for herself but she said his wife should nut return to him again—he then said he would look for his wife, and if he found her he would lay her a corpse—those were the words he used—he used some bad language—he also said if he met her sister, and she said two words to him, he would rip her gate up—I begged of him not to do that, and told him he would be hanged—he then went on a great deal, and swore a great deal, and said he would sooner be hanged than be in the way he was then—I am quite sure he said that—it was during the time he was sharpening the knife that we had this conversation—he left the house about half-past 9—that was half an hour after this—he did not do any work that morning that I am aware of—he was up some time before me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The prisoner used to work sometimes at home, and sometimes go out to work, did he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never knew him go out to work—I never said so—he always used to work at home—he had the front parlour to work in—he was in that parlour at the time he had this conversa<lb></lb>tion with me—that was the place where he worked ordinarily—I had seen that knife before—it is the knife he used for cutting—I have known him to go out to buy leather—I never knew him to take the knife with him—I have never paid any attention as to whether he took the knife with him—I had often seen him when at work sharpen his knife on the same place on which, he sharpened it at this time—he might have carried that knife in the same place, and taken it out from his breast when he wanted it, but I do not know—he might have carried the knife in that way before, with the bit of cork on it, but I never noticed it—I believe he had lived about a year in that same house—he was there before me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From the time you came there, to the time his wife went away, I believe he behaved with very great kindness and affection towards her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did, when sober—when he was sober he was a very comfortable man—he was as well conducted, quiet, and orderly a man as ever I saw in my life, when sober—he was given to drink—he then became very much excited, and would be so perhaps for some time after—I never knew that he had received an injury to his head—this is the first time I ever heard of it—hen he drank it affected his head—I never heard that he had received an injury to the head some time before—I have seen his father—I don't know him intimately—after his wife left him he was continually making inquiries about her, and seemed almost mad to get her back to him again—he laid the blame of her going away on the deceased—I can't say that he con<lb></lb>tinually pegged of her to tell him where she was; I have not seen them together—the conversation on the morning in question lasted some few minutes before he went out.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say he was ordinarily well conducted, and kind to his wife when sober. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—when he was under the influence of liquor he was like a madman—I saw him leave about half-past 9 that morning—he was then sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long previously to this conversation was it that the prisoner's wife went away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On Friday, 29th February—she did not go away while he was at work—he was gone out—she went away with the deceased woman.</p>

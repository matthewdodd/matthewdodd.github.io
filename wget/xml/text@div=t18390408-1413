On the 17th of December, the prisoner Williams came and asked if I would take in a piece of flannel—I said, "Yes"—he said, "It is the usual quality and quantity that I bring to your house"—he did not bring it then, but he stepped outside, and Baynton came in with him, with this piece of flannel—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I asked Wil<lb></lb>liams what he wanted for it—he said 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked what quantity there was—he said 138 or 140 yards—I am confident he said that—Baynton was present, but he took no part—I counted the folds, and found there</p>

               <p>was nothing like the quantity he specified—I said, "There cannot be that quantity of yards"—Williams said, "I will forfeit my life if there is not that number"—it was laid in rather better than half-yard lengths—I said I did not consider there was above 90 or a 100 yards—Williams said I was mistaken, they were all marked at the end, and he pointed out to me the mark on the flannel—138 was marked on it in red chalk—I said it was very strange that I could not make that number—he said he would forfeit his ex<lb></lb>istence if there was not that number of yards, which was there marked—he said, "You have taken in flannel of me before, and you never disputed my word before"—he then produced a duplicate from Mr. Jones, a pawnbroker, of a piece of flannel, pawned for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "Your neighbours do not doubt my word, and why should you?"—I said, "Well, as you say there is that number of yards I will lend you 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and to end the dispute, I had better measure it"—he said, no, he could not allow that, as he served shops, the flannel was done up on a machine, and if it was undone, neither he nor I could do it up in the same way again—I said then "You had better take what I offer you"—he said that would not do, he must have more money, he said the flannel was worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—I said then I would lend him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, no, I must make it 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then said, "Well, I will make it the other half-sovereign"—I lent him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and made out the ticket in the usual way, and gave him the money—I did not put the quantity on the ticket—they then left the shop together—this is the flannel—it has been unpacked, and measured since, and it is 88 yards—I had taken in pieces of flannel of him before, and he has taken them out five or six times.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How happened it, as you had all this chaffering, you did not put the number of yards on the duplicate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I supposed I was dealing with an honest man—if I had measured it, I should have done it—we are answer<lb></lb>able for the number of yards we put on—I believe it is the custom of manufacturers who have articles by them, to pawn them for the purpose of getting ready money, and then redeem them—that is the reason I took the prisoner's word.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Summers, a pawnbroker in Bath-street, City-road. On the 4th of January, Baynton came and asked if I would take a piece of flannel in—I said, "How many yards is it?"—he said, "A piece, 138 yards"—I said, "I will look at it"—in a few minute he and Williams came in together, and brought the flannel—I said, "Well, how much?"—Williams said "10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "Who is the owner of it?—Williams said, "It is all the same, this is my son," pointing to Baynton—I said, "Well, there is 138 yards, is there?"—Williams said, "No; 140" I said, "One says 138, the other says 140; which am I to understand?" Williams said, "It is a 138 yards piece, but they always run 140 yards"—I said, "How am I to know there is 140 yards?"—he said, "A piece never runs less than 140 yards"—I said, "What, are you the manufac<lb></lb>turer?"—he said he was, and had been so for years—I said, "I don't like to take it unless I measure it"—he said, "You must not measure it, you will disturb it"—I said, "You are a manufacturer, are you not? you can do it up if I can't"—he said, "No, it is done with a machine"—I said, "Well, you have machines"—he said, "No, there are none in this town"—I said, "Well, if you will not allow me to undo it, I don't like to take it; I know nothing of you; have you a card?"—he said, "No; but here is the ticket of a pawnbroker, who I have been doing business with a number of years"—he showed it me—I said, "Why don't you take it there again?"—he said, "I don't like to take so much to one place"—I said "This has not been out above a day or two"—he then said, "The car<lb></lb>riage conies to so much"—I then began to count the folds, and he stopped me—I said, "We can ascertain a little by that, I think;" and by count<lb></lb>ing</p>

               <p>the folds I made it about 89 yards—he said, "You can't tell any thing by that; I will vouch there is 140 yards, or else I will forfeit my life"—I said I should not like to lend any thing like that upon it—he slid, "What will you lend?"—I said, "Bring me two pieces, and I will lend you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said, "I can't bring two pieces now, what will you lead on this?"—I said, "I will take it in for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard"—he pretended to be astonished at that, saying the value was so much more—he at last left it on what I supposed was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard—he represented it 140 yards, and I lent him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it, supposing it was that—I believed it to be 140 yards, oft his representation, he appearing to be a respectable man—Mr. Summers measured it the following day, and thinking he might be mis<lb></lb>taken, I measured it myself, four or five days afterwards, and made it the same as he did, 90 yards—here is the counterpart of the duplicate, on which I afterwards put the quantity it measured—this is the duplicate I gave the prisoner—I gave Williams 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., deducting the ticket-money—when I gave it him he asked me if would take another piece in in the morning—I said I would ask Mr. Summers, and if he liked to call in the morning, I would give him an answer—I did not see either of the prisoners again till the Monday following, when Baynton brought another piece—I said, "You represented what you brought before as 140 yards, and there is only 90; you know you defrauded me"—he said, "I know there was 140 yards"—I said, "You know there was only 90"—he said, "Then you won't have the other piece?"—I said, "Have the other piece! no, you had better go and mind what you are doing for the future;" and he went away.</p>

               <p>conversation on the subject—Williams then said he wanted 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on each piece, and that I had misunderstood him—I said I could not think of lend<lb></lb>ing 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on each piece, that I did not consider they were of that value to me and I would not take in more than one piece—he said, "137 yards of fine flannel surely you will lend me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on?"—I said I could not—I reckoned it up, and offered him 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—he agreed to take it—I was going to make out the ticket, and I said, "It is rather awkward, how am I to call this a piece of flannel?" and he showed me a ticket of Mr. Fleming's, on which was "137 yards of fine flannel, as marked," and I made mine out the same—he referred me to the mark of 137 on the flannel—I made out the ticket on the faith of what he represented, and they went away—on the same day I received a communication from Mr. Cotton, and just after that Baynton came to the shop again—I was in the parlour—I asked him into the parlour—I said I was very much afraid I could not make the number of yards, I had tried it, and could not make more than 100—he said he was certain there was, and referred me to the mark—he said it was measured in the manufacturing districts—I asked if he would allow me to measure it—he said no, it could not be done up in London in the same form, and it would spoil the sale—I said it placed me in a very awkward situation—he said he would go and speak to his father.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. Did Williams, when you took the first piece, say there was 137 yards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He both pointed to the mark and said there was—I have taken in small quantities of flannel at different times—I suppose this to be worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—I consider at our sale it would fetch that—it is a bad time to sell flannel in January, February, or March, and that I took into consideration, as we should have to sell it at a lower rate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker. I have one shop in Shoreditch, and one in Hackney-road—on the 7th of January I was in my shop in Hackney-road—about the middle of the day the two prisoners came in and brought a piece of flannel, but I did not take it in—it was in flat folds—I forget the sum they asked for it, but it was 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked what quantity there was, and they said the quantity was marked on it, 137, pointing to a red chalk mark on the outer end—my young man was attending to the prisoners, and I asked him if he had measured it—he said, "No"—I said I could not tell what there was without—they said they would not have it measured on any account, as it would put it out of con<lb></lb>dition, and those marks on the flannel were made in the country by author<lb></lb>ised registered men—they showed me a ticket which my young man had given them, and that of Mr. Fleming's.</p>

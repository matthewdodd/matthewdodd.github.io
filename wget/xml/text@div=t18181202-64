I told him to tell the porter, that I was gone up stairs. I was called down by the female servant. When I got into the passage, Mr. Hewitt told me to go to my bureau and see if I missed anything. I had left the keys hanging in the lock of a cupboard, in the servant's hall. I took my key out of the cupboard, and went to my bureau, which stood in the back passage, not in the servant's hall. I put the key in the bureau, and found it was already unlocked. I immediately missed a 5 l. bank-note, which I had left laying open in the bureau, and a 1 l. note under it. I came back to Mr. Hewitt, and said I missed a 5 l. note. He immediately turned round to the prisoner, and said, he must insist on searching him. The prisoner began to pull his things out of his pockets. He at last pulled his hand out of his coat pocket, clenched. Mr. Hewitt laid hold of it, and said, I must see what you have got there. He opened his hand, and took a 5 l. note out of it. He looked at the back of the note, and read the name of</p>

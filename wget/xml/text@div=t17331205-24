            . I have had a World of Wrong done me, my Lord, a World of Wrong, indeed! I bought four Tons of old Iron, my Lord, and eight hundred Weight, my Lord, and a Quantity of old Rags, my Lord, and it was brought to London, my Lord, in Captain Hammond's Ship, my Lord, and, my Lord, it was brought to Iron-gate in the said Ship, my Lord; and so, my Lord, I went to the Custom-house to pay the Juty, my Lord, for, my Lord, I did not know there was any Juty to be paid upon old Iron, my Lord; and, my Lord, the Iron was put into Bray's Boat, my Lord; yes, my Lord, it was put into Bray,s Boat, my Lord, to be carry'd to Mr. Spencer's, my Lord, at Savorie's-dock, my Lord, from Iron-gate, my Lord; for I had agreed with Mr. Spencer for 4 l. 15 s. a Ton, my Lord; and I sold it him three Days before I sent it, my Lord, and Mr. Spencer paid me very honestly for it, my Lord; and it was Mr. Spencer, my Lord, that sent the Prisoner to fetch the Iron.</p>
               <p>Court. If you had sold it to Spencer, it was his Property. But the Prisoner is charged with stealing Goods that were your Property.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050015"></xptr>Williams. Yes, my Lord, he is so, my Lord, and it was my Property, and my Goods, my Lord, and none of Mr. Spencer's, my Lord; it's true indeed, my Lord, and I'll tell my honourable Lordship how it was, my Lord, for when Bray, my Lord, had carry'd the Iron to Mr. Spencer, my Lord, Mr. Spencer would take but 18 hundred Weight, because he said, my Lord, that it was not fit for his Purpose, my Lord, and so I came and call'd a Sculler, my Lord, yes, my Lord, I call'd a Sculler, and Mr. Spencer told me, that when I had paid the King's Juty, my Lord, he would send a Lighter, and fetch the Iron, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. But you said Spencer would have no more of it.</p>
               <p>Williams. O Lord! my Lord, this was before he had the 18 hundred Weight, my Lord, and so when I came to the Water-side, it was 11 a Clock, my Lord, yes, my Lord, it was 11 a Clock, and meeting with Bray, unknown, my Lord, I say, my Lord, Bray, unknown, for I did not know him, my Lord, and I wanting a Waterman to Savorie's-Dock, my Lord, he ask'd me, if I wanted a Waterman to Savorie's-Dock, my Lord, and says Bray to me, my Lord, for Bray was in a small Boat, my Lord, says Bray, Mister Williams, says he, I know you, Mister Williams, says he, and I have fetch'd old Rags for you, says he; and says she, why can't you let me carry the Iron, says he; and so says I, to Mr. Spencer, Mr. Spencer, says I, the Captain makes a sad Noise at me, for letting the Iron lie so long in the Ship, and therefore, pray Mr. Spencer, says I, why don't you take it away?</p>
               <p>Council. Was Spencer with you at the Water-side?</p>
               <p>Williams. No, my Lord, Spencer was not with me, and please my honourable Lordship. But this was after I was at the Water-side, my Lord, and I went over to Spencer, my Lord, and Bray, my Lord, was with me; yes, my Lord, this was afterwards, and Bray was with me, my Lord, and says Bray, my Lord, Pray Mister Spencer, says he, can't I carry it? says he. And says Mr Spencer, Have you got a Lighter? says he. And Bray said, Yes. And then Mr. Spencer bid him be ready by the Ship's side by two a Clock in the Afternoon, my Lord, and I went back with Bray, my Lord, to Capt. Hammond's Ship, my Lord, and Bray went with me, my Lord, and so he went to fetch his Lighter, my Lord, and I stay'd in the Ship, in Capt. Hammond's Ship, my Lord, till four a Clock, my Lord, and then Bray came with the Lighter, my Lord, and I went to Mr. Spencer between three and four a Clock.</p>
               <p>Court. You said you staid in the Ship till four?</p>
               <p>Williams. God save your Lordship, my Lord! no my honourable Lordship, it was four a Clock when I came back, my Lord, for I went to Mr. Spencer, my Lord, and told him, my Lord, that I wonder'd Bray was not come for the Iron, my Lord, and Mr. Spencer bless'd himself, my Lord, to think, my Lord, that he could not have it sent that Night, my Lord, and so he sent another Lighter man with me, my Lord, but when we came to the Ship, my Lord, there was Bray, my Lord, with his Lighter, my Lord, by the Ship's side, my Lord, and so, my Lord, the Iron was put into Bray's Lighter, and he carry'd it to Mr. Spencer, my Lord, at Savorie's-Dock, my Lord, and I went with him, my Lord, and Mr. Spencer took 18 hundred Weight, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Council. As I apprehend it, here was a Contract for the Iron, and a Delivery of it to Spencer's Man. Spencer refus'd part, and the rest that was sent back, was that which Bray went away with: Is that your meaning?</p>
               <p>Williams. No, my Lord, I beg your Lordship's Pardon, I sold but 18 hundred to Spencer; but Bray took my Iron the Day before I went to Spencer.</p>
               <p>Court. The Day before?</p>
               <p>Williams. Ess, my Lord, for I found 5 hundred Weight at Mr. Wood's, at the Faulcon; ess, my Lord, it was the 5th of September at Night, and I found several. Tubs taken from the Iron, as Bray and I came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050016"></xptr> from Spencer's, and says I to Bray, Where's the Tubs, Mr. Bray? says I, my Lord, and Bray, my Lord, was to carry the Iron to a Gentleman in Thames-Street, and upon the 7th of September, I was to carry some to Mr. Harrison, my Lord, and Bray run away from me, my Lord, for he was gone from me, and I could not get a Constable to take him, my Lord. And as Spencer took no more than 18 hundred, upon the 6th of September, at 7 in the Morning, my Lord, by Mr. Spencer's Recommendation, he desired me to go to a Founder, one Mr. Fowler, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Let us understand you, if possible. Did you Deliver any of your own Iron to the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Williams. Ess, my Lord, ess, I deliver'd three Tons and a Quarter to Bray, to bring to Mr. Fowler, thro' Bridge, my Lord, thro' Bridge, and it was put into his Lighter, my Lord, and he said, he could never get thro ' Bridge this Tide, and I got two Men to aid him, to push him thro'; but we could not get thro' for-the Tide was so strong, that it push'd us back again, and then he made his Boat fast on the other Side of the Bridge.</p>
               <p>Court. Then he did get thro'?</p>
               <p>Williams. Ess, ess, my Lord, he got thro'; but that was at two a Clock.</p>
               <p>Council. Did not he make some Excuse, and send you away?</p>
               <p>Williams. O! yes, a great many Excuses, and a Man came to him, and he quitted the Boat, and I staid there most of the time with it when he was gone, and I told him I must go away, and I left the Boat with the Man at the White-Bear, and the Man at the Bear said, the Iron would be safe.</p>
               <p>Council. Who did you leave in Possession of the Iron?</p>
               <p>Williams. No Body, my Lord, I left no Body in Possession, my Lord, but the Man at the Bear, my Lord, said it would be as safe as so much Gold, my Lord, but Bray, my Lord, Bray, took it out of the Ship.</p>
               <p>Council. Now we have got to the Ship again. But who took it out of the Boat at the Bridge?</p>
               <p>Williams. I don't know that Bray took it out of the Boat, my Lord, but Bray took it out of the Ship, yes, it was Bray, Bray, my Lord, Bray took it out of the Ship; and I found 5 hundred and a half at Mr. Wood's, my Lord, and I gave Mr. Wood a Subpoena to be here, my Lord, but he pray'd to be excus'd, yes, my Lord, he pray'd to be excus'd. I have had a World of Wrong, of Wrong, my Lord, a World of Wrong, yes, my Lord, a World of Wrong have I had, and

               <p>Thomas Taylor. My House was broke open on the 5th of May, between 1 and 2 in the Morning, and my Goods taken away. I heard that the Prisoner was in the Compter, and made an Information. I went to him and he readily told me that he enter'd at my Bake-house Window, and then open'd the Street Door and let in one of his Accomplices; and another Accomplice stood to watch, while they brought out the Goods; and he named most of the particulars.</p>

            . I went with the Prosecutor to the Compter, the Prisoner put out a Paper, and said to the Prosecutor, this is a List of the Goods you have Lost. And then shewing his, he added - And these are your Shoes.</p>

            . I heard him own the Fact, and, (shewing his Feet) he said these are Mr. Taylor's Shoes. And (pointing to another Prisoner) That's one of his Wigs upon that Man's Head - And, says he, when I broke into the House, I was afraid Mr. Taylor was coming down; but if he had, he would never have gone up again alive - We put the Goods into Sacks, and so past the Watch in Theobald's Row; but they never offer'd to Stop us.</p>
               <p>This was confirm'd by - Wright, the Prosecutor's Servant.</p>

            , and they told me several Particulars of this Robbery, and the Prosecutor told me the rest, and I having been guilty of some trifling Things, such as picking Pockets and the like, was willing to clear my self by turning Evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Taylor, again. I can't say the Prisoner told me of every individual Particular relating to this Fact; but he mentioned so many, that I thought he could not have known them if he had not been concerned - He was an Evidence against 3 Prisoners last Sessions, but they were all acquitted.*</p>

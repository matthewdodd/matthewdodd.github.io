A man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177902170014"></xptr> came up, and asked my business. I said I had brought Mr. Fasey's linen. He said Mr. Fasey was out, and that he desired him to wait about there till either me or my mother came with the linen; he said he was Mr. Fasey's brother, and lived at London Wall, and he was to take them to his house till the next morning, and if I was going that way, I might go with him. I went with him some of the way, when a man met him, and said Mr. Fasey wondered how he could stay so; and he said to me, boy, how came you to stay so long? I said my mother could not get them done sooner. The prisoner said to me he must have the things, and he gave them to the other man; then he told me to come back with him, that he had got an acquaintance at a publick-house where he must call as we went back. I began to think that they had robbed me of the linen; I said to the prisoner, that I did not think the things were safe. He said if I did not think they were save, I might run after the man; I did run after him, but could not see him; then I lost them both.</p>
               <p>Do you know the persons of those men? - No. I cannot be positive to the men it was so dark.</p>
               <p>If you was to see the man you would not know him? - No.</p>
               <p>Is he like any body in court? - I do not think he is.</p>

I took it on his word; I gave his wife a guinea, and she gave me three shillings change. I sent for the mantua-maker, and gave it directly to her. Mr. Fasey's apprentice went to the mantua-maker's, and saw the gown, and asked her how she came by it. The mantua-maker brought it to Mr. Fasey's house, and the washerwoman got it.

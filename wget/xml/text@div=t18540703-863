                  </hi>. I am a labourer, in the employ of the prosecutor. I sleep in a shed of his—I went there last Saturday night, and saw the prisoner there—I asked him what he was doing there—he said he came to lie there for the night—I said that was not a place for anybody to lie—I told him to come and lie on the green grass—I brought him out of the shed, and told him to pull out some from the side, and make a bed and lie down—about 8 o'clock the next morning I said to him, "Are you going to lie here all day?"—I said, "Are you at work here?"—he said, "No, I can't get work"—he swore at the country, and said he could not get work, and he had no money—I took out a small loaf and gave him half of it, and he went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I slept in the shed also—I saw the prisoner in the morning, and saw the last witness give him some bread—I saw him leave, and shortly after he left I observed some smoke coming from a rick, which was seven or eight yards from the shed—it was on fire at the end away from the shed.</p>

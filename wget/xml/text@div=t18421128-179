                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Hardy, of Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove. About twelve o'clock at night, on the 19th of Nov., the prisoner came to our shop with another man, who called for a cup of coffee—the prisoner said he would treat the other man with it—I turned to get it, and heard something fall—I came back, and saw the prisoner reaching himself from the window—I asked what he had got—he said, "Nothing"—I took him, and he had a leg of pork under his arm—I was going to take it from him, he turned, and it fell on the floor—it was cooked—I called assist<lb></lb>ance, and Arnold came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and carry on business as a book-binder at 50, Moorgate-Street under the firm of Quinn, Rose, &amp; Co.—the prisoner had been in my service eight months up to 11th February—on that day I sent him out to post some letters—I won't be sure that there was one addressed to Collins &amp; Co., Manchester; I don't remember—I did not see him after that on that day—he did not come back to my service—Messrs. Collins &amp; Co. were indebted to me in the sum of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not receive a letter from them on that day enclosing a draft—the prisoner had no authority to open my letters—the endorsement on this draft is not my hand-writing, or written by any one with my authority—the endorsement is "Quinn, Rose, &amp; Co,"—the prisoner had no authority from me to make that or any other endorsement—according to my belief, it is in his handwriting—it is slightly an imitation of mine.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What position was the prisoner in, was he the only clerk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was an assistant; he was not exactly a clerk—there was no one else to help him—he assisted me—he sold everything that was asked for, but he had no management of the business—I was never absent more than one day at a time—no one lives in the house but the housekeeper—if I was away the prisoner would manage in my absence for me—I have never been away for three days together—I would not swear I have not been away two days—the letters were always left until I came back, to the best of my judgment, I believed so, I expected so—the prisoner has never opened letters for me that I am aware of—I remember his father coming during the week that he stayed away—I told his father that I was very sorry for him; I did feel sorry—he did not bring the boy back with him then; he did the fol<lb></lb>lowing week—the prisoner engaged himself as fifteen years old to me—I felt very sorry for him; I don't remember crying—I did not tell his father that I did not restrict him in anything, because I restricted him in opening the letters—I live in the country—I may have been away two days, but not frequently; never been away more—I should have expected the letters to remain if I had stayed away a week—I did not find that he opened my letters for me; certainly not.</p>

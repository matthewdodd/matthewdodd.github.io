I am first-lieutenant of the Woolwich division of Royal Marines—the prisoner is a private in the Deptford detachment of marines—he could have gone to my room if he chose, but he had no business there—he had access to the rooms from the kitchen—on 17th June I missed a gold pin, and afterwards some gold studs, and made a communi<lb></lb>cation to the sergeant-major—I had not used them for three or four weeks—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

I live at 3, Lamb-lane, Greenwich—on 14th June, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I was in a pawnbroker's shop, in Church-street, Green<lb></lb>wich, and saw the prisoner pledging a pin—I went with him to a public-house, and drank with him there—I met him again in the course of the day, and he asked me if I would go into a beer-shop and have a glass of ale with him—I did so, at Mr. Allen's, and he asked me to go with him to pledge some studs—I asked him if they were his own property—he said, Yes; he bought them some time back—I asked him what name I should pledge them in—he said Mr. Brown, and I pledged them for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at Mr. Nash's, in London-street, Greenwich—these are them—I pointed out somebody else as the prisoner, in mistake, a fortnight afterwards, and saw the prisoner the day after that—I made a mistake in the first person; they were very much alike—I am sure I am not making a mistake now.</p>

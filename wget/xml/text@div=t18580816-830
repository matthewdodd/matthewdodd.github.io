                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer—at the time of this robbery, I kept the Bricklayers' Arms in Manor-street, Chelsea—on the 13th July I was at the Admiral Keppel public-house, in Brompton-road; I arrived there from 1 to 2 o'clock in the day—I saw Diggory and Howden there—I had known Diggory for 2 years—I treated them, and in a few minutes Brown and a man named Cole introduced themselves to me—Brown asked me for a job, seeing me in the dress of a bricklayer; I said, "I think I have seen you before, but I have nothing for you to do"—I then observed Brown and Cole making motions to Diggory and Howden—the gestures pointed to me—inconsequence of that, I proposed to Diggory to take her a drive—it was to get away from the company—before I left, I paid for some liquor in presence of Diggory and Howden; in doing that, I produced my purse—I had 2 sovereigns in my porte monnaie—I did not change either of them at that house—I had some silver—I called a cab and got in with Diggory, and she said, "Allow my friend to accompany me"—Howden then got in, and she said, "Allow my friend (that was Lewis) to come in the cab with us; we shall then be four in the cab, a nice party"—she said he was a nice civil fellow—I assented to that, and we all got in and drove on to Battersea-bridge</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160116"></xptr>
               <p>—when I arrived, I saw Brown and Cole on the bridge—I discharged the cab, and I asked Brown and Cole why they were following me—Cole said, "I am not following you"—I then walked on with Diggory, Howden, and Lewis over the bridge, and we went into a beer-house—Brown and Cole followed us in—I did not stay there 5 minutes—I then went to the Prince Albert in the new park—Brown and Cole followed us there—I ordered a pot of porter and half-a-quartern of gin—I put down a half-crown to pay for it—I changed a sovereign, but I can't say where; it was on the Battersea side, I believe—when I put down the half-crown to pay for the liquor I ordered, the change was produced, and I believe Howden took it up, but I was out of the house round the corner—when I came back I de<lb></lb>manded the money, and the landlord told me in presence of the prisoner who had got it—he said, "She has got it," pointing to Howden—I then demanded the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from her—she would not give it up—she refused it for some time—Cole said to her, "Give it him, and we will have the d—d lot"—after some difficulty, Howden gave the change up to me. I think I remained in the Prince Albert a quarter of an hour—I still endeavoured to get out of their way—I slipped away and went into the park, endeavour<lb></lb>ing to get out of their company—before entering the park, I sat down on a seat facing the river opposite to the public-house—Cole came to me and asked me to drink—I told him I wanted nothing to do with his company, I would not drink with him—I went away into the park directly—I did not see whether any of the prisoners followed me—I proceeded on about 200 yards, and the first thing I saw was Cole in front of me—he prevented my walking on the path—I said, "What is it you want of me?"—I was about to force myself by; and while I was endeavouring to pass him, Brown came behind me and pinioned my arms, put his knee to my back and threw me on the ground—Cole fell on me directly—there was Brown on my chest, and Cole on my groin—Cole tore all the front of my trousers up, while Brown held my head and shoulders on the gravel—during the scuffle I had put my hand in my pocket to make sure of my porte monnaie and what little money I had, and I still grasped it in my left hand—while this was going on, I had an opportunity of seeing Diggory and Howden—they were so close to me, that I could not tell who touched me and who did not—while I had my purse in my grasp, Brown made use of the expression "D—n his eyes, he has got it in his fist"—Cole directly grasped my hand, while the other was ill-using me—Brown held on me with his knees, and Brown took my arm, and Cole took the money out of my hand—the two women were close to me, and I called to Diggory for assistance, as she was the only one I knew in all the company—she put her hand on my body, and during the time I believe she robbed me of my silk handkerchief—my handker<lb></lb>chief was gone—by pressing her hand upon me she assisted in holding me down—Howden was close to me; Lewis stood at a little distance—on a sudden they all left me, seeing the park constable running towards me—before the constable came up, I saw Diggory was concealing my handker<lb></lb>chief under her dress, and I said to her, "Give me that if I have lost my money"—she was standing close by, she did not run away—the park con<lb></lb>stable was running towards us—Howden said to her, "D—n him, give him his <hi rend="italic">wipe"</hi>—the men had made their exit when they saw the constable—Brownand Cole ran up the park, and Lewis went back to the public-house—I ran what distance I could; but I was so much hurt, I could not run a great distance—the park constable never lost sight of Cole and Brown till he brought them back—the effects of the pressure I feel now in my</p>

               <p>ribs and loins and in my groin, which I never expect to get rid of—when the constable brought Cole and Brown back, I gave Diggory and Howden in custody; I had not lost sight of them—I came back with the constable and the prisoners to the Prince Albert, and there I found Lewis and I gave him in custody—I had about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my purse—Lewis made his escape during the journey to the station.</p>

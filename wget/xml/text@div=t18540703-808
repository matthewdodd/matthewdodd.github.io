I shall do myself the pleasure of paying the swindler a visit in about a fortnight, to see the piano, maple frame glass, and all other goods sold, that you stole.

               <p>to her, that I swear; I never promised her marriage—my first introduction to her, I believe, was when I was smoking at a cigar shop, next door to hers—I have not been living with the prisoner as man and wife—I have known her, but have never lived with her, or she with me—I have slept with her—I had known her nearly a month before I had any improper intimacy with her—that was at her own house, in Grosvenor-place—I knew her in Grosvenor-place from 1842 to 1851 or 1852—I used to be there continually until she left—perhaps for two years I did not see anything of her—she removed from there in 1850—I occasionally visited her between 1842 and 1850—I cannot say whether she was obliged to remove in 1850, in conse<lb></lb>quence of the premises being about to be pulled down—I have passed the house since, and it has been pulled down—I think it was at the latter end of 1849 that I took Oakley-villa—I have paid many bills for the defendant at Grosvenor-place, but always in her name, not in my own—she got into diffi<lb></lb>culties, and I paid them for her—they were bills in her business—I did not pay them on her premises—she did not pass as Mrs. Newton with my sanction, or to my knowledge; she certainly did not do so to my knowledge—she might have done so—I believe I have some letters signed as Mrs. Newton—I think I never addressed her as Mrs. Newton—I could almost swear that I have not addressed letters to her as Mrs. Newton—I will not swear that I have not—it is since I have been married that she has sent letters signed "Mrs. Newton;" she sent them to my wife, and also to my father-in-law—I will not swear I have not addressed letters to her as Mrs. Newton before I was married; I might have done so—I have never called myself her husband; I swear that; nor did I ever pay bills in the name of Newton—I have paid them in the name of James, and I have bills to show it—I know a person named Weston—he took part of the shop which the defendant had—I let that shop to him, and have the memorandum here—it was not the shop that she had, but the shop adjoining—I advanced a great deal of money to Miss James, and I said to her, "I am not going to be humbugged any further; I must have some security"—she said, "You can have the shop I am about to let, and you can have the rent of it, and have the agreement signed in your name;" and I did—this is it—I have a duplicate of it, signed by Mr. Weston—there was some furniture in the shop and rooms at Grosvenor-place when Miss James occupied them—that furniture was not subsequently sent to Oakley-villa.</p>

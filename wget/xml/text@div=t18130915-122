From suspicion I measured some bed-ticking; the roll contained forty-nine yards. I cut sixteen yards off it. I left thirty-three yards. This was on the shop where the women were at work.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no other woman there but the prisoner - A. There was one. I sent the other woman out. I went out at the warehouse door, and went into my house by the private door. I saw the woman when she came back by the window. The prisoner was left alone in the shop where the ticking was, the thirty-three yards. I went into the shop immediately the other woman returned. There was no opportunity for any person to take the ticking but the prisoner. I then measured the ticking; I missed about six yards and a half; suspecting my women, I determined to detain them when they left work. I sent for a constable. The prisoner went away at seven o'clock. After she had gone about twenty yards I called her back; she came willingly. Read, the officer, was in the shop. When she was brought back, I told her before several of my women that I had lost several yards of ticking. I was determined to find out the thief. The prisoner asserted her innocence, and said she was very willing to be searched. Read searched her in my presence; he found concealed under her clothes two bags of feathers; they were made to fasten round her waist. The bags hanged low, and were not perceptible. She acknowledged they were my feathers; she said she had taken them out of my picking room. The officer then took her into a room to undress her, and when I entered the room the officer said she had confessed where the ticking was, and she would shew us. She went with Read and myself into a back room; there under a shelf she pointed it out. It was six yards and a half, the quantity that I missed. This is the first offence of hers that I know of.</p>

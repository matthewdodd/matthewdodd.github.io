            . The prisoner was in my employ, and was intrusted to receive money - when Wilkinson was in my shop I observed her looking at some flannel and stockings - shortly after the prisoner brought me 5s. with a bill, which I produce - the regular way a bill should be made out by a shopman is describing the articles, and having the articles examined by another young man, who signs the bill: and the custom is to take the bill up with the money, in order that it may be seen to be correct - the cashier was at tea, and I went to the desk to receive the money myself - he paid me 5s. with this bill - I asked him what goods he had sold her - he said, "Four yards of flannel at 1s. 21/2d., and a piece of tape at 2d." - he had made a false bill, and merely said on it, "Flannel 5s.," and it was not signed - I spoke to Wilkinson, and observed two pair of stockings lying on the flannel he had sold her - he hesitated at doing the parcel up - he then called me aside, and said there was a mistake, that the goods he sold her came to 6s. - I said, "You have only brought me 5s." - he said, "Here another shilling" - this bill is in his writing; that which is in pencil; what is in ink is mine - it was not till I had spoken to Wilkinson, and looked at the parcel, I learnt from him that he had sold to the extent of 6s. - he said he had sold her tape, but she had not bought any - the bill merely was "Flannel, 5s." - when I had examined the parcel he said it was a mistake, and it was 6s. - the flannel mentioned at 4s. 10d., and he said there were two pieces of tape, making it 5s. - I found there was no tape, but two pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been in business? A. On my own account about twelve months - I never had a mistake made by a shopman in that way before with the money retained in his hand - I was six years in business before I began myself - I never heard of a shopman making a false bill out - it was his duty to get the bill marked - I was within five yards of him, and generally, when I can, I mark the bills - he never made an excuse for not getting it marked.</p>
               <p>COURT. A. When you asked him what articles had been sold, he said flannel and tape, 2d.? A. Yes; when I ascertained what he had sold, and that it was 6s., he said it was a mistake, and offered me 1s.</p>

               <p>MR. STAMMERS. Q. Did not he say, as if recollecting himself, "Oh, there are two pair of hose?" A. He simply said, "There is a mistake; the goods I sold amount to 6s. - I have another shilling," and gave it to me - I suppose he stood hesitating three quarters of a minute.</p>
               <p>MARY WILKINSON examined. I paid him two half-crowns, and one shilling - I did not receive any change from him.</p>

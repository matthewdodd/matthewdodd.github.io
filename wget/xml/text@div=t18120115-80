I produce the certificate of his conviction, I got it from Mr. Hilditch, the clerk of the assizes for the midland circuit.</p>

            . I am one of the goalers of the office of Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person of the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes, I have known him between four and five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge that he was tried at Westminster sessions any time. - A. Yes, I was present at the time he was tried there for stealing a silk handkerchief; I was present when he was taken from Tothill-fields to be tried; and I was present in the Session's house at the time. I used to attend the Sessions, at that time he was transported for seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. What jail was he returned to from the Sessions. - A. To Tothill Fields first, and from there to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him after he was sent to Newgate. - A. I never recollect seeing him until I was sent for to go to Birmingham, near three years ago, I found him in the jail at Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him to be the same person whom you had seen tried at Westminster. - A. Yes, and under the sentence of seven years transportation.</p>
               <p>A. Did you see him tried at the Warwick assizes. - A. Yes, I was bound over to give evidence against him, and I did give evidence against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the trial at Warwick. - A. Yes, and heard the verdict, the jury returned him guilty.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible that you can be mistaken as to the man. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the next time you saw him after he was tried at Warwick. - A. Never, until he was brought to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, it is not with the intent of denying my charge, that I pleaded not guilty, but humbly hoping there are some circumstances in my case, that deserves your lordship's commiseration. At Westminster quarter sessions I was tried for the attempt of stealing a pocket handkerchief, by only moving the pocket handkerchief from one pocket to another; since my return, which is about fourteen months, I have had the satisfaction to say, that no police officer, or any other, can lay the slightest charge to me; I was, for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150059"></xptr>the first ten months in the country, residing on my friends' bounty, since then I lodged at Mrs. Hoare's, Blackfriers, never quitting her house till seven in the evening to enjoy the fresh air, and invariably returning at nine o'clock. I am by trade a glass-cutter, and should have ever been a useful member to society; I therefore humbly implore implore your Lordship to recommend me. With respect to my doing any hurt to the community, I declare to God I have not.</p>

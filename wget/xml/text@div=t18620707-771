                  </hi>. I live at 6, New York-road, Lambeth—on Saturday night, 21st June, about 10 o'clock, I was in my office, at the end of a pas<lb></lb>sage in my house—I heard a key put in the lock of my front door—thinking it was some member of my family, I took no notice; but as I came out of the office towards the back parlour, I saw some one standing inside the front door, which was closed—I had come from the dark into the passage, where there was a gas-lamp—immediately upon seeing me the party pulled the door a little way open, and ran out—it was the prisoner—I rushed after him immediately, and caught him within a few feet of the door—I brought him in, sent for a policeman, and gave him in charge—he asked me what I had taken him for—I told him I would tell him that when the policeman came—I heard a clink as I went out after him, as if he had thrown away a key or something—I had heard the lock turn, and thought the prisoner was a long time about it, but did not think there was anything wrong—there</p>

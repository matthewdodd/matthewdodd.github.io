Then she was seiz'd by one of them, who pull'd her by the Throat, and knockt her down. Afterwards they thrust some Rags and a ty'd Handkerchief into the mouth of Madam Le-grand, which choked her; then they opened the Bags of money and filled their Pockets, some falling upon the Floor; but away they went, and dropt more of the money in the streets. Mrs. Larroe lay upon her Face through Fear, so could not discover which of them kill'd Madam Le-grand, but she saw her dead within two hours after. Mr. Baker likewise gave an Account, That he saw three men, who lookt very suspiciously, walk to and fro near the House, and did not know them, but John Jewster was not with them; yet afterwards, when he was examined in Newgate, he freely confest the Fact thus: I am not concerned in the Murther, says he, neither was I in the House; but he was consenting to the Robbery, and that he and Butler, Paul Grove, Edward Hinton, and his Brother Francis, were the five persons that did it; and that his Brother William was no ways concerned. This he expressed with great Reluctancy, wringing his hands, saying he was afraid he should die John said, that they were to divide the money the next day, but he would not go to receive his share. Other Evidence was produced for the King, who declared, That the woman, Madam Le-grand, was found lying dead at the bottom of the Stairs in the Kitchen, with her Hands and Legs tied, and her Mouth full of Rags, tied down with a Handkerchief; and that Mrs. Mouth was stopt with Rags too, but not so full as to choke her, and that there was a Cry of Murder. Other Evidence that were there, found Madam Le-grand's Neck tied fast to a Chair, twisted with a Stick drawn through the Chair, which was a most barbarous and ugly sight to behold. As to Butler it was sworn, That he and three more were seen near Madam Le-grand's Door, a little before the Murther and Burglary was committed; and the Sword that was found lying under the Old woman, was the same Sword that one of them had by his side: But there being a Flaw in the Indictment, it was altered, and they were again Arraigned after in the Afternoon, together with

The Evidence was again repeated, as before, and it was very positive as to Butler, that he was the man that came first into the House, and made the Offer to the said Le-grand, about the compounding of the Bond. He would have proved he was in another place at the same time, but could not. John Jewster denied that he was there; but the Evidence was positive that he was walking to and fro before the Door, as if he stood to watch or keep Guard. And being told how that Madam Le-grand was murdered, he replied to them, Hold your Tongue, for there is Money enough. There was no Evidence positive as to Frances Jewster, but presumptive; so the Jury <rs id="t16940711-40-verdict173" type="verdictDescription">

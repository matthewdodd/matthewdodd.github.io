               <p>the step of Mr. Johnson's door quite sharp; I was within ten yards of him; he walked up Bell-lane—I tried the door, it went open, and I then went after the prisoner, took hold of him about thirty yards from the door and told him that I wanted him to come with me—he asked me what for—I told him to come back with me, and I would show him—I took him to Mr. Johnson's door, and asked him if he knew anything of that; he made no answer—I told him I had seen him step from that step; he replied that he came from Fryingpan-alley (he was coming in that direction)—I sprang my rattle, another constable came; we searched the prisoner, but found nothing.</p>

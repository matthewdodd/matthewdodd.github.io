I was in the Liverpool-road, on the 16th of March, and saw the prisoner coming from some unfinished buildings belonging to Mr. Glenn, with a basket—I overtook him, and searched his basket—I found this property—he said he brought them from his master, Mr. Perkins, at Holloway—I should think he was half a mile from Holloway—I took him to the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Northampton-row, Holloway. This ball brush, and pipe, and other things are mine—they had been in a new building in the Liverpool-road, from which the prisoner is described as coming—I had engaged the prisoner as house-painter on the 15th of March, he had not completed the job—he should have come to me on the day he was stopped—he was stopped at twenty minutes after twelve o'clock at night.</p>

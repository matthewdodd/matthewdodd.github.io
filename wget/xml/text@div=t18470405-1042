                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 259.) On the evening of the 31st of March, at half-past eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner in High-street, Poplar—he was coming along with something on his arm under his jacket—I asked him what he had got—he said some nuts and screws—he said he had brought them from Derby—I asked him if he worked for anybody in London—he said, "No"—I took him to the station—he told me where he lodged—I went there, and found he worked for Mr. Wigram—I found these brass nuts and screws under his jacket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman in the yard of Messrs. Money Wigram and Co.—the prisoner was in their employ as assistant to the boiler makers. On the 31st of March he was employed on board an iron boat in the East India Dock—I told him to go the saw and cut off the ends of the screws projecting from the nuts—I told him to take care of them, and take them into the store—he said he could not take care of all of them, for some had dropped—I said, "Take care of what you can, and take them to the store"—he was not to take them away—after he had done that, I put him on another job, at which he would have no occasion to have the ends of the screws or the nuts at all—I saw him on the vessel between five and six o'clock that evening—I know this metal—it is my master's property—these are not the perquisites of the men at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi> When first I began to cut them off, I was working over the engine room; I worked about an hour, letting the pieces fall down and not taking noticed of them; a man came from below, and said, "You must be foolish to let them fall, you will make 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi> or a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi> of them; they are of no use below;" so I put them into my pocket; this man says he told me to take them into the store; I never heard him; I own I brought them away, but I did not know I was wrong.</p>

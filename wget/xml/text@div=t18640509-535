I am single, and live at Chapel-street, St. George's-in-the-East—on 15th April, I was coming up Wells-street with another young woman—a young man was standing at the corner, eating a saveloy—I said to him, "You might give me a bit;" and he said, "Yes;" and gave me a bit, and I gave a bit of it to the other young woman who was with me—the prisoner then came up and called me names; and I said, "What sort is your mother?"—he said, "I will break your jaw if you say that again"—I said, "Do it, then"—he said, "Yes, and I would do it to your brother-in-law too"—he then hit me across the small of the back, and then he kicked at me twice—the first time, he did not kick me; the second time, he kicked me in the private parts—it was a violent kick, and I fell down at once—I bled—there was a great pool of blood when I got up—I was taken to the station, and I gave the prisoner in charge—I was insensible—I was examined by a surgeon—I only knew the prisoner before by sight, by seeing him about the Sailors' Home—I believe he and my brother-in-law had some old disagreement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer, at Wells-street, Whitechapel—on Friday, 15th April, shortly after 10, I was standing at my own door, and saw the prisoner come round the corner of the street and cross over to where these women were standing—he said something to a woman, not the prosecutrix, and struck her twice—she left him, and I afterwards saw him in altercation with the prosecutrix—I then saw him strike her with his fist—she was exasperated with him, and took off her bonnet, which she gave, with a basket which she had in her hand, to the other woman who was with her—she then followed the prisoner, and called him a very bad name—he struck her first, and then kicked her twice in the lower part of the person, and she sank at my feet—I called my young man, crossed over and told a policeman what had occurred—there was a pool of blood on the ground where she fell; the stain is there now—the prisoner seemed excited; he threw himself about as if he was in liquor—he kicked the woman before, twice; she makes a mistake, it was not behind—I was quite close to them—he kicked her twice in the fore part of the person, and stood before her.</p>

I was called by Mr. Withers, and took the prisoner into custody at the corner of Wells-street—I sent my brother-constable to bring the woman—I told the prisoner I should take him to the station for assaulting a woman, and kicking her in the private parts—the woman was brought to the station, and charged him—he said, "Yes, you called me the son of a cow; and I will die for my mother"—he was excited from drink, but was in a state to know what he was about.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110107"></xptr>Q. What do you know of this property that was taken away? - On the evening of the 22d of last month, I was coming down the gateway of our house and just coming to the door I observed my partner with some muslin in his hands, crying stop thief! and looking down the street I observed a man running with another person or two, which I immediately followed nearly to the bottom of the hill; at that time a young man delivered a man to my care.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that man's name? - Evans.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man that was delivered into your hands? - The prisoner at the bar, I have every reason to believe, and he was in my hands but a very few minutes; the young man told me that was the man. I was conducting him up the hill again, in the space of a minute or two a man came up to me, and told me he was a constable in our ward, and asked me if he should take charge of him? I then told him yes; and I immediately delivered him to the constable's charge, his name is Watkinson.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw three men running? - I saw one or two men running down the hill at the time that my partner cried out stop thief!</p>
               <p>Q. You say a man was delivered to you by Evans. Was the prisoner one of those men that were running? - That I cannot positively say; when the prisoner was delivered into my hands, his coat was much soiled, by which it seems he had sell down in the road.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say you saw one or two persons run; the prisoner at the bar, you do not know whether he was running or not? - That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner at the bar was drunk? - He seemed somewhat disgansed in liquor, whether he was drunk or was not I cannot say, or whether it was sictitious.</p>
               <p>Q. You never see the muslin till you returned to your partner's? - No, there were several persons running, it is impossible to see in such a crowd on such a hill as Fish-street-hill, whether it was two or three.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Had the man that you took, hold of any other person near him? - At the time I took him he had none.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that you took, you do not know any otherwise of his being the prisoner than delivering him to Mr. Hassell, and seeing him before the magistrate? Did not you look at him when you took him? - No, I never saw his face, as soon as Mr. Hassell came up I delivered him to him and went in my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person you took, in liquor or not? - I really cannot tell, I took no notice at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he was not in liquor? - No, I will not swear one way or the other, for I cannot.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Bullman. On the 3d of December, between nine and ten o'clock, I was going past the bar into the back-parlour, I saw the prisoner take some halfpence out of a drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she use to go to the till to take out halfpence to give change to the customers - A. Yes. She continued in the bar about ten minutes, some time after I followed her to the cellar-door, her pocket dropped off, the prisoner took the pocket up, and put in the drawer. When my master came down the constable was sent for, and she was taken in custody, charged with having stolen the halfpence; she said, the pocket was hers, the copper she had to pay for her shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any dispute with her - A. Yes, the same morning; we very often used to have words.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and occupy the first-floor front room at 2, New-court, Nicol-street, Bethnal-green—the prisoner lived next door, on the ground-floor. On the morning of 27th Feb., between two and three o'clock, a man named Sadler was in my room—he left me, and went down stairs in his shirt—Mary Day threw his trowsers down after him—I went down to look for a constable, and saw Gibson fighting with Sadler—Sadler came up-stairs again, and Gibson too—he was drunk—he tried to get into my room, but did not succeed—he then went over to Morris's room—I went out, and went down stairs—the prisoner rushed up-stairs into Morris's room, and said, "Oh you b—black mare!"—she ran to the dresser and took up a knife—Morris ran down stairs, and the prisoner after her, and she caught sight of Gibson, who was standing in his shirt, between Nos. 1 and 2 in the court, looking up to the window, and she drew the knife across his throat-Morris was at the bottom of the court, looking for a constable—it appeared to me that in the dark the prisoner mistook Gibson for Morris—when she had done it she said, "Oh my God! I have cut <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi> Gibson's throat"—she was drunk—neither Gibson or the other man were acquainted with her—they did not visit her—she wiped the knife with a piece of cloth; I think a piece of a child's frock, and flung it up into Sarah Morris's room—she then laid hold of Gibson's head and said, "Oh my good God! <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi>, I shall never rest upon my bed again, for I have cut your throat"—Gibson had then gone into the prisoner's room—she took a washing-basin up full of water end flung it up to Morris's window, saying, "You b—black mare, I will give you this in your face,"—the basin fell down on Gibson and smashed to pieces—I do not know what quarrel they had had—Morris was in bed when the two men were fighting—she had no quarrel with the men—I am quite sure it was the prisoner who cut Gibson's throat—I saw the knife in her hand, but she endeavoured to make it appear that Morris had done it.</p>

                  </hi> am a sawyer, and live at 3, New-court. On 27th, Feb. I came home drunk—I saw the prisoner that evening—we Were very good friends together—when the fight was over I was coming in-doors again, and directly I got against my own door I found my throat was out, and I tumbled down—I cannot say whether it was the prisoner did it, but there was nobody in the court but her and me, and she was crying—I was taken to the prisoner's room and laid upon the bed—I heard her say, "I shall never rest upon my bed any more, for, poor fellow, look how he bleeds! look how he bleeds!"—she said, "Dark <hi rend="italic">Sally</hi> has cut poor <hi rend="italic">Charley's</hi> throat with I knife, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it up-stairs again"—she afterwards said, "I have cut his throat with the washhand basin; I did not intend to do it"—I swear she mentioned the word "washhand basin"—she said, "I shall never forgive myself any more"—when the basin was thrown up it did strike me—the instant it Was thrown I found my throat was cut—I do not know what it was cut It—I Was very tipsy—I was in the hospital a month, and have pot been able to work since.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the yard with Gibson, and saw the prisoner draw the knife across his throat—he fell down—about two minutes afterwards the basin was thrown up to the window, and it came down on Gibson's head—it did not break before it hit his head—it was meant for Sarah Morris.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hos<lb></lb>pital. Gibson was brought there on the morning of 27th Feb.—he had an incised wound across his throat—I should say such a knife as this produced would cause such a wound—I should say it was impossible for it to have been done by a basin being thrown up and falling upon him as he lay upon the ground—the wound was about two inches long between the chin and apple of the throat, and about half an inch deep—it wounded one of the branches of the carotid artery—he had lost a good deal of blood when he was brought—he would be very likely to fall instantly—he was under my care for a month.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Gibson told me the doctor had taken several pieces of china out of the poultice applied to his throat, and he had several pieces remaining under his chin. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I have not seen any—I never heard of it till this moment—no complaint was made of the man's head—I noticed no abrasion, of the skin.</p>

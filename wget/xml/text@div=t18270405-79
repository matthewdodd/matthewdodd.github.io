This coat was in my bed-room drawer; the prisoner came in to drink about ten o'clock at night; I was called by a young man, who caught him in my bed-room. I went up, and met him on the stairs; he knocked me down, and rushed out, leaving his hat and handkerchief behind. Mason took the coat from him; he was taken a fortnight afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long have you known him? A. Five or six years; I have two daughters - I never knew of his courting either of them - the eldest is only fourteen years old; she has lost one eye, and nearly another; she was in the bar with me when I was called. I never heard of Mason being my daughter's sweatheart - I do not think he would have her - I never desired Mason to write to the prisoner - I found two of my drawers open, and the coat gone.</p>

I live at Boyle's - he sleeps in the first floor back-room - I found the prisoner in the front room - I had been watching him, and saw him drop this coat on the floor and put the candle out - I am sure I saw the coat in his hand - he had no business in the room - I tried to lock the door on him, but the key was not there - he rushed out - I called Boyle - he threw Boyle down on the stairs and got out, leaving his hat and handkerchief behind.</p>

               <p>T. BOYLE re-examined. He did not call for it, he sent a woman for it, and he was apprehended.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live in Fitzroy-market. I was in Boyle's club-room one night when Mason and the prisoner quarrelled - I heard Miss Boyle, who was on the landing-place, tell Mason to hold his mouth, for her father was coming up - I do not know what that meant - I saw Boyle turn the prisoner out of the club room - he charged him with no theft.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Will you swear he was not charged with going into the bed-room? A. He only told him to go out of the house - I cannot say how long he had been in the club-room - he might have gone into another room without my knowledge - I have seen him in the club-room since this matter happened - I do not know what Mason and him quarrelled about.</p>

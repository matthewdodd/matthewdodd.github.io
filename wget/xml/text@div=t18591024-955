I have forgotten the book; I will show it to you next time"—he ordered of me (<hi rend="italic">Referring to his day-book</hi>) two large gilt frames, with glasses and backs, which came to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the next order was on 31st August—I could not be positive as to whether he came, or sent an order—it was for a large looking-glass, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I should not have sent the things unless he had given the recommendation about Mr. Barclay—he got other goods from me at other times—I credited him right on—he came again to my shop, I should think about a dozen times—he always ordered goods on those occasions, and he always had them—he was always in a very great hurry for them—the second time he came he said that Mr. Barclay had come home and had given him a great quantity of orders—he said, "I shall want a load of things for him, from you"—in consequence of the representations he made, I let him have the goods—altogether he had goods to the amount of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from me—he gave me a reference to a Mr. Crossman, who, he said, was a respectable housekeeper in Walthamlstow—I did not apply to Mr. Crossman—I was fully satisfied with the statements he made about Mr. Barclay and the 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if I had not believed those statements, I should certainly not have let him have the goods.</p>

I am a carrier between Walthamstow and London—be<lb></lb>tween 9th September and 1st October, I took parcels of goods from Mr. Reece to the prisoner at Walthamstow, and delivered them—I could see on 9th September that the goods were frames, and on 1st October they were frames and pictures—I did not observe what the other goods were—the prisoner had a small cottage at Walthamstow, for which, I should think, he paid about 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a month—there was merely a parlour-window in front—he appeared to be doing a very nice trade—he appeared always at work.</p>

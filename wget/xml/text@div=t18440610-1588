                  </hi>. I live in Bedford-place, Kensington—I live on my property. In January last, the prisoner was in distress—I relieved him and on two or three occasions afterwards—on the 29th of May I received this letter,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184406100080"></xptr>
               <p>in consequence of which I gave information to the street-keeper, and desired him to watch my house, and see who came to it that day—in the course of the day I saw the prisoner pass by my gate—I immediately went out to the street-keeper—he was in the street—I waited till he came to us, and said to the street-keeper, "That is the villain, look at him," and when he came close to us, I said, "You villain, you have sent me a most rascally letter this morning," and doubled my fist at him—he said, "I know I did"—I imme<lb></lb>diately said to him, "That is a constable and our street-keeper; now, if you have any charge to make against me, make it, and I will go to the police-office with you"—he said, "I have none to make"—I said, "I insist on it, if you have any charge to make, now make it"—he said, "I have none, I should like to have some private conversation with you"—I said, "No, what you have to say you shall say publicly"—he repeated again that he had no charge to make, and was given into custody.</p>

(that was the name he had given me)—he said, "Yes, sir"—I said, "What in the name of God are you doing?"—he said, "Nothing, sir"—I said, "What a deplorable state you are in," and when he got up he was in such a state I was surprised how he could enter the gardens—the whole of his trowsers behind were completely gone—I took off my coat, and said, "Take this, I will, forgive you"—he said, "I have been among the soldiers, and pawned my things"—I told him to go to my tailor and get his clothes mended, and call on me for work—he got them mended—but never called for work—he came to me another day—he said he was starving—I said he was a vagabond, but I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said if he would go to a house in the city I would put him there till it was let—he went—I said, "You must be there to-morrow morning from nine till five"—I went there in the morn<lb></lb>ing, and the woman said he had left with a bundle—I missed a new shirt, a pair of stockings, some wash-leather, and a few articles I had bought the day before to give to another poor man—I did not see him again till the Sunday after, when I met him in the street—I collared him and said, "You infernal rascal, I will give you in charge"—I got a crowd round me, and seeing no policeman I let him go—he acknowledged he had got the things—he said, "I have the leather at home"—I said, "Where is your home?"—he made no answer.</p>

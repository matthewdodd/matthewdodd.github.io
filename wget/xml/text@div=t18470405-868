                  </hi> I am in the service of John Briggs, a butcher, No. 57, Great Tower-street. On the 5th of March, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in the shop—I had placed three half-crowns on the desk—in consequence of information I asked him to give up the money which I was informed he had taken off the desk—he said he had not taken any—I missed one of the half-crowns.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Before the half-crown was found on me did not you say you did not know whether it was half-a-crown, a shilling, or sixpence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said, "Give up the money," but I did not know what it was till I looked on the desk and missed a half-crown—that was before you were searched.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Carpenter's-yard, St. Dunstan's-hill. On the 5th of March I was at Mr. Briggs' shop—I saw the prisoner come in and look at a piece of beef—he went to the desk, took some money off it, and put it in his coat pocket—I told Bird—I could not see what money it was, but I saw there was money on the desk, and I saw him lean his arm on the desk, take the money, and put it is his left hand coat pocket.</p>

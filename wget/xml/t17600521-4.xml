I staid till my brother went and fetch'd more men. I fixed 2 at the back door; they told me there were 3 men went out at that door; but as they had no tobacco with them, they did not stop them.

I said, now the watch has gone 2, they will soon come if they come at all again. I saw a weight against the door, and the lock lay on the ground, the staple had been forced. Presently I heard my brother's voice; we both went up; and I heard my brother say, you smell strong of tobacco; then I said hold of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176005210006"></xptr> Anderson; they came with us very quietly as far as the warehouses. I said to Groves and Simpson, do you stay and watch here, we will go to the warehouse. When we came to the corner of White Lion street, Holmes made a resistance; I had a sword in my hand, and Cordwell another; we swore we would cut him down if he would not go quietly; he held my sword in his hand, I was afraid of mischief, and drew it threw his hand, and cut it; he was put in the cage, after that I was told he was a milkman, and lived in Church yard Alley. We went to his door, there I found some tobacco, and in his cellar we found the tobacco laid in the indictment.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you judge it had lately been brought in, or had it lain there some time?</p>
               <p>C. Sambrook. I judg'd it had been just brought in.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you distinguish that?</p>
               <p>C. Sambrook. When a hogshead of tobacco is just broke open, it is warm in the inside, and smells a great deal fresher (and so did this)</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner confess any thing?</p>
               <p>C. Sambrook. At the latter end of his examination he own'd to the fact; he own'd they were all concerned.</p>
               <p>Q. What was laid to their charge?</p>
               <p>C. Sambrook. Breaking the Warehouse open, and stealing the tobacco.</p>
               <p>Q. Who charg'd them?</p>
               <p>C. Sambrook. My Brother and I; Holmes was examin'd first, he told us in what manner it was done; then Anderson said it was done with a pick-ax; that there were four of them, some shoved, and some pull'd the folding doors apart, and that he crept in between them, and the use of the pick-ax was to wrench the lock off, I think he own'd he broke the lock off, and let the other 3 in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was no lock at all on the door, if I was to die this moment.</p>
               <p>C. Sambrook. The prisoner own'd, that Holmes stood at the door with a cutlass in his hand, and that he did carry some of the tobacco off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I disown it, I did not carry a morsel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say where he dispos'd of it?</p>

            . I am servant to Messrs. Sambrook. About 1 in the morning I heard a Disturbance.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you?</p>
               <p>Simpson. I was in my room in the warehouse, where I lie.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose have you a room there?</p>
               <p>Simpson. To take care and see that nothing of this kind happens.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see or hear?</p>
               <p>Simpson. I heard a noise, I got up, and found the door put to, and a half hundred weight put against it. I went and told my master; he sent me for other assistance: we met my master and his brother, and the watchmen came with their lanthorns; we went in, and found a whole hogshead broke to pieces, and the tobacco gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the Justice of the peace?</p>
               <p>Simpson. I was; there I heard the prisoner at the bar say, the others held the folding doors open and he went in between, and with a pick-ax wrench'd the lock off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You do not say right, there was no lock there.</p>
               <p>Simpson. There was a lock there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how the tobacco is bought?</p>
               <p>Simpson. The buyer goes first to the merchant, and if he likes the sample then he buys it there, and after that, they compare them with the hogshead when it is weighed.</p>

            . On the 4th of May, between 11 and 12 o'clock at night, one Farrel came into my bed-chamber and call'd me up. I came down stairs, there was the prisoner and the rest, we went all together to Chamber street.</p>
               <p>Q. What conversation pass'd?</p>

             and Anderson said, they wanted me to go with them to get some tobacco there; we went to a pair of doors like barn doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do they belong to?</p>
               <p>Holmes. I did not know then, but I do now, it is the warehouse that belongs to the prosecutors, as they say; one shov'd one door, and others pull'd the other at the bottom, and the prisoner got in between, he had a pick-ax in his hand, and when he was within the inside he open'd the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he open it?</p>
               <p>Holmes. He made a noise, but I being on the outside could not see how he did it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a light?</p>
               <p>Holmes. No, none at all; we all went in and opened a hogshead of tobacco, and took it all out, and part of another.</p>
               <p>Q. How many turns did you make?</p>
               <p>Holmes. I cannot justly tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry it all at 2 or 3 turns?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176005210007"></xptr>Holmes. We did not carry it all at 2 or 3 either.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you begin to carry it away?</p>
               <p>Holmes. As near as I can guess between 12 and one, or about 12, but I did not go with them till the last turn, then I did, and carry'd 2 or 3 leaves in my hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He carried about 4 pounds, he went along with them as a guard, and carry'd none till the last, then he carry'd some.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you carry it to?</p>
               <p>Holmes. We carry'd it into my cellar in Church-yard Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. After this, what became of you all?</p>
               <p>Holmes. We all separated, Anderson and I kept together, we went back to Chamber-street, with a design to put the doors together, that it should not be soon discover'd by the watch; and as we were going towards the place, I saw 2 or 3 men on the outside. I said, who is there? they came up to me. One of them laid hold of the prisoner, and I walk'd on; they did not lay hold of me till we got to where the other 2 men staid to watch. The prisoner ask'd what they wanted with him? they said, you smell of tobacco, and they wou'd tell him by and by; then they took us to the watchhouse, and after that before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in the warehouse declare what you have now, and to whom?</p>
               <p>Holmes. When I was carry'd before the justice, I was charg'd with being an accomplice in taking this tobacco; and then I declar'd what I have now said, and what I know'd, and

             the prisoner could not deny what I said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he own it?</p>
               <p>Holmes. He own'd he went into the warehouse when we pull'd and push'd the doors; he own'd to every thing that I said.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Was there any lock upon the door, or not?</p>
               <p>Holmes. How could I tell that, as I was in the street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>When the door flew open Holmes came in with a drawn cutlass, and said, any man that opposes or interrupts us he wou'd have his life: when the hogsheads were opened there were three men with him.</p>

            . I live in Crawford-street, and am a cheesemonger. About half-past five o'clock I saw the prisoner step into the shop, and take this stuff; I ran to him: he knocked me down, and fell on me - I cried Stop thief! and my master ran out. I never lost sight of him; he dropped the bundle before he was stopped. The officer took him back to the shop.</p>

            . I am a constable. I heard the alarm of Stop thief! I was not far from the shop, on the opposite side of the way - I saw the prisoner running towards me with a bundle, and dropped it in the middle of the road. I stopped him before I lost sight of him - Templeman came up, and charged him with having stolen the property; I took him back to the shop, and showed the stuff to Mr. Dent, who claimed it.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to my master for some work - I ran against Templeman, and threw him down. I got up, and the officer stopped me; Templeman came, and said I had committed a robbery.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HENRY TEMPLEMAN re-examined. The prisoner knocked me down by a blow with the board in the middle of the stuff.</p>

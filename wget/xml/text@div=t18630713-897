                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Glitsenstein, wine merchants, of 63, Great Tower-street—on 7th May the prisoner called at our counting-house—I had seen him on one occasion before—he desired to pur<lb></lb>chase a hogshead of brandy—he gave the name of William Sims—I showed him a sample, which he approved of—I told him that our terms were net cash—he said he would give me a cheque in exchange for the warrant—he said that he had an account with Messrs. Mangles Brothers—on that repre<lb></lb>sentation I delivered the warrant to him, and he gave me this cheque (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>), "London, 12th May, 1863. Messrs. Williams, Deacons &amp; Co. On 14th inst. please to pay Messrs. S. Glitsenstein 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Advised by Messrs. Mangles Brothers." (<hi rend="italic">Signed</hi>). "William Sims."—I presented that cheque at Messrs. Williams, Deacons &amp; Co.'s—it was dishonoured—I parted with the warrant in exchange for this cheque, which he represented to me would be paid on its becoming due—I certainly should not have parted with it if he had not told me he had an account with Mangles.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> All I have to say is, that I bought this hogshead of brandy of Mr. Andrews, and it was a credit transaction, not a cash. I was to pay for the brandy on the 14th May. I told him I was going down to Aldershott, and I offered him this draft, knowing that it would be met in due course, which he took; and I feel certain that Williams, Deacons would have advanced that payment if it had been advised, and the reason it was not advised was because I received a communication from Paris on 13th May about some pecuniary affair, and I wished to raise money, and so left the warrant with the pawnbroker for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

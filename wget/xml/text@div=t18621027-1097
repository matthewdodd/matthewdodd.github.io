On 1st October I was in Murray-street, Hoxton, about 5 minutes to 11 o'clock, and saw a cart there being driven at the rate of about ten or twelve miles an hour—the prisoner and a person, whom I afterwards found to be named Saunders, were in the cart—a female and some boys were at the back of the cart—the prisoner was driving—I hallooed to them to stop, and can after them up the street, but lost sight of them—they turned down one of the by turnings there—I saw the same cart, about a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes afterwards, at the Earl of Durham public-house, in Murray-street—I am positive it was the same cart—a shaft was broken off—no person was with the cart, except a man who was holding the horse—I saw the prisoner, at the side of the public-house, attending to his wife, who was insensible—he was trying to do all he possibly could for her, to assist her recovery—I did not stay till she died—I saw that he had been drinking very freely—when the cart passed me the first time, I saw the driver cut the horse across the back with the whip; that made me halloo to them.</p>

               <p>at my house, 24, Inglefield-road, Southgate-road, which is about a mile from his house—the horse was a very restive one—I know of the prisoner's having that horse and cart before—I have seen the horse shy very often at a piece of paper, or a dog, or a person crossing the road, and there would be the greatest difficulty in keeping it off the pavement—the prisoner, in my judg<lb></lb>ment, was always a very careful driver—I never saw him the worse for liquor, and I have known him nine years—I had to go somewhere and the prisoner said he would drive me up to the City-road, as it was on his way home—his wife was in the cart, himself, me, and three boys—he drove me up the East-road, and as he was crossing the East-road the witness Mullens and another man came out of a public-house, and came off the pavement—the prisoner pulled up as quickly as he could, and pulled the horse round, and the horse went over the man, but the wheel did not—the prisoner did all he could to prevent anything happening to the man—he and I got out of the cart, and we afterwards got in again and went round the City-road and up Britannia-street; he was going to call somewhere—as we came to Eagle-street there was a hoarding with some bills on it, some of which were flying out from the hoarding—the horse shied at them, and ran on the pavement—the prisoner kept him off as well as he could, but when we got to the corner it caught against the kerb, and we were turned over, and were all thrown out—the bills were loose at the bottom—the prisoner did all he possibly could, after the horse shied at the hoarding, to keep it steady in the road, and pre<lb></lb>vent any accident.</p>

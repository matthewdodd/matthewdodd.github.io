On Saturday, the 21st of June, I was in the Strand - I went into the Swan public-house, in Hungerford-market, about four o'clock, or a little after - I know the prisoner - I never saw him before that time - he came in while I was there, and inquired if any gentleman had been there inquiring for any one, for he expected to meet his attorney there - that he had come out of the country on business for an uncle of his, and had a great deal of money to take, and in the course of conversation he said it was a hot afternoon, and he should take something to drink - he began to talk about the boats on the water, what wonderful things they were - then he said his uncle had given him a good bit of money, and what should he do if the attorney did not come - he said, "There is no fear of being robbed, is there?" for his lawyer had told him to keep nothing but gentlemen's company - he pulled out a green pocket-book with three or four notes, which I thought might be Bank of England notes, and he said as he was a stranger, if I would show him a little way about London he would be very much obliged to me - I said I was going towards the park - we went out together, and going towards Charing-cross by a pewterer's shop, he looked at that and asked if that was all silver, and when we got to the horse at Charing-cross he thought that a wonderful thing - we went into a public-house, and had a glass of gin, which he paid for - we walked up Bond-street and different streets - we then went to a public-house and had some gin and water - I do not know what street it was in, nor the house - it was a very large one, like an hotel - I said I wanted to make water, and asked the waiter for a convenient place - he said, "There is a water-closet up stairs" - the prisoner said he wanted to go likewise - I went up and came back - I had left the gin and water on the table - I drank it, and said, "This has a very nasty taste, I don't like it at all" - it was different before - he said, "Never mind, have some brandy and water after it" - I refused - we came out - went to the Duke of Wellington's statue in the Park, and there he tripped my heels up, and away he ran - he took my purse, which contained 3 sovereigns and a half, and the screw of a gun, and he took a 5s. piece which was loose - I gave an alarm of "Stop thief," immediately, and he was stopped by a young man named Garland - there was another man in our company at the Swan, but the prisoner came in there by himself - the other man went with us part of the way, and after having the gin and water I said, "I do not like that gentleman's company at all" - he said, "Well, he has no occasion to go any further, I will call him and pay him for his trouble" - he gave him what I supposed to be half a sovereign, and said, "Take this for your trouble between you - I don't wish people to walk about showing me things without paying them for their trouble" - the other one wanted me to give him 5s. and take the half-sovereign - I said I would have nothing to do with it - I wanted nothing for my trouble - before we got out of that street he came back with the half-sovereign to the prisoner, and said, "If this gentleman won't accept any thing for his trouble, I am sure I will not - take your money again" - he went with us all the way to <placeName id="t18340703-4-crimeloc23">Hyde-park</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did he do any thing then? A. It was done so quick, and after I had the gin and water I began to get so sleepy and so ill, I do not know whether the other touched me or not, but I do not think he did - when the prisoner tripped me up and took my money, I called, "Stop thief," and Garland took him - a gentleman rode up in his chaise and spoke to me - I got up and walked towards the prisoner as fast as I could, but I was so lame I could not walk fast, for he hurt me so in throwing me down I could not walk at all without a stick - as soon as I could walk, I went to the station-house, and gave him in charge - I had seen the policeman come up and take him from Garland, but I was not near him - Garland came back and led me to the police-station, because I could not walk - I did not go there with the prisoner - I saw nothing again except the crown-piece - the prisoner paid for the gin and water and different things which I had.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Did not you pay for any thing? A. No - I am a labourer - sometimes a gardener, and sometimes a bricklayer's labourer - I do what I can get to do - I had no employ that day - I had the day before - I had three sovereigns and a half in my purse, and a five-shilling-piece which was not in my purse - I left home about two o'clock - I fell in company with the prisoner about half-past four o'clock - I had been walking about from two o'clock till then after my business - I went after a young man who owed me some money - I could not find him, but I saw his brother, and he paid me- a young man went into the Swan with me, but I did not know him - I met him in the Strand - I did not know him before - he asked me to go with him, and I did - I had a pint of beer with him - I had had a pint of ale on the road in the course of the day - I had nothing before that - I drank nothing with my dinner - after the prisoner joined us, we went to look at the statue in Charing-cross - he asked my opinion, what I thought - I gave him the advice I should my own children, which was to take care of his property - I did not give him any invitation to come to see me - I do not exactly recollect every occurrence - I will swear I never asked him to visit me.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not ask him to come and dine with you the following Sunday? A. I did not - I said nothing to him about getting married, nor mention a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030006"></xptr>daughter of mine to him - I have a daughter at Van Dieman's Land, and one in this country - she is a widow - I said nothing about her to the prisoner, to my knowledge - to the best of my knowledge, I mentioned no such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You never suggested the probability of his marrying her if he produced a certain sum of money? A. I am quite certain I did not - I do not know that I mentioned my daughter to him at all - I was in Hyde-park when he tripped up my heels - I could not swear that the crown-piece which was found was mine - I had the money in my possession at Hungerford market - it was taken from me in the park - I took it out of my pocket in the public-house - I thought I was going to have something to eat, but I did not call for it, and put the purse back again - I pulled my purse out there, but not the five-shilling-piece - I would swear it was in my pocket - I pulled my purse out to see if I had 6d. in it, to pay for some bread and cheese, if I had it; and I had not one, and did not have any thing - I only took out my purse and opened it, but did not take out the three sovereigns and a half - I saw them there - it was a leather purse with two slides to it - I had saved the money out of my earnings, to pay my rent with it - I saved a little every week.</p>

            . I was in Hyde-park, coming into the park, about eight o'clock on Saturday evening, the 21st of June - I heard the cry of "Stop thief," and saw the prisoner put his hands on the rails and jump over, near the Duke of Wellington's - he came running to the gates - I tried to stop him, and he hit me on the breast - I caught him by the collar of the coat - he said, "For God Almighty's sake, let me go; there is nothing the matter" - he said it was only a fellow wanted to give him a dusting - I told him I should not let him go; that I would help him if that was all - I looked about, and asked him what charge there was against him - he said there was no charge against him - he afterwards said a man there had got a charge against him - he pointed to a man standing against the railings of the Duke of Wellington's Achilles - I took him there to him - he said, "I have no charge against him; let him go" - I do not know who that man was - it was not Tiler - I saw Tiler coming across the green very slowly - he seemed very lame; and at that time a gentleman came up in a cabriolet, and told me to hold the prisoner till he saw a policeman - he said he had seen him rob a countryman - the prisoner heard him say that, but made no answer to it - he told me directly afterwards that he would give me a £20 note, if I would let him go - I said I should not let him go till I saw a policeman, and gave him in charge - the gentleman rode round to look for a policeman - I saw one coming, and the gentleman gave him in charge, and, as the prisoner came through the park gates, he threw down a green pocket-book, with flash notes in it- I saw that done - the policeman picked it up - the prisoner then walked very quietly down Vine-street, Piccadilly, till he came opposite the Duke of Devonshire's house - he there fell on the pavement, and threw down two £20 flash notes - the policeman picked those up - at the time he was on the pavement, he put something into his mouth - what it was I could not see - he was taken to the station-house, and searched - I went with him - I saw him searched, and a crown-piece and a shilling were found on him - Tiler was behind the prisoner, walking as near to us as he could - he was very lame - I did not go back to fetch him - he came in by himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was this? A. A little after eight - it was still light - there was not a person within the park gate but himself - not near the Duke of Wellington's house - I never saw the park so clear in my life - there were people higher up the park.</p>

            . I am a policeman. Garland gave the prisoner in charge to me - there was a gentleman in a gig who said in the prisoner's hearing, as he was close by, that that was the man who robbed the countryman - the gentleman is not here - I understood him to be Mr. Corbett, of No. 2, New Palace Yard - I called on him, but he stated that he knew no more about the case than Garland - I took him to the station-house - after walking about five yards with me he dropped this pocket-book, and a 5l. flash note - I picked them up directly - he struggled very violently - I told him it was no use, he might as well go quietly - and he did so till we came opposite the Duke of Devonshire's - he then made another attempt to get away, and tried to throw me- I seized him by the collar, and in struggling we both fell down together; he on his back and I on my side, and he dropped these two 20l. flash notes - I picked them up - I then heard somebody in the crowd call out, that he had put something in his mouth - I could not succeed in opening his mouth - I put my thumb in his mouth until it bled very much, and I thought it best then to take it out for fear of the consequences, but I could not open his mouth - I could not get it open - I took him to the station-house, searched him, and found a crown-piece, a shilling, and four duplicates - the crown-piece was loose - I saw Tiler almost as soon as I took the prisoner into custody - he distinctly said the prisoner was the man who robbed him - the prisoner must have heard him - I could not perceive whether he was intoxicated or agitated, but he seemed very ill at the time - I did not see any other person in particular near the rails of the Duke of Wellington's house - there were several people, but nobody to recognise in particular.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found no sovereign, nor half-sovereign? A. No.</p>

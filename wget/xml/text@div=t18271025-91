On the 26th of October I went out, about eleven o'clock in the morning, and left 6l. odd in the till of the bar; the key was in it. I returned in half an hour - the prisoner was then sitting in the bar, taking a pint of porter: while he sat there I took 1l. worth of silver out of the bag in the drawer, and expect I left 5l. odd there, in half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences - I do not know how many of each. My wife and daughter attend the bar; they are not here. The prisoner remained there above an hour - I met him in the passage (he had paid his reckoning); he asked me to take a glass of gin with him; I declined. He had been there alone some time - he bid me good morning, and left; I have known him some years. I directly went to the drawer, and found the bag of silver gone; I ran out, and overtook him about two hundred yards off; I tapped him on the shoulder - he turned round, and said, "Is any thing the matter - is not all right?" I said I would thank him to walk back, and he did so - I took him into the bar, and accused him of stealing the bag, which he denied; I said several times, if he would deliver it up I would let him go - he refused. I then asked what silver he had about him - he said he might have 2l. or 3l. worth. I send for an officer, who found 5l. 4s. in silver in his breast pocket - the bag was found in the fire-place, close to where he sat; nobody but him had been in the bar; he said he had brought the silver from Bristol, as Bristol notes would not pass in London. I cannot swear to any of the coin.</p>

            . I am an officer. I searched the prisoner, and found seven half-crowns, seventy-seven shillings, and nineteen sixpences in his left-hand waistcoat pocket, with some tobacco and segars, and 61/2d. in copper in his breeches; he said it was of no use to have Bristol notes in London. I said, "Where is the bag - I must search for that;" he said, "You cannot find it;" it was afterwards found under three or four coals in the stove; the fire was not lighted. The strings which tied the bag laid between his legs where he had sat.</p>

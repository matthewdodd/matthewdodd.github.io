                  </hi>. I am a gardener, living on Bow-common, Bromley New Town. I was in town on the 17th of April, about three o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon and about four or five I was in a public-house—I do not know the name—I was not drunk, but very tired—I went in and sat down—there was no one there but myself—I had seen the prisoner before I went in—she had drank part of three pints of beer with me—there was another party with her, whom I knew, but I had never seen the prisoner before—I had a ring no my little ringer, and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my right-hand pocket—they followed me from the Angel public-house, where we had, been drinking, to the George, and then the other person asked me to give her something to drink—I said I had had enough, and gave them 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get rid of them—I then went on to another house, and there lost my money and ring—the prisoner did not go into that house with me—I did not see her there—I do not know the sign, nor what street it was in.</p>

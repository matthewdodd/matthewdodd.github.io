               <p>I am a pawnbroker, in Red-lion-street, Whitechapel: the prisoner at the bar pawned a watch with me on the 17th of June, between eleven and one; I had never seen him before, but I am certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You are not the master? - I am not.</p>
               <p>Where is your shop situated? - No. 30, Red-lion-street, Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Your master drives a good deal of trade, I believe? - Middling, Sir.</p>
               <p>A great many people came into your shop in the course of that day? - Many.</p>
               <p>You never saw the prisoner before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by your knowledge? - He is the man I took the watch in of.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was it? - I cannot say positively, it was between the hours of eleven and one.</p>
               <p>Might it not be between twelve and one?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179107200030"></xptr>- I believe, as near as I can form a recollection, it was rather before twelve.</p>
               <p>Is there any particular mark or any particular way of knowing the prisoner at the bar; how long might he be in the shop? - He might be in ten minutes.</p>
               <p>What made him so long; was you chattering about the watch all that time? - Nothing particular, but what we ask other people; I asked him if it was his own watch; he said it was; he said he had had it a long while, but he had never pledged it before.</p>
               <p>What did you give him for it? - Half-a-guinea.</p>
               <p>Did you enter it in your book? - I did.</p>
               <p>Have you the book here? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>No, we can never get the book of the pawnbrokers here; what was there about his person that should induce you to know him again; how was he dressed? - He was dressed in a smock frock and trowsers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to Prosecutor. What time did you miss your watch? - Between eleven and twelve.</p>
               <p>How long might the prisoner be, after you missed your watch, before he was taken into custody? - It might be half an hour after eleven.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. He was taken into custody about ten minutes after you missed your watch? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>How long had the prisoner lived with Mr. Lemon, the millwright? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>(The watch deposed to.)</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Petticoat Square, and am a cigar-maker—on the night of the 29th March I was in a barber's shop in Wentworth, Street—when I came out I saw a man named Driscol outside—I knew him before—there were a good many others outside—I saw the prisoner alongside of me—Driscol had his coat off, and wanted to fight—I touched him on the shoulder, and told him to go home—he said he would fight anyone—he punched me on the cheek, and I told him not to be foolish, but to go home—I said "I don't want to fight," and he hit me again-a third time he made an attempt, and of course I defended myself, and I was thrown down by Driscol, and I found my left arm being ripped up—I could not see what it was done with—Driscol had hold of me—I did not see the prisoner at that time—when I was going off to the hospital my attention was called to the prisoner who was in custody, and they said "This is the man that done it"—I went to the station, and Dr. Phillips, the divisional surgeon, was called to, dress, my arm—I was laid up nearly six weeks; it is getting well now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I cannot say whether Driscol seized me by the necktie—I was on the ground—I felt myself being tightened by the throat, and my handkerchief was then cut; it is only a little necktie; I cannot say who cut it; somebody cut the handkerchief—I thought I had left the handker<lb></lb>hief in the barber's shop—I had never seen Carthy before. Solomon Green. I live at 72, Goulston Street, and keep a beer shop—on the night of 29th March I was in Wentworth Street, and saw Mendoza there and a man named Driscol-Driscol was fighting with several-persons—there was a crowd—Carthy was there, and he and Driscol were wrangling together—Carthy was endeavouring to get, his coat on and then he was pulling it off and then on again, and Mendoza came out of the barber's shop and tried to get them away—Mendoza and Driscol wrestled, and they were first down on the ground and then up again—I heard-Mendoza say he was stabbed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. I heard them call out "Cut the handkerchief, or he will be choked"—I heard Mendoza holloa out "I am stabbed, I am stabbed!"—I said to Carthy "You <hi rend="italic">done</hi> that"—he said "I-have got-no knife"—in. the first instance Driscoll wanted to fight Mendoza, and Mendoza tried to get away and said "Well fight for bread and cheese"—I did not hear Carthy say anything—there were 200 or 300 people there—one was talking</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I heard some one say "You are big enough"—I saw somebody with a knife and the same instant the handkerchief was cut Mendoza called out "I am stabbed!"—the man who cut the handkerchief is in Court—I think I said he was a cowardly scoundrel, and he said "I have got no knife"—I should be very sorry to say anything that I was not certain about—that is all I saw—I went with Mendoza to the station—Carthy was dressed in the same manner as he is now, and the man who cut the handkerchief, Barnett, had a white coat on similar to the prisoner's.</p>

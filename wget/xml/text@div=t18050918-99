               <p>Q. The only reason of your apprehending him was because he was a transport? - A. No other reason.</p>
               <p>Q. Now prisoner, if you have any pardon, or any order for your discharge, you must produce it? - A. I have a letter which I had wrote for since I was taken, which I received from the ship (the letter handed to the Court); Mr. Homan knows that I received this letter; I was ruptured by a fall from the fore-top-yard; I was sent on shore as a disabled man, they would not have me any longer; after that, where was I to come but to my wife and family; I am both fractured and ruptured.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Hawker? - A. A navy agent at Plymouth.</p>
               <p>Q. These are not the proper documents; certainly when you were discharged they ought to have given you your discharge? - A. There were more than twenty sent on shore, and they never gave a man of them a discharge; I begged hard, and asked them for it particularly, telling them I was a convict; they considered me being a convict that I had no right to it; Mr. Kirby knows that I had my pardon.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any body to prove that fact? - A. Mr. Kirby could if he was here.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were disabled they would have granted you a certificate of that? - A. They considered my being a convict that I had no right to any thing of the kind; they even told me they would slog me if I came on board again; they told me I was not fit for the service, as I had a fracture on my skull; they sent me on shore on account of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you light of this accident? - A. About four months before I left the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any evidence that I can state to the Jury on your behalf, or any witness of any kind? - A. I have no witness to come forward to state any thing.</p>

                  </hi> I am the son of Francis Manesty Hammond, of the Churchill-arms, Kensington. On the 18th of August, at half-past six o'clock, the prisoner came and left a bottle, and said she would call for it in a few minutes—she came again, and wanted it filled with vinegar, and wanted a bottle of the best rum, for Mr. Smith, of Bedford-place—I know him, he deals with us regularly—I gave the prisoner the rum and vinegar, believing she came from Dr. Smith—she went away—I watched her up Bedford-place—she did not go to Dr. Smith's, but turned into the New-road—I stopped her, and told her that was not the way to Dr. Smith's—she said she was going to call as she came back—she put the rum and vinegar on the path, and said if I did not believe her I might take them myself, and was going to walk away—I said she should not go, unless she went with me—this is the rum and vinegar—(<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

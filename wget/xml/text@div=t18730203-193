                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Paul &amp; Trevor, of New Inn—in consequence of a communication from Colonel Ives I went to Praed Street, Paddington, to the publishing office of the "Paddington Times" and bought two copies of that paper, one of 21st December and the other of 16th December.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first saw the paper of 21st December, I think, a day</p>

               <p>or two prior to my purchasing it on the 23rd—I went to the Police Court on the Tuesday or Wednesday—I did not see the prisoner between the Monday and the time of my going to the Police Court—it is not the fact that in opening the case almost the first sentence of my counsel, Mr. Straight, was that no apology would be accepted—those were not my instruc-tions to him—it was at the close of the case that I instructed him to that effect—I think I can say positively that Mr. Straight did not say that it was a case in which no apology would be accepted—Colonel Ives heard him open the case—I never saw the prisoner before I saw him in the Police Court, nor had I communicated with him—it was not in consequence of Mr. Lewis's manner of cross-examining that I instructed Mr. Straight that no apology would be accepted, but after the close of the case I followed the instructions of my client—nothing was said about two years ago except that it was stated that some attack had been made upon Colonel Wood—I can scarcely form an opinion whether the words in the letter "as you very properly state ought never to have been said "refer to the article in the paper of 16th December; I have some doubt, because the paper of the 16th contains the speech, and the letter of the 21st is complimentary to the editor for not publishing the speech—I know that the letter refers to the article of 14th December—it was read by me on the application for the summons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There was a long cross-examination of Colonel Ives by Mr. Louis Lewis, and it was at the end of that cross-examination that I received instructions from my client that he would accept no apology.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 41, Hereford Street, May Fair, and have been colonel of the 36th Middlesex Rifles between three and four years—their head-quarters are at Paddington—before that I was an officer in the Coldstream Guards, and served in the Crimea in 1864 and 1865—I have the medals of those campaigns—I am a member of several clubs, including the Guards and the Army and Navy—I never knew the prisoner till I had an interview with him to remonstrate with him about another letter in 1869—I then saw him as the editor of the newspaper, and the letter of which I complained was in relation to an order which I had issued—I think Mr. Paul, has a copy of that letter, and also of another one—I complained to the prisoner of that letter, and he assured me of his regret that it had been published, and that it should never happen again, and upon that I became a subscriber to the paper—he also gave me the name of Mr. Hope as the person who had written it—on the occasion of distributing the colours the place was crammed, and a great many ladies and gentlemen were present; there were several wives and daughters of gentlemen in the regiment—I made a speech in which there was not a single word or thought of indecency, or a word that I would not speak now before ladies or before anybody—not a single complaint was made of it by ladies or gentlemen—the letter was mentioned to me before I saw it, and then I read it, and considered the matter with Colonel Burnaby, and determined to take proceedings—an inquiry took place at the Police Court, and I was examined and cross-examined at great length—among other things I was asked whether I was drunk—at the end of the cross-examination on the second meeting Mr. Louis Lewis made a statement in the prisoner's presence, who I saw speaking to his attorney, and at the end of the case the attorney said "Will an apology be accepted?" and after questions had been put, such as "Were you drunk?" &amp;c., I said that I could not accept</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187302030063"></xptr>
               <p>an apology—no apology was ever offered me before the intuiting cross<lb></lb>examination, as far as I know—I have no recollection of Mr. L. Lewis Baying anything after that—I think he shrugged his shoulders—at the end of the second examination Mr. L. Lewis said that he should bring forward the reporters of a daily leading journal and some members of the regiment to justify on the next occasion—no witnesses were called on the next occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was very angry with my cross-examination—I did not lose my temper with Mr. Lewis in the least, but I thought he did not understand me, and I contradicted him—I was asked if I referred to shop boys who ought to be drilled as animals, and if I used the words "little animals"—I admitted that I did, but I did not say that I meant him as well—I said just the contrary, but he had asked if I was drunk—he asked me if I had dined, and I believe he asked me directly whether I was drunk—one of my first answers was "I have not a perfectly dear recollection of what I said, "but I also said that I had a sufficiently clear one—I am certain that Mr. L. Lewis put the question to me "Were you not drunk?"—it was more than asking me if I had dined—his general tone injured me—my recollection was better on the second occasion than the first—I did not take the pains to write my speech—I am not a great speaker—this was at 10 o'clock in the evening—a great many volunteers were there for the distribution of the prizes; they had been there since 8 o'clock—Colonel Wood had spoken and given away the prizes before I spoke—there were cheers, but no violent cheering—I have said that the reporters must have heard indistinctly—I was speaking I should say about a quarter of an hour—what I saw in the prisoner's' paper was very offensive—the leading article was most offensive and untrue—the report of my speech on 14th December was neither agreeable nor disagreeable to me—I spoke more of the army than the volunteers—I spoke of a volunteer life improving their figures and their limbs—the little animals were simply indicated in a French phrase, which refers to little rich idle men who are to be found in the streets of Paris, who are of no service, but spend their time in complete idleness—I did not expect the audience to know about <hi rend="italic">petit creve</hi>—there are forty witnesses here who will say what I did say—when I was painting the picture I did not recommend the former to the consideration of the ladies—I never addressed the ladies till the last three or four words of my speech—I did not recommend to the ladies the manly and vigorous form of the volunteers—I possibly might have recommended the ladies to have a great regard to the military element, but I don't think I did—I presume there is no report of my speech longer than the one the prisoner published—the "Volunteer Service Gazette" gives a report—the "little animal" did cause some laughter—I spoke against the effeminacy of the age, and said that I knew some women who were one hundred times more manly than those little animals, and so I do—I do not know that there is anything wrong in that—I did not refer to Her Gracious Majesty—it is very difficult to know what causes laughter on such an occasion—when you speak to friends they are very apt to receive what you say with kindness—my expressions could only be misunderstood by a foul-minded man—I have never known instances where words used by me have been misunderstood by my hearers; never in the society of honourable men—I did not, speaking of the volunteers, say "Look at their everything," or "Look at their feet and legs;" I may have said "Look at their general appearance after drill"—on my first examination I did admit that I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187302030064"></xptr>
               <p>suggested the propriety of young ladies marrying volunteers, and after-wards I corrected that, and said that I wished ladies to marry men of manly character, but I never alluded to any visible part of man—my impression is that the paper was handed to me the very day I went to see Mr. Paul—I wrote no letter to the prisoner—I subscribed to his paper as a token of my forgiveness—the adjutant will tell you when I ceased to subscribe, because I sent to the office—Colonel Wood is very much my senior in years—I spoke with less energy than he did, I should say—he is a very energetic man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I consulted a good many members of the regiment, and there was no other course—I had appeared as a drunkard in the "Times, "and I thought I should put a stop to that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">CAPTAIN CLARK</hi>. I am adjutant of this regiment—I was formerly in Her Majesty's 108th Regiment, in which I served nearly twenty-one years—I heard the colonel's speech, and paid great attention to it—I have a general memory of it—there was nothing in it but what I should say myself—my wife was present; she is here, and quite willing to give evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know that it was a very jolly meeting, but it was a very kindly one, and we were all in good spirits—I did not take notes—I did not know there would be any libel—I heard the laughter; I have often heard more—the first point which caused laughter was Colonel Ives saying "If you notice a man drilled he looks a man and he looks a soldier, and it is to the credit of the country that he should look so"—he said "Look at the man, look at his head, look at his shoulders, look at him all over, he is everything a man would wish to be"—he did not tell the ladies to look at him too or recommend them to marry him—I do not recollect his saying "little animals," but he said "lumps of men"—he said he should recom-mend the young ladies to marry men of manly character, and I believe the ladies do love men of manly character, for I have got a very good one; I am sure you will be very glad to see her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I went out as a private soldier and rose from the ranks—I have been thirty-six years in the service—there is no word in the British language which could express Colonel Ives' speech as an indecent one, and I consider this is the most blackguard attack I ever met with.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Chippenham Road is about a mile from the office—the prisoner occupies the office—it is shut up at night—it is not a printing-office, only an agent's office for the sale of newspapers and taking in of advertisements.</p>

                  </hi>. I am printer of the "Paddington Times"—the printing-office is at 15, Praed Street—I was there on Friday night, 20th December—I first saw the manuscript of this letter signed "Decency" about 8 o'clock on that evening—it came by a boy who generally brought, the copy from the publishing office—Mr. Ambler was not there at the time—the copy was set—it was not set by me, but I saw it set—I saw the-compositor actually put up the type—the boy's name is James Hazzard—he is not here—I do not think the prisoner was there at all before the publication of the paper—it was printed between 9 and 10 o'clock that night. (<hi rend="italic">The letter was as follows:</hi> "To the Editor of the ‘Paddington Times. '—Sir,—I was glad to perceive that there was one paper that would not lower itself by inserting the after-prize-giving speech of Colonel Ives. It was in every way of a doubtful character; it was in unquestionably bad taste, and such as you very properly state ought never to have been said. Having once begun to slide downwards, he appeared to enjoy his improper remarks, and I can assure you that the opinion of the men was anything but gratifying. How a man like Colonel Ives should lower himself to pander to a prurient taste is extraordinary. He must be aware such a speech could not in any way exalt him with all right-minded people, and those volunteers who had their sisters or female relatives there could and did have but one opinion of what Colonel Ives said. It was a gross insult to them, and if the Colonel was flattered by the laughter of the men, he may rest assured that there would be but one idea of what was said during that evening by the Colonel of the Paddington Rifles, and that was of the most thorough disgust and contempt.—Your obedient servant, <hi rend="smallCaps">DECENCY.

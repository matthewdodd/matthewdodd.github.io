On the 14th of July, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoners, Sanders and Reading, came into my shop to match a piece of print like a gown one had on, another girl was with them-it was not Gould; I had not got the pattern, they asked to see some others; I showed them several, they said none would suit, as they wanted the exact pattern - They all three went out together; in about five minutes I missed a scarf, which I was marking when they came in, I told Wood to follow them; he returned, and said they were in the next linen-draper's shop - I sent him to fetch them. Gould was brought in immediately; as she came in I saw the scarf lying on the floor where she had passed.</p>
               <p>JAMES HODGETTS. I am a linen-draper, and live in Crown-street, Finsbury-square, near the prosecutor. On the 14th of July, Reading and Sanders came into my shop with another girl, not in custody. I afterwards saw the scarf on the ground in Mr. Cater's shop. Gould had been in my shop, but did not come in with them.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WOOD. I am shopman to Mr. Cater. I saw the women come in, we afterwards missed a scarf, my master sent me after them; I saw them coming out of another shop a few doors lower, I took either Reading or Sanders-the other two ran away. I went and took Gould in Moorfields, about ten minutes after, with the calico; I brought her back to the shop, the scarf dropped from her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, residing at Portsea. On the 8th of June I sent a letter directed to Messrs. Collard and Furbur, refiners, No. 17, Jewin-street, Cripplegate, and enclosed in it a gold medal, on one side of which was an effigy of Charles the Tenth, King of the French—I did not take particular notice of what was on the reverse side—I can hardly say what was on it, it being some time since, I forget—I do not know whether it was of the French or English alloy—I do not know the exact weight—I took no memorandum of the weight—before I sent the medal away, I made a mark with a file on the edge, and tried it with aquafortis—I have tested the medal now produced, since, in the same way, and it is precisely the same quality, as far as the test of aquafortis will prove, and I believe it is the same piece of gold, for that reason—I gave the letter to my assistant to take to the Post-office.</p>

                  </hi>. I belong to the British Museum, in the depart<lb></lb>ment of antiquities, which embraces the coin department—I have looked at this piece of gold very minutely—it presents the appearance of a struck medal, hammered out—I can discern a fleur-de-lis on this medal, and two capital letter E's—in the field of the medal there is the appearance of the letter M, and the edge appears to have been rather raised—it has been battered down, but there is the appearance of the rim—medals are gets rally made with raised rims—it has every appearance of having been battered down—I have examined the medal with one of the hammers produced, and it would make the same impression on that piece of gold—a piece of copper has been shown to me, on which the hammer has been used, and it bears the same mark as on the gold—the reverse side is that on which the cuts have been, and here is the indication of the fleur-de-lis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you first examine it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was brought to the Museum about a fortnight ago—I was not examined be<lb></lb>fore the Magistrate, nor required to be in attendance on any occasion but the present.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">HARVELL</hi>. The prisoner lodged at my house in August last—I have lent him a hammer on many occasions, and I have heard ham<lb></lb>mering up stairs—there was only him and his wife lodging in the two Looms, and in those rooms I have heard the hammering—this is the ham<lb></lb>mer I lent him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you able to say he was at hale when you heard the hammering? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I cannot say what day it was, nor what month—I had no reason to remark, not having any suspicion—I was not before the Magistrate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>. I have seen this hammer in Court this morning—it is the hammer which produced the marks on the gold and copper likewise—I cannot say who made the marks on the copper—the policeman showed it me this morning—I have not the slightest doubt this gold has been beaten with that hammer—there is a particular mark of a small stroke on the hammer, which corresponds precisely.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 79, London Wall, and am carman to Samuel Tyrrell, who is porter to Mr. Eaton, of No. 33, Old Broad-street. On Tuesday afternoon, 13th Jan., from 5 o'clock to half past, I had some bales of silk in my possession, in wrappers, in a covered van—I took the van to Little Love-lane, Wood-street—I stopped at a warehouse, and unloaded ten bales there out of thirty-three that I had got—they were delivered on a man's back from the back of the van—I did not leave the van a moment—I was inside it, to put the bales on the man's back—the van was not there more than 10 minutes—it is always my practice to fasten the back of the van up after delivering goods—I did so on that occasion—I got out of the van, and went to the back to fasten it up—I then got on the van, and looked for my whip—I could not find it—I looked about and found it about ten yards up the lane—Mr. Eaton's porter was with me—while feeling about for my whip, I missed a bale of silk from the corner of the van.</p>

From information, I went on Tuesday, 13th Jan., to Mr. Eaton's warehouse, and on Friday, the 16th, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon, I went with Bull to Spital-square—I saw the prisoner in White Lion-street—he had this parcel—there was no one with him—he went into a public house called Job's Castle—I and Bull, who were both in plain clothes, went in after him—he had some refreshment, and some conversation with some other persons, who asked him if he had got silk in the parcel—he said, "Yes; a piece of silk;" the persons said, "Silk is going up "—he said, "Yes; it has got very much dearer of late "—he left the house, and I and Bull followed him—he walked through various streets till he got to Bishopsgate-street—he called a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and got in—we called another <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and followed him—he went to No. 14, Hatton-garden—when he alighted we alighted, and as he was going in at the door I took hold of his arm, and said, "We are two police officers, is that parcel your property?"—he said, "It is"—I said, "I think it contains silk, does it not?"—he said, "It does"—I said, "I believe it is stolen property; how do you account for the possession of it "—he said, "That is my business "—we went into the house, and he went into the back room on the ground floor—there is a cupboard in that room, which forms something like a dresser—on entering the room I saw an immense quantity of silk lying on that cupboard—I said, "Here is the remainder of the silk we are looking for"—it was covered with part of a newspaper—I said, "How do you account for the possession of this "—he said, "I shall answer no questions "—I said, "You may consider yourself in custody for being in possession of this silk, and not giving a satisfactory account of it; we believe it to be stolen property, you have an opportunity of telling us who you received it of, if you think proper to do so "—he then said, "I received it from a person of the name of Bacon "—I said, "What Bacon?"—he said, "Bacon, of Anchor-street, Spitalfields; it was left here on Wednesday afternoon; I was not at home "—I asked him if he had seen Bacon since that time, since the silk had been left—he said that he had, and he was going to sell it for Bacon—Bull took possession of the silk, and I took the prisoner to Moor-lane station.</p>

Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A bobbin silk seller—I have had a shop nearly twenty years—I deal in silk—I have known the prisoner sixteen or seventeen years—he has sold silk for me at various times—I am not always in my shop myself—when I am not there, my daughter attends to it, no one else—my wife is alive—she is very seldom in the shop; she never does anything with buying or selling—there is a parlour behind my shop—my wife is generally sitting there—I have no servant—I am out a good deal during the day—my daughter is very often in the shop at the same time that I am—I keep a horse and cart—I was in trouble about the purchase of some silk—that is, I am certain, more than twenty years ago—I did say that it was fifteen years ago, but I had forgotten it—it was not that some silk which had been stolen was found in my possession—it was an information I do not know for what—an officer came, and took away my silk—I had a great quantity, a couple of hundredweight I dare say—I had no bales—I do not know what is the weight of a bale, they differ so—I have not been in the habit of buying bales this eleven years—the silk taken from my place was of different colours, dyed silk—the silk was taken, and I went before the Magistrate with it—I have been living at the same place since—the prisoner has frequently sold silk for me—I believe he sells on commission—I never was in prison—I had the misfortune to be a bankrupt about thirteen years ago, as nigh as I can recollect—I was examined before the Bankruptcy Court—I did not get my certificate—I was not sent to prison—there was no charge against me of having concealed some property from my creditors—I cannot tell how it was that I did not get my certificate—for the last thirteen years I have been an Uncertificated bankrupt—I have not done a large trade since—I never passed the Insolvent Court—my debts, at the time of my bankruptcy, were 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not paid a farthing to any of my creditors since—I sell silk over the counter, nothing else—I do not deal with any wholesale houses—I generally buy my silk of Mr. Shears, a man who deals largely in silk—he lives at Cambridge-heath; he keeps a warehouse—I bought of him three or four months back—I keep no books at all; no account books of what I purchase or sell—I am no scholar—I cannot tell any one besides Mr. Shears that I have bought of lately—I do not buy job lots of any strangers that offer them to me-—of course I know the persons—I should not buy of a stranger—I have done so—if any person comes in, and offers silk, I make a purchase if I can buy it—I give a fair price—I do not give a receipt—I take it over the counter—I do not enter it in any book—I do not take the names and addresses—I get no invoice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Since this transaction, twenty years ago, have the police called on you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—if anything is lost in the trade, it is a frequent thing for them to call, and leave a bill there, in case it should come in—on that Wednesday, when I went to the prisoner in the afternoon, I swear he called on me first between 1 and 2 o'clock—I had done dinner some time—he did not go into the parlour—he merely sat down in the shop—he was not there five minutes—he staid five minutes, and went away—after that I called on him—I should think it is two miles or more from my house to his—I was away from home a couple of hours or more—during that time my daughter was obliged to attend to the shop—I did not tell any one I</p>

               <p>was going to the prisoner's, to see some silk—it was between 4 and 5 o'clock when I called on him—I did not go in my cart, I walked there, and walked back—I should think that would be walking more than four miles—I saw his wife there, and saw the silk—I did not express surprise at seeing such a quantity—when I was in the habit of dealing largely, I have seen a great deal more than that at Mr. Drago's, in Broad-street, a silk broker—I used to purchase silk of him—the prisoner asked me 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound for the silk, but it was no use to me—I do not know the value of raw silk—I do not know that 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound is considerably under the value of it—it is silk that we do not use—I have never dealt in this sort of silk—I have dealt in thrown silk—I did not say anything to the prisoner about the price—I have known him some years—he knows the business I am in, and has sold silk for me—I do not know whether he knew that I did not deal in this sort of silk—I merely looked at it when I saw it, and said that it would not suit me—I did not ask him where he got it—his wife was present; she was the only one present—I do not know whether the prisoner sold on commission—he has paid me for what he bought over the counter—he sold silk for me three or four months ago—I do not know where he sold it—the amount he sold it for was 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound, I believe—he did not bring me an invoice—it was silk that I had bought, and dyed it for sale—I cannot tell how soon after 1 bought it, it was sold; it may have been a few weeks—I gave him a price, and he bought it—he sold it for me—I charged him 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound—if he had not got the money, I would have let him have it—that is what I call selling silk for me—he has frequently had silk of me without paying the money at once—I do not know anything about his circumstances—I was not afraid to trust him—I did not, when I saw this large quantity of silk in his house, ask him where he got it—I made no inquiry at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What silk is it you deal in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Thrown silk; fit for work—I never had any dealings in raw silk—when the prisoner called on me on the Wednesday, my wife and daughter were, I think, gone up stairs—they were not in the shop at all during the five minutes that he was there—I keep a horse and cart—it was out on that Wednesday—I did not go with it—my man did—his name is Smith—he is here—when I went before the Justice, the officers came, and took away all my silk, and I went with it—the silk was returned back by the Magistrate, and I was at once released—there was no charge made against me—I cannot read or write—when I have sold silk to the prisoner, either on credit or for money, the amount has been 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the last transaction I had was two or three months ago—we generally know something of persons we buy silk of, by their coming to the shop frequently—it is part of my business to dye silk and sell it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long has Smith been with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Going on for eight years—he is in the habit of going out by himself—I know he was out with the cart that day—I was at home—he went out at half past 8 o'clock in the morning—he went to a wadding manufacturer in Thomas-street, to take his goods out—the cart was hired out that day by the wadding manufacturer—it was out all day, till half past 4 o'clock—I know that, because he paid the money—I was not at home when he came home—he paid the money to my daughter—he was out eight hours, and received 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an hour—he had been out the day before, and he was out the day after—he is out little or much every day—I am sure of the day of the month we are speaking of—it was the 14th—I do not know whether</p>

               <p>he had been out all day on the 13th—I cannot tell whether he was out all day on the 12th—I have not been asked about this before—I recollect this was on the Wednesday—I should not have remembered this unless my man had recollected where he had been that day—I asked him if he had been out on Wednesday—I sent him to the parties he had been with, and I have seen them myself—it is in consequence of inquiries I have made of the wadding manufacturer and my man, that I am able to speak to the cart being out on that Wednesday—I think I did not speak to my man about it before Tuesday last—I should not have thought anything about it, but the officer asked me where my man was with the horse and cart that day—I was before the Magistrate, and was bound over to appear.</p>

                  </hi>. I am acting as carter or carman to Mr. Bacon, and have been doing so for seven or eight years—my attention has been called to Wednesday, 14th Jan.; on that day I was out, taking wadding out for Mr. Godding, a wadding manufacturer—I went about half past 8 o'clock in the morning—I had Mr. Bacon's horse and cart—I was employed at that for three hours and a half—I then went with Mrs. Carley, to Edge-ware-road—I went at half past 12 o'clock, and came home at half past 4 o'clock—I put the horse and cart in the stable—I did not receive any money, they generally pay it but once a week—I gave an account of what I had been doing to Miss Bacon, in doors.</p>

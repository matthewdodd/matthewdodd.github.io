I missed my watch, and by the light of a lamp I saw a woman running; I followed, and just as I came up to her the watchman came up, and we were both taken to the watch-house. I cannot swear to the woman.</p>

            . I am a constable. Bromett was brought to the watch-house. I went out and took a woman answering Edwards's description, but he said she was not the girl; she said the prisoners lived together in Peter-street; I went there and found Edwards in bed, with the watch under her holster - this was half an hour after. - Nesbitt was in liquor, but knew what he was about - he gave me an exact description of the watch.</p>

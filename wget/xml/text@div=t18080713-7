               <p>Q. Did you see him do it - A. No. I awoke on the 2nd of June in the morning in a kind of fright.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear a noise - A. No, nothing particular. The first thing I observed was the street door wide open: ours is a little habitation, two rooms on the ground floor; the bed room door stood a little open; I could see the street door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Your bed room door was left partly open when you went to bed - A. Yes, we always leave it ajar; it was between three and four o'clock when I awoke, it was quite light; I jumped out of bed and went into the front room; I said to my husband, oh, my God! we have been robbed. I missed my things immediately; the street door was standing wide open.</p>
               <p>Q. What things did you miss from that room - A. Seven shirts; they were laying on the top of the table wringing wet in that room, I had washed them the day before; the shirts I had to wash and the shift; I missed my husband's coat, a pocket handkerchief, and a black linen apron; I had seen all these things in the room when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the windows of that room - A. One was shut and the other half open; the window case was close.</p>

I went out to work the morning they were robbed at three o'clock, it was day light then; I saw two men run across the fields from Mr. Hatton's house, I believe they might be five yards off when I saw them first, but I did not see them come from the premises; I never saw them before; I could take no further notice than of their clothing: one was dressed in a dark coat, whether blue or brown I can not say; and the other in a light coloured drab. When I went home to my breakfast I was told of the robbery. On the Saturday following I saw the two men at the Mansion house, they were dressed the same as I described to the officer.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, 134, Bishopsgate street. On the 2nd of June, about ten o'clock I received information that a house was broken open on Bethnal green, and shirts, with other things, had been stolen; I recollected having taken in two shirts previous to the information having been given, from the prisoner Lyon; I advanced him five shillings on them. I had another shirt brought me by the female prisoner and another woman, between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say when they came in - A. I do not know that they said any thing; as soon as they came in I looked at the shirts to see that it was one of the same as were stolen; immediately I detained them, and sent for an officer. I have kept them shirts ever since.</p>

I am a constable; I was sent for by Mr. Sadler to take charge of the two women; I searched the apartment where they lived, in Reeves court, Angel alley, Bishopsgate street; I understood this was Frindall's apartment, knowing she had lived in the alley some time. I found one shirt in the room, one coat, and a pocket handkerchief, they laid on the bed; I then went to an empty house just by, there was no person living there. On the stair case I found two shirts and a pillow case; I asked the prisoner Frindall how she came in possession of them, she told me that she received them from the prisoners, that they brought them in about three o'clock in the morning, and told her to dry them. This black apron I took from the prisoner Whittingham, before the magistrate on Thursday.</p>

            . After I received information of the robbery I went to George street, Wentworth street; I saw the two prisoners, I knew them well; that was on the 2nd of June about six o'clock in the afternoon; knowing the place to be a dangerous situation I went for another officer, and placed him at one end of the street, I went to the other, I saw the two prisoners, I took one in my hand; Lyons made resistance, but Whittingham did not; being surrounded by a parcel of girls, one had a large knife in her hand, Lyon got away before the other officer came to my assistance; I took Lyon the same evening in Essex street. I received information from the brewer's servant of the description of the prisoners. I found the lock to be a spring lock, it goes with a catch and a stiff hasp; there is a bit of wood nailed against it, it is im- impossible when shut to force it open; I saw the mark of a chisel I tried a knife and it opened it.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mrs. Hatton. Look at these shirts, there are three of them produced by the pawnbroker - A. They are all mine, they were all in my house, I know them by the mark, the make, and the cloth, and those found in the empty house are part of them which were taken away. The coat, pocket handkerchief and apron, are my husband's; the shirts are worth seven shillings each, the coat half a crown, the new holland shift, fourteen shillings; this pillow case is mine.</p>

               <p>Lyon's Defence. I get my living buying and selling old clothes. On the 2nd of June a young man asked me if I would buy two shirts; I gave him six shillings and sixpence for them; I went and pledged them for five shillings. I do not think it is my place if any body brings things to me to ask them whether they stole them or not.</p>
               <p>Whittingham's Defence. That apron is my own, I bought it; on Wednesday the 1st of June, I got up from my lodgings in Wentworth street; I went to this woman, I told her I was going to my diseased mother at Deptford; I had a bundle, I took it away with me, which was a waistcoat in a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Frindall's Defence. I am an unfortunate girl; a man came to me on that morning and left me the things; this room is not my own; I went to that room that one night.</p>

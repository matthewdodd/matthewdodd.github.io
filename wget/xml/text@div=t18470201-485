                  </hi>. I keep the Bell public-house, in Red Lion-market. On the 13th of Jan. the prisoner, accompanied by another person, came to my house—they called for a pot of porter and a screw of tobacco—the prisoner paid my wife's mother, Mary Ann Devonshire, and she handed me the half-crown immediately—I gave the change—I did not see it was bad at that time—they went away before I discovered it was bad—I found it was bad—I marked it, and placed it on a shelf at the back of the bar, behind some drinking glasses—on the 18th of Jan. I saw the prisoner again—I said, "You are the party that I wanted to see; you passed a bad half-crown to me last week; I shall give you into custody"—he said he had not done any such thing; he would sooner put his head in the fire than pass bad money—I am confident he is the man—I sent the servant girl for the policeman—she was some time gone—the prisoner tried to make his escape, and said he would not be detained—I said he should—he seized hold of me, and tried to make his escape—two parties came out of the tap-room to my assistance—I detained him till they drank a pot of porter—he struggled, and two buttons were torn off my waist<lb></lb>coat—no policeman had been brought at that time—I did not know how the law was, and I let the prisoner go—Mr. Devonshire handed the half-crown to Richard Gascoigne, and he handed it to me—it was the same I had marked and placed behind the glasses—I went out after the prisoner—I saw him, and kept him in sight till I saw Constable, the policeman, in Bunhill-row—I carried the half-crown with me in my hand, and gave it to the officer—in going down Bunhill-row the prisoner said, "Here goes the last b—y penny," and he threw something away—it was a bad 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—Gascoigne picked it up and handed it to the officer immediately.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Apsley pellatt as a stopperer. These decanters (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>) I stoppered—these quart ones I marked on the outside ring—I was found fault with for doing so—I stoppered and marked twenty-seven quart decanters, from No's. 1 to 27—the numbers on these two quarts are, Nos. 3 and 18—I stoppered and marked thirty pint-decanters from 1 to 30—I never stoppered so many before at one time of the same sort—I stoppered and marked the quart ones from the 14th of August to the 21st, and the pints, from August the 21st to the 28th.</p>

Morgan was not in the decanter line, but made toilets and smelling-bottles—that was the only service I was in—my brother taught me to stop—he was apprenticed to Mr. Stock, who worked for Mr. Pellatt at the factory—the mode is to mark the stopper, and then the decanter, or else we should not be able to fit them.</p>

I had sold—I believe these, Nos. 1 and 29, were part of those decanters—I saw the quart decanters safe on the same day, the Saturday—there were twenty-seven then—I examined them on the Wednesday, and there were but nineteen—I cannot tell the Nos. of the eight that were gone, nor the Nos. of those that were left—I believe these two quart decanters were there on the Saturday—(<hi rend="italic">looking at two</hi>)—they were certainly not there on the Wednesday—I have the care of the room in which those decanters were kept—they are kept in a room we call the show-room—it is up a flight of stairs, and across a bridge—I remain in general in the middle-room—in order to get to that middle-room you must go through the counting-house, and up a flight of stairs—I did not see the prisoner there from the Saturday till the Wednesday—MR. Day is there when I am absent—MR. Horton locks the premises of a night, and takes care of the keys.</p>

Hewitt bought them of me for him—these quart decanters are like Mr. Pellatt's—there was a vast quantity of glass in the warehouse exhi<lb></lb>bited for sale, where the customers may walk through and look at it—there are persons to clean out the warehouse—they are let in at half-past eight or nine o'clock—the man who locks up the warehouse is here—there are two boys, named Hunter and Humphries, who might go in and come out when they liked—they are not authorized to sell—they might do it—the retail price of the quart decanters is 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the pint ones.</p>

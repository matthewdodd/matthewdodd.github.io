               <p>I am a silversmith, in Bond-street; I know the prisoner Seville, I have known him about four months.</p>
               <p>Q. On what occasion did you first know him? - Owing to an advertisement in the news paper, I took him into my service.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did he first enter into your service? - The 9th of April, and he quitted it on the 7th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity was he? - As a <rs id="t17930911-89-deflabel495" type="occupation">porter</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17930911-89-defend1005 t17930911-89-deflabel495"></join>, and to wait at table occasionally.</p>
               <p>Q. As a porter, what did he do? - He opened and shut up the shop. My customers when they went out of town they sent their chests of plate to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. From the nature of his employment, was he or was he not in the habit of becoming acquainted with the manner of your house, and where this plate was deposited? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know where the plate was deposited? - He has assisted in carrying the chests of plate to the cellar, when they were brought in by my customers.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in consequence of carrying down these chests of plate into the cellar,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110143"></xptr>he knew where the plate was deposited? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the situation of this cellar? - It is a strong cellar with a double door and plated with iron.</p>
               <p>Q. On the inside in what position was this cellar? - It opened into the back kitchen; there was but one window and that was strongly barred with iron; the iron barrs looked into my garden; I mean the iron barrs of the cellar where the things were deposited.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it level with the garden? - No, it was under the garden, and strongly barred withinside, only these bars remained just as they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to describe what was the situation of the other part of the cellar? - The cellar was square.</p>
               <p>Q. How many outside walls? - Only one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it towards the garden? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. What does the other three communicate with? - One to the back kitchen, and another is the party wall between the two houses, and the other divides the scullery; between the cellar and scullery, within the cellar there is a door way, and a smaller cellar behind that.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you describe the situation of the wall which you mentioned to be towards the back kitchen; in what situation was that wall when you made the discovery? - In the wall between the scullery and cellar there was a small hole that conveyed a water pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. What size was that hole that conveyed the water pipe? - About the size of the crown of a man's hat.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the situation of the wall surrounding this pipe? - It was bricked up; and when I received information that I had been robbed I went to that place, and found that the bricks had been removed out and replaced; I mean the bricks about the pipe; I opened the cellar door, and when I entered the cellar every thing appeared perfectly secure; but after searching the different chests I found two chests belonging to Mr. York broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you go any further tell me exactly where these chests stood? - They stood fronting the door, one of them, and the other above it, rather behind, close to the wall of the garden.</p>
               <p>Q. What had these chests been fastened with? - They were locked with padlocks.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the keys of them? - Mr. York or his servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that the locks had been forced? - The locks had not, but the staples had been.</p>
               <p>Q. From this hole, where the pipe was introduced, you observed these bricks removed; what was the size of the hole? - About the size of one of those books.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it large enough for a man to get in at? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did this box stand from the hole? - The hole is a great deal higher than a man's head, seven feet high from the ground, and there appeared, on the side of the wall, evident marks of a person getting up through the hole.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the place where this hole was stood these boxes? - About six feet; so that a person must have been in the cellar and got over other chests to have got to this.</p>
               <p>Q. By your description I take it for granted that these boxes stood without any other boxes on them? - There were no chests on the top of either of these of Mr. York's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they stand on the ground, or on other chests? - On other chests, one of them about three feet from the ground, and the other about five feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that that stood about five feet from the ground, I suppose it was necessary to get on something to open it? - On one of the other chests. These<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110144"></xptr>two chests were covered with matting, so that a person might have gone into the cellar several times without observing they were broke open, as the matting was replaced again.</p>
               <p>Q. When you examined this hole, that you have described, did you observe any rubbish that were left in consequence of that? - There was an oven in the scullery, which a person had got open to get into this hole; on this oven I found mortar and rubbish, it evidently appeared that somebody had been on the top of the oven.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any instrument within the cellar, by which it might be supposed that this box was broke open by? - In searching the cellar at one corner I found this hatchet or cleaver; I remember seeing it some time before, it had been laying about in the kitchen some years I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell me the latest time you recollect seeing it in the cellar? - About six months ago; I am confident it was not in the cellar five months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to recollect, Mr. Hemming, when Mr. York's boxes were deposited there? - On the 10th of July I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. When you examined these boxes where part of the property was taken away, at which part of the cellar did you find the cleaver in? - I found it in the small cellar, near the hole.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to mention some of the articles that were lost. - I had not a list of the contents of the chests.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This man, I think, you say was discharged from your service on the 7th of August? - He was.</p>
               <p>Court. Pray, sir, what day was it you first made this discovery, or went to the cellar? - He went away from me on the 7th, but I asked him to come on Friday the 9th to wait at table in the evening, to assist my servant; on that day I paid him his wages; he came about three o'clock in the afternoon to wait, and he did wait, and he slept there that night, and went away about ten o'clock on Saturday the tenth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then this man had two clear days to have gone any where out of your reach, and on your invitation he came on the third day? - He did; he went on the 7th and came again on the 9th to wait.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you say this cellar communicated with the back kitchen; pray how many servants may you have employed in this business of your's? - I have two others besides the prisoner at the bar, who are engaged in the actual business, two more servants.</p>
               <p>Q. They had as much access to the cellar as the prisoner? - They had more access to the cellar than the prisoner had, because they had the keys.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe as this communicated with the back kitchen, the servant of the house likewise knew that was the deposit of the plate? - I presume if the maid servants knew it, the men servants knew it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many servants have you who are engaged in the business now? - Only two; I have only four servants in the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have an uncle of the name of Hemmings? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he has some concern in the profits of the business? - He is not in partnership, he has been out of business some time. I had a cousin who was in the business since, whom I presume, you mean, but he has been out of business some time.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said you are certain that this cleaver was not in the cellar five months ago; how long it had been in the cellar of the five months you cannot tell; it may be in the cellar four months, but five months you are sure it was not; I take it for granted you know no better about the removal of the bricks how long ago this aperture was made in your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110145"></xptr>cellar you cannot say? - I cannot say. I should suppose it has not been above five months ago, the very same cellar was attempted, the window was broke and one of the bars taken out; at that time there was but one chest in the cellar, and the cellar was cleared out, and strong bars put to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the cellar having been attempted at the outside of the house, your attention, which was to make that stronger, was drawn to quite a different part of the cellar than where this hole was made? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Hemmings, the window being repaired if the cleaver had been in the cellar then, you, or some of your people would have seen it? - Certainly, because the cellar was then cleared out.</p>

             is his real name, as he always told me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him? - These three years, it may be a little more, it is not less.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live yourself? - Before I was taken into custody I lived at Mr. Roach's, in Pall Mall, as a porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner when he was in the service of Mr. Hemmings? Yes, I don't know the day that he went, but he told me two or three days before he went that he was to go there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you knew him when he was actually in Mr. Hemmings's employ? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any connection with him while he remained in that service? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you visit him there? - I went to see him sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man of the name of Thornbury? - I knew him very well as an acquaintance of Mr. Seville.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Seville at any time, and you must tell when, say any thing about what he had done in the house of Mr. Hemmings? - The first thing that ever he told me was of a tea urn.</p>
               <p>Court. I would be glad if you would recollect the time? - He had been there about a month or six weeks, as nigh as I can guess, I cannot justly say to a week.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you? - He said that he had got a tea urn; I asked him afterwards how he got it? he said he got it by a hole in the wall where the plate was.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this all the words he said, because that is an unintelligible sort of language, and must be unintelligible to you? - He said he was looking for something one day, and he got into a hole of the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Into the hole of what wall? - Into the hole of the wall of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what house? - Mr. Hemmings.</p>
               <p>Q. When he told you he had got a tea urn, was that all he told you? - He said that he had got a tea urn.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the whole of the conversation? - It was at his master's house, Mr. Hemmings, and I asked him if he could not stop in his place without doing such things as these, for he would lose his place.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the beginning of the conversation? - The beginning of the conversation, before ever that he told me about the tea urn was, he said, that was he in my place he would never want money, he would rob my master of all the silks he could; I told him I I should not do any such thing; I told him I had done too much for him already.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it you had done for him before he went to Mr. Hemmings? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110146"></xptr>He slept with me three nights, and the first night he slept with me he asked me if I had any money? I said, no; he said he had not money sufficient enough to to go to his place, and I told him I had no money; he said I was a damned fool, for if he lived where I did he never would want money; he asked me to get some silks; I asked him what he meant? He had none that first night, the night after he came again, and asked me to get some silks; to rob my master of some silks, that was his expression; on which he had two pieces the second night, and the third night he had the same; he took them out of the shop; I was a party in that.</p>
               <p>Q. After this what more past? - He went to Mr. Hemmings service; a few nights afterwards I went to Mr. Hemmings to see him, he told me he had sold the silks to the jew, that he mentioned that he should sell them to, and I asked him what he had got for them? and he never satisfied me, and I had two guineas in the whole from him at different times; I went after that, and he still was persuading of me to get some more silks. he told me I was a damned fool that I did not. Another time after that, about six weeks after that he went to Mr. Hemmings, he told me that he had got a tea urn.</p>
               <p>Q. How did this conversation begin? - He said that he meant to get something of his master before he had got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that his expression? - It was. After that I went again, and then he told me of this tea urn; I went one day, says I, Wright, how do you do? says he, I am very well; and he whispered to me and said that he had got some plate of his master's; I asked him what it was? and he told me that it was a tea urn; with that I told him if he could not stop in his place without robbing his master he had better go away from him; he told me I was a damned fool, did not I think that he knew what he was about? I asked him how he got it? he said he was looking for something one day and he found a hole in the wall, and the hole was not quite large enough, and he pulled a few bricks away to make it larger.</p>
               <p>Q. Now at that time, which was five or six weeks after he had been there, the story happened about this tea urn? - It did.</p>
               <p>Q. You went away at this time? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go again at any other time? - I did in about a week, it might be a little less, or a little more, I cannot say which; he said that he meant still to get some more; that was all that passed the second time as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. What past after this? - I did not go any more for a fortnight after this; I told him that I did not like to come, because your master must find out this that you are doing of, and he will think that I have helped you off with it; and he said I was a damned fool; he was then saying that he wanted somebody just to take the plate off, as he should take it away, and I said don't mention that to me for I shall have no hand in it at all; then I did not go to him any more for a week; he then was telling me that he was going to put some money, twenty pounds, in the bank. About this time, it must be towards June or later, I cannot recollect the time, I cannot say the time, he said that he meant to put twenty pounds in the bank, and that he should not stop with his master but a very little while; no, says I, now you have robbed him of all you can you are going to leave him; he said, yes, did I think that he did not know what he was about? I told him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110147"></xptr>I did not know whether he did or not. Another time he was telling me, it was the day before he left his master, and there was a young man there, that was to succeed his place, he says to me, this is the young man, I don't know his name, that is to come to take my place; O, is it? says I, then I suppose you go away to night; no, he should not go away till the morning; he did expect to go away a week before that he did. I called the next day, in the afternoon about five o'clock, and I asked the shopman whether Wright was gone? and he told me no he was not gone.</p>
               <p>Court. How came that about? did you call him Wright at the shop? - I did sometimes; and he accused me with it, why I could not keep my own counsel, and said I was a damned fool for it. The shopman said that he was not gone, but he supposed that he would not be long, I might go down stairs; I did go down stairs, and I saw him in the pantry, and I said, John, I see you are not gone yet; no, says he, but I shall not be long first, and after a few minutes talk he went towards his box, and opened it, and shewed me a coffee pot; then he came towards the warehouse, and he unbuttoned his breeches, and shewed me a handful of spoons that were there in his breeches; they were silver spoons; if they were tea spoons they were very large spoons; I said to him, John, do not take any thing out of the house, but put them where you had them; he said no, did I think he was a damned fool and did not know what he was about? then I did not say any thing more to him about the plate at all; I stayed half an hour, and he called a coach; this was the very day that he went away, and the box was carried up, and put into the coach; the coffee pot was in the box, and he got into the coach and I wished him a good night; says he, what are you a going home? yes, says I, I am; no, says he, go along with me to Oxford-road; with his asking of me I did go, I got into the coach; a little way from Mr. Hemmings's,

             stopped the coachman and got into the coach; then Seville and me, and Thornbury were all in the coach, and we went to where Thornbury did live in Oxford road, No. 100, There we got out of the first coach, they went in, but I did not; they took Wright's box out and put it into another coach, which they called; they went into a house for a box, of Charles's, at his master's; then they got out, and got into the other coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Who discharged the first coach? - I don't know. Then the box that was brought out of Thornbury's master's was put into this second coach, and Wright's box was put into the same coach: I stayed in the first coach while they went into the lodgings, and we all got into the second coach; when we were all in they desired the coachman to to go to the French Horn.</p>
               <p>Q. Who desired him? - One of them did, I don't know which it was. When they came there they desired the coachman to drive into the yard, and there the coach stood, and they got out of the coach, and the boxes were taken out, and I got out, and there we all went into a lower room at the French Horn.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of the evening was this? - About eight as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Now then you three, and the two boxes are at the French Horn; what day was this? - It was of a Wednesday, but I don't know the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you was in the room what passed? - I said I must go home; they said, stop a little while and you shall ride home, and I did stop for about a quarter of an hour; the coach was ordered to stop by the French Horn gate; then after stopping that half hour<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110148"></xptr>we all three got into the coach and left the boxes behind, and they desired the coachman to go to the Strand, just by Temple Bar, and when we got through Temple Bar they desired him to drive up to where they sold sticks and umbrellas.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the journey you all took together? - To the bottom of the Haymarket. Then Wright says, we are going to the Haymarket little Theatre, and if you will go back and shut up your shop, and do what you have to do and come back we will come down in an hour; I went home and did what I had to do at home; in about an hour after that I went to the little Theatre, and I saw them there again, and when they came out they called a coach and desired the coachman to drive to Brownlow-street, Drury-lane, and we went there, and then knocked at a private house door, as I thought it was, but I found it was a dancing room; we all three continued there till half after eleven; when we were coming away I said, I don't know what to do about going home, I am so late; says he, you shall go along with me and sleep at the French Horn, which I did, and the coach waited at the dancing room till we did go.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever at the French Horn before? - Never in my life. When we arrived there they called for something to eat for their suppers, and then they went to bed; they all three slept there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Seville say any thing to you about the contents of the box? - No, nothing at all that evening; the next morning when we got up I said, I cannot tell what I shall say or do when I go home; says he, that don't matter what you say, never mind, damn it, leave your place; then they had breakfast, and they said they were going to Limehouse; after breakfast they called a coach, and the coach came into the yard, and this box that Thornbury took from his master in Oxford-road was put into the coach; the box that belonged to Wright was left behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you all three go into the coach with this box? - Yes, we did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you drive? - We ordered the coachman to drive to Ludgate-street, where they each one bought a pair of boots, and John a pair of boots and shoes; they then ordered the coachman to drive to Limehouse, which he did; I asked them when they were going what they had got in that box of Thornbury's? Charles said they had got pictures. Then when they got to this place at Limehouse, they took the box out and stopped half an hour or more, and I sat in the coach all the time, they took out the box and emptied it, and brought the empty box into the coach again; then when they returned from there they went out a little distance from that, where there was but just room enough for a coach to go, the name of the place I don't know, they stopped at some house which looked like a fireman's or waterman's, I don't know which, they both of them got out and took this box with them, and went up stairs, I stayed in the coach all the time, they stopped half an hour in that house; then this box was brought down again, and the coachman brought it to the coach, and I lifted up the box and found it was not very heavy; after they got into the coach they desired the coachman to drive them to the French Horn where he brought them from, which he did; as soon as they got into the coach I said to them, what is here in this box? and they both laughed and said they were oranges; odd sort of oranges, says I, I doubt; Wright said they were the best sort of oranges; they both said so, and coming home I asked them what they meant to do with themselves? they said they meant to go to Margate, and that they should want some servant, and they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110149"></xptr>found they could never make a buck of me; if I would go with them they would give me a livery coat and a hat, and four guineas a month, for they should never make a buck of me; then we got to the French Horn and desired the coachman to drive into the yard, and the box was taken out, and we all got out, and the waiter carried the box up, and Wright, he said, now I will go and see for Moses, for he is waiting somewhere hard by; then he went down stairs; after he had been gone about ten minutes he came back and he said that he was just at the corner of the gate, but he would not come up the yard, and he said to Charles, we must take the plate between us to him, for he will not come up; they did, they opened the box that they took from Limehouse, and they took some kind of plate, there was a silver tankard, the silver tankard they bruised together; there were two pieces of a silver dish cut or broke, I did not see it done.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they take this away? - John and Charles took hold of this to pull it one way, and the other to pull the handle off the tankard; I stood still, and they said, you sit still and will not help us; I said, no, I will not; Wright said don't ask him any thing about it; they could not make any impression to pull it to pieces together, so Wright put it down under his feet and pressed it together; Charles took the largest piece of the silver dish, that had been broke or cut, and put in John's breeches and buttoned them up again, and then they put some in their pockets and other parts about them, and this tankard they put it into an handkerchief; then they took what they thought they could get off without being noticed, out of the house; there was this coffee pot left, which I saw at his master's then in the box, which they did not take, and there was some other little articles left; they asked me to take that; and I said no, I would not touch them, nor I did not; they left that behind; they put them into John's box, and they went down stairs, and I followed them a little way from the French Horn gate, there stood the jew, the same man as at the bar, Eleazar Lazarus, with a bag on his shoulder; when they all three got into the coach Wright says to me, you must not go in because the jew never saw you before, and as I would not take any thing; then I got up behind; then they drove to Whitechapel, I shewed the gentlemen the spot where they stopped, the place I don't know the name of; when they got there I got off from behind, and went the opposite side of the way to what they stopt; after they got out of the coach the jew came the same side I was of, but I don't know whether he saw me to know me or not, and he went into a house either by the corner of the street or a little way up the street; after the jew went away from them Wright held up his hand to me to come over to him and I did, and I saw no more of the jew for that moment.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came up to Wright where was Thornbury? - Thornbury was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the bundle? - The jew had the same bundle when he came out as he got into the coach with, and John and Charles had nothing about them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did there appear to be any thing in that bag as he past by you? - There was something in it before.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to the coach to Wright and Thornbury, what they got into the coach with they had not about them, nor was it in the coach? - I did not look into the coach, they had it not about them.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the coach? - The coach then turned away; they discharged the coach.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110150"></xptr>Q. What became of you, and Wright, and Thornbury? - We went to a public house just by, within a few yards of where they got out.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the coach had stood at no particular place, only for the jew to get out? - No, at no door at all; then they went to the public house, and Wright and the landlady's boy went out, and got some beef and ham; Wright was telling me that he expected the jew every moment; in twenty minutes or less the jew came into the house, but had no bag, he had nothing that I saw; Wright asked him to sit down, and he looked very hard at me, not knowing me nor seeing me before, and he sat down; Wright asked him to eat, but he did not, he drank a little, and stopped in the house about a quarter of an hour, and he says to Wright, I want to speak to you; then Wright got up, and the jew and they both went out, and Wright was gone about twenty minutes with the jew, leaving Thornbury and me in the public house; this was between one and two at noon, as near as I can say; then when Wright came back I said, what did the jew say about me, for he seems very much frightened at the sight of me? Wright told me that he told the jew that I was his brother; soon after that they called for the reckoning, and we came away, and coming home we called another coach, about half a mile from this public house, I don't know the name of the street; the jew did not come in any more after he went out with Wright, and we all three got into the coach, and desired the coachman to drive us to the French Horn again; then afterwards at the French Horn they dined and went up stairs, and opened the box, and took the plate that I would not take, and tied them up in a bundle; that was from the box that Wright had left; they then took it themselves, they told me they were going to take it to this same jew that they had taken the other to; he said he was going to take fourteen or fifteen guineas of him when he returned back with this plate that I would not take.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go to look after this jew? - They went out of the French Horn, and I went out with them; they took the plate in a bundle tied up in a handkerchief; before they left me they said if you can get some silks of your master to night do, and the jew will buy them, and we will all set off on Monday or Tuesday next for Margate; which I told him that I should not; I wished them a good night and went home to my master's house; I lost sight of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any more of them that day or night? - I did not see any more of them till the Saturday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been on that Saturday? - I had been after some business in the City and I called at the French Horn, and I asked if either of them young men were at home? I was told one was at home. I went up stairs, and Wright was then in custody of the beadle of the parish; I was coming away, and he said, young man, you seem to know this young man, and I have orders to stop him, and I must stop you too; and I was carried with him to Bow-street, and we were both examined there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of yourself who was the keeper of the house at Limehouse where you went? - No, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man of the name of Dordy? - Yes, very well; I have known him this nine or ten years; he is a gentleman's servant; I knew him when he was an apprentice, and when he was a master, he was a master baker; I knew him when he lived near Bedford-square, I know him now,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110151"></xptr>he lives with Mr. Appleton, No. 77, Hatton-garden went the next day to Dordy, after he had been with them on Friday, and I called on him to ask him how he did; and he was asking me when I saw Wright.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen Dordy near about the time that Wright had left his master? - A little after I did; the day after I had been at Limehouse and Whitechapel I went to his house, he was a servant to Mr. Appleton, and I went to Mr. Appleton's house where he was a servant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Pray where did you come from? - From Tothill Fields Bridewell.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been there ever since you was at Bow-street? - I have been there some part of the time that I have been in custody, and some part of the time in Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. So that in short you have been a prisoner ever since the information of your's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I am very sorry that so much good advice as you gave this young man has been thrown away. So he came to see you at Mr. Roach's, you permitted him to sleep in the house, and the first use he made of that indulgence was that he persuaded you to rob your master? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You was quite shocked with that advice? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you declined all further acquaintance with the man? - I told him when he asked me that I should do no such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell your master? Kick him out of the house? or tell your master's servants? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell any body that he had given you that advice before you came to Bow-street? - I don't know that I did tell Dordy of it.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you kept this snug to yourself. On the second night he came to sleep with you, I suppose you told him as you are a man of this cast, I shall have no more acquaintance with you? - I did not tell him that.</p>
               <p>Q. You permitted him to come and sleep in your master's house the second night? - I did not ask him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell him you are not a fit man to keep me company? - I did not. I asked the house-keeper; I did not let him sleep without leave.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the house-keeper what he had told you the night before? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this robbery of your master's was committed the second night? - The second night he had two pieces; the first night he had none.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray who shewed him where the pieces of silk were? - He went along with me into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. He was the person that took the pieces? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are positive to; your conscience would not let you take them at all? - He took them out of the house.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you take them at all? - He took some and I took some.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How came you to tell us that he took the pieces, and you consented? - I said that he took them out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You never gave any information of this business to Mr. Hemmings, or to any of Mr. Hemmings's servants? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew it for the five months that he was there? - I knew it as he told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Even on the very day in which he was going, this person shewed you some silver, and you assisted him to take his box out of the house? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You see it taken out? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And you followed it into the coach? - I got into the coach after the box was in.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know a plainer definition of following a box into a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110152"></xptr>coach? - He asked me to come in as I said I wanted to go home.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how often was you examined at Bow-street? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever examined at Bow-street or any other justice's office before? - No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Now do you recollect how many examinations you underwent? - There were several examinations, and I don't know how many there were.</p>
               <p>Q. You was examined the first time, did you tell any thing of this story on your first examination? - I don't know whether I did or did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon you oath don't you know that you did? - I don't know; I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did you reveal this circumstance on your first examination or no? - I don't know whether I did or did not.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath was not your second examination finished before you gave any account of this business? - Finished!</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you gone through your first examination before you mentioned even a syllable of this against this man? - As near as I can tell I told them all I knew on the second examination; the first examination was late, and therefore they did not stand to hear but little what I had to say.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew that all this happened when you was first examined; had not you got through the whole of your second examination before you gave an account of this business? There is something or other I have got hold of; this examination was put off you say; what about the robbery of your own master? - I don't know whether it was or was not; first of all the foreman came to me on Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you examined relative to the robbery of your own master, when you was examined at Bow-street? - They did not ask me, but I told them.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath was not the magistrate going to commit you for trial for robbing your own master, before you said any thing about this business? - They never asked me about my own master's affairs till I told them of this.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not then going to be committed for trial? - I was, but it was on Mr. Hemmings affair.</p>
               <p>Q. Then to save yourself you have discovered other people, to save yourself from being tried? - I accuse nobody but what is true; I knew I had not done any thing with the plate at all, and therefore I had a right to save myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you are not to be prosecuted for robbing your master? - I should not have done any such thing as this if I had not been over persuaded.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you are not to be prosecuted for robbing your own master? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know you are not to be prosecuted? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be so long before I could get it out of you? You cannot account for delaying your answer so long.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Do you remember what past at the time you was admitted to give evidence? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then after being asked several questions you was told that you could not be believed, and you must be put to the bar with these two men? - I never heard any body say so as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you remember when you was asked whether the jew was the same person that got into the coach, did not you say that you did not know him at all, and to the best of your knowledge you never saw him before? - I said I had seen a man a great deal like him if that was not the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or did you not say, that you could not swear that you had ever seen him before in your life? - I did not say that I could not swear; the justice<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110153"></xptr>asked me to look at the man; and I said that I had seen a man a great deal like him; he told me to look at him again; then I said that I did know him.</p>
               <p>Q. You then don't remember that he asked you three or four times before you said that you knew him?</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever tell them that you did not know them? - No, I never said so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Did you or did you not say that you never knew him? what was the first answer you gave? - I said that I had seen a man a great deal like him.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was it between the time that you had seen him on the occasion you have mentioned, and the time he was brought before the justice? - This was on Wednesday, and the Thursday week following I saw him before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him at the justice's had you any doubt about him? - I had a right to look at the man.</p>
               <p>Q. You may think that you shall not be prosecuted; but if you do not make proper answers you may find yourself mistaken. When you saw him before the justice had you any doubt about him? I will have a direct answer, yes or no? - I thought I knew him; I had not much of a doubt; I had no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you have a doubt when you had seen him but a week before?</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Why did you tell the justice that you had seen a man a great deal like him? - Wright says to me at the bar, this was not the man, for he had never seen the man before in his life.</p>
               <p>Q. The question they put to you was whether you knew the man? you said that you had seen a man a great deal like him. I only ask you why you said so? - I could not be positive till I had looked at him; I had a right to look at him first, before I said it was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. This happened on the second time you was examined? - It was the first time I saw the jew.</p>
               <p>Q. You stood as close to him at the time you gave this answer as the next man now that stands by you? - I did.</p>
               <p>Court. You may be sure, Mr. Const, that no jury will convict a man on this evidence, except it be corroborated.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that young man at the bar? - That is one of them, and Fisk is the other, there was a third; I carried them to Ludgate-hill, and there they got out and they bought two pair of boots, and I went to Three Colt-street, Limehouse; I stopped at a house there about five doors down behind the church, as nigh as I can guess, and there the two brothers got out, and they ordered me to give them the box out; I carried it out and gave it them into the parlour, and I came out and minded my horses; the two brothers went into the house, they stayed in about three quarters of an hour, and they hallooed coachman to come and take the box in again, they ordered me to go down London-street, Ratcliff-cross, to turn on the left hand, and go to the bottom of the next street on the left hand; then I turned on the right, and went to the bottom of that; then I went to the left into Tiles Alley, to a fireman's, belonging to the Sun Fire office where I stopped; the same two young men got out, and they ordered me to take the box out again; I did so, and put it into the passage of that house, and they stayed in the house about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. After this quarter of an hour had past what happened then? - They called me again to take the box into the coach the second time, and they got into it again.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they direct you to go then? - Back to the French Horn; I went up into the yard again into the same house; they got out, and two men came and took the box, and there one of the brothers came out, and asked me what my fare was?</p>
               <p>Q. So all this time Fisk remained in the coach, and never got out at all? - He never got out at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I hawk poultry about, and have done so for more than four or five years. I was a labourer at the time of the robbery—I went out into the country to Mr. Ellis's farm, hopping, and met with the pri<lb></lb>soner and a man named Daniel Hurley—we worked there at hopping together at Barming—when we had done, we came home together, and determined to go out potato-grubbing—we spent all our money—I had 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the hands of my clergyman, Father Doyle—I went to him to get 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to buy some forks—I got 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him—the prisoner and Hurley were not with me than—when I got the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I came back to Whitechapel—I had pawned 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for safely, I should not have it about me, and they gave me a duplicate—I bought some forks with the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I went down to Essex, potato-grubbing—I joined the prisoner and Hurley at Barming—the prisoner went with me to the pawnbroker's when I left my money there—about five of us went down near to Romford—the prisoner's father-in-law and sister-in-law—I cannot tell what happened—it is ten years ago, I believe—it was the November before the Duke of York died—I have no recollection of what happened in going but that we all went to work together—after we came home we went to a lodging-house to<lb></lb>gether—I believe it was in Spitalfields—they me told that five or six men could be taken on at place, and I had better go with them and work—I went with them to Stepney, I believe—they told me it was Stepney—I have not pointed out the spot to any one—went into a house in the fields and waited till the man came in to his dinner, and them went to a public-house—I had some liquor—we then went into the field, and they knocked me down—I not certain which it was—they were both, together, and struck me across the nose—my trowsers were cut at the knee, and a little box, which I had with two sovereigns and the duplicates of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it, taken out—I think it was the prisoner that took the box from me—he and Hurley were both there at the time it was taken—after they took it, they struck me again—I got senseless, and I suppose they went away—I had some liquor—I cannot say I was drunk not yet sober—when I came to, I went in pursuit of them to the house we had left but they were not there—I then went to the pawnbroker's as fast as I could, and that was shut—I then went to lodging-house we had left in the morning—I found Hurley there, and had him taken up—he was taken before the Magistrate and discharged—the first I saw the prisoner after that was in the Borough-market, about five years after the robbery—(I had made a charge against him at Lambeth-street, when I took Hurley, but never saw him for five years)—I laid hold of him by the collar, and he made an attempt to trip me and knock me down, but did not—a parcel of boys and men surrounded me, and rescued him from me, and kept me till he got away—I saw him again twelve months or two years age, as I was coming out of Leadenhall-market with a basket of fowls on my head—he was coming against me, and ran away as quick as he could, and I having poultry on my head could not follow him—I saw him again last Tuesday fortnight in Bishopsgate-street—I went into a public-house to have a drop of beer with some people, and he was in before us, sitting be<lb></lb>hind the door—I sent my son-in-law for a policeman who came and took</p>

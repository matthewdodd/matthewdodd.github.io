The property that I missed was deposited in a back garret; it is a store room belonging to me. The prisoner lodged in the same house. I afterwards saw the property that I had missed at Mr. Colnatty's, a parcel of prints, the ruins of Rome. That parcel contained two hundred and eighty-four. They were my property, except about twenty; they belonged to a Mr. Edwards. All that are not tinted are mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that part of your property that you saw in Mr. Colnatty's possession, that had been in your store room - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What room in the house did you occupy - A. The front room on the second floor. The prisoner occupied the room above me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any right at all to go into your store room - A. No. That room door was more open than shut, because it served to dry linen in. My store room was next to the prisoner's room.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no knowledge of missing any of your property until Mr. Colnatty produced them, had you - A. Not at all. The prints that are not coloured are all my exclusive property. Mr. Edwards had a share before we parted.</p>
               <p>MR. COLNATTY. I live at 23, Cockspur-street, Charing-cross. I know Mr. Merigot, the prosecutor. On the 26th of January last, I purchased two hundred and eighty-four prints at Mr. Dodd's auction in St. Martin's-lane; I knew them to be Mr. Merigot's property. I shewed them to Mr. Merigot; he claimed them. These are the prints that I bought at Mr. Dodd's sale.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Dodd, an auctioneer. Mr. Colnatty purchased prints of me. On the 20th of January last, the prisoner brought me four hundred prints of different descriptions, ancient and modern; he left it to our best judgment to sell them for him. Mr. Colnatty bought a part of them four hundred which the prisoner brought to me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The whole of the prints were in my possession, and all that are not coloured are mine. They are worth five pounds.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

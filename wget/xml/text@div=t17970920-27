               <p>YARDLEY sworn. I live in Bloomsbury: I was going through Broad-street, St. Giles's, and saw the prisoner in company with another person, the prisoner in followed Mr. Smith, and took his handkerchief out of his pocket; he twisted it round his hand, and put it into his inside pocket; I called out to the prosecutor, but I believe he did not hear me; the prisoner turned round and shook his fist at me; I immediately went up towards him, he ran round the corner of Dyot-street, and seeing me after him, he immediately turned back and took out his knife; I told him I was not afraid of his knife, I would have him; he stood with his knife in his hand to keep me from laying hold of him; when I went near him, he made an attempt to cut me; another person came up who had a great coat on his arm, he threw the great coat in his face, and we tumbled him down, one got hold of one hand, and another of the other, but we could not get the knife from him till the other person almost throttled him, and then we got it away; we searched him and took this handkerchief out of his pocket. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my handkerchief.</p>

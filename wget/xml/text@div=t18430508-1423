                  </hi>. I am the wife of Owen Hughes, a mangle-maker, No. 8, City-terrace, Old-street-road, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. On Thursday, the 6th of April, about a quarter past ten o'clock at night, I went into the back parlour—I found the door and two of the drawers open—I missed the articles stated, which I had seen safe in the back parlour about nine o'clock—no one else was in the room then—I went down into the kitchen—I shut the door, I am sure, but my boy went up afterwards—he is not here—he is fif<lb></lb>teen years old—when I came up stairs at nine the street-door was shut—when I left the parlour I did not pass the street-door—I saw it shut at nine—nobody came in after, that I know of—there are lodgers on the first and second floors—some lodgers came in between nine and my missing the things—they have got keys, and come in and out—this property now produced is all mine, and is what I lost that night.</p>

On Thursday, the 6th of April, about half-past nine o'clock, I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner in Short-street, Tabernacle-square, about a minutes' walk from the prosecutor's house, tying up a large bundle—two men were there as well—I heard some one say, "Go on," as they crossed the street—I followed the pri<lb></lb>soner—he went about 100 yards down Cowper-street, and returned back about two yards—I followed him—he went down the street about three parts of the way, to within about four yards of where I first saw him—he then threw the bundle at me—I followed him close—I did not lose sight of him—I picked it up—he ran—I cried, "Stop thief"—I stopped him myself—this is the bundle.</p>

                  </hi>. I am pot-boy at the George and Dragon, in Hoxton Market. On the evening of 19th Aug. the prisoner, the deceased, and other persons were playing at skittles in the skittle-ground—they played four<lb></lb>handed at skittles—the prisoner and deceased lost the game; they then played, to see which should pay for the pot of beer—the prisoner lost it—I supplied the beer—I asked the prisoner for the money—he said he had got no money, he would pay me in about a quarter of an hour—he was not sober, he had been drinking there all day—I told him I wanted my money—he were away and came back again—I asked him for the money again—he said he had got no b—y money—I said, "That won't do, you have served me that trick so often; I want the money"—he hit me two or three times on the back of my head with his open hand, and irritated me so that I called him a thief—he said, "What am I?" and I told him so again—Dutton was then at the time—I did not hear him say or do anything—I was sent for a police<lb></lb>man, and saw no more.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 28, Norman's-buildings. On the day in question I was in the parlour of this public-house—I got out of the window into the skittle-ground—the first thing that drew my attention was the pot-boy and the prisoner having some words about a pot of beer—I saw the prisoner strike the pot-boy several blows with his open hand—the land<lb></lb>lord came out and parted them, and sent for a constable—about a minute elapsed—the deceased got up from his seat, and called the prisoner a b—y thief—the prisoner said something; but what, I cannot exactly say—I believe it was a caution for him not to call him that again—the deceased then said, "If you are not a thief, you are a b—y rogue"—upon that the pritoner stripped off his shirt, and said something—I cannot say what it was; it was a challenge to fight—the deceased was the tallest of the two, and a much older man—I suppose he was about thirty years of age; the prisoner calls himself eighteen or nineteen—they fought four or five rounds—they went to it in earnest—I saw two or three falls; they both fell together—there were two blows given in the last round, and the last blow was given with the left-hand under the right ear—I consider it was a fair fight—there was no unfairnes on either side; only the prisoner remarked at the time of the fight, that he would fight any man in Hoxton—when the last blow was given Dutton was in act of falling, but he was caught up by a man, and never spoke afterwards—he was dragged to a seat, and sat down and bathed—somebody exclaimed, "You have killed the man!"—the prisoner, in a low kind of voice, said, "Oh, God! dont say that," and he dipped a pint pot in some water and took it up to the deceased—I consider the man died directly after he received the blow—I did not observe him revive at all afterwards—I and another went for a doctor, and the prisoner was given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Feather's-court, Drurylane—the prisoner lived with me for eighteen months or more. On Sunday morning, the 30th of Aug., about half-past twelve o'clock, I returned home, and saw the prisoner at the street door—I was not sober—we had some words in play, and the prisoner began to be very spiteful—he laid hold of me sud<lb></lb>denly, and threw me down in the court—we were not at play then—I struck him, got up again, and stood at the door—he went down to the bottom of the court into Drury-lane—I went up stairs to bed—he followed me up five or ten minutes after—we had another scuffle up stairs in the room, and both fell—he began biting and scratching me—I then struck him several times with my open hand—I was going to turn him down stairs, but did not—I then found I was stabbed in my hand—he was going down stairs—I said, "You vaga<lb></lb>bond,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184609210064"></xptr>
               <p>you have stabbed me!"—I called to the landlord, who came up and stopped him—there was a long wound across my little finger—I was also stabbed in the breast and side—my hand was all over blood—the breast of my shirt was all over blood—I went to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Drury-lane—the prosecutor and prisoner both lodged at my house. About half-past twelve o'clock on Sunday morning I heard the prosecutor go up stairs—the prisoner was not there—he went up more than five minutes afterwards—I heard a noise in the bed-room, I went up to see what it was, and met the prisoner coming down—Figgins called to me to stop him, for he had stabbed him—I stopped him, and took him back into the room—Figgins was bleeding—he had five cuts on the body, and two on the finger—I sent him to the hospital, and gave the prisoner in charge—I had seen them both before they came into the house—they had both been drinking.</p>

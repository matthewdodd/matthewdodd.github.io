                  </hi>. I am a furniture-dealer, of 15, Eaton-place, Old-Kent-road, and deal with Mr. Anidjah. In April last, the prisoner brought me a table, which I purchased of him for 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—what makes it perfect in my memory is that I did not know that Mr. Anidjah dealt in tables, and the prisoner said, 'It has nothing to do with Mr. Anidjah; it is my own pro<lb></lb>perty"—I therefore paid him at once—he did not give me a receipt—he brought the table in the van which comes every week.</p>

I had been accustomed to buy looking-glasses of him—I had not bought any pins—I deal in furniture, looking-glasses, and miscellaneous articles, but no fanoy articles—I did not pay for my goods on delivery—I used to run an account with Mr. Anidjahy and paid him a little at a time; sometimes 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., sometimes 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sometimes 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received an invoice or statement with respect to this table two or three months afterwards: that is how I discovered it—Mr. Anidjah brought me in debtor 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I did not owe him a farthing—he and I had some words about it—I do not in general take a receipt for a small article like this—</p>

I am a looking-glass maker and furniture-dealer, of Bishopsgate-street—the prisoner has been my traveller about ten months—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—it was his duty to take out goods, sell them, and pay me, Mrs. Anidjah, or my foreman—an entry of the goods he takes out is made out in pencil on a long piece of board, and every article as it is brought home again, is credited to him on the board—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the book in which he enters goods which he has sold; it is in his writing—he accounts here for 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a table sold to Mr. Clamp in April; but he never paid me the money—I know of his taking out some breast-pins—here is no entry of the sale of them—when I questioned him, he said that he had sold two boxes to Mr. Miskin for 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which was not paid, and had forgotten it—I wrote to Mr. Miskin about it, and received an answer—Miskin is a customer of mine—I communicated the result of the letter to the prisoner, that he had nothing of the sort, and then he said he thought it was to Mr. Horsnaile that he had sold them—this is my book, in his writing—I gave him the money to purchase it—here is an entry "September 9, Mr. Horsnaile, Strood, two cases, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he has never paid me either 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this book was in his possession when I asked him for the explanation—I asked him for this book and another several times, and he said that he did not know where they were: I found it at last at his house—he said that he had not received the 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or one farthing from Horsnaile; but one day, Horsnaile was at ray counter, and was confronted with him, and he then said that he had accounted for it—that was some time in October—when he came home from his journey I went on my journey, which prevented my calling on him to account—I was away a fortnight or three weeks—I have a van—my servants sell the goods, and they are delivered at the time of sale—the prisoner had no van with him—I have a good many customers in that neighbourhood, and the prisoner had the pins in his pocket as samples, and</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long did his journey occupy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very nearly three weeks—he remitted me money three times during his journey—he paid his expenses out of the money he took, if what I gave him was not sufficient—this large book was at my establishment during his journey—I have not looked in this little book to see if there is any entry about the table—it shall be looked for—it was very rarely produced to me—I have often asked him for it; it is mine; I gave him the money to purchase it—the books have been in my possession since he has been in custody—I gave him in custody about a week after I returned from my journey—he came to my house when I was engaged with two gentlemen on business, Mr. Horsnaile being one, and when I went to look for him he was gone—I do not remember saying that if he did not go about his business I would serve him as I did Clamp, or give him as much as I had given Clamp—I had given Clamp that which I thought he deserved—I will not swear that I did or did not say that to the prisoner—I did not order him to go out of my establishment—I said, "Go out of the counting house," and when I came out he was gone.</p>

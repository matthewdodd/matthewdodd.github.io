                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Parl. We lodge at No. 1, Great Chesterfield-street, Marylebone—the prisoner came tome on the 30th of Jan., as if sent to me—she came in the name of Mrs. Potter, and said she was sweeper at a chapel, that her sister was in her confinement, in great dis<lb></lb>tress, and she wished me to get her a box of linen—I said I could not do that—she named Mrs. Cox and Mrs. Fielder, that I used to do needle-work for—I knew them to be very good people, and thought she must be a good woman—she asked me to lend her 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I lent her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she then said she was very faint, and asked for a glass of water, which I gave her, and half a glass of gin in it—she then threw her arms round my neck, with a view, I thought, of taking my snuff-box—I put her aside, and said I did not like to be touched by a woman—she then asked me to lend her another shilling; which I did—she got up to go down, and I said, "Do not go without a light"—she snatched my cloak off a line and went down with it—I said, "What have you got?"—she said, "Only a petticoat"—I called, "Stop that woman! she has got my cloak"—she got out—I gave an alarm, and the policeman took her with the cloak upon her, at eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I went to your apartment; you told me to sit down aside you; I asked you for the shilling, and asked you for a little cold water, and you went and brought a black bottle to the table, and poured out of it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, I gave you half a glass of gin, and compassion induced me to give it you—I took my snuff-box and gave you a pinch, but I saw your manceuvre to take it from me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I asked you for the loan of a shawl to go to my sister's; you said you had no shawl, but you had a cloak you could spare till the next morning, when I could return the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; you told me to go home, as you expected your husband. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I gave you the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for your poor sister—I did not lend the cloak—I did not tell you to go—I told you to go to a chair which I pointed to.</p>

I received information that the cloak had been stolen—I found the prisoner at the Jolly Bakers, in Little Chesterfield-street, with this cloak upon her back—I asked her where she got it from—she said, "Why stole it, to be sure; where do you think?"—I took her to the station with great difficulty—it took three of us to take her there—she said she would not go—at the station she said Mrs. Paul lent her the cloak.</p>

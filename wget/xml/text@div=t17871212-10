               <p>I am a private house-keeper, I was going along Brick-lane, near seven in the evening, I took some of the things down to the Justice; these jumps were brought to me sealed up; I live facing the prosecutor's house, I heard the cry of stop thief from a boy, I turned round, and saw the prisoner come out of Hanover-court, just coming through the posts; if he came out of the prosecutor's garden, he must come from the court, a boy hallooed, stop thief; I took the prisoner without his shoes; I said you must stop, my friend; he said, I have nothing about me, and these jumps were brought to me, and all in the course of two minutes; I can not justly say who gave me the jumps; I gave them to the Justice; they were sealed up.</p>

               <p>Mr. Hall. They have been in my possession ever since; the jumps were brought to me by one Greenwood, but he would not come.</p>

               <p>What bad place? - They call it Hell.</p>
               <p>Were you present in Brick-lane? - Yes, I saw the prisoner come out of Hanover-court, I heard a rumbling about; he ran out with the jumps underneath his arm, I hallooed out stop thief, and he dropped the jumps right facing the muffin-shop; and as the man was coming from Whitechapel, the witness Sadgrove stopped him; a sailor picked up the jumps; I saw the prisoner drop the jumps, that were delivered to Sadgrove by the sailor; I am sure I did.</p>

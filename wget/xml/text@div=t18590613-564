                  </hi>. On the 31st May, in consequence of instruction, I placed myself where I had a view of the Fleur-de-Lis public-house in Blos<lb></lb>som-street, Spitalfields—I got there soon after 6 o'clock in the evening—an officer named Elliott was with me—I gave him some instructions, in consequence of which he went into the house—I remained watching on the outside, accompanied by Inspector Bryant, and other officers—I observed the prisoner Davis come to the door frequently and go back, and in going hack he disappeared from the front of the bar, apparently to the back part of the house, and on each occasion I saw different parties go in, and appa<lb></lb>rently hold some conversation with him—that took place several times while we were watching—after that I saw Haddon go in the house, and he and Davis appeared to me to be in conversation, and at that time Davis again disappeared towards the back part of the house—he returned again to where Haddon was—after that I saw Elliott seize Davis, and on his being seized we rushed across from where we were in view of the place, and I saw Davis throw from his hand a paper parcel into the bar—it went under the beer engine—I picked up 5 counterfeit shillings in the sink, and under it one on the floor—they were all wrapped up separately in paper, except the one that was loose on the floor—I found a portion of the paper in which they were inclosed, and some of the coins came undone—Bryant picked up a piece of paper which contained coins under the sink where the shilling laid—I saw another officer take Haddon by the hand, and take from his hand a packet which contained 4 counterfeit shillings—we pushed the prisoners into the back part of the place, and I said, "Well, Mr. Davis, I have received instructions from the authorities of the Mint to look after you for dealing in counterfeit coin, and this is the fourth public-house I have traced you to during the last 18 months"—he said, "Very well, Sir"—they were then taken in custody.</p>

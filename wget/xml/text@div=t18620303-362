                  </hi>. I am servant at the Coach and Hones beer-shop, Mill-lane, Deptford, and am a married woman—on Friday, 21st February, the prisoner and some other marines were drinking at that house—I attended to them—one of them, not the prisoner, asked me to go and sell a silver spoon broken in three pieces—I took it to my mistress, and afterwards went to a pawnbroker's with it—the pawnbroker would not buy it, because I could not give a satis<lb></lb>factory account of it—I was coming back, and a constable took me on the shoulder, and asked me where I got the silver spoon, and I told him the truth about it—he came back with me, and I went up stairs—he saw the prisoner—the man was there who gave me the spoon—I went into the room and said, "Which of you men gave me tho spoon?"—the mau who gave it me pointed to the prisoner, and said, "That is the man it belongs to"—the prisoner said, "I picked it up in the street"—the constable then took him to the station—I gave up the pieces of the spoon to the constable.</p>

On Friday, 21st February, I went with the last witness to the Coach and Horses—she gave me these three pieces (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of a silver spoon—there were several marines at the beer-shop—I asked which one it was belonged to the silver spoon, and a marine there pointed out the prisoner—the prisoner could hear what he said—I asked him if it was true that it belonged to him; and he said that it did, that he had picked it up in the street as he came up from the barracks that morning—I told him that I could not be satisfied with the account that he gave, and I must take him—he did not say anything else at that time—afterwards he told me that it looked as though it had been run over, but that he had broken it into three pieces himself.</p>

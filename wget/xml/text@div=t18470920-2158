                  </hi> I am the prisoner's wife—I am now in Kensington workhouse—we did live in Earl-street, Kensington—I have nothing at all to say against him. On the 19th of July he came home about eleven o'clock at night very drunk—he was very much in liquor and out of his mind all that week—I had the child in my arms—I told him to go to bed, and he pushed me down stairs with the child in my arms—when I got to the bottom he hit me one blow I think on the head, and then took and broke the things with a hatchet—I did not faint—I think I must have had a touch of this sickness that has been going about—it came on that week—I thought I was at work all that week, but I understand that I was not, for I was far too ill—I do not think I lost my recollection after I was struck.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of William Beazley, and live in Earl-street, in the same house with the prisoner. On Monday, the 19th of July, about half-past eleven at night, I heard a cry of "Murder!"—I went to the pri<lb></lb>soner's room, and saw his wife sitting on the bed—she seemed as if she had been knocked about and ill used very much—he was standing in the room tearing up his wife's bonnet and the clothes—he had nothing in his hand when I first went in, but after I had been there two or three minutes, he took up the axe, and said he did not care for any four men that came to take his wife's part—I took the axe out of his hand, and put it down against the door, and talked to him about ill-using his wife—he said he was sorry for what he had done, he would not ill-use her any more that night.</p>

On the morning of the 20th of July the prosecutrix came to my house—she appeared to be suffering from loss of blood—there was a contused wound on the scalp, and a lacerated wound on the left leg, as if from a kick—they did not seem very serious wounds—she complained of pain in the head, and I bled her.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Old Town, Clapham—about 6o'elock on the evening of 10th November I was in Long Lane, turning into Cloth Fair—I saw three or four young men in the street standing together, the prisoner was one of them—as I was passing the end of that turning the prisoner came in front of me, rushed at me and drew his hand down my waistcoat, caught hold of my chain, which had a watch at one end and a coin at the other; he dragged it out of my pocket and from the button hole and ran up the turning—I could see the watch and chain in his hand as he ran away—I started after him and was interfered with by the others, one tore my coat and another tried to catch hold of me—I knocked them on one side with my fist, got past them, and went after the prisoner—I called "Stop thief!"—I afterwards saw him taken by a constable—I only lost sight of him for one moment as he turned the corner—I am sure he is the man who took my watch—the value is 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I wore it at my waistcoat—one of the young men pulled my coat on one side to see if it was there.</p>

About 6.15 on this night I was in New Street, Cloth Fair and heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I saw some men running and followed them down the street—as I got to the corner the prisoner got in front of me and pushed me back twice, he took hold of my coat and asked me what was the matter—he then put his foot out and tried to throw me down—I missed the other man who was running—the prosecutor came up and said he had stolen his watch, and charged him—I took him to the station.</p>

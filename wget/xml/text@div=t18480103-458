We have been married twenty-two years—we habe never been separated, until I was in the Ham<lb></lb>mersmith workhouse three weeks before this occurred—my husband was then out of work—I left him in the street—I was only there one night—that is the only night we have beed separated since we have been married—this is our child with me—it is four years old next March—he was not at the workhouse, he remained with his father—I was at the Hammersmith Police-court about his ill-treatment before I went to the workhouse; but I forgive him all that—it has nothing to do with this—one Saturday night, about three weeks before this happened, I met him with the little boy in the street—we did not engage a room then—we did afterwards, in White Lion-passage, Harrow-road—I lived there with him up to the time of this occurrence—I did not send for a policeman while we lived there—a policeman named Pollard was in the passage—he did not come into the room—the landlady fetched him—she said she heard words, but there was nothing of the kind—on the day in question, my husband came home about half-past five—I set the tea things—he was going to take off his shoes and stockings, as he had got wet feet—I asked if he would have coffee or tea—he said he did not care, "You have made the tea, that will do"—I had boiled the water in a saucepan, as I had no tea kettle—the tea was not made before he came in—we had no table in the room—I made the tea, and poured out two cups, and a little mug for the child—I placed the two cups on a chair, one on each side, between me and my husband—the little boy cried for the chair his father was sitting on—he im<lb></lb>mediately got up, gave the child the chair, and sat down on the floor by the side of it, and therefore I must have got the cup that he intended for himself—there was no chair in the room but the one he sat on, and the one that had the tea things on it—he did not sit on the same side as before—I mentioned this before—I sent the boy for some milk—he was the only child we had in the room—he came back, kicked at the street door, and called "Mother!"—I went and opened it—I had not observed the cups of tea before I went—when I went to put the milk in I thought the cup looked rather thick, but the candle stood on the mantle-shelf—I tasted the tea, it was bit<lb></lb>ter and very nasty, not like tea—I asked the prisoner to taste it—he did so, and said, "There is nothing in it for you"—I said I would see what it was—he did not interrupt me, I placed the cup on the chair again, then poured the tea off into the basin; he took the cup out of my hand, and what there was in it he threw under the grate—I said I would go and see what it was—he said nothing then—he said afterwards it was for himself—I looked in the saucepan and teapot before I went out, but saw nothing—I tasted the other cup of tea, that was not nasty—that was upset when he gave the child the chair—it was filled up again—I did not taste it again—the child drank the tea in the mug—there was nothing nasty in that, for I tasted it—I went out to several doctors shops with the basin and cup—I went back to my husband, and said a doctor said there was poison in it, and he was to come out with me—I did not mention any particular kind of poison—he said he was not coming out—I went out by myself—a woman who had been at the doctor's and heard what I said, had sent for a policeman—Pollard came, I gave him the basin and cup, and accompanied him to Mr. Faulkner's, in the Harrow-road—my husband came in directly after—I have seen him take a great deal of</p>

On the even<lb></lb>ing of 22nd Nov., the prisoner came to my house and asked whether a woman had been in with a child with a cup in her hand, asking whether there had been any opium in the cup, I said, "No"—I did not know him before, he addressed me first—I am certain he used the word "Opium"—he went away immediately, and twenty minutes or half an hour after he was gone, his wife and Pol<lb></lb>lard came in together, and brought a cup and basin—I examined them cur<lb></lb>sorily—some dregs remained in the cup, which consisted, in my judgment, of coarsely powdered opium—I smelt the contents of the basin, but did not dis<lb></lb>tinguish any particular smell—the dregs smelt like opium—I did not taste it—the taste is very strong, but I was satisfied—the prisoner came to the shop again—the woman and Pollard went into the back room while I examined the things—they were certainly in the house when the prisoner returned—he was shown by the servant, or some one, into the back room—he said if any one had taken anything, he had taken it himself, and it must be inside his body; and he wished me to apply a stomach-pump—I do not recollect that anything had been said to him then—no one was present but the woman—Pollard was gone to search for him, but missed him—I did not think it neces<lb></lb>nary to apply the stomach-pump from any symptoms which he exhibited—I do not recollect that his wife said anything at that moment, or that anything was said about who put it in—I was engaged at looking at the poison.</p>

                  </hi>. I am lecturer on practical chemistry, at St. Thomas's Hospital. I received from Pollard a cup and basin, and analysed the con<lb></lb>tents—I found in the cup a small portion of a dark-coloured substance, which appeared to have been coarsely powdered, sticking against the sides—it was scraped away, and had the consistence of a very thick extract—it smelt strongly of opium, and had every character of powdered crude opium—I submitted it to a very careful analysis, and from it produced morphia, which is the active principle of opium; and also meconic acid, which is a substance which has never yet been found in anything but opium; it had the smell and taste of opium—I mean poppy acid—meconic means "poppy"—I found about half a grain of crude opium in the cup—I examined the con<lb></lb>tents of the basin—they contained a solution both of morphia and meconia—I made a rough estimate of the quantity, but being mixed up with milk and sugar it was difficult—I should say there could not have been in the quantity I had, less than half a grain more opium—there was not above a dessert spoonful of tea, hardly the tenth part of such a cup as this—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—according to my judgment, three or four grains of opium would be sufficient to kill a woman of that age and constitution, provided there were no antidotes used to prevent it—if opium was made into the form of an ordinary-sized pill, and dissolved in tea, I should not think it would present the appearance I found at the bottom of the cup—in the form of a pill it sometimes would and sometimes would not be compounded with other ingre<lb></lb>dients—I imagine if you ask for an opium pill, they would give you a pill formed of opium, but they might put something else to make it into the form of a pill—if I were asked for an opium pill, containing half a grain of opium, I should mix it with something to make it roll up a little better—opium existed in the contents, in the state of power—as regards the dregs I can say nothing, because part of them were thrown under the grate; but leaving the dregs out of the question, and supposing the whole to have been uniformly stirred up, there must have been four or five grains in the whole cup—I exam<lb></lb>ined all that remained in the basin; there was a dessert spoonful of tea in it—I should not imagine that it would be much stronger towards the bottom of the cup, because only the dregs would settle—it was not a saturated solution—not as much as it could possibly hold—whether the whole was equally infused, would depend on how long it had stood, and whether it had been stirred up or not—if it was not stirred up, the chance would be that it would float on the surface—whether it would get weight, would depend on the time it was left, you might leave it half an hour, and still find some on the top—the heavier portion would sink to the bottom—that which was left would be a little stronger than that at the top of the vessel, if you did not put anything in to disturb it, provided it has stood for a length of time—it would never take up the whole of the opium, there is a portion of resin which would always remain at the bottom—all the soluble potion would be taken up and would be uniformly diffused—this at the bottom contained a great deal of the soluble portion of the opium.</p>

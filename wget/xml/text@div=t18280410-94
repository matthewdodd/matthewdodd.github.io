On the 1st of March, about half past nine o'clock, a man and woman came and enquired the price of a piece of mutton, which I told them; at that time another person came and enquired the price of a piece of beef; I turned to him, and then missed a piece of mutton and the man who had enquired the price of it; I do not know that it was the prisoner, but I recollected I had seen a man and a woman in front of the board - I looked at the woman, and she had not got it; I then saw the prisoner across the road - I went over to him, and said, "I want you" - he said, "What for?" and dropped the mutton behind him; I took it up, and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had he paid you for any meat? A. No; he had not given me half a crown - I do not know who the woman was; I had not seized another man before the prisoner - I had no mark on the meat, but it was a scrag of mutton which I had cut into three pieces, and this was the best end of it.</p>

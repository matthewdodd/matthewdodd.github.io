               <p>—the prisoner was the butcher, and the deceased William Wiggi the chief steward—on 6th October we had made fast at Port Said, and ther was a lighter alon side the vessel—I saw the prisoner go towards the steward in a very threatening way with something in his hand, and by the time got round the mast the blow had been given—I heard the blow and saw the steward falling overboard—he fell seven feet into the lighter—I took holt of the prisoner and handed him to the chief officer—he said something in French which I did not understand, and dropped this belaying-pin (<hi rend="italic">producd</hi>)—it is made of iron—before the blow was struck the steward was finding fault with the prisoner for being negligent with the poultry, and I saw him give the prisoner two or three blows; I cannot say whether with his open hand or fist—that was 10 minutes before I saw the steward falling into the lighter—the prisoner was standing behind the steward when he struck the blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi> The steward was sober—he used to drink now and then—Port Said is a hot place, and it is a common practice on going ashore to indulge a little—I saw the steward strike the prisoner two or three times, but the blows were not violent—I was 12 or 14 feet off—I moved forward and aft about the same distance—I could see them both—the steward did not continue to strike the prisoner—he was angry because the chickens were not caught directly, but he went 12 feet from the prisoner after striking him, leaving him to catch the fowls or encourage the men to catch them—they had gone over into the lighter—we were made fast to a buoy—the prisoner was first engaged at Calcutta; the steward engaged him—I heard that he had been in the service of the Ducal line of steamers; he had ex<lb></lb>perience of being at sea—I was loading the cargo, and coal was coming on board; over 100 men were employed in the general work of loading, but there was not considerable noise and confusion, because they had finished taking the coal in and had gone away—the ship was quite quiet during the 10 minutes which elapsed after the steward hit the prisoner—the prisoner was putting the fowls away, and the steward was trying to catch them.</p>

                  </hi>. I was surgeon on board the Duke of Buccleugh—on 6th October at Port Said I was called to the chief steward, and found him bleeding from a very severe wound at the back of his head, about three inches long, both incised and contused—this instrument would cause it—he complained of great pain in his back; he had no power in his limbs, and could not feel his legs—when I saw him he was in the lighter alongside the steamer—he was unable to move, and was carried on board—I then examined him, and found a bruise on the lower part of his spine, which would be likely to result from a fall overboard into the lighter—he remained paralysed the whole voyage, and on our arrival he was conveyed to St. Mary's Hospital—he was a very strong man, and was in robust health before this.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was told that the butcher had struck him with a belaying pin, which I saw afterwards with blood on it—I did not consider the wound on his head dangerous—he must have fallen on his back—he was a pretty temperate man; he took a glass sometimes—I never saw him strike any one before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in Holy Orders, and chaplain and secretary of the Deaf and Dumb Association, in Oxford Street—I am in the habit as secretary of receiving letters containing postage stamps, and small sums as contributions to the charity, addressed to me at the church, and from time to time I have missed certain of them—I communicated with the post-office, but they failed to find the delinquent, and I employed a detective—on Monday evening, 27th May, I took 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of postage stamps and did them up in three letters—there were thirty in one, eighteen in another, and twelve in another—I saw the letters addressed and I posted them myself—I did not receive those letters in the usual course, on the Tuesday morning—they were missing—in the course of Tuesday, in consequence of something the detective said, I went to the post-office, in South Audley Street, and I saw there the stamps which I had posted myself the night before—in consequence of that I have taken these proceedings.</p>

Petley said, "It is mine"—I found under it a stone-bottle of strong rum—I asked if they knew anything of it? they said, "No;" Lewis said he came down with the barge, and never left her, and that they had been asleep—I took them to the station, and left Wall there with Bargi-nall—I found this shipping-note on Petley (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went back and asked Wall what he did in the barge—he said he was ordered by Mr. Pope to take some papers to the watchman.</p>

            ; we watched four persons from near Exeter 'Change to Arundel-street - the prisoner was one of them; they walked on towards Temple-bar, and followed several persons very closely, as if to pick their pockets; near Arundel-street they closed upon two gentlemen, who were walking arm-in-arm - the prisoner and another were in front, and the other two behind; we saw the two front ones with their hands to the gentlemen's pockets, and something was drawn; the prisoner and his companion then crossed the street - Reardon ran and seized the prisoner, and his companion struck him a blow in the cheek; Reardon called to me that he had got the right, and I ran and told the gentlemen to come back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the handkerchief taken from the gentleman? A. No - I could not see what was taken from the gentleman; he owned the handkerchief, but refused to give his address.</p>
               <p>DANIEL REARDON. I was with Stevens. I saw the four lads - the prisoner and one more were in front; I saw them close on the pocket, and the prisoner took the handkerchief; they crossed the road towards me - I seized the prisoner with my left-hand, and the other with my right; the other struck me, and I let him go; I secured the prisoner, who had the handkerchief on his thigh; it appeared the same colour as the one taken from the gentleman - the gentleman came back, and the prisoner begged him not to prosecute him.</p>

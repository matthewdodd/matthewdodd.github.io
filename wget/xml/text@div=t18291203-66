On the 9th of November I dined at Merchant Tailors'-hall; I looked at my watch as I left, and it was half-past twelve o'clock - I had sat down to dinner about six, and drank about my ordinary allowance of wine; one is a little more gay with liquor than when dining alone, but I was perfectly sober: I was accompanied from the hall by my brother, Mr. Loveday, Pope, Mott, and a young man called Frederick, who is clerk to Mr. Leplastria; Pope and I had dined at the hall - the rest were invited to the dessert, and all left together; my brother, Frederick, and Mott quitted us - Loveday left me soon after, and I remained to speak to Mr. Pope; we talked about the pleasant evening we had passed - when Mr. Loveday was twenty-five or thirty steps before us, I perceived a man assault him, and went to his assistance; the instant I was going to his assistance, the same man came to me, and struck me in the lower part of my belly; I will not positively swear it was the same man, but believe so - I felt stifled with the blow, and at the same moment the man who struck me seized the chain of my watch; the end of the chain being appended to my waistcoat button, I attempted to get hold of the chain with my left hand, but could not - I passed the middle finger of my right hand into the button-hole of the man's coat; while I was holding him and struggling with him, another man arrived, and struck me on the head with something which he had in his hand, but what it was I do not know - I fell down from that blow, perfectly senseless, and think I brought the other man down with me; I recollect that the skin of my finger was grazed in the struggle - I do not know how long I remained in that state; while on the ground I received a blow on my arm, and one on my head - whether they were from feet or what I cannot say, but I felt them, and revived to a certain extent; I endeavoured to get up, and was taken to the watch-house, where my senses returned - I was sitting down on a little bench near the table - I felt for my handkerchief to wipe the sweat and blood from my face; the first thing I observed was that my watch was gone, and on searching for my handkerchief I discovered that my snuff-box was not in either of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030027"></xptr>pockets; five or six minutes after complaining of the loss of my snuff-box, the hand of somebody passed behind my back, and at the same instant somebody said, "Sir, is this your snuff-box." but this was not till some persons' pockets had been searched, and the contents put upon the table - I had it when I left the hall. I presume my watch was taken when the chain was seized - I did not use my snuff-box after leaving the hall, and cannot say whether it was taken- I think Puttock is the man who seized my chain, but I do not mean to affirm it, and believe he is the man who struck me in the lower part of the belly; it was the same man in whose hand I saw the chain - I think McAdam is the one who struck me in the head, but will not swear it -I saw something shining in his hand as the blow descended - I do not know London sufficiently to state where I was attacked; it was very near the Bank - I had left the hall five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Was it not after the prisoners were searched that your snuff-box was given to you? A. Yes - it was about the time they were talking of searching their pockets; it was at that period that it was produced - I do not recollect stating that the pockets of some persons had been searched before: if I did, I beg it may be stated that I mean to swear it was about the time there was a talk of searching their pockets - I do not mean to say the contents of their pockets were on the table: I drank sherry and port, but no claret - I had punch made of wine and water; I was sober when I left the hall - I had no quarrel with any person in the hall - there was a young man who had his sleeve torn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the beadles of the hall obliged to follow you and your party, to keep you quiet in the street? A. There was a quarrel between a young am and Mr. Leduke, and I begged my brother to carry off the young man- I do not recollect the beadles following me; I was two or three minutes in the watch-house before I said I had lost my watch, but I cannot exactly state, as my senses had not perfectly returned - I swear my snuff-box was not in the same pocket as my handkerchief, for when I took out my handkerchief I found it was not there, for I felt for it - that is one of the first things a snuff-taker does; I immediately complained of losing it, and it was passed to my right-hand, and put on the table - I did not see who handed it to me; it was neither of the prisoner, for they were on my left, and it was passed to the right - it was a dark night, but the lamps were lighted; I was knocked down a minute or two after they came up.</p>
               <p>DOUGLAS LOVEDAY. I did not dine at the Merchant Tailors '-hall, but was at the dessert; I left with Mr. D spres - a great many persons came away at the same time, his brother, Mr. Hope, Mr. Mott, and young Frederick; I cannot state the time - I believe I was the cause of their leaving; Mr. Despres appeared to be sober - I was sober; there had been a quarrel and disputes at the hall - Despres was not a party to them; after we left I separated from the party, in two or three minutes, went on alone, and in about two minutes I met two men, who appeared a little in liquor - I do not know who they were; they appeared to be coming from some feast, and having a little wine in their heads, they invited me to go and take some wine with them - I not having had enough, consented, but did not go, for recollecting Mr. Despres was a foreigner, I thought I had better return to him; I went towards him, and when in a part that was pretty well lighted, there came out of a place very ill lighted (called Bartholomew-lane) a man, who without ceremony struck me a blow in the face - I had never seen him before; I felt the blood run from my nose - I returned the blow with my left hand, upon which something like a regular fight took place between him and me: during the struggle my umbrella was broken: the stick of it was a came - finding I was nearly a match for him, he endeavoured to throw me down, and succeeded; I fell undermost, and found my umbrella completely broken, leaving only the came in my hand - I cannot say it was one of the prisoners, but it was the same man who struck me, that afterwards struck the prosecutor; I planted the umbrella on his neck, and said, "You are the better man. but take care," and continued to strike the umbrella on his neck, and he quitted me without my receiving any further injury - this occupied two or three minutes - I then found myself in the custody of somebody, and was taken to the watch-house; the prisoners were there- I cannot say whether they were there before me or after; I think every thing that took place was in their hearing - on going into the watch-house, I inquired whether I was a prisoner or not, and was told I should know presently; Mr. Despres was brought in apparently lifeless, but bleeding from a would in the forehead - he was pale and covered with blood; the officer asked if I knew him - I said he was a friend of mine; I was then told I was complainant - having some sticking-plaster, I 
               <persName id="t18291203-66-person502">drew</persName>
             the lips of his wound together, and bound up his head with my pocket-handkerchief, and washed his face; he appeared better, and then putting his hand to his watch-pocket, said, "But my watch is gone;" the prisoners were both present - he said it was worth about sixty guineas, and putting his hand to his coat-pocket he said, "And my snuff-box is gone also;" he appeared considerably affected at this loss, as he declared he would not have lost the box for 500l. - the officer ordered the prisoners' pockets to be searched; some duplicates were found in them, and a tin box, with "Warren's patent blacking" written on it - there was a red mark on it, which had the appearance of blood; whether before or after the prisoners were searched, I cannot say, but much about that period; some person in the watch-house said, "I wonder whose snuff-box this is?" Despres immediately recognized it - I asked the person in the prisoners hearing where he found it; he said, "On the bench;" it was placed on the table -I asked both the prisoners if they would state which of them had struck me; both denied it - they were taken to the Compter; I believe Puttock to be the man who struck me; I have no other reason for that belief, than that his lips were cut and bleeding at the watch-house; the prisoners are not the persons who asked me to take wine- they were well dressed, and the prisoners meanly; I recollect striking the man in the face, and thought I might have cut his lip, but cannot say.</p>
               <p>JOHN DASHFIELD. I am a watchman of Broad-street ward. On the night of the 9th of November, at half-past one o'clock, I saw McAdam, I believe, strike Mr. Despres a blow on his forehead, it was with his hand, I think, for I saw nothing else - he struck him only once; the blood<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030028"></xptr>directly flowed from his head, and I directly took McAdam into custody - I am certain it was him: I had heard a noise and scuffle and went among them - McAdam directly struck the blow, and I took him; I called Howard, my mate, who came to Mr. Despres' assistance - I collared McAdam the moment he struck the blow; there were ten or twelve persons there - I do not know who they were.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not at first swear you believed McAdam struck the blow? A. If I did, it was unknown to me; I did not mean to say so - he had nothing in his hand, when I took him; Despres was on his knees- the blow was the first thing I saw; they were about three hurdred yards from Merchant Tailors'-hall - I had called half-past one o'clock; they could not have come straight from the hall, if they left at half-past twelve - I cannot be mistaken in the time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where was this? A. At the top of Bartholomew-lane; I did not search McAdam.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Broad-street ward. I was out on the night of the 9th of November, and heard a noise; I went to the top of Bartholomew-lane, being called by Dashfield; when I got up he had McAdam in custody - I went over to Mr. Despres, and saw him laying bleeding; I rose him up; I saw Puttock cross towards the piazza of the Exchange, from the place where the prosecutor lay, and took him in charge - before I took him he used a had expression, and said, "I won't see my friend ill-used;" Lloyd came to my assistance, and we took him, and Mr. Despres to the watch-house - both the prisoners were searched there, but the property was not found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. No watch or any thing was found on them? A. No - they were searched instantly, and both complained that they had been assaulted and ill-used in the street; Puttock said he would not stand by and see his friend ill-used; it had gone half-past one o'clock: what took lace was before I got up - I picked up the snuff-box in the watch-house, alongside Mr. Despres; I suppose it had fallen out of his pocket, as he pulled his handkerchief out; it was on the bench alongside him where he sat - as soon as I picked it up I gave it to Jones, who gave it to the officer of the night: the prisoners had been searched before I picked it up; neither of them could have put the box where I found it - they were quite on the opposite side of the watch-house; one of them said he had two pairs of trousers on, and desired both should be searched.</p>

               <p>JOHN GIRTON. I was officer of the night; when the prisoners were brought to the watch-house it was nearer two o'clock than one; Despres had a cut on his forehead, and Mr. Loveday dressed it - Despres pointed to Puttock, saying he was the man who had struck him; Dashfield said No, it was the short one who struck him - Despres afterwards said it was the short one who struck him; in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes he put his hand to his fob, and said he had lost his watch - he pointed to Puttock, and afterwards to McAdam, and said he was the one who struck him; I immediately searched them - Despres was taking his handkerchief out of his pocket, and after that a snuff-box was found by his side, by Howard, and given to Jones, and by him to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He at first pointed to Puttock, and when Dashfield said it was the little one, he pointed to the little one? A. Yes; he was equally positive of both - he was not exactly asked which struck him, for we could not make him understand, but he pointed to the party; the box was found directly he pulled out his handkerchief - it could not have laid long there without being observed: it was quite away from the prisoners - they could not have put it there; they both complained that they had been assaulted, and had returned the assault.</p>
               <p>Puttock's Defence. I am innocent.</p>

            . I was attending to trim the lamps at Merchant Tailors'-hall on Lord Mayor's Day, and saw Mr. Despres and Loveday; about six more were in their company - they left the hall about one o'clock, and in consequence of something that was said I watched the party along the street; Mr. Despres seemed very drunk, but Mr. Loveday was not so tipsy - the whole seven of them in the hall were tipsy; - Mr. Despres had hold of Mr. Loveday's arm; they stopped in Threadneedle-street, and I saw the two prisoners coming along towards Bartholonew-lane, by the side of the Bank, and by the time they got to the corner of Bartholomew-lane, within a yard, Mr. Loveday and Mr. Despres came up meeting them, and Mr. Despres struck McAdam, and directly one of the prisoners said to Mr. Despres, "You are mistaken;" the prisoners directly pulled off their hats, threw them, into the road, and struck again; there was a scuffle - the watchmen had not come up at that time; they came up very shortly after the scuffle - they stood a minute or two, and interfered at last; I told the watchman the prisoners had been struck and insulted first, and struck again in their own defence - the watchman said then it was his duty to take them; the beadles of the hall came up - they were sober, and so was I - I am certain the prisoners were struck before they touched Despres or Loveday; they got close against the wall to make way for them to pass - McAdam was struck before any blow was given to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time they left the hall till they got to Bartholomew-lane, was their conduct peaceable or otherwise? A. They were fighting. I light the lamps at different halls, and of this Court.</p>

            . I live in Finch-lane, and am ward-officer of Broad-street. I was attending at Merchant Tailors '-hall: I consider that the prosecutor left form half-past one to a quarter to two o'clock - they were decidedly tipsy, all of them; I consider so from their behaviour in the hall -Mr. Loveday was the most sober, but I should not consider him sober: we followed them out; one, who is a livery man was going the wrong way - I tried to put him right, but did not succeed; he was one of this party - I begged him to go his own way; he said he would not, he would go after his friends - I followed at a distance, to see that no quarrel took place in the ward; I saw a scuffle, but no blows - Sheffield was before me, and interrupted my seeing the first of it; I came up after the scuffle, and in consequence of my interference the whole set were taken to the watch-house; after Despres charged the prisoners with assaulting him they replied that they were assaulted first; they were singing and going on in the hall, and in the coffee-room I parted four of them from fighting, but can only swear to one of them, which is Mr. Loveday - I know nothing of the prisoners.</p>

I was conducted to the watch-house by a witness here, and he is the only one who had indentified McAdam; it has been suggested that I was a little drunk which was not the case - I quitted Mr. Despres either in Broad-street or Threadneedle-street; we were not arm-in-arm in Bartholomew-lane - I wished them good night, went home, and I did not see Mr. Despres again till he was in the watch-house.</p>

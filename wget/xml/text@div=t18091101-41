                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18091101-41-victim374 t18091101-41-viclabel248"></join>. - A. I am; on the 27th of September, I sold the prisoner an ox, the price of it was 17 l. 10 s. he paid me ten guineas in cash, and seven pound in note.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the notes consist of. - A. Two two's and three one's, apparently bank of England notes. I put the cash into the notes and wrapped it up together to give to my book-keeper; on the next day I gave them to Mr Skinner, my book-keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the cash and notes you gave to Mr. Skinner were the same cash and notes you received of the prisoner. - A. I took out two half guineas and gave him a one pound note and a shilling for it. I am sure it was the same money; I am sure the five notes that I took of the prisoner I gave them to Skinner on the next day. I bid him put Taverner upon them, I gave him the five first, I saw him mark the outside one. I gave him the money and the five notes.</p>
               <p>WALTER SKINNER. Q. You are an agent to a salesman in Smithfield market. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the last witness Mr. Job Coles. - A. Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember receiving any notes of him. A. Yes; there were seven pounds put together which Mr. Cole gave me in the name of Taverner; and while I was making the entry he told me that he took two half guineas away from the guineas, he said, here is a one pound note and a shilling. I believe I wrote Mr. Cole's name upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the notes that you received of Mr. Cole's independant of that one pound note.</p>
               <p>A. Two two pound notes, and three single one pound notes. I mark the outside of the five with the name of Taverner upon it; this is the outside note, I put twenty-eight upon it because I received it on the 28th; the next day I put nine on it. I marked the other four, upon the front Taverner and the day, the 29th being the day I marked them, these are the identical notes. I doubled them up and put them in a book which I keep for the business of Smithfield Market, which book was put in a small drawer and remained there till the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these are the five notes. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner in Smithfield Market, on the 6th of October. - A. Yes, he came to enquire for Mr. Coles. Mr. Coles was just gone, he went to seek for him at the inn where the coach was going off into the country, he was in great anxiety to see him. He did not see him he came back; he told me he came about these notes which he understood Mr. Cole's had received of him. I recommended him to go to the bank, and told him that the notes were at the bank; he had nothing to apprehend if he could prove who he received them of. I told him they were forged notes; he told me that he had heard it in Smithfield Market; and that the clerks of the bank were after him. He declined going to the bank; he said, he could not say of whom he received them, if he was to die for it. He said, it would hurt his credit in the country; and people would talk a great deal about it in the country to his prejudice. I think he said, he had been arrested three times in a short period, he did not tell me upon what account. He said, he might have received them at Windsor Market, but, he did not know that he did received them there.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the notes after you received them. - A. I sent them to a banker's by a young man with other articles that I had received in payment.</p>
               <p>Q. However, you sent no other with the mark of Taverner upon it. - A. No.</p>

            . Q. You are one of the inspecters of bank notes at the bank. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to take this note in your hand, and tell me whether this is a forged note. - A. It is a forged one: the signatures are forged, it is not upon bank paper, it is a forgery throughout, there is no water mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the other two one pound notes. - A. They are from the same plate as the first, they are also forged throughout; they have the same artificial hand-writing. And these two one pound notes are also forged throughout, they are also from one plate, and are fitted up with the same hand-writing as the one pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing wanting to compleat the two two pound notes. - A. Certainly one of the date are wanting in both the two's, the left hand date is left out in both<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010028"></xptr>of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner give you any account in what manner he came by them. - A. He said, he received them at different times, these five notes; he said, he received his money in small sums; and in consequence of a banker failing in town he had hoarded up bank notes to carry to market; he could not give any account of having received them at different times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you serve that notice to the prisoner. - A. I did, it is a copy of a notice I sent him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I think the prisoner was first of all examined by the magistrate down in the country. - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q.He came and surrendered himself to the magistrate did not he. - A. No, he did not, he was taken by Dowsett the officer, at Windsor Market.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stated that in these notes there is no watermarks. - Q. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the paper-mark. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean that there is no water-mark of the Bank of England. - A. No, I know that is there.</p>
               <p>MR. NICHOLL. Q. You are a servant to Mr. Hebsworth. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember receiving any notes of the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes, at the Horseshoe, near Warvil, in Berkshire. It is a month ago last Monday, I received a bank note of him for my master for two sheep I had sold him. I delivered that note to my master.</p>

            . Q. Do you remember receiving any note from the last witness in the beginning of October, last. - A. I do, he told me he received it from Taverner. I received the note on the 4th of October.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I object to this.</p>
               <p>Court. It strikes me it is not admissable. I cannot couple crimes in this way: if the note had been produced and it proved to be of the same fabrication, then it might infer a dealing with the same machine that they were made of then there would have been a circumstance to couple it with this; if there had been any evidence to couple it with this, then I should have suffered it to have.</p>
               <p>PLATT KNIGHT. Q. You are a shoe-maker. - A. Yes, I lived at Alliport, at the time. I sold the horse to the prisoner and an orchard of grass; the poney was sold for four guineas, and the grass for three guineas and a half. He paid me a five pound note and a one pound note down in notes; this was in July, the day of the month I cannot say; I had no other note in my pocket, I carried them to Mr. Bovington, a currier, at Eaton, in Buckingham.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever apply to the prisoner for the amount of that note. - A. I did for the amount of the five pound note. Mr. Bovington sent to me that it was a bad note, I paid the amount of it. The prisoner went with me to Mr. Bovington; the prisoner said, he did not know where he took it; he promised to make it good, and he did so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the note shewn him. - A. No, it was stopped at the bank; he was told the note was stopped at the bank.</p>
               <p>MR. BOVINGTON. Q. You are a currier, living at Eaton. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive a five pound note any time in July last, of the last witness Mr. Knight. - A. I did I made an entry of it in my book, the book is here; 17th of July, No. 1676, taken of Mr. Knight, signed by Budd, drawn on the bank of England, dated August 13, 1808; the sum 5 l. paid to Messrs. Hull and Smith, bankers, Uxbridge Bank, on the 29th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any mark on it. - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards say any thing to the prisoner respecting that note. - A. Yes, the prisoner said, he knew nothing at all of whom he took it; it was very hard for him to return the money, every body knew he was poor; when he could return the money he would.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note, do you believe that to be the note that you received. - A. I have no knowledge whatever of the note; it corresponds in all respects with my entry. The person to whom I paid it is a quaker.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mr. LEE. Look at the five pound note, is that a genuine bank note. - A. It is a forged one. The one pound note real.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am not guilty of what I am accused; I can only say, I took them in my trade as good notes, and so I passed them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eleven witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of the East and West India Docks. On the 29th of June, I saw the prisoner in the Western Dock, with a chest and a hammock—he presented me a pass, and said, "Will you overhaul my things?"—I examined the chest, and then I lifted the hammock, and I said, "What have you got in it to make it so heavy?"—he said, "Only my old wet things"—I desired him to unlash it, which he did partly—I finished, and found in it a silver spoon, and fork, a bag containing 12lbs. of sugar, another with 12lbs. of mixed tea, and another with 3lbs. of coffee—I asked how he came by the spoon and fork—he said, "O, I forgot to give them to the steward, they belong to the ship the <hi rend="italic">Sophia</hi>"—I asked how he came by the other things—he said a sailor on board Captain Selby's ship gave them to him—I knew Captain Selby's ship was the <hi rend="italic">David Lion</hi>—he said afterwards that he did not get them from Captain Selby's vessel, but from a sailor on board a foreign ship.</p>

               <p>she arrived in the West India export dock from Jamaica—the prisoner was cook on board—the captain's name is Henry Pengelley—I did not miss any tea or coffee—the prisoner had nothing to do with this fork, only by accident it might have gone from the cabin to him—he once returned me a fork that went up—I served out the grocery to him for the ship's company every morn<lb></lb>ing and evening—on the day he was taken, I saw him leave the vessel—this spoon and fork are the captain's.</p>

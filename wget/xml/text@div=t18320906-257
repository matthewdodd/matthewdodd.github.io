            . I am the brother of William Willis; he was younger than me - he was seven years and seven months old. I was at Mr. Arnold's paper-manufactory with him some days before he died; I was there a week and two days - on a Thursday, about half-past one o'clock in the day, I saw the two prisoners there; Bowery leaned my brother over the valve of the steam-boiler, and Hartley let it off on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say why they did this? A. Because he took some grapes out of Mr. Arnold's garden the day before; he and some other <rs id="t18320906-257-viclabel1446" type="occupation">boy</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18320906-257-victim2105 t18320906-257-viclabel1446"></join>s had got into the garden and taken them - I think the prisoners were laughing when they did this; I did not hear what either of them said - the steam went to my brother's face.</p>

               <p>Q. Did it hurt him? A. No, only the fright; he became ill two or three minutes afterwards - he did not go home till about an hour after; when the steaming was going on he called out Murder! and tried to get away - he did not try to kick either of them; I think I have said he was trying to kick them - he died on the Sunday week afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This happened on a Thursday? A. Yes; I had seen my brother eating the grapes on Wednesday night - I did not eat any, they were not very ripe; I think he had a bunch - he eat some of them; I am not sure that he did not eat the whole bunch - it was as large as my first; they were green grapes - I saw him on the Friday, laying on the cellar flap; he could not play about, he could walk about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not walk about the place where the steamengine is, all day? A. Yes; he was taken to Mr. Wilson, the doctor.</p>

            . I am the last witness' mother - he is twelve years old next February; my son, who is dead, was seven years and seven months old; he came home to me about an hour after the steaming, and looked very ill; he was playing about on Friday and Saturday, and was taken ill in the middle of Saturday night - I called in Mr. Wilson on Sunday morning; he voided a worm on the Thursday or Friday after he was steamed - he vomited it upwards, when I gave him a cup of beef tea; I gave the worm to one of the Coroner's Jury.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way was he taken ill on Saturday night? -A. With violent purging and vomiting, and that continued till his death; he died on the Sunday following, the 2nd of September - I observed that his eyes never closed from the Sunday he was taken ill till he died.</p>
               <p>MR. WILSON. I was first consulted about this child on Sunday; he was attacked with violent vomiting and purging - I administered medicine adapted to that complaint; I saw him but twice - the second time was on Thursday; the mother did not show me the worm, nor apprise me of it - I did not attend the opening of the body; the disease appeared likely to terminate in death.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you judge of any other cause for death than the disease? A. My opinion is, there was something in the bowels and stomach causing continued irritation - a boy of his temperament and age eating unripe grapes I should think very likely to produce that; it was as likely to produce that complaint as any thing - it did not strike me at the time that he had worms; his mother did not inform me of his having been steamed till after the Thursday - as far as my opinion goes, I should think that could not have caused his death; I saw the worm before the inquest (looking at it) - there are generally a number of worms in the stomach where one is found; they are often produced by eating unripe fruit, that is the exciting cause, but they are produced by a morbid secretion of the canal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Would not a severe complaint of the stomach produce some complaint on the brain? A. That is generally consecutive; the brain and stomach act on each other - there is great sympathy between them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. We have heard of his eyes being continually open from the Friday till he died, does that indicate any thing the matter with the brain? A. It often does.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I opened the head and body of the child after death; the approximate cause of death was inflammation of the surface of the brain; there was a predisposing cause in the system, which was a very firm adhesion of the membrane lining the chest - that must have proceeded 
from inflammation; it was a predisposing cause providing an existing cause applied - I think it extremely probable that the steam being let off in his face 
was the cause.</p>


               <p>Q. Are you able to say that with any certainty? A. There was a great deal of probability to come to that conclusion - any powerful stimulant on the mind may produce inflammation of the brain; it might be caused by other means; we are very often unable to account for inflammation: of the brain; and this may have been produced by causes which I could not observe - I found no worms on opening the body,</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have heard he was playing about for two days after the steaming? A. Yes - I did not attend him till I was called in to open the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you agree with the opinion of the gentleman who attended him? A. With regard to the irritation of the stomach, I consider that a symptom of inflammation of the brain: unripe grapes might disorder his stomach - there is a great sympathy between the stomach and brain.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The boy had been vomiting and purging all the week - might not that be the consequence of eating unripe grapes? A. Very probably it might.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I attended the opening of the body - my opinion is that the child died from inflammation of the brain; from the representation given, I should naturally conclude that arose from a certain exciting cause - that is the steam which was let off while he was held over it - vomiting and purging for a week would undoubtedly cause death; there was no inflammation of the chest; but there was the result of a prior inflammation in the thorax on the left side - that was a previous inflammation, not within the last ten days.</p>
               <p>Q. Inflammation there sometimes produces some disorder in the brain? A. It is not usual - I have not witnessed it; there is certainly a sympathy between the stomach and brain; when the surface of the brain is inflamed we cannot sometimes ascertain the cause; it is very often so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When there is a disordered state of the stomach, would you not expect some consecutive disorder of the brain? A. Not permanent; I should certainly expect the brain would be affected by a disordered stomach - vomiting and purging would irritate the stomach- I should not think the quantity of unripe grapes he eat would disorder his stomach; there may be constitutions where eating a single unripe grape would cause vomiting and purging - a child eating a dozen might be likely to produce it.</p>

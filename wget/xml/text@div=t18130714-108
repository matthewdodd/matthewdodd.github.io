            . I am a city officer. On the 2nd of July, I was going down <placeName id="t18130714-108-crimeloc624">Holborn</placeName>

I knew the prisoner, Gosling, by the name of Lad; I saw him follow a gentleman; he pulled the gentleman's handkerchief out a little way; the other two were close by. Then the prisoner Wells pulled it a little further out; then Gosling took it right out. Gosling wiped his nose with it, and put it in his pocket. While the handkerchief was being pulled out in my judgment the gentleman did not perceive it. The prisoner Gosling turned round and saw me; he went across the road, and left the other two immediately. I took hold of Gosling; I told him it would not do. I took the handkerchief, and sent to the gentleman; the gentleman returned; he claimed the handkerchief in Gosling's hearing. The prisoner said he was sorry for it; he was in distress, and had had no work for some time. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140062"></xptr>gentleman gave me his address; his name, I think, was

            . I took the prisoner to Marlborough-street office; the gentleman appeared, and begged to be excused prosecuting, as he was going to sea. He lived in New North-street, Red Lion-square. I was present when the gentleman was examined: the gentleman gave in his name, and swore to that being his handkerchief. He said his ship was waiting for him.</p>

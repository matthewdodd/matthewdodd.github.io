            . I am a waiter to Mr. Terry, John's coffee house, Cornhill.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of these women. - A. On the 1st of April, about a quarter past seven o'clock, Dalton came in for a bottle of wine, accompanied by Fitzgerald; they asked for a bottle of wine; I did not like the appearance of them, and it being not the practice of the house to send wine out of the house I refused serving them. Dalton said she had had it frequently for the same gentleman that she came from; I told her she could not have it for that gentleman unless he was a subscriber and a friend; she then said he frequented the house, his name was Mr. Dalton, of Cheapside. I did not know the name, but in all probability I thought he being a respectable gentleman, and not knowing but he used the house, I went into the bar and tendered her a bottle of wine; she tendered me a guinea; I gave her half a guinea, five shillings, and two pence, which made the wine and bottles five shillings and fourpence; she disputed the price of the bottle of wine, and said she never gave more than four shillings and ninepence for a bottle of wine in her life there before; this was Dalton, the other said nothing. I told Dalton she could not get it for less; she refused having it except I would let her have it for four shillings and nine pence; I took the wine into the bar; she said give me my guinea and I'll give you the change; I held out my left hand to receive the change and tendered her the guinea with my right hand; Dalton had got the guinea; they both walked towards the door; I opened my hand, I found I had get only two pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they put something in your hand. - A. Yes, which I thought was the whole change; I called out to them to stop, they had not given me the right change; Dalton cried out she had. They both returned; Dalton insisted upon it she had given me the change, I insisted upon it I never received it; Dalton was riotous, Fitzgerald desired her to be quiet. I went for my master, he found Dalton in a riotous situation, he sent for a constable; she was taken to the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite certain that she played this trick upon you, and gave you no more than two pence. - A. I am certain of that.</p>

            . Q. You was sent for by your servant. - A. Yes, on Friday the 1st of April; I was in the bar of the City tavern; about seven o'clock Dalton came into the City tavern for a bottle of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180804060044"></xptr>wine, (I am master of that); the prisoner Dalton tendered a guinea for the wine, she said she should not pay five shillings and four pence for the wine; the bar keeper was giving her change, she disputed the silver, said there were Irish shillings in the change; and she as he supposed gave him the change about an hour after that I was fetched to John's coffee house, and told of the circumstance; in consequence of which I sent for a constable</p>
               <p>- SHIRVIN. I am an officer. I searched Dalton first at the counter; in her right hand pocket I found a new guinea and a penny piece. Fitzgerald had nothing about her except a farthing or a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Dalton's Defence. This young woman came to see me on the 1st of April, she lived in Ratcliffe highway. I told her I would go and see her home; my mother was very ill, I thought I might as well go in that place and get the wine.</p>
               <p>Fitzgerald's Defence. I went to see Mrs. Dalton, she came to see me part of the way home; she said her mother was very poorly; she went in to buy a bottle of wine for her; I went in with her; what past after I do not know.</p>

I live at 10, Edward Street, Limehouse Fields, and am apprenticed to a waterman and lightarman—I am nineteen years old—On Tuesday night 17th March, I was on the towing path of the Regent's Canal—when I got to the New North Road bridge—I saw the prisoner kneeling down on his knees, with his hands in the water—I was about a yard from him when I first saw him—I passed him, and when I had got about two yards past him, I asked him what he was doing, was he drowning a dog—he said no, a boy was in the water—he did not speak particularly loud—I went back, and pulled off my coat and handkerchief, and tried to get the boy in—I saw the hair of somebody's head, out of the water, and the tops of the fingers, I could not tell whether it was a boy—his hands were moving about—the prisoner asked me if I could swim—I said "No"—and he said, "He can't swim because his legs are tied"—I folded up my handkerchief and threw it behind the back of his head, and <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> him to the shore—I was able to reach his head—I got the handkercief behind his head, and pulled him in so that the prisoner could have got hold of him if he liked—I pulled the boy's head close to the bank—the prisoner was then kneeling down, in the same position that I first saw him—a packet of sugar fell out of his pocket, and he turned round and picked it up—I believe he had on the same coat that he has now—I don't know from what part of his coat the sugar fell, I did not see it fall—I only saw him pick it up, and put it in his poc ket—and by that time the boy went down—I told the prisoner to catch hold of the boy, because he was sinking, and he turned round and picked the sugar up—I was able to hold the boy's head with tho handkerchief two or three seconds—it was very dark; there were no lamps on the towing path, there was one on the opposite side, about 100 yards off—there was no lamp near enough to show any light—when the boy dis<lb></lb>appeared, he did not come up again—I saw nothing more of him—the prisoner did not say anything—I told him the best thing we could do was to go and get the drags—he went with me to get them, to the look<lb></lb>house, that was about one hundred yards from the spot—we got the drags, and went back to the spot, and a man came with a lamp, to show us a light—the prisoner did not seem to be in a flurry while we were going for the drags—I said to him "Who is the boy?"—he said it was his own son—I asked him how he came down there—he said he had sent him for half-a-pound of sugar, two hours previous, and he had come down there to look for him, and he had found him, and was going to take him to the City Road—by that time we had got to the lock-house—in going back to the spot I asked him how the boy got in the water—he said he slipped in and his slippers slipped off, and he pulled these slippers out of his pocket, and said, "Here are his slippers"—tho soles were a little damp, as they would be from walking on the towing-path, not wet—we then proceeded to drag the water, but were not able to find the body—a barge came by and disturbed us—the prisoner Raid he would</p>

About ten minutes past nine, on Tuesday night, 17th March, I was on duty in the New North Road—in consequence of information, I went to the lock-house, on the towing path, on the Regent's Canal—I saw the prisoner there and four or five others—I told the prisoner I had been told that he had thrown his son in the Canal—he did not appear at all excited when I told him that, he was sitting down, "If such is the case it amounts to murder, but as there is no witness here present that saw it done, I shall not take you in custody on that charge, but I must detain you, and take you to the Police Station"—he did not make any reply at that time—three or four minutes afterwards, when we got on the way to the station, about sixty or seventy yards from the lock-house, he said, "I sent him out about two hours ago for half-a-pound of sugar; as he did not return I went to look for him, and I found him, and we took a walk together, as we generally do, and when going under the arch he all at once slipped in, and his shoes slipped off; I tried to get him out but could not"—I then left him at the station—I was afterwards present at the charge was read over to him by the sergeant on duty—I have not got the charge sheet here—he made some observation at the time, I don't remember the exact words, but it was a denial of the charge—he said he was innocent of the charge—I went to the canal, and the spot was pointed out to me by Pritchard—I remained there till one in the morning—I did not assist in dragging that night, I did next morning—I know Crescent Place, Whitmore Road, where the prisoner lives—I have measured the distance, and sketched a slight plan of the place (<hi rend="italic">handing it in</hi>)—the prisoner's house is the second from the towing path—the wall of the house next to the towing path is ten feet high, it is 620 yards from the prisoner's house to the place where the boy was drowned—that is, measuring along the towing path—there is no access to the towing path from the prisoner's house—you would have to go to the Queen's Road Bridge—the are only two entrances, and from one to the other ia 1, 670 yards—that would be the nearest way of getting to the towing path—he could not get down by the Kingsland Road bridge, nor anywhere between the two points, except by getting over a wall, not between Queen's Road bridge, till you come to a little entry by New North Hoad bridge, 220 yards on this side, at the lock-house—there</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician and surgeon—on the morning of 18th March, I was called on to examine the dead body of a boy, at the dead house, at St. Mary's Church, Islington—I made an examination of it, it was in a very good state of health—there was no organic disease—it had every appearance of having been well looked after—there was some food in the stomach—there were no external marks of violence—I examined the legs, but could discover no mark whatever of any ligature having been placed upon them—if a ligature had been placed there, however slightly, I imagine there would have been some mark; there was not the slightest—a handkerchief tied on outside the trousers would leave no impression—death had unquestionably resulted from drowning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If a handkerchief was tied in a knot, would not the effect of the water be to tighten it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should question whether it would have any effect.</p>

            . I am ward-beadle of St. Andrews. On the 11th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, I was called upon, and told, that Chaplin had murdered his <rs id="t18121202-32-viclabel181" type="occupation">wife</rs>

               <p>Q. Was it on the ground floor - A. On the ground floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door open or locked - A. The door was open when I was introduced. There were some people within; they let me in; they are here. This was within a few minutes of six o'clock in the evening. I then immediately made application to the coroner of the City of London, to hold a jury, which was immediately granted. The coroners jury was held the next evening; and the next day, hearing the dreadful instrument was not found, I went in with the undertaker. The body was in a tolerable<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181212020020"></xptr>state to be measured for a coffin. I then requested the undertaker to shew me a light, as it was a very small, dark place. Nobody lived in the house. In searching I found a razor with blood on it. This is the razor. (Witness producing it.) I found it in a drawer in the next room to where the corpse lay. It was a small drawer, that draws out of a small deal table. That is all I know, and that is the razor I found.</p>
               <p>Q. You never know any thing of the man yourself, did you - A. I never saw him but once before, that was a few nights before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When the intelligence was brought to you that Chaplin had murdered his wife at last did not you know that he had been in a deranged state for some time - A. Indeed I never knew Chaplin.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you seen him shortly before confined for some strange, wild, mad conduct - A. No. I did not. I never saw him confined, only in the watch-house on the Saturday previous to the murder. The murder was on Wednesday. On the Saturday before I saw him and his wife in the watchhouse together.</p>
               <p>Q. That was, I believe, for attempting to cut her throat - A. I do not know what it was for.</p>
               <p>JURY. Did you find the woman dead when you went in the house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BENFORD. I am beadle likewise of the parish, and under overseer. I cannot say any thing to the present business; a former part I can.</p>
               <p>

            Were you called in on occasion of some violence he had committed in January last - A. It might be January or February I was called in.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you found him quite mad, and in a straight waistcoat - A. The first time I was called I did not find him so. I did not find him in a straight waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find him mad - A. That I cannot say. I am not a man of faculty. A complaint being laid to me that the man had attempted to murder his wife. I immediately went down to his house; there I found the man seated in a chair, and several persons about him. It might be in the month of January. I am not positive to the day. I went close to him, and took hold of his hand. I said, poor man, you are ill I am afraid; I will go and fetch a doctor. The doctor came, and spoke to him. He asked him how he was. He then leaned his head upon his hand, and said, he was very poorly. The doctor thought it was the effect of liquor.</p>

               <p>Q. My question was, about January last did you or not find him in a straight waistcoat - A. Yes. I did. He was spread upon his bed. with his arms spread out, and in a straight waistcoat, on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition did he appear to you to be in - A. I should have told you, I brought the doctor. I undid his hand, and he made a snatch with his hand. I then left him to the doctor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear out or in his senses - A. I cannot say. The doctor would not pronounce him out of his senses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of you, that day, cause him to be sent to a mad-house at Hoxton - A. The doctor, with some persons, went down to consult about it. I took him that night to Mrs. Burrows's, at Hoxton, and there left him, and after a short time he was out at large.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he continue there - A. About three weeks. His wife requested he might come out, and he came out.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of August last did the wife make any further application to you - A. Mr. Taylor made the application. He is the landlord of the premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she at different times made application to you - A. Yes, she has.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18121202-32-person353">Q. </persName>
            Upon any of these occasions that she has applied, has she represented him to be mad - A. I know but little of the man; every one supposed him to be mad.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever observed him to be much in liquor - A. I cannot say I ever saw him in liquor. I never was with him. About four days before the murder, his wife applied to me, on account of his offering violence. I said to her, Mrs. Chaplin, what is the matter now. She said, I shall be murdered. She said, that he had threatened to murder her. I desired her to go immediately to Guildhall, and I followed her. I advised her to go, and swear the peace against him, and when we came there the alderman was gone. We could not be heard. She pulled the razor out of her pocket, signifying that he had threatened to murder her with that instrument.</p>

            Independant of the act itself, before the hour on which you heard of the death of this woman, was not he uniformly considered as a madman - A. Yes. In short, I took a jacket with me, but I did not use it. I put the jacket behind me, and gave it to a person that he should not see it. That was the first time I was called in.</p>

            . I keep the Eagle and Child, Shoe-lane. On the 11th of November the prisoner come into my house, about six o'clock in the evening, and asked for a pint of porter, which I refused to serve him at first. I told him, his wife before had had some for him, about three minutes before. His answer was, he knew that she had had it. Then he said he must have a pint of beer, for he had just murdered his wife. I told him that he must be joking, he could not mean what he said. He said, he had done it. I immediately told a person to draw him the porter, while I went into a back room to inform two or three people that were there, what he said Two of them that knew him came out immediately, and heard him repeat the words again, that he had done it; and while I was left with him the two men went out of the door, to see if it was the case. His house is directly opposite of my side door; and while they were gone I asked the prisoner in what manner he had done it. He told me, that he gave her a violent blow at the back of her head, with a roller belonging to a mangle is the next room.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181212020021"></xptr>COURT. What she took in washing, did she - A. Yes, and mangling. Immediately after he took the razor from his pocket and cut her throat; during this time I had no answer from the party that had gone whether it was true or not what he said. With that he requested to to have a glass of peppermint. I said, I thought he would have known better, or something similar to that effect; he made answer that she was a good woman, he could not help it; I hesitated serving him with a glass of peppermint some time, but thought by serving him the glass of peppermint might be a way of detaining him until I knew whether he had done it or no; he gave me a shilling to take for what he had had, and went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him the peppermint - A. Yes; I then did not know whether he had done it or not; he went about six or seven doors further, to the Two Brewers. I understood that by other witnesses; he went towards Fleet-street. I heard, in a minute or two after he was gone, that he had come back and opened the door himself of his own house. I went myself down to the house, and there were some people in doors with him. I immediately got a constable to take him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not perceive what was in the house before you got a constable, did you - A. No; the constable took him directly away out of his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing about being taken up - A. I cannot say any thing to that. I did not hear him. I immediately went to Mr. Fletcher, the ward beadle, to tell him what had happened, that somebody might take care of the house. Mr. Fletcher came down, and took charge of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the house did you see the body of this unhappy woman - A. I immediately searched it before Mr. Fletcher; in the left hand pocket was a small knife and comb, in the right hand pocket was a pocket handkerchief, nothing but these things. She was quite dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine her head - A. I cannot say I did; her throat was cut in a shocking manner.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the course of living of the prisoner - A. He had been in the Guards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Fifteen years - A. He was an out Pensioner in the Guards at Chelsea.</p>
               <p>JURY. Do you know whether he had ever been wounded - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he often at your house - A. Not very often; he has been at our house two or three times very troublesome, and I did think him out of his mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you say from your own observations whether he was given to drinking at all - A. He used to be very steady for about a month or six weeks together, during that time he would not touch a drop of porter; after that time he would break out in a violent manner, he would make his wife fetch him porter at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any children - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When he came to you and told you that he had murdered his wife, he was quite cool and calm; was he not - A. He was as composed as ever I saw him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. And told you of having murdered his wife with as much indifference as any common occurrence; as composed as if he had told you his wife had drank her tea - A. Yes; that is the reason I did not think it so.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing of that kind of manner which you would have supposed a man had committed a horrid crime - A. Far from it. His wife was a very industrious good woman, as could be; no woman could be more industrious or more prudent.</p>
               <p>Q. And a kind woman, who gave her husband no provocations of any kind - A. I do not think she did; she was a quiet, well-behaved woman, as could be.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe your wife said to him, how could you do such a thing to such a woman as she was - A. I rather think she did. I believe he said in reply, he was obliged to do it; I can almost say it to a certainty that it was so; he answered with as much composure as if he had been doing her a kindness.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you were called in last winter when they were obliged to put a straight waistcoat on him - A. I was; that was the time he went to the madhouse; the very same night the wife came to me and wished to have assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Whenever he had these mad fits it was always directed to her - A. Whenever he had these fits she came to me, living near; she complained of his behaving in an improper way, that she did not know what to make of him; and he has twice come into my house and behaved in an improper way; he behaved very much like a madman certainly; I thought he behaved in a very strange way. When I got the straight jacket, I took a person with me not much in the habit of doing such a thing; I put it on secure that he could do no mischief. Dr. Davis examined to see if he had any wound on his head; he could not see that he had any.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the same night that he was taken to the madhouse - A. Yes, the very same night.</p>
               <p>JURY. Were you aware, after you were called in by the deceased, that he was overpowered with liquor - A. I cannot say; I looked upon him as deranged; he never was in the habit of drinking spirits; when he broke out he used to drink beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it was the effect of liquor - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he gave you the shilling on the night that he did the murder, and after that he took the change as a rational man - A. Yes, he took it very coolly indeed and counted it over; and that is the reason I did not think that he had done it.</p>

            . On the 11th of November I went into the Eagle and Child public-house, I and my brother, to have a pint of porter, merely to look at the evening paper; this was between the hours of 5 and 6; we had one pint; my brother said we had better have another pint; we had another pint; I started to come out; I met the landlord of the Eagle and Child public-house coming into the tap-room, and in consequence of what he said to me I immediately went into the bar where the prisoner was drinking a pint of porter; I spoke to Chaplin; I said, how do you find yourself, Chaplin; he said, middling, Winster, I have done it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him before - A. Yes, I had long known him: I have been in the army with him for several years. I said, what have you done; he said, I have killed my wife; I said, I hope not; he said, I have indeed, and he had done it to perfection, he said. I saw him put his hand into his pocket to pay the landlord for the porter that he had had, and as he held his hand to give the landlord the money I saw the blood on his wrist; then I made a motion to the landlord to keep him in hesitation while I ran to his house.</p>

I went to his door; my brother got there before me; my brother was knocking at the door; he could not get in; I knocked at the door very hard; I was for breaking the door open; my brother said, do not, get a constable; I said, no, wherever there is murder we have a right to break the door open. I went to my wife; my wife was very intimate with the prisoner's wife, and then returned to the prisoner's house, and when I came there I saw some person going into the door, and when I came to the door I found my brother and the prisoner returning from the corpse; Chaplin said to me, there she is, I told you so. When I saw the corpse I was shocked for a moment until I came to myself; I then said to him, do not you call yourself a pretty fellow; he said, it is of no use to say any thing, for, said he, I have saved many a life by doing that to some thousands; nothing further passed in conversation. He walked to and fro along his wife a considerable time; he did not seem to be affected at all. We waited there till the constable came.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were you - A. Me, my brother, and him, only us three. The deceased lay upon her back on the floor. The constable came. I said to the prisoner, come, get your hat; we went up stairs into his bed-room; he took his hat out of a corner-cupboard; I had the light in my hand; the prisoner put his hat on his head; he had a jacket on; he took his coat off the bed and put it on; he then went to the chest of drawers; he said, he must see if there was any money; when he could not find any he put in the bottom drawer with his knee; he said, I must have something, for, said he, I shall want some victuals when I get in prison. He took out a handkerchief, and a gown, and another article. I then said, Chaplin, you have got plenty, you shall not have more. I turned round with the candle to come down stairs. I came down stairs nearly to the bottom step, the prisoner was about on the centre of the stairs; he said, Winster, stop, I forgot; forgot what, said I; why, said he, some silver spoons; he said, they would fetch him something; I said, no, you have got plenty, you shall not have any more; we came into the room where the deceased lay; he took a handkerchief out of his pocket to tie the articles up in that he had taken out of the drawer; then the patrol came to the door; the patrol said to the constable do you want me; he said, yes; the prisoner, the constable, and the patrol then went out, and the prisoner, when he was out, gave me the key of the door; he said, you are the only friend I know, you take care of the key. I have never seen any thing of him from that time until this.</p>
               <p>COURT. You told me that you had served in his Majesty's service with the prisoner - A. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. In this last service that you have been with him how has he been in his understanding - A. He was as well as any soldier in the regiment.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. In good health you mean I presume - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. But you have known him since he was a Chelsea pensioner - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. With the same intimacy as when you were in the army together - A. Yes, but not so much in the habit of being with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You often saw him at his own house, I suppose - A. Yes. I saw him on the Saturday before this dreadful affair happened; I had no conversation with him then.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you conversed with him intimately for the last three or four months - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When he conversed with you did he appear to be in his right senses - A. Yes, at all times. One time in the last summer he called upon me about half past five in the morning; he said he wished to speak to me; I went to him; I walked some yards with him; he said, Winster, you are the greatest friend I have in London; said he, I am going to dispose of my goods; I said, what is the matter; he said, oh, the devil has got me, he is coming for me; I said, you are talking foolish; I said, what is your wife to do when you have disposed of the goods; oh, he said, she is provided for. I left him and went to my work. I do not know where he went to at that time.</p>

            . I am brother to the last witness. On the 11th of November I and my brother went into the Eagle and Child public-house to have a pint of porter. I went at first and knocked at the prisoner's door; I knocked several times, no one answered; my brother came down, he knocked at the door, and likewise kicked at the door, no one answered; he went away; I stopped in the passage, it was very dark; I heard somebody coming down the passage, I said, is that you, brother; he replied, is that you Winster. I said it is; he came down; he had the key in his hand, he unlocked the door; Winster, he said, I have done it, I have murdered my wife; I did not then think he had done it; he told me to come in; I went in; I saw the deceased laying upon her back; there was a light upon the mantleshelf; the deceased was laying upon her back, with her head against the jam of the chimney-piece, with her throat cut, her throat was cut nearly so as I could put in a half-pint pot; Chaplin, said I, how could you murder your wife, such a good creature that she was; his answer was, she was a good wife; I said, Chaplin, how could you do such a thing; he replied, I was obliged to do so to save others. I immediately came to the door of the house, saying, that she certainly was murdered; with that my brother came in immediately, he said, how could you do such a thing; the prisoner said, I have done it and it is no use saying any thing about it. The constable came in immediately, and one of them told him to get his hat; the constable told me or my brother to go to the watchhouse to get a pair of handcuffs and to fetch the patrol; Chaplin, the prisoner, said, I do not want any handcuffs, he said he would go along with him; he went up stairs with my brother and the constable; he came down stairs near to the bottom saying, he had forgot the silver spoons, that will bring me something; my brother said he had enough; then the prisoner said he hoped they would let him take some things to pawn; he was going out of the door, the constable told him he should not go out with the things so open in his hand. He went and tied them up on the table. That is all I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the habit of knowing Chaplin any time - A. Yes. I had not seen him for four or five months before this happened, perhaps.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he was talking to you did he appear to be in liquor - A. Not to me; at certain times I know that he would drink a good deal.</p>
               <p>MR. CORBY. I am a constable of St. Andrew's, Holborn. I took the prisoner in custody.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181212020023"></xptr>Q. You heard the two Winstens examined; have they given a true account of it as far as passed until you apprehended the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner in taking him to jail - A. Yes; the first thing we went to a pawnbroker's in Fleet Market by his desire; he put down the bundle on the counter; he untied the handkerchief and pushed the clothes to the man; Mr. Guest's man said, how much do you want on these; he replied, as much as you can let me have; and while the pawnbroker was looking at the things, I said, if he has any thing a shilling or two will be quite sufficient, as he is going to prison, but the better way will be to take him to prison and to send somebody with the things; the pawnbroker said, I will have nothing at all to do with it. Chaplin said nothing at all to this. In going along I asked Chaplin how he came to do it; he said, he had done it and it was what he meant to do; he was right enough, and he hoped she was happy; he wanted to stop at several places to have beer; I would not grant him liberty of doing that. When he got to the Compter I searched him; he had nothing in his pocket except a shilling, some halfpence, and a farthing, and a botkin case.</p>

            . Mr. Gurney. Q. I believe you are a printer, residing in Shoe-lane - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is your house to the house in which the prisoner lived - A. Only separated by a small yard; his house is between my dwelling-house and printing-office, which is down a court. The prisoner was a tenant of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember in the month of January last this poor woman making application to you respecting her husband - A. About that time, or rather earlier, some time in last winter, perhaps a month before, he was sent to Hoxton. She told me that she was afraid her husband was deranged, and wished that I would come and see him and speak to him; that he had taken no food for some days, and slept very little at night. I went to see him and found him sitting up in bed, occasionally reading out of a hymn book which he had in his hand; he was not outrageous; he was quite in a dejected low state; he said he was going to die in a day or two. I began to talk to him, and tried to compose his mind; he talked to me in a wild incoherent manner, and he spoke of seeing things which were not real; he talked of the sky being in flames and a great many things. After talking to him some little time, what I thought might be of service, I left him. After that I enquired occasionally after him of his wife; she told me that he was in the same state, and sometimes better. After that he was better for a while, and after some interval she applied again. I understood from her application that he was then in an outrageous state; she then told me that she feared that he would attempt something against her life or his own; the wife said, she thought it necessary for him to be confined; that she had borne with him as long as possible, and she wished me to apply to the parish-officers to procure his confinement as a lunatic. I went with the parish officers, and he was put in a straight waistcoat; he had the straight waistcoat on, some of the neighbours put it on before I went there, and he was sent to the madhouse. I am persuaded that he was deranged.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday preceding the transaction did his wife make any application to you - A. She had applied to me before that; she always represented him to be insane to me, and I questioned her whether it might not be the effect of drinking; she assured me that he had had no liquor at the time she applied to me.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday night the wife made a complaint to you - A. Yes, she did. On Saturday night word was brought to me at the printing-office that she had escaped out of the window and taken refuge in my dwelling-house. I found she had. I saw her there. In consequence of the alarm I went from my printing-office to my house, and there I found her. After that I went to the prisoner's house; I saw him, but I did not see much of him; I thought he was deranged; he was then in the custody of the officer; he seemed quite wild.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Mr. Taylor, give to me what complaint she made to you that Saturday - A. She told me that he had fastened the door of the room in the house that she and he was, and that he made an attempt upon her life with a razor.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, Mr. Taylor, he was kept in confinement till the Tuesday - A. I understood so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you know of your own knowledge, that he was kept in confinement until Tuesday - A. I saw him taken away. I saw him at Guildhall on the Tuesday, when he was before the Alderman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. to Mr. Fletcher. Do you know what day he was set at liberty after he was taken up on Saturday night - A. On the Tuesday, and on the Wednesday this unfortunate affair took place.</p>
               <p>Mr. Taylor. On Tuesday I persuaded the poor woman to go and swear the peace against him, as all attempts of confining him did not avail to have him permanently confined; she said she could not bring her mind to do that; she said if that was the only thing that could be done, she never would do that, whatever might be the consequence.</p>

               <p>Q. In what state was he when under your care - A. Sometimes quiet and sometimes outrageous; we were obliged to put a straight waistcoat on him frequently.</p>

He said by so doing he should save the life of thousands; he had every appearance of being a deranged man.</p>

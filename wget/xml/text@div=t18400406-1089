In consequence of informa<lb></lb>tion, I watched the prosecutor's premises on Monday and the two follow<lb></lb>ing nights, at a quarter-past seven o'clock. On the 19th of March I saw the prisoner come down the yard, and look about some time very cautiously, he then drew this sash out, took it in his hand, and went away as fast as he could walk—I stopped him, he seemed confused—I asked what he was going to do with it—he said, at last, "To buy it"—I found 11 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I came to a timber-yard where they sell old ma<lb></lb>terials and marine stores; I stopped, looked down the yard, and saw some sashes lying there, I went down, and looked about, but did not see any one on the premises; I went to the shed, looked at four or five sashes, took out one old-fashioned one from the rest, took it about two yards, and laid it one side, thinking I had not sufficient money to pay for it, but if I and the prosecutor could have bargained, I would have left 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. deposit. The policeman laid hold of me while I was going to the prosecutor's house to know the price.</p>

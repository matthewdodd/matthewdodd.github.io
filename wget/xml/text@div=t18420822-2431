                  </hi>. I live in Manor-place, King's-road, Chelsea. On the morning of the 30th I saw the prisoner at Cheyne-wharf—there is a pier there, made of two barges fastened together—I saw the prisoner go on the barges, stoop down, and pick up the seat of the boat—I was not above four yards from him—he went away for five minutes, then came back and took them with him—there was this piece and two other thin pieces of wood.</p>

Q.</hi> What time was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Six o'clock—there was nobody there—the pier is a couple of barges—they are aground at low tide, and afloat at high-water—they are fastened together with a chain—there are some long planks on the barges, which are nailed to a wooden platform on shore—I do not know the prisoner—I did not speak to him—he went on very coolly about it—he might have seen me.</p>

My father keeps the Ship, in Camden Street, Islington and act as barmaid—about Tuesday, 25th February, I served the prisoner with a pint of beer, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he gave me a shilling—I tried it—it bent—I gave it to the postman, who said that it was bad—I gave it back to the prisoner and told him it was bad—he said that he did not know it, and paid me with coppers—a tall gentleman was with him, they left together—on Friday, the 28th, they came again, and I recognized the prisoner in a moment; he asked for a glass of six ale, and gave me a florin. I tried it, it was bad, and I took it up to my father, who went down with me and spoke to the prisoner, who then ran away—my father ran after him—I had served the other man first, he paid me with good money, and left before the prisoner.</p>

I said "No - but where did you buy it?" he said, "Of a man named Blake, at Barnet;" I said, "Buy it of who you would, it was stolen from Mr. Smith, and it is mine;" I went to a Policeman, and asked if he knew the man, he said No - but did not notice the name on the cart - I said No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not make any mistake about the ass? A. No, never - I did not describe one which did not turn out to be mine - I described it as a small, genteel black ass - and one was produced which had a white face, and mine was a black one - I have never seen mine since - the one produced was not like mine.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long after you lost it did you see it again? A. Not till July.</p>
               <p> - DEATH. I live with Mr. Smith - I knew the ass; it was a black one; it was turned out in the grassfield on Saturday night.</p>

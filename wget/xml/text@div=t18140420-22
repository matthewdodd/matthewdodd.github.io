               <p>Q. Were you in possession of a gelding lately - A. Yes, it was a brown gelding. I worked him on the 9th; at night I put him in the stable. I was feeding it at ten o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the stable - A. In New-street-square, near Tottenham-court-road, in the parish of St. Pancras. When I fed the horse I left it in the stable; I locked the stable door, and took the key away in my pocket. The next morning, about five o'clock, I went to feed the horse again, I found the horse missing. I took all the pains I could to find it. I looked every where I could think of. On the Friday evening following, I saw a man in Smithfield; he told me he had bought a horse. He took me to the place where I found the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of the person - A. Mr. Special; he is a horse boiler, at the Ducking Pond, where I found my horse. I am sure it is my own horse I found there; it runs a great deal at the nose, and it is blood tailed. I have had the horse four months. I gave four pounds ten shillings for the horse; I think it is worth that now. Mr. Special told me if the horse was mine I might take it away. I have it now in my possession.</p>

            , a watchman of Whitechapel parish came with him to my house. I was in bed when they came; it was about seven o'clock when they came. I asked him his business; he said he had a glandered horse to sell; I asked him where he brought it from; he said, from Mr. Lee, of Batking. He said he wanted fifty shillings for it; two guineas I gave him for the horse at the Red Lion public-house, Whitechapel, in the tap-room. I was at Smithfield market on Friday evening. I went with the prosecutor to Mr. Specialls stables. I delivered him the gelding. He owned the horse. My master delivered up the horse to him. That was the same horse I bought of the prisoner.</p>

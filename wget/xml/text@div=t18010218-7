               <p>Court. Q. How do you know that this was sugar in your charge? - A. It was very likely it was, for it corresponds with the sugar, I found the hogsheads knocked out; I was responsible for the sugar; I looked upon it there was nearly a quarter of hundred weight deficient; there was more than this two pounds taken out of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of this two pounds of sugar? - A. I take it to be about one shilling.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MERRYMAN sworn. - I am a constable, I took the prisoner into custody, I have had the sugar from that time to this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming down about nine o'clock in the morning, and there were some hogsheads of sugar knocked down, and I picked it up.</p>

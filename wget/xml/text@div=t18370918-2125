                  </hi>. I am a Spaniard. I am a watchmaker, and carry on business in Wayfield-street I have known the prisoner for a short time as a baker's journeyman, coming to my door with bread—on the 25th of August he came, and said he should like to buy a watch—I showed him one at the price of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he should like to take it to a friend of his, who was in the trade, to see if it was worth that; and if it was, he would come in the evening, and bring me the watch or money—he did not come then, but next day he brought the bread as usual, and said he did not think he should like the watch, and should like to have another—I showed him one which came to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he asked if I would let him have it on the same terms as the other—I said, "Yes, if you will bring the other back you shall have this"—he said I need not suspect him; he would come every day with bread, and he would come in the evening with the money for me, and the first watch he would bring back—he did not come—on the Monday I went to his master, and found he had a week's notice, and was gone—he had promised to come to me after seven o'clock—the watches were found in pawn.</p>

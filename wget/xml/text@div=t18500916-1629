                  </hi>. I am cashier to Mr. William Henry Cole, of High Holborn. The prisoner was his porter—on 1st Oct., about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw twenty sovereigns, and five half-sovereigns in a drawer belonging to me in the counting-house—it was Mr. Cole's money—the prisoner knew that cash was kept there—I used to pay him his wages from that drawer—at half-past five I went to tea, and left the key in the drawer—I afterwards missed the money—the prisoner had been in the house the whole day, but he was not there when I went to tea—he was let in while I was at tea—he had been a porter nearly ten years—he left that evening, and did not return—he had given no notice that he was going away—I did not see him again till he was in custody, about a fortnight ago—he had no right to go out at the lack-door—he always went out at the front, unless he had the truck.</p>

I know the prisoner—on the evening before I heard of this robbery, I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Cole's back-door—I said, "Halloo, are you going off?"—he said, "Yes, for a little while;" and he went off—it was from half-past five to six o'clock—he had no truck with him.</p>

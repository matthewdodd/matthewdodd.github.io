                  </hi>. I keep a glass-shop in Bedford-street. On the 14th of August the prisoner came and asked for a smelling-bottle or scent-bottle—he was a stranger—I showed him a number—he said there was none would suit him; he would go to the lady and ask if she would allow me to make one for her; he would go and be back in a quarter of an hour—he left, and by his running across the road 1 had suspicion—I looked at the tray, and missed this smelling-bottle—on the Monday following my son found him in Charles-street, Middlesex Hospital—I am sure he is the person—the smelling-bottle was found at Mr. Denny's, in Oxford-street.</p>

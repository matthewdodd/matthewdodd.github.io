             produced a copy of the record<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060032"></xptr> of the prisoner's sentence, which the witness said he had examined.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know the person that was indicted by the name of Watson, otherwise Davis, some time ago? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is he in Court? - Yes; he is at the bar.</p>
               <p>Was you concerned in taking him up at that time? - No; but I am positive he is the man. I apprehended him this time near the Pantheon, Cold-Bath-Fields, in consequence of an information sent to Sir John Fielding's office. The prisoner was concealed in a house by the Pantheon; we got into the house, went up two pair of stairs, and found him under a bed.</p>
               <p>When was he transported? - In the year 1769.</p>
               <p>Was you particularly acquainted with him? - Yes, so well, that if I had seen him at large I would have taken him into custody.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing to you when he was apprehended? - He asked what we wanted.</p>
               <p>Did you know of his being at large before you had this information? - No.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You say you had not seen him before this information? - No.</p>
               <p>You did not take him up upon your own knowledge? - I knew him as soon as I saw him.</p>
               <p>Was it in the beginning or latter end of the year 1769 when he was tried? - I believe it was the month of August of September.</p>
               <p>You take a great many men in the space of a year, do you not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you so positive to know one man from another among the crowd of prisoners you apprehend? - I know him as well as I do any person, and for some particular reason. If you want to know the reason I know him so well, I will tell you; I am positive to the man.</p>

            , captain; I believe he is now gone to New York.</p>
               <p>Do you know where the rest of the sailors are? - No; I saw the chief mate about three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect seeing the man at the bar in America? (after looking about for some time, said) - I know him very well, and saw him in America; he came aboard the Grosvenor at New York to see some acquaintance, and drank pretty free: he asked leave to go on shore, but the captain had given orders that no man should go on shore, there being only eleven of us: he asked two or three times to go ashore, but the captain refused; he said no man should go on shore: they consulted together, but I cannot say what passed.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath is it truth that the captain is gone abroad? - Yes; I was only subpoenaed last night, and little thought of coming here.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner tell the captain the reason he wanted to be put on shore? - I did not hear; the captain gave that order the night before.</p>
               <p>Was the order given before he came on board? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the rest tell him of that order before he got on board? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>When did you arrive in England? - We came to England four or five weeks before Christmas the year 1773; we came to Chatham. We sailed from America, September 1773; we were about six months from England. When the ship arrived at Chatham every man was discharged.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>When the ship arrived at Chatham, the owner of the ship hired men to clear her out, and every hand was discharged; she was an old East-Indiaman. I never saw the last witness since that time till Monday afternoon: Mr. Nixon sent him to Newgate to me; my wife had heard of this man.</p>
               <p>[Tamis was again called, and said Mr. Nixon sent him to see the prisoner in Newgate.]</p>
               <p>During the voyage did you know that this man was in America on transportation? - No, I did not: I knew the man very well, he was my mess-mate: the cook was taken ill, and he was ordered to assist in cooking.</p>
               <p>Was the Captain aboard when the prisoner came? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner know before he came on board that such orders were given? - I don't know; it was the night before we sailed.</p>
               <p>Is it usual for the captain to let strangers come on board after giving such orders, as any person my be carried off in that way? - The captain said no man should go on shore: I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060033"></xptr> would not say this if I was not sure: I have nothing for it, I lose my time.</p>

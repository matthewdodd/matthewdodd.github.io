                  </hi>. I live in Cheltenham-street, Bethnal-green—I have some houses in Mount-street, Bethnal-green—I examined the gutters there, and found the lead gone from there—I have compared the lead now produced with that still on the premises, and believe it to be part of that lead.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Mount-street, Bethnal-green—my house adjoins Mr. Brown's empty houses—between seven and eight o'clock, on the 11th of March, I received information from a tenant of mine, and went to one of Mr. Brown's houses—I heard voices, on the roof, and heard the ceiling crack inside—I went to the rear of the house, and some lead fell very near me—I sent for assistance—a young man lodging at my hoose came, and found the prisoner coming out of the back window—the lead was not cut, but removed all in one piece, and put down at the back of the house.</p>

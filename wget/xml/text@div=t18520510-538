                  </hi>. I live at 10, Valentine-place, Blackfriars. On a Sunday morning (I did not put down the day of the month) I was in Trafalgar-square with Elizabeth Hayes—we met a man, who I afterwards saw dead at the Hospital—he was half tipsy and half sober—it was, as near as I could judge, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning—we all three went to the Hop-gardens, to a room on the first floor—the servant refused to let us have the room, and we left that house together, and went to a house at the corner of Banbury-court, and at the corner of a street also, kept, I believe, by the prisoner—we went up to the first floor, the landlady asked for a couple of shillings—the man said he had not got the money to pay it—she said it would be one shilling if he had one girl, but two shillings if he had the two—the pri<lb></lb>soner was not there then—the man went and lay down on the sofa, and said he was sleepy—two or three women, servants I believe they were, and the land<lb></lb>lady, came up, and said he should not sleep there unless he paid, and they were pulling him out—I said, "Don't do that, I can get him out quietly"—the landlady called him Irish—he said he would strike anybody that aggra<lb></lb>vated him, or called him Irish, or dragged him out of the room—I said it was of no use aggravating a drunken man, quietness would be the best; with that I took hold of his arm, and got him nearly to the top of the stairs—I then saw the prisoner—I do not know where he came from—he said what did he come into his house for without any money—I do not remember that there was any answer—then the prisoner gave him a push with his hands in the middle of his back, not very hard, but sufficient enough to push him down stairs—he did not go down stairs very quick, he went step by step; he fell on his face—there were fourteen or fifteen steps; the first two or three at the top were not straight, they were larger stairs, and went three-cornered <hi rend="italic">wise</hi>; the others went straight—I saw him fall on his face; he went from the top to the bottom, sliding, headforemost, so slowly that every step must have touched him, and with his face downwards; it was more like a slide down—he did not fall head over heels—when he got to the bottom his head was on the mat, and his legs up the stairs—when he was at the bottom Belasco struck him three or four times on the neck, and the top part of the head, with his fist, nothing else—one blow was on the neck, and the rest were about the head—I said it was shameful treatment—he said, "You are a woman of the world, and ought to know better; and if anything occurs from this you must say he fell down stairs"—I said, "No, I shall not"—he turned the man over, and looked in his face, and his wife went into the parlour, brought out the gin bottle, and gave us a glass of gin each—he had then got hold of the man at the foot of the stairs; he was dragged out by the collar of his coat by two or three, the wife was one; but I could not take particular notice which of the servants did it—he was dragged all the way along, not lifted; and was laid all along in the court, flat on the ground, on his back—some one said,</p>

               <p>"Don't leave him so, as he has had a little drink, put him sitting up against the wall"—a policeman afterwards knocked at the door, and said, "There is a man lying dead outside your door, you must answer for this, for I saw him come in not long ago with two females"—Belasco said, "There has no man been in my house to-night of the sort; how do you know who has been in my house? I am the master of my house, and I think I ought to know best who has been in and out of it; he has not been in here to-night"—I went away, and the very first policeman I met I mentioned it to.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had you been in this house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not quite a week; it is a brothel—before that, I lived in Holborn, at a brothel—before that I was at home with my sister, in the Wal-worth-road; she keeps a shoemaker's shop—I was not on the town—on this night there was a lady and gentleman in the parlour with my master—I do not know who they were, or whether they are here—I saw them there after it was all over—the persons belonging to the house who went up into the room, were Mrs. Belasco, me, and the other girl who struck him on the nose—I do not know her name, she did not live in the house, she had been with some other man—I have seen her there before—I do not know whether she is here, or whether she is one of the witnesses—there was no one in the room besides those persons, and the man and the girls who were with him—there were only six on the landing—Collins, the servant, was in bed, and the chil<lb></lb>dren—the third girl struck the man on the nose, and two or three times about the head, and Tillett and' Hayes pushed him down stairs; that was to get him away from hitting Mrs. Belasco, who was making her way into the front room—I am quite sure I saw them push him—when he got to the bottom he was not able to stand—I did not see Mrs. Belasco bring any gin and give to the two girls; if there had been gin given, of course I must have seen it—there was not a drop of gin, I know very well—when the two girls pulled the man out, they never came in again—I never saw them again till I was at Bow-street—I heard the police come—I did not hear anybody say, "Don't answer him"—I heard the policeman say to Mr. Belasco, "There is a man outside, and he has been in your house"—I was going up stairs with the c company, some men and women, who were going to sleep there—I did not hear Belasco say he had not seen the man, or that there had been no man</p>

               <p>there—he was in the parlour when the policeman knocked, the policeman was outside the door, and must have spoken loud to make him hear—Belasco went out of his parlour to him, to ask what he had got to say—it was a dark, stout policeman, that is him (<hi rend="italic">Dodd</hi>)—I did not hear any person come or call out before that—after the man was put outside, I went up to sheet two beds for the company who were going to stop there all night—the servant was left down stairs in bed with the children—Mrs. Belasco always asks for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when there are two girls—I did not interfere in the struggle up stairs—I kept out of the way on the landing, there was quite enough without me—I did not call out for assistance to protect the drunken man when the girl struck him—Belasco was down stairs—I only assisted in dragging the man out; we could not lift him he was so heavy—this is a regular brothel.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mean fresh company were going up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; a great many were waiting for the rooms to be vacated—when we had put the man up against the wall, I went direct up stairs; therefore what took place in the parlour I could not tell—the two girls pushed the man, to get him out of the room; I do not say their object was to throw him down stairs—(<hi rend="italic">Mrs. Levison and Frederick Turner were brought into Court</hi>)—that is the female who was in the parlour—I do not know the man; he was inside.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is the person who you call the lady? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there are three rooms on the first floor, front, middle and back—when you get up on the landing you turn to the right to go into the front room, and to the left to go to the back; the middle room has the door fronting the stairs; this room was the back—there is a very awkward staircase there—you turn about half a yard to the left before you get in at the door—it is a little landing-place which you pass over—you turn to your left to do that, and go in at the door—there was no other man in the house besides Belasco and the gentle<lb></lb>man in the parlour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married; my husband is a commercial traveller. I have known Mr. Belasco some time, and previous to his keeping a house of this description—I called to ask his wife a particular question on this night—it was about 11 o'clock, as near as I can recollect—I remained, as near as I can remember, two hours—I have a child, eleven years old, who is very ill, and I went to get an address at Gravesend from Mrs. Belasco—previous to Mr. Belasco coming home, there was no noise, excepting that there were people coming in and out—he came home about 12, with the man who came into Court with me just now (Turner); they came into the room where I was—afterwards, it might have been after 1, the parlour door opened, a person came and called Mrs. Belasco out, and said she was wanted up stairs—shortly after she went out I heard a noise; there seemed to be a contest up stairs—Mr. Belasco was in the room, and the other man—I heard Mrs. Belasco go up stairs, and heard her say distinctly, "Don't, don't!" and shortly afterwards there was a rumbling noise, as if some person had fallen—while that noise was taking place, Mr. Belasco was sitting in the parlour smoking his pipe, or he had been smoking, for there was his pipe on the table—he jumped off his chair, and went to the parlour door; I went with him and saw a man lying doubled up, all of a lump, with his head down, as well as I can remember, and his heels, I think, were towards the top of the stairs, as if he had fallen head forwards down the stairs; at that moment several females rushed down stairs, and I heard Mr. Belasco say, "What is the meaning of all this? I will have none of this nonsense in my house;" or something of that sort—he took the man by the arm, made use of a vulgar expression, such as "Old fellow, what is this?"and one of the females made</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185205100075"></xptr>
               <p>use of a vulgar cant phrase, meaning that it was all right—he said, "It is not all right; I am surprised at you, as a woman of the world, bringing a drunken man; you might get the house indicted; if you don't all go out, I will send for a policeman, and have you all put out"—he was not with the man as long as I have been speaking; he, merely for one moment, put his hand on his shoulder; and when the woman used that expression I said, "Mr. Belasco, you had better come in, and let the women settle it;" and then he shook him for a minute, and came into the parlour—he did not strike him in my presence; if he had struck him at the bottom of the stairs I must have seen it—he did not kick or strike him in my presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he shake him violently? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he did not; he put his hand slightly on the man's shoulder, and was in the act, as I suppose, of raising him, when I said, "You had better not interfere, let the women settle it among themselves"—he did not raise him, but imme<lb></lb>diately followed my advice—I did not see the man fall down stairs—I imagined Mrs. Belasco had fallen down stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then when you found it was only a man who had fallen down stairs, you thought it was a woman's affair? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought it was a drunken, disgraceful affair; and thought the women had better settle it—I staid till nearly 2 o'clock—I did not hear the policeman, or any voice at the door—I heard no voice saying, "Don't answer him"—I made no inquiry as to what had become of the man; it was not my business—I saw two women take him, one by each shoulder, and lift him towards the entry—I never saw Mr. Turner before; I think he left a little before I did—it was last Saturday week—I do not know which of us went away first—I went out of the room to go into Hart-street—we did not go out together; I do not know whether he left before me—I went there first; he came about half an hour after me, with Mr. Belasco—it was Mrs. Belasco that I went to ask the question of, and I asked her; that did not take me long—it was merely where she had been residing at Gravesend last summer, and she said that when her husband came home he would give me the direction—it was Everett, the town crier, of Gravesend; that was very soon given; but he had removed from there; and she said Mr. Belasco would give me the right direction—he came home at 12, and I asked him, and he answered me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you, the wife of a commercial traveller, do, after you had got the answer, waiting at a brothel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have known Mrs. Belasco many years—I will show you that I went for that purpose, and no other—here is a certificate that my child was an invalid, and that is what I went for—Mrs. Belasco was an acquaintance of mine previous to her marriage—she admits her private friends—I had nothing to do with her business or occupation, and I was sitting talking to her till 2 o'clock in the morning—I had nothing to drink except a cup of coffee—there was no gin there in my presence, or gin bottle—Mr. Belasco was drinking porter—Turner was there all the time after Belasco came in; nobody else came in but Mrs. Belasco—I live at 10, Russell-place, not three minutes' walk from Mr. Belasco's—it is a small detached cottage—there is one bedroom for myself and husband, and one for the children—my husband travels for Mr. White, of Houndsditch—he is out about his business—he was at home at this time—I told him what I was going to Mrs. Belasco's for; I did that in the night, as I had my business to attend to in the day—I did not know I was going to stay, but Mrs. Belasco asked me—she did not ask me to take care of the children—she asked me if I would take an infant about two years old, which could not stand, off her lap—I had no intention of staying so long, and if I did, I did nothing, that I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185205100076"></xptr>
               <p>was ashamed of—I do not know whether Turner or I left first—I went home by the Hart-street entrance, not the entrance that persons are admitted by—I did not bid Turner, "Good night;" he is no acquaintance of mine—I had h ad no conversation with him while I was sitting in the room with him—we never passed a word; there was no occasion—I knew the sort of house it was perfectly well, and I do not deny it—I had the coffee a short time after I came in, before Belasco came in—it was only the remainder of half a cup that was in the teacup—I heard of Mr. Belasco being taken before the Magi<lb></lb>strate—I did not go, because I had no occasion—I did not know whether he was charged with murdering the man who had fallen down there—I did not know whether it might be another person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After this transaction, how long did you stay in the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I might have left about ten minutes after; no policeman came, while I was there, to my knowledge.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If any policeman came, and Mr. Belasco went to the door to him, you must have known it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; because he never left the parlour—Mrs. Belasco was not taking coffee when I went in—there was only about half a cup of coffee on the table—the coffee things were not on the table; it was only a few spoons full of coffee in a cup which had been standing for some time—it was quite cold—there was no coffee pot or teathings—that was all the refreshment I got while I was there—when Belasco and Turner came in, they had a little porter which was on the table—I think they poured it out from the jug—I do not remember it being there when I went in—I think it was brought in after they came in; I cannot remember their sending for it—there were not pipes and tobacco on the table when I went in—I do not know who brought them in, I did not take notice—they had nothing to eat, to my knowledge, before they began to smoke—I did not take any notice—I heard Mr. Belasco say, "My wife will be in directly; and as it is past 12 o'clock, you may as well sit down and enjoy yourself with your pipe"—Mrs. Belas<lb></lb>co was not in the room when they came in; I was sitting by myself, with the baby in my arms—Belasco did not introduce Turner to me—he appeared to be a decent mechanic—Belasco said to him, "You are in no hurry; Mrs. Belasco will be here in a few minutes, and she will give you a trifle"—it appeared to me that he had been decorating some house, and that they owed him a trifle—there was no porter on the table then—there were some jugs in the room, but I do not know whether they got the porter out of them—there was a fire in the room—I sat down by the fire when I went in—it faces you as you go in—Mrs. Belasco asked me to hold the child, as it was very cross, and I got up and walked the room with it—I was doing so when Belasco and Turner came in; I am quite sure of that—I may have changed my chair—I did not sit on them all—I did not see them when first they came in, as my back was to the door—I was standing still by the fireplace with the baby in my arms, I heard the door open, turned round, and saw them come in—I moved away from the fireplace, and took a seat near the door—I sat there till Mr. Belasco came in, and she said her husband would write out the direc<lb></lb>tion, and while she was speaking to me she was again called from the room, and I distinctly heard the contention on the landing—I was sitting down then with the child, nearer the door than the fireplace—I went and sat near the door when they came in, as I did not want to hear their conversation—I after<lb></lb>wards moved back nearer to the fireplace with the child—that was also between the fireplace and the door—my chair was on the right hand side of the fire<lb></lb>place as you come into the room, and then I changed my place to sit on the left as you enter.</p>

                  </hi>. On Saturday night, to-morrow fortnight, I came home with the prisoner—it must have been very nearly 12 o'clock—a female was in the parlour—that is her (<hi rend="italic">Mrs. Levison</hi>)—when I had been in the house something like three quarters of an hour or an hour, I heard a little <hi rend="italic">bustle</hi> up stairs, and said to Mr. Belasco, "What is the matter here?"—he said, "Oh, women bring in drunken men"—he did not move from his seat, neither did I or any one else—perhaps a minute or two elapsed, and then I beard a little <hi rend="italic">rumbling</hi> sort of noise, like a <hi rend="italic">scuffle</hi>, up stairs, and the female went out first, as far as I could judge, and then Belasco—I did not get off my seat at all—there were three or four females there—I got off my seat and went to the door, but no further—I saw no man, only two or three females and the female who went out of the room—I said to Belasco, "What do you stop out there for? let the women settle it themselves, and come in"—when I heard the <hi rend="italic">rumbling</hi> Belasco was in the parlour with me—he was not out of the room two seconds, and the woman who went out said, "Let the women settle it themselves, and come in"—he came in, took his pipe from the table (he and I were smoking together), and sat down again with me, not beside me, but a little opposite me, by the side of the fire-place—I never knew him to be a prize fighter, or anything but a kind, comfortable man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you been drinking anything to-day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Have I? yes, I have; three glasses of ale, nothing else; I paid for it myself f—when Belasco lived in Brydges-street he kept a coffee house—I did the painting and decorating there; it is above four years ago, for which he owed me 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I received 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and the rest has been running on till now—Belasco pleaded poverty at all times, and what could I do? he said, "When I can pay you I will"—when a man has a disposition to pay, why should I put him to any unnecessary trouble?—I had been laid up with the colic, and wanted money, and not knowing where Belasco resided I called at his father's, and went with Belasco to his house; I did not know it was a brothel; I had never been there before—I did not get a farthing—I had some porter—the woman (<hi rend="italic">Mrs. Levison</hi>) was there when I went in—she left the room a portion of the time I was there, but was not gone five minutes altogether—I should say she did not go up stairs with a gentleman; if she did, she was very quick about it—she left the room twice, but did not go out of my sight the second time—I went away first—I did not bid her "Good night;" why should I? I had never seen her before—it must have been very near or quite 12 before I left the prisoner's father's house—I cannot say what time it was when I left the prisoner's house—I might have been there an hour, under or over, but I will not undertake to swear anything—I am speaking facts—I have sworn once, but not all this time—I went to the parlour door when I heard the noise, and saw a man there—it was Belasco—he was not doing anything—he was standing a little outside the parlour door—he had not got hold of any one—I could see into the passage where I stood, and saw two or three women, or there might have been four, at the foot of the staircase—Belasco was close by me; I beg pardon, I am wrong; the woman who was in the parlour when I went in was nearer Belasco than I was—I saw no man there but Belasco—I could see the staircase—if there was a man there, I must have seen him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You told me just now you could see very plainly the bottom stairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said five, six, seven, or eight stairs up, but not reckoning from the bottom stair.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Yes; I asked you the question? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Then I could not do so under those circumstances—the women had their backs to me, they were bustling and huddling about—I did not feel at all interested, or at all in any way see that I ought to have anything to say in it, and I came back into the room, and I only know Belasco was with me at the time; he went out and the female who was there called to him to come back into the room—it is very possible that a man might be lying on the mat and I not see him.</p>

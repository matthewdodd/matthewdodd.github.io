On 25th November last I was in Jerusalem-court; the prisoner came up and said to me, "I say, little girl, if you will go and get me a pint of six ale, I will give you a penny"—she gave me a half-crown and a jug, and told me to go to Mr. Wright's oppo<lb></lb>site—that is the Earl of Warwick public-house—I went there and asked for the beer and put down the half-crown—Mr. Wright gave me the ale and I gave him the half-crown—he did not give me the change, but said it was a bad half-crown, and told me to go out at one door and to go to her, and he would go out at the other—I told him that I had been sent by the prisoner—I took the ale to her—she was standing at the top of the court opposite the public-house—I took the ale across to her—Mr. Wright came out, and directly she saw him come out in his shirt sleeves she began to run away—she had not taken the ale.</p>

On 21st November the last witness came into my house for a pint of ale, which was threepence, and tendered a bad half-crown—I asked her where she got it—she said she got it from a woman—I gave her the ale—I said, "Where is the woman?"—she said, "She is outside waiting"—I told her to go out at one door, and I went out at the other; she went to the prisoner, and was in the act of giving her the ale, when the prisoner saw me, and ran away—I ran after her and took her in charge—I asked her how she came to send the child in with the bad half-crown—she said she had never seen the child before—I gave her in charge to the first policeman that came up—I gave the half-crown to the policeman.</p>

On 19th Nov. my little girl kept a stall in the Commercial Road—about half past 6 o'clock that evening, she told me something, and I watched the prisoner; I saw him go to Sophia Thomas, and buy a halfpenny worth of apples; I saw him pass a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece to her—he then went to Lawless; I did not see him pass anything there, but as soon as he went to that stall I took him, and handed him over to a policeman—I told the prisoner he had been uttering bad money—he said, "That <hi rend="italic">be one</hi> d—lie."</p>

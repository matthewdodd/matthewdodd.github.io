I lost several models and moulds too, but the stock is numerous, and I cannot tell when I missed them - I got a search-warrant, and went to the prisoner's; I knew where he lived, but I do not know the name of the place - I found these thirteen casts from models, which I knew to be our's; we did not find any models of legs and arms there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I believe the prisoner is a very skilful workman? A. Yes - my mother had recently before this received an order from Lord Onslow to execute some figures, to the amount of 110l.; the prisoner had left my mother before that order was executed - the order was given at my house, and in my name; his Lordship did not direct that the prisoner should execute his order - it was not to be executed till the spring; I had a quarrel with my mother some time ago - I went away, but not far off; I did not go to live with the prisoner - I swear that; I have a house of my own in Elms-lane, Bayswater, where I reside - I am not married; I went before the Magistrate when the prisoner was committed - I did not then give charge of him for stealing some legs; I found the cast of a leg in Brujiarty's window, in Russel-street, and stated that to my mother - it was not from me that he received that model; he borrowed some models of me - I did not state to the Magistrate that I was the person who took the cast from the lady's leg, nor did I deny it; the question was not put to me - I did not state to the Magistrate that I and my uncle together took that cast; I did not deliver the leg to Mr. Brujiarty, or, if I did, it was unknown to me; I was not at Madame Vestris' when the model was taken - I have been to May-fair, but not to that lady's house; I sent the prisoner and his father - I was not turned out of the room on account of my youth; the gentleman who came to our shop said, "Don't let that man come, he is too young, send two elderly men;" I do not know that we had been directed not to part with that leg - I cannot swear that I did not lend the model of it to Brujiarty; he borrowed some moulds of legs of me - if this one was lent, it was with other moulds, and I did not know it; my mother took out the warrant for some other property - she reduced the prisoner's wages on account of had behaviour; Lord Onslow gave his order to the prisoner to bring to my house - I cannot tell how often in last year I had been at the prisoner's house; I might have gone several times to fetch him to work - I saw some casts there, but I never saw any of those now in Court; these casts are all mutilated - the prisoner has three or four children, who are in the habit of coming backwards and forwards for money; it is the custom in our business to throw aside mutilated casts in the shop - these are the casts; this one, in its present state, is worth nothing, but we can put a head to it, and then it would be worth 2s. 6d. - my man's time in making it would be worth 6d.; we did not know of these at the time the prisoner got Lord Onslow's order; we have so many about that I cannot tell when I had seen these - I never saw any of these models at the prisoner's house before we took them; I never slept in his house - I had a quarrel with my mother about several affairs, but not about money.</p>
               <p>Q. Now your mother is here, upon your oath was it not about money? A. No, I never was charged with taking any money - I charged the prisoner with stealing casts, not models.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you not been on the prisoner's pre<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170111"></xptr>mises, and seen them there before? A. No, never, my Lord - this charge did not originate in a suspicion that he would get Lord Onslow's order.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the prisoner's, and found these casts among immense quantity of other things - they were on the mantel-piece in the cupboard, and different parts, not secreted in any manner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they not broken? A. No, I believe I have broken this - they were whole when before the Magistrate.</p>

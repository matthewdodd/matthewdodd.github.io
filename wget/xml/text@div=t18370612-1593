On 12th May, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, three artillerymen came into the shop—the prisoner was one of them, and Smith, a soldier, was there—he said nothing, but one of the other two said, "I have brought a soldier who is discharged, and he has got his discharge—he said, "I want a suit of plain clothes for him"—I took up a suit, and said, "This comes to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said he wanted one about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said he wished to try them on, which he did, and the two soldiers said they would fit him—Smith then said, "I cannot stop here, I shall go into the country to my father and mother"—I said, "If you like the clothes, pay for them; if not, take them off"—he said, "I have not got enough to pay my passage—will you take the regimental clothes in exchange?"—I refused to do so, and he said, "I see you are afraid to take them"—I said "Am I? if you like to go with me to the barracks, and the officer will give me leave, I will take them"—he said he would go with me there—I went with him, and he shook hands with several soldiers by the cage—he went into a public-house with me, and had something to drink—I said, "Now, it is time to go"—in about a quarter of an hour, he said, "No, I shall not go yet—I shall stop here and have a <hi rend="italic">whole</hi>"—I said at last, "I will make you go, if you</p>

The prisoner was a gunner in that regiment on the 12th of May—I knew Waller Smith, a gunner—he had not obtained his discharge that day—he was absent from parade that day, and the prisoner also, with another man—Smith has deserted—he has not obtained his discharge—the prisoner returned to his barracks at a quarter past seven o'clock that night, and was confined in the barracks; and Mordecai's father came, and brought Smith's regimentals with him—the prisoner was shown to the witness with five others next morning, and he pointed him out as the man who held him against the wall.</p>

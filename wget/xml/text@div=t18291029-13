On Monday evening, the 5th of October, the prisoner was in the shop; I received information, and went round the counter, to see if I could observe any thing between her muff, and a picture frame, which she had, but she kept it so, that I could not see - while I was speaking to her, she had occasion to use her handkerchief, and instead of putting it up to her face, she put her face down to it; I then went and waited till she came out of the door - I asked her to allow me to satisfy myself, as my young man had said something; she lifted up the frame, and the muslin trimming was there - she said she did not know it was there.</p>

The prisoner came in; I shewed her some muslin trimming - she placed her muff, and a paper parcel on the counter, before her, and after shewing her two or three pieces of trimming, I observed her put something under the parcel- she wanted two yards of trimming; we do not cut less than three - I informed Mr. Hall; she left without buying any thing - she was brought back, and fifteen yards of trimming, worth 8s., taken from between her muff and the frame; two yards would come to 1s. 1d.</p>

                  </hi> I am a shoemaker, of 100, Tottenham-court-road, the prisoner was in my service. On 27th Jan., about half-past five o'clock, I found a boot in my nursery—I went into the kitchen, and asked the prisoner whose it was; she said hers—I asked where the fellow was; she said on her foot—I asked her to take it off—she at first refused, and afterwards took it off—she said she had them made for her in the country—I said" Here are my initials on them"—she said, "that is the maker's name, John Berridge"—I sent for a policeman, and went with him and her to her room—the policeman asked her whose box that was; she said hers, and gave him the key—he found two pairs of boots, one pair had been worn a few times—they were both mine—they had my mark in three places, and have never been sold—I had missed them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am bar-man to my uncle, Henry Cross, who keeps the Three Keys public-house, in Orange-street, in the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury—it is his dwelling-house. On the 2nd of July, I went to bed about twelve o'clock—I was the last person up—I shut the outer door, fastened the windows, and every thing—I went into the first floor front room and shut down the window which was open—it was next the water spout—about two o'clock in the morning, I was called up by the police, and found Bacon, the policeman, in the front room—I got a light, and we found the prisoner lying flat on the floor by the table, pretending to be asleep—he said nothing—the window was then open.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the night of the 2nd of July, about two o'clock, I saw the prisoner climb up the water-spout of the prosecutor's house, and get in at the window—I immediately alarmed the inhabitants of the house, placed another constable at the door, and got up the spout, the same as the prisoner had done—we got a light, and found him pretending to be asleep—I found six lucifer matches lying by him.</p>

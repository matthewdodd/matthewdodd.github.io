               <p>I was sent for: I saw the bureau had been forced: I found a large spike-nail in the room; I tried, and it fitted the mark where it had been wrenched open. They did not attempt to go away, nor make any resistance. I found an handkerchief and neckcloth in the window.</p>
               <p>CORN's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I promiscuously went into the Two Brewers, in Shoe-lane. I went to meet a young man at four o'clock, as I had appointed, to buy two canary birds. I met this young woman at the door: we recollected one another: we sat about half an hour: then this young man came and said he was sorry he kept us so long, but one of the birds was dead. We had a bowl replenished. Just after, she came in, and said we had broke her master's desk open. I know nothing of it; nor did any there, I am persuaded.</p>
               <p>WOOD's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had not been five minutes in the room before the girl came in, and charged us with breaking a desk open.</p>

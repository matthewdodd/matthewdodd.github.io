I keep the Red Lion public-house, in Horton-street, Clare-market—on the evening of 22d July, between 7 and 8 o'clock, the prisoner Gibbons came into my house, and asked for a half-quartern of rum, she gave me a shilling in payment, and I gave her 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I put the shilling in the till—there was other money there—she drank the rum, and went away—in about a quarter of an hour afterwards she came in with three other women—Miles was one of them—Gibbons asked for a quartern of rum, and tendered a shilling in payment—I gave her 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they drank that between them—I put that shilling in the till—there was then in the till nothing but sixpences and the other shilling—a pot of beer was then called for by Miles, which was 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a shilling, and I gave her 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I also put that shilling in the till—the other two women were there then—Miles afterwards called for a quartern of rum, and tendered a shilling in payment—I looked at it; it was a bad one—I had suspicion of it, and put it on one side under<lb></lb>neath the counter, on a ledge which comes out, by itself—the quart of beer was not drunk—Miles said she wanted half-a-pint—she took an oath she</p>

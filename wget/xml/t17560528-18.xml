            . I live almost facing Mrs. Alcock. I was standing at my door between seven and eight o'clock to the best of my knowledge, on the 20th of March. I saw a parcel of boys run across the way, and heard some glass break. I saw Mrs. Alcock's young man open her door, and then a man darted over the way to me; he had something white in his hand; as he ran, it drew after him, and he drop'd it in the channel. After he had got about half a dozen yards from me, he turn'd about, and walked gently by me; and when he had past me about half a score yards, there was a cry of stop thief. I said that was the man, and pointed to him, upon which they took him.</p>

I ran forwards, and saw a man take out some printed linen through the square that was broke; the handkerchiefs, that lay on the piece, drop'd in the pathway; the man ran cross the street, and I after him: and when I had got almost to him, near the channel, he drop'd the printed linen; I took it up and brought it back, and then ran back again and call'd out stop thief.

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Old Bell public-house, in Friday-street—on Friday evening, the 20th of Dec., I recollect the prisoner coming to my house—I was up stairs attending to my customers at the time I heard a noise take place—it was a little after seven o'clock—I came down stairs, and saw the prisoner and another man wrestling together—I went between them to stop the disturbance—my waiter afterwards came and interfered—he told mo to get inside the bar, and he would see after that—the prisoner imme<lb></lb>diately struck the waiter, knocked him down, and jumped on him—he was pulled off, I believe, by the hair of his head, by the waiter's wife, who hap<lb></lb>pened to be there that night—he immediately ran into the tap-room and swung the poker round the room—there were three or four persons sitting quietly in the room—whether it was done intentionally or not I do not know, but he struck the poker against the window, and struck a person, and knocked him down—the persons in the tap-room all ran out, and "Murder" was called—I afterwards called in the assistance of the police—they would not come in at first, and I went to Bow-lane station for further assistance—there was a reinforcement obtained, and when I came back, the prisoner was in the second floor of my house, in a private room—the door was opened, and he had got another poker, or the fire-irons in some shape or other, in his hands, flourish<lb></lb>ing about, and threatening any one that dared to touch him—he struck a po<lb></lb>liceman—he broke some of the furniture—three mahogany chairs were broken, I suppose by him—he put some chairs against the door.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 567.) I was sent for to the Old Bell, on the 20th of Dec, and got there about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes past seven o'clock—when I got up stairs I saw the prisoner through the broken panel, inside the room—the panel was broken when I came—I reasoned with him, and persuaded him to give himself up—he re<lb></lb>fused to do so, and said that he would knock the first b—policeman's head off that dared to enter the room, if he was hung tomorrow morning—I waited there some minutes, and Monaghan came up stairs—he and I forced the door open, after asking him whether he would give himself up and be refusing as before—Monaghan received a severe blow on the eye with the handle of the fire-shovel—I was close behind him, and I received a blow on my hat which burnt my hat, which I produce—I immediately struck the prisoner on the top of the head with my truncheon—there was a rush behind directly, and the prisoner and Monaghan fell—I fell on the prisoner, and took the part of the fire-shovel handle out of his hand, and threw it on one side—the prisoner was then taken into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the prisoner fall from the blow on the head which you gave him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think it most likely he did—I struck him as hard as I was able, on the bare head—several constables were present—I can<lb></lb>not say whether they saw me or not—Monaghan was in front of me, close in on the prisoner, with his arms round him—Leonard might have seen roe—I cannot say—they were all close by—I should say the prisoner was too strong to be overpowered by one man—I should think he was overpowered by the blow I gave him on the head—I did not hear him say he would submit.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a packing-case maker, and live in Little Trinity-lane. I was in the Old Bell public-house on the evening of the 26th of Dec.—I heard a disturbance—the police were sent for—I went up with them—I saw Monaghan struck by the prisoner with the handle of the shovel—I assisted in picking him up, and I received a severe blow in the right eye from the prisoner when he was down, with his toot—Monaghan fell on his side—the prisoner fell at the same time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Bow-lane. Monaghan was brought to me on the evening of the 26th of Dec.—he had received a contused wound on the upper part of the head—it was a severe blow—it was through to the bone—he had also received a blow on the left eye, a little scratch—his eye was swollen and the skin scratched—I dressed his wounds, and de<lb></lb>sired him to be taken home and kept quiet for the night—I knew he would be placed under Mr. Child next morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What did you do for him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I dressed his head with strapping—I drew the edges of the skin together—there was, perhaps, a quarter of an inch between the skin and the bone—it was a dangerous wound—the skull was not fractured—there was danger if inflammation had ensued, then suppuration would have followed, he might have felt fever, and erysi<lb></lb>pelas might have ensued, and then death might have followed—all those cir<lb></lb>cumstances must have occurred before there would have been danger—there is a chance of such things under the best of treatment—not exactly a remote chance—from a severe blow of that description it was very likely to occur—I did not look at the prisoner's head—I never saw him till he was at the Man<lb></lb>sion-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the City police force, and live in Fore-street, Cripplegate, I have attended Monaghan since the 27th—I then found him labouring under the effect of some injuries he had sustained the night before—he had an incised wound on the upper part of the left side of the head—also a severe contusion of the eye, and the left fore-arm was very much bruised—the wound on the head was about half an inch in extent—it is impossible to say what such a wound might read to—it was not a severe wound under ordinary circumstances—vary inconsiderable wounds may, under some circumstances, produce very serious effects—the man being in a good state of health, in all probability the wound would have healed kindly—he bat been labouring under symptoms of slight concussion of the brain since—he is on the sick list at present—the functions of the brain are impaired, and he suffers from occasional loss of vision.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you mean that he received a shaking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—a man night receive a concussion of the brain from a fall—I do not believe that if the man had been struck on the back of the head as hard as he could with this instrument it must necessarily have fractured his skull; not in the position he was struck—police hats are generally very thick.</p>

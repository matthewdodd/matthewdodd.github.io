               <p>Q. What did he go with you for? - A. To shew me the way; we came back again at four o'clock in the evening, and then we took a walk to St. Paul's church; then we came back again to the Queen's Head, and then went to his mother's, on College-hill, and slept there all night; the next morning one of my ship-mates that came from American called for me to go to see the boatswain of the ship that we came up in; we went to <placeName id="t18010701-51-crimeloc277">the Gun, at Wapping</placeName>

             sworn. - I keep the Gun public-house, Wapping; on Tuesday, the 9th of June, the prisoner and the last witness came to my house together; Sutton gave me a one pound note to get change, and I gave it to a woman who was a customer to get it changed for me, because I had not enough in the house; Drury sat next the window and Sutton next to him, and nobody else at that box, except the woman at the end of the box.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that woman so near as to take any thing out of Sutton's pocket? - A. No, it was impossible; I returned the change, and in a short time he missed his pocket-book; I immediately insisted that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010056"></xptr>no person should go out till they were searched; I asked Drury if he was certain Sutton had brought the pocket-book into the house; he said he was sure he had, and he was sure he was robbed in my house; he was sure the woman who had gone out for the change had stole it out of his pocket; I immediately insisted upon her going into a private room with my servants, as there were men in the tap-room, but she would not, but stripped to her shift in the tap-room; I searched her, and all she had was three farthings; I then went to Sutton; I thought he might have put it somewhere and forgot it; I felt all about him, but could find nothing; I had asked the prisoner if he had got any thing belonging to Sutton; he said yes, he had got Robinson Crusoe, a song-book, and his protection-box; I asked him if that was all he had belonging to Sutton; he told me yes; I put my hand into his left hand pocket and found nothing but a knife, I put my hand into his right hand pocket and found a pocket-book containing what Sutton had described, three guineas and a one pound note; I then asked him why he suffered the woman to strip to her shirt when he had got the pocket-book; he said Sutton owed his mother a great deal of money, and he had procured the pocket-book to pay his mother; I sent to the Thames Police-office, and kept the prisoner till the officer came, and I gave charge of the prisoner and the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>- WARNER sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the Thames Police-office: On the 9th of June, I took charge of the prisoner from Mrs. Breese; she gave me a pocket-book containing three guineas and a one pound note. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Sutton. This is my pocket-book, it has my name in it and the money that I lost.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you owe this man's mother any money? - A. I owed her, I believe, three shillings, for washing some clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you had never seen him till the day before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know his mother before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you owe her any thing for lodging? - A. No; I lodged with a young fellow that paid her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was in this young man's company at the Queen's Head, on College-hill; he came in and asked me if I could get him a lodging; I told him I could; I walked about with him all day of the Monday; on Tuesday morning he asked me to boil some milk for him and his shipmates, and then we went to Wapping; we had been both of us drinking, and he gave me the things to take care of while he went out with a bad woman, and while he was gone I laid down upon the table to sleep.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character. GUILTY</p>

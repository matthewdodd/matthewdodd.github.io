             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How old are you? - A. I am fourteen next Twelfth day.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round, and tell me whether you know the person of the prisoner? - A. That is he that is at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him the latter end of last month? - A. It was last Thursday week I saw him facing No. 77, Lombard-street, about four o'clock in the afternoon; he asked me whether I would go into No. 77, and receive that; there was a bit of paper given into my hand by the prisoner; I went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner when you went in? - A. He stood in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. You went in there and saw a clerk? - A. Yes, I gave the paper to the clerk, he is here in Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Hawkins was the person that you saw? - A. Yes, and I gave the piece of paper to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with that paper? - A. He asked me where I got it from; the gentleman looked in the book then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go back to the prisoner then? - A. Yes, by myself, in the street to the prisoner; I left the paper there; the prisoner was gone a little further; I stood there, and he came to me; I told him that the gentleman said he must step in himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing to you before you said any thing to him? - A. He walked away very quick; then two gentlemen came out and took him, and brought him back.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner gone out of your sight before they took him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he returned back again, are you sure that he was the person that gave you the paper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that the paper you received from the prisoner, you gave to Mr. Hawkins? - A. Yes, I had no other.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round, Mr. Hawkins is nearer to you, tell me whether that is the person you gave the paper to? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. When the paper was given to you, were you not desired to go and see if it was a good check? - A. No, I am sure it was not; he asked me if I would go in and receive that.</p>

               <p>- HAWKINS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Q. You are clerk to Messrs. Vere and Co. No. 77, Lombard-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember receiving from the last witness a draft on the 29th of November? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the draft, did it appear to be a good one? - A. It appeared to be a forged one.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050036"></xptr>Q. You went and took the prisoner? - A. I did, and I went afterwards to the Mansion-house; I have it about me now, it was payable to Mr. Getham, or bearer, 20 l. 10 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person whose name is there? - A. Yes, they have kept cash at our house, and they have at this time an account kept open.</p>
               <p>Q. When you received it you saw it was a forgery, and did not pay it? - A. I did; I did not pay it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. At present they keep an account with you, did they last Thursday? - A. Yes, and for years.</p>
               <p>Q. Has this draft been in your possession ever since? - A. Not the whole of the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the draft that you received from the boy out of your possession? - A. A very short time; it was in the possession of Mr. Lucadou from about four o'clock on Thursday till twelve o'clock on Saturday, at the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give it to Mr. Lucadou? - A. I did not; it was laid on our counter, and who took it up I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. It was out of your sight till you saw it before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put any mark upon it before you parted with it? - A. No, but from the attention I paid to it, I have no doubt of it; I think I can swear to it without any difficulty.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the boy that is standing up here? - A. Yes, I saw him speak to him, and then he ran away; I ran after him, and I came up to him in Pope's Head alley, that leads from Lombard-street to Cornhill; I told him that he had been sending a check by the boy to our house; he said he had not; I told him he had, and that he must go back with me, and as I was taking him back Mr. Fleming came up; he is one of our clerks; we then both took him into our house.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the boy that has been examined bringing the draft? - A. Yes, I was there, between the hours of four and five; I saw him, and I think I saw the prisoner before he was brought in; I saw when he was brought in; I said, how came you by that; he made me no answer; I pressed him two or three times to tell me where he had got it; his answer was, he lived with Mr. Morgan, in Lawrence-lane, who kept cash at our house; I desired one of the clerks to go for a constable, and just at the moment he was going out of the room with this constable, he said, I wrote it, I meant it as a joke, or intended it as a joke.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with this draft? - A. I immediately took this draft and put it under lock and key.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the Mansion-house? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry the draft to the Mansion-house? - A. I did not, I rather think it was Hawkins.</p>
               <p>Q. You locked it up and kept it till the next morning? - A. Yes, and when I came down into the office, I saw the draft again; I have not a doubt but it is the same draft.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have not a doubt but it is a draft of the same purport? - A. I have no doubt at all it is the same, and now looking upon it I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. It has been out of your possession? - A. It certainly has.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a draft, in your judgment, of the same hand-writing; you will not swear positively that it is the same draft? - A. I saw the draft and looked attentively upon it at the time; I have not a doubt but it is the same, to the best of my recollection and judgment.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen a draft similar to this, and, upon recollection, it induces you to think it is the same? - A. I have not a doubt but it is the very draft.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the impression on your mind; Messrs. Booth and Robson had no account open at your house? - A. They have at this time what we call accounts open, upon which there is a balance due to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Have you any doubt of that draft that you took to the Mansion-house, but it is the same you had under lock and key? - A. None in the least.</p>
               <p>Jury. We believed that he said he could not swear it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Upon oath do you believe that to be the draft you had locked up in your desk? - A. I do believe it to be the identical draft; I have not the least doubt; I can take my oath of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you any doubt that you had it in your possession, and delivered it to be produced before the Magistrate? - A. I have no doubt.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you say that is Mr. Keymer's handwriting? - A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not like it? - A. I think it is in imitation of it, but I have no doubt that it is not his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you speak it from what he has said to you? - A. No, I suspected it when the boy gave it me; I have seen him write many times, there is a faint resemblance, but it could not deceive me. (The draft read in Court.)</p>

On Sunday past eight, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300017"></xptr>saw the prisoner coming down stairs, she had three parcels containing feathers, I had suspicion that she had taken them from one of the beds, I asked her where she slept, she said up three pair of stairs, she asked me then for a glass of brandy, I shewed her to the Coffee-room, I left her there, and told a young woman to mind her until I could go up and see what property was missing, when I was going up stairs the young woman called me back, and told me the waiter had turned her out of the coffee-room, I returned and met her three parts of the way up the yard, I asked her what she had got in the baskets, she said two baskets and a bandbox, I said I was confident she had got feathers, she said no indeed I have not a feather about me, I turned her round and shewed her the way into the kitchen, I went up into No. 5 room where she had slept on the 21st at night, I found she had made the bed she slept in, I pulled the clothes off the bed and missed the feathers, the bed had been ripped and sewed up again, - and a pin put in the end of it, because the thread was not long enough, I came down and took her to the room and told her she had not left it as she found it, she made no answer.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of feathers had she taken away. - A. Twenty pound weight. I am in the habit of going into the rooms every day and making the beds; the property is under my care; the bed was not ripped before.</p>
               <p>- WOODMAN. Here is the two baskets of feathers and a hat box. I took the woman in custody; I weighed the feathers, they weighed twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was distressed in circumstances and distressed in my mind, and if I had not done that I should have done something worse, my husband had volunteered to go to Ireland, I wanted to go to him, and that made me do this.</p>

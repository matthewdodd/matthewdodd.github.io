                  </hi>. I am messenger at the Imperial Ottoman Bank, 4, Bank Buildings—on 6th August, about half-past 3 in the afternoon, I was on London Bridge, looking over the parapet at a steamer—I saw the prisoner close to my left side—just at the moment the steamer was starting I felt a movement at my waistcoat pocket—on looking down I saw my Albert chain dangling about—my watch had been in my left-hand waistcoat pocket—I immediately seized him and accused him of taking my watch—he said, "I have not"—I said I should give him in charge—at that moment the watch fell on the pavement between his legs, as if it fell from him—I picked it up, and also the bow which was on the pavement, broken off—I still held him—he said, "You have got your watch, why don't you let me go"—I gave him in charge—he was the nearest person to me—the watch is worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

Q.</hi> I suppose this occurred very quickly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there was not a considerable crowd—my niece was with me on my right—I did not observe the prisoner's arms over the parapet—I will not swear there were not people behind me—I don't think there was anybody stand<lb></lb>ing near there—people congregated when I seized the prisoner.</p>

               <p>who caught hold of the prisoner, and accused him of taking his watch—I saw it drop between the prisoner's legs—my uncle picked it up—the prisoner said, "You have got your watch, what more do you want"—I am sure the watch dropped from the prisoner and no one else.</p>

The prisoner was given into my custody by the prosecutor for stealing his watch—the prisoner said, "On my word I did not take the watch, I had my arms over the parapet, looking over into the water"—he said that several times—I took him to the station—I found on him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a ring—he gave his address 47, Cambridge Heath-road—there is no such number in the street.</p>

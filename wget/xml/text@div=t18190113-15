On the 18th of December, about ten o'clock in the morning, I went into my parlour to breakfast, and saw the prisoner and another man walking backwards and forwards for a quarter of an hour, looking in at my window - I thought by the shade that he was pointing at the window. I got up, went out, and found my window cut, part of a pane of glass taken out, and some rings and brooches gone, which had been put in the window that morning. I went out to look for him, and caught him to the corner of Russell-court, coming towards my house again with the other man. I collared, brought him back, and said</p>
               <p>"He was a fine fellow to cut my window, at that time of day." He said, I have got nothing, and you can not do anything with me, but if you will let me go, I will get the property back again for you. I took him towards Bow-street, met Ellis, and gave him in charge. I was in my house with my family - I lost ten rings, worth 5 l., and five brooches, worth 40 s..</p>

                  </hi>. I am sexton to the parish of Woodford, in Essex—the prisoner was grave-digger to the parish—he has been to ever since he was a boy. On the 2nd of May a young woman named Charlotte By-water, was buried in the churchyard—she was the daughter of poor people—her father is a basket-maker—her grave was four feet two inches deep—it was properly filled up after the funeral—I saw it again on Monday af<lb></lb>ternoon, the 3rd of May, about five o'clock—it was then apparently in the same state as on the Sunday—the father of the young woman watched the grave on the Sunday night, and on the Monday night—on Tuesday after<lb></lb>noon I was walking round the churchyard, and noticed the grave was in a deranged state—it had been dug up, and the earth removed—I went to the prisoner's house—he was in bed—I desired his wife to call him—I asked him how the grave came to be in that state—he seemed much con<lb></lb>fused, and said he had dug it out to put the child in—(a child of the same family, which had been buried six months before, was taken up to bury this body, and ought to have been put in again)—I told him it was no such thing, that the grave never was dug out in that way to put a child in—we had then gone to the grave—I desired him to dig out the earth that I might see the coffin—he was very much agitated, and wanted to dig at the foot of the coffin—I insisted on his digging at the head—he did so, but was very much agitated, and could not throw the earth out—he went for a pickaxe, and while he was gone, I removed some of the earth, and to my horror, when I had taken hold of a piece of wood, the face of the body laid quite bare—I saw the coffin had been opened—when the pri<lb></lb>soner came back, 1 said to him, "Dick, you villain, how could you do</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184105100146"></xptr>
               <p>such a thing as this?"—he said, "I did not do it, I know nothing about it—nobody can say I did"—I sent for the churchwarden, and afterwards had all the earth dug out—I found a portion of the lid of the coffin loose—it had been cut off about the shoulder, and the head of the lid was at the foot—this chisel—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—is mine—it had been about my place—it had been used in scraping chairs, and so on—the prisoner had access to it—I compared this chisel with the marks on the coffin, and am quite sure this chisel must have made the marks on the coffin—the body could have been removed in a very few minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Woodford. On that Tuesday morning I was going to the Rectory—as I passed through the churchyard, I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner in Charlotte Bywater's grave—about half of his person was in the grave—I did not notice what he was doing.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was applied to many times by Mr. Lane, Mr. Morgan's assistant, of Woodford, Essex, to allow him to inspect the body of the deceased Bywater, as be stated it would be of great and important consequence to the community that an examination should take place, as it was unknown of what disease she died—I refused very often, but at last I agreed to dig to the coffin for the purpose of allowing him to make the required examination, but it was not my intention to take the body up, and it never was taken up after it was buried on Sunday—Mr. Lane did not offer me any money for digging down to the grave, but stated that he would reward me for it after he had succeeded—after I was taken into custody, the policeman and the Rector told me that it was best to speak the truth, which was the reason I made the confession I did, and under the impression that I should get off by making that confession.</p>

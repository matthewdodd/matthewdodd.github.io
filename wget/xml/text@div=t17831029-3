               <p>What money had you? - I know I had thirteen guineas in a canvas bag with a parting in it, I had the silver in one side and the thirteen guineas in the other; I cannot be positive to the quantity of silver.</p>
               <p>Was this your own money? - Yes.</p>

               <p>When was you sober enough to know what came to you? - About ten minutes after they awoke me.</p>

               <p>How many were there of your party? - Only one, but he was more in liquor than me, and was taken away to bed.</p>
               <p>Do you know this prisoner? - Yes, he is a neighbour of mine.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether he was there or not? - No, I never saw the man all the day.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find your purse or your money? - No neither, I was offered seven guineas of the money by Perry, who said he came from the prisoner, and asked me to make it up.</p>

               <p>Was you in this house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time of the day did you come in? - About a quarter after four o'clock, I stopped I believe till six o'clock or after, I went in to have a pint of beer to nourish myself, and in the mean time who should come in but the prisoner, and he would insist on sitting down by the prosecutor who was in the house; when I first came in he was in company with Mr. Perry.</p>
               <p>Was he sober or in liquor when you first came in? - He was between both.</p>
               <p>Do you remember his falling asleep? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How did he lay? - He lay with his head on the table sleeping by himself, the prisoner came in and placed himself on the other side of the box opposite to him, and he sat there about the space of a minute, he moved and sat by the prosecutor and began to handle him with his right hand on his left side, and I saw the prisoner put his right hand into the prosecutor's left hand breeches pocket, he drew his hand back and put it behind him under his coat, and drank his beer and walked out of the house immediately.</p>
               <p>Did the man awake before you went out? - Yes, and I saw him searched.</p>
               <p>How came he to be searched? - Mrs. Medley insisted on his being searched before he went out of the house, as I told her of the man having robbed him; he had nothing but a few bad halfpence.</p>
               <p>What did he complain of having lost? - The same as he does now, thirteen guineas and some silver.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Prosecutor. Was not you intoxicated when you came in? - Not so much.</p>
               <p>No, not quite so much: did the last witness at any time give you a reason for not detecting the party he afterwards chose to say had robbed you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why did not you immediately pursue him? - I did, I went to three different constables.</p>
               <p>What reason did the last witness give you for not detaining him? - The reason he gave is, he is very guilty of drawing a knife, and they were afraid of that.</p>
               <p>There has been a great deal of misunderstanding between you and the prisoner? - No, nothing.</p>
               <p>Did you never make use of words to this import, that you would do for him? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Brassnell. Had the prisoner and you any quarrel at any time? - No, never.</p>
               <p>How many people were there in the room? - I suppose there were ten or eleven.</p>
               <p>But you did not think proper to stop him? - I was rather dubious, I immediately acquainted all the remainder in the room of it, and nobody stopped him.</p>
               <p>Did not you say at any time, that if he did it, it was out of fun? - Yes I did think so.</p>
               <p>Jury to Brassnell. When you saw the prisoner with his hand in the man's pocket, did he take out canvas or money? - I saw his hand full.</p>
               <p>What was it full of, canvas or money? - I cannot say, it made no noise.</p>

               <p>I was in the room, I sat with that gentleman who was laying on the table, his feet were under mine, and he was down on the ground.</p>

               <p>Did the prisoner endeavour to wake him in your presence? - Yes, he did endeavour to wake him, but I never saw him any further than laying hold of his hand, I did not see him meddle with any part of his person any further; I was sitting in the same box, the rest of the company sat at the right-hand of me in another box; I have known him about a twelvemonth, I never heard any thing but a good character of him, always a striving endeavouring young fellow in his business.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any of the persons in the room charge him with a felony at this time? - No, Sir, they did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you remember hearing Mrs. Medley call to him? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you stay in the house after the prisoner, or go out before him? - I went almost directly after him.</p>
               <p>Did you come in with him or before him? - We came in both together.</p>

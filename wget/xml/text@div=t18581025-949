On Monday afternoon, 20th September, about half-past 2 o'clock, I went to the prisoner's house, 22, Broad-street, Bloomsbury—it is a shop for saddlery, and saddler's iron<lb></lb>mongery; the whole house is in the prisoner's occupation—I asked him whether he had bought any leather lately, or within six months—he said no, he had not bought anything of the kind for a long time—I asked him if he was positive about that—he said, "Well, I bought some cuttings about six weeks ago"—I went up-stairs and saw them; they had nothing to do with this transaction—I told him that that was not what I wanted, I</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185810250016"></xptr>
               <p>then took him some more bridle leather; I think I took two pieces, as near as I can remember, they were two sheets similar to these produced—the piece I took the first time was about a pound weight—when I took the leather the second time he asked me how I came by it—I told him it was my own leather; I told him I had work to do out of doors, and what was over I had for myself—he asked me both times how I came by it—I gave him the same answer both times—he allowed me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for it—I do not remember how many pounds there was—I went again a few days afterwards; I almost forget what I took then, it was either something of the same kind or some wallet pocket leather; he bought that of me—I went altogether perhaps seven, eight, or nine times, while I was at Mr. Dale's—I took him a few straps and buckles, something like these produced, but long and narrow, not quite so wide as these—that was all I took; I did not take any of these blinkers—I can't say how many times I took wallet pockets; it was during the eight or nine times that I went—the largest quantity that I took at any one time, was perhaps four or five pounds weight—he allowed me 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for the wallet pockets, as nearly as I can remember—the straps he weighed with the large pieces of leather at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—the largest sum I received at one time was 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I think—it was all new leather that I took; it was all stolen from my master—I told the prisoner who I was working for; I mentioned Mr. Dale's name—when he gave me the 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the leather I took, he asked me how I came by it, and I told him it was work I had to do out and what was over I had for myself—he did not ask me that question upon every occasion—the wallet leather was not cut when I took it; I took it quite whole, and in shape for the wallets—I told him they were for wallet pockets—there was some white bridle leather; I received half-a-crown a pound for that, that is more expensive—he paid me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on one occasion; I can't say what that was for. I was charged by Mr. Dale in March; he consented not to prosecute me—some time after that I was told that Mr. Dale wanted to see me—I was not at home at the time; he left a card for me—that was on the Sunday before the prisoner was taken into custody—on the Monday morning I called at the prisoner's shop, about a quarter to 10; I asked him if he had heard from Mr. Dale where I had been working—he said he had not, and asked me the reason why I enquired—I told him that Mr. Dale had left a card at my house on the Sunday morning, and I was afraid there was something wrong about the leather I had been selling him—he asked me why I left Mr. Dale—I told him the reason, and he said, "Oh, indeed"—I said I would go and see what Mr. Dale wanted me for, and I would call on him as I returned back—I have always dealt with the prisoner himself, he has always paid me himself—I have asked him to have a glass of ale on several occasions, and he has gone with me to a public-house opposite his shop; I have paid for it several times; sometimes he has paid for it himself; I believe he paid for it one or two occasions—I was paid in the shop.</p>

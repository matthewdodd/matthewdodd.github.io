On Thursday morning I had suspicion from something, I heard that she had robbed me; I called her into my parlour, I said to her, how long have you been in the habit of taking candles and disposing of them for gin at a neighbouring public house; she denied it; I sent for a gentleman that had one in his possession, he was not at home; she after that owned to it. I told her I did not mean to keep her in the house, and for her to give up those things that she had in her care, and let me see that it was all right. She paused for a moment, she said she hoped I would not be angry with her, she had made away with some of my things; I asked her what she had done that for, as she wanted for nothing in my house, and I had let her have twenty shillings advance in wages; she had only been with me five weeks and a few days. She said that she had pledged them at Mr. Collins's and Messrs. Lea and Barnet. Mr. Blackman the officer searched her and found six duplicates on her; we went to the shop of Lea and Barnet and Mr. Collins; I saw the things produced, they are my own.</p>

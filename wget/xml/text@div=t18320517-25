               <p>JOHN MOORE. I am a warehouseman and live in Cheapside. On the 10th of April, about noon, I saw the prisoner in <placeName id="t18320517-25-crimeloc149">Cheapside</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18320517-25-crimeloc149" type="placeName" value="Cheapside"></interp>

               <p>Q. Was any one but him and his companions near enough to have cut it? A.Several were passing; a gentleman came out of a house, and crossed over - I cannot say whether he was near enough - another person passed between the prisoner and the lady soon after: when I laid hold of the prisoner he said nothing - I went to the lady, and saw her reticule had been cut; she claimed the handkerchief - the prisoner was then in custody; his companions went away.</p>
               <p>JAMES ADAMSON. I am one of the City patrol. Moore gave the prisoner into my charge - I had not seen him before - I have Miss George's handkerchief; she claimed it -I do not know who gave it to me in the confusion; I searched the prisoner, and found this knife in his pocket - it has a buck-born handle.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH SMITH GEORGE. This is my reticule. I was walking with two ladies; it was entire then, and had a handkerchief in it - I afterwards saw the handkerchief and reticule before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been four months out of work, and throw myself on your mercy.</p>

               <p>JAMES FORD sworn. - I am errand-boy to Mr. Buss: On Tuesday, the 17th of January, in the afternoon, I brought the sal-ammoniac into the shop, and put it on the counter; I cannot say what time in the afternoon, I believe about four o'clock; when I went to put up the shutter of the door, between ten and eleven at night, I found the door wide open; we did not miss the sal-ammoniac till next morning; the shutters were up at nine o'clock, and the door was on the latch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of the family go out or come in between nine and ten o'clock? - A. I don't know; we missed it in the morning, between eight and nine o'clock; I saw it on the Friday, at the Police-office.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose sal-ammoniac was it you saw there? - A. We thought it belonged to us, because there was nearly the same weight we lost; I fetched it from Fleet-street; it was weighed when I received it, and it was weighed when it was offered for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when it was offered? - A. They sent over for my master, he was not at home; I went over and saw it weighed; there were 28lb. all but a quarter, it was in little bits, in a brown paper bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to the bag? - A. No; it was in the bag when it was found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it look like the same bag? - A. Yes; I saw the woman prisoner at the shop where it was stopped; I asked her where she got it, she said the would not tell me.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it dirty? - A. No, that was only an excuse; after we had been talking about it some time, she said, she would bring the whole of it; she said there was about twenty pounds of it; in the course of a little time she brought the whole of it; as soon as I saw it, I sent over for Mr. Buss, who had informed me of his loss, and desired I would stop it if it was offered me, he was not at home; I weighed it, it weighed twenty eight pounds; while I was weighing it, I asked her where she got it, if I was safe in buying it; she said, I was in no danger in buying it; if there was any danger she was in the most danger, by standing so long in the open shop; I asked her if it came from on board of ship; she told me, yes; that a man had left it at her house to fell; when my boy came back, and told me Mr. Buss was not at home, I told her if she would leave it an hour or two I would consider what the price was, and give her what it was worth; she told me she would not leave it, but would bring it again in about two hours; I let her take it away, and she brought it again; and told me to weigh it again that I might see she had taken none out; Mr. Buss was not come home, she said, was the reason of my not buying it before, because I was afraid; I told her, no; I was informed Mr. Buss had lost such a parcel the night before, and I would not buy it till he saw it; she said, she was sure it was not Mr. Buss's; I said, if she could make it appear it was not I would buy it of her; she behaved extremely well; she said, she would with Mr. Buss to look at it; Mr. Buss was not come home, but the lad (the last witness) came over, I was serving a customer, I bid him walk backwards and forwards, and see if that was the parcel they lost the night before; he looked at it, and said, he thought it was; she said, nobody should have it till an officer was sent for; then I sent for an officer, and he took her to Shadwell office; in the evening, Thomas Gee came into the shop, and told me, he came to me concerning the woman at the office; I asked him what woman; and he said, Barbara Gee, that was taken up for the article in question; I asked him if she was his wife; he told me, yes; and he said he had found the article I stopped that morning between five and six o'clock; I asked him where he found it; and he told me, in an alley, the back of Mr. Furlong's house; I told him that was not very likely, because the bag was very clean, as if just taken off the counter; and it was a moist morning, if it had laid there it would have dissolved; just at that time the officer came to me to attend the office, and we all went to the office together.</p>

            's defence. I have been a watchman these fifteen years, within an hundred yards of where this gentleman lives; after five in the morning, I went into Mr. Ward's house and had a pennyworth of purl; going up an alley by my own house, this was lying at the back door of Mr. Furlong's, on the flag stones; I took a piece to Mr. Ward's house, and shewed it to a watchman, and asked what it was; he told me to go to Mr. Kirk's in the morning, and he would tell me what it was; I never was in the gentleman's house.</p>
               <p>Barbara Gee's defence. My husband came home at fix in the morning, and said he had found a paper bag with something, he did not know what it was; I beg for mercy, as I have four children.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the Prosecutor.) Do you know what this man's character is? - A. The man bears a very honest good character.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Mr. Furlong's, where this is said to be found, from your house? - A. I suppose two hundred yards, it is up an alley in Love-lane, I never was up the alley in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the situation of your shop from nine to ten o'clock? - A. The door was left on the latch; two or three customers had been in, and they might have left the door open; the prisoner has a large family, and is, I believe, a very industrious man; the sal-ammoniac is charged rather high in the indictment, if your Lordship, and the Gentlemen; of the Jury, can shew him any mercy, I shall be obliged to you.</p>

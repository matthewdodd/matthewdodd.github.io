                  </hi>. I live at White Webbs Farm, Enfield. Brightman has been in my service twenty years on and off; he has sometimes been away and has come back again—he was quite a lad when he came to me—Houghton occupies a farm by me—I left it, and he entered on it at Michael<lb></lb>mas last; it is not 200 yards from my farm—I knew him before Michaelmas, but he had not been a farmer before that to my knowledge—in consequence of suspicions I entertained I went on 5th Feb., to a loft on my farm which Brightman had the care of—I missed from the stable a new truss of hay which I had tied up for a particular purpose—I went up into the loft, and found it there concealed—it was for cutting up for the sheep—Brightman was the last person there that afternoon, and I am positive that he con<lb></lb>cealed it—nobody else had any business in the loft, and no one went there besides him in the afternoon, to my knowledge—the loft was never locked—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a list of the dates—I told my brother the dates and he wrote them—I examined the racks in the stable, and there was no hay in them—on the 7th I missed another truss, and found it in the loft covered over with some oat straw, some before it, and some on the top of it—I also missed three trusses on the 8th, and saw them laid in the same place in the loft—they had come from the stack, and the prisoner ought to have put them into the rack—between 5th and 8th Feb., I went into the stable, and saw that the good hay had been taken out of the racks, and some which had been lying about in the stable for a month, and could not be eaten, was in the racks—I communicated with the police, and Goodall and Harriss came on the 11th, about 12 o'clock at night—I went into the loft with them, and saw two trusses of hay concealed in a corner, and some trusses of straw in front, and on the top of them—there was a truss of hay in the middle of the loft; that was exposed—those trusses were for the use of the horses, but instead of that they were concealed—Goodall and Harriss put brown paper into all of them, with my initials on, and some with Harriss's initials—I watched with them all night, but nobody came, and the policemen watched afterwards till half past 3 o'clock, when I desired them not to stop too long in case the men should see them in the yard—on 13th, about 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning, I went to the loft and missed these three trusses—the police were not there then, but I sent to the station house, and afterwards went to Houghton's, with Goodall and Williams—we went to the granary—there were two men cutting chaff, and I examined two trusses of hay, which were mine—I saw the brown papers taken out of them which the police had put in—we found three more trusses in the stable, two of which I had marked—I identify three marked trusses, and two others—I identify those which are not marked by the character of the hay, and by the bands they were tied up with—the man who made them did not know how to make a band—some of them were straw bands—Houghton was there while the search was going on, but I did not speak to him—the police asked him how he came by them; he said that he did not know, and that he had no right to tell them—another truss was thrown out of the loft, Williams asked me if</p>

CODD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe your farm adjoins Houghton's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the landlord of my farm is General Meux, and of Houghton's, Mr. Bowles—there was a misunderstanding between me and Mr. Bowles on my leaving, but we settled it very amicably—Mr. Bowles did not prefer Hough<lb></lb>ton to me as a tenant; he wrote a note to me to say that he had let the farm to Houghton, and the reason he did not offer it to me was, that he had heard me say that I paid too much for it; but if he had offered it to me I would not have had it, in consequence of the ill treatment I met with from him—I have known Houghton 14 or 15 years, he was a hay dealer previous to and since taking this farm—Brightman lodged in part of Houghton's house with his wife and family—there is a short cut across the fields from Houghton's to my farm, but Brightman would not be allowed to go that way—he said he went that way to his dinner, but his daughter carried his dinner into the fields to him—Brightman lived in Houghton's house at the time I held the farm, but he was not my tenant, he was my workman and it was then my farm—I have six horses now, and had then—I employ two men thrashing, and a boy and my brother assist me—they could go up into this loft if they liked—I never saw them go there—this was rowan hay, the second cut—I do not recollect Houghton saying that he purchased the five trusses of Rutherford, but as to the last one that came out he did—that was as large again as mine—he said that he bought some of Rutherford—Mr. Rutherford is a farmer, and is here—the papers were all brown, and were four or five inches long—Goodall put them into two trusses, and Harriss into one—there is a footpath leading from White Webbs to Cheahunt, that passes Houghton's field, close to his yard—Brightman might go that way sometimes, and sometimes by the road, that is the shortest way, but I do not know that there is much difference—when we went to Houghton's pre<lb></lb>mises the granary was open, and Houghton was in the stable doing his horse up—the loft was too high for me to see the trusses in it—the bands of the trusses are made with oat straw, by which I also know them—that is a common sort of straw in my neighbourhood—there were about twenty loads of hay in the stack—I have not missed a truss from the stack, only out of the loft—Brightman was quite a lad, at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, when he first came—he had lived at Houghton's house perhaps twelve months—I did not leave the farm at Michaelmas—I was not turned out by Bowles, my lease ex<lb></lb>pired—I was not anxious to keep it, and would not have it at any price through the treatment I received from Bowles, but we parted good friends, and shook hands.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, N</hi> 3). My duty is in Enfield—Mr. Harrison communicated with me about this hay, and on 11th Feb. I went to his farm—I went into the loft with him at 12 o'clock at night, and saw two trusses of hay covered over with straw, and one exposed—into each of the two trusses I put, I believe, four papers, marked "E. H.," Mr. Harrison's initials—I saw Mr. Harrison mark the other truss—I then left, and watched the premises till 3 o'clock—I watched again between the 11th and 13th, but did not see the trusses removed—on the afternoon of 13th, Mr. Harri<lb></lb>son came to the station, and I went to his house, but did not go into the loft—I took Brightman into custody in the yard, and asked him what had become of the two trusses of hay in the corner of the loft—he said, "One of them is there yet"—I said, "Where is the other?"—he said, "I have got it"—I took him into custody—I found another truss, a wet one, sub<lb></lb>tituded</p>

               <p>for one of the others in the loft—I afterwards went into Honge<lb></lb>ton's, went into the granary, and a man was cutting some hay up into chaff—I examined the truss, and took this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from it, it is one of the papers which I had put into the trusses in the prosecutor's loft—sergeant Williams handed down four or five trusses from the loft, among which I discovered another truss which I had marked, and took from it these two papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there were no marks in any of the other—altogether, I found two marked trusses at Houghton's—I have not discovered the truss that Mr. Harrison marked—I saw Houghton first in the stable, nothing was said to him in my presence—Mr. Harrison identified five or six other trusses, and a number of hay and straw bands, which he said were his pro<lb></lb>perty—I found footmarks at the back of Houghton's—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a plan of the premises—the footmarks extended across Houghton's field to the farm, and up to the fence, as it is dotted here—I found some hay stick<lb></lb>ing to the tarred fence by Harrison's—I took off Brightman's left boot, and examined it with the footmarks up to the first fence—they exactly corre<lb></lb>sponded—they were rather indistinct across the field, but there were two very deep impressions on the side of the fence near to Mr. Harrison's pre<lb></lb>mises—they were in the ditch where the hay was handed over into the field—a key was found on Brightman which opened Houghton's granary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was Houghton's granary open when you went to it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they were at work—I compared the footmarks on the fol<lb></lb>lowing afternoon—it had rained a good deal in the interval, it was wet—I did not trace footmarks on the public footpath across the field, but there were some at the bottom of the field—I did not take the right shoe—the mark was where a person had stepped over—I observed other footmark made with a different shoe, but they were indistinct, and I did not compare them—I went into Houghton's stable, but did not see any trusses of hay in the loft as I went in—I did not look whether it was open when I went—it is open to the stable, but the stable door is locked—I put four papers marked "E. H." into two of the trusses, and saw Harrias put some into the other truss, but how many I do not know—I believe the mark on them was "Harris"—I saw none found with "Harrison" on them—I did not know the prisoners before.</p>

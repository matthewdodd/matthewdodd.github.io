On the forenoon of the 23rd of February the prisoner came to my house, to look at a lodging: I showed him a first floor room - he agreed to take it at 4s. 3d. a week, and said he would bring in his goods on the following Monday; he then proposed to leave a deposit, and asked me what was usual; I had not suggested it to him - I rather declined it- he asked me to give him change for a half-sovereign; I opened my pocket-book, and he took 9s., and gave into my hand the supposed half-sovereign, which I took and placed in my drawer; I then told him we always required a reference - he said he would give me one if I would give him a pen and ink; I went down for one, but could not find it - I came up to him, and he said his time was gone, but the reference was No. 20, John-street, Cleveland-street; he asked me three times if I would keep the room for him- I said Yes, and I would if he had not left the deposit; he went away, and never came back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was he a stranger? A. Yes; this is the half-sovereign he gave me - I did not find it was bad till the Saturday after; I had put it into my pocket-book in the drawer - I had five sovereigns there, but no half-sovereign; I did not expect to get the nine shillings back - I gave him them as the change of the half-sovereign, and the shilling was retained in part payment of rent - I gave him the change on the faith of the half-sovereign being a good one.</p>

            . Q. What did the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050076"></xptr>say to you? A. He said, "It is usual to leave a deposit"- I said, "I don't require one;" he said twice "I would rather leave you a deposit;" I then looked what silver I had, and gave him 9s. - he had before asked what it was usual to leave; I said some left half a crown, but he might leave what he pleased - he said he was going to the timber yard, should want some silver, and he would leave 1s. if I could give him change for a half-sovereign; I had asked him what family there was, and he said his wife and himself; I could find no such place as that to which he referred.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go to look for the place? A. No, my husband did - I have made inquiries, and there is no such place; I do not know how many Cleveland-streets there are in London; when I handed him the 9s. I expected a half-sovereign, and I had seen it in his hand-I parted with the 9s. upon the faith that I should get a half-sovereign.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You would not have given him change if he had not spoken of taking your lodging? A. No, certainly not; he took the lodging, and expressed a desire to leave a deposit, and I believed this to be really a half-sovereign at the time - I dealt with him on the footing of supposing he was about to become a lodger of mine; I did not hear of him till he was in custody.</p>

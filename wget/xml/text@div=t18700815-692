                  </hi>. I am assistant engineer to the Brighton Railway—I made these plans of the line at the point in question—they are correct—the line is practically level at Croydon—the red is the Croydon line—these are the signals, and here are the signals on the green line—all the signals shown on this plan are worked from the Sydenham station signal-box—we call the signals at the box the "home" signals; the next, towards Syden<lb></lb>ham, are the "stop" signals, and the next, going towards Penge, is the "distance" signal—when the signal is at "all right" on the green, or Crystal Palace line, it is necessarily at "danger" on the red line, from the mechanism—these signals have been at work for three years before the accident—I examined them after the accident, and they were working per<lb></lb>fectly—I am acquainted with the line—when a train is pulled up at the Penge station, the driver can see the distance signal—a train of ten vehicles, engine, tender, and two break vans, going at the rate of twenty miles an hour, on a gradient of 1 in 600, could be pulled up, in ordinary weather, in about 350 yards; it depends upon the break power—the distance signal is 700 yards from the point of collision, and if the break power was applied, there would be 400 yards to spare—the stop signal is 126 yards from the point of collision—when the driver is alongside the distance signal, he sees the stop signal, and if by any accident he overlooks the distance signal, he would still have 600 yards or 700 yards to pull up in—a driver coming up from Penge would see the home signal, if at "danger," quite as soon as he saw the stop signal, if not before, from the Croydon line—the home Signal is the highest from the ground, and is visible as the driver passes the</p>

               <p>distance signal—with regard to the Crystal Palace, the green line, the same rules apply—the distance signal on the Crystal Palace line is 700 yards from the home signal, and it is 126 yards from the stop signal to the fouling point—the gradient there, on the Crystal Palace line, is 1 in 60 for a certain distance, and 1 in 100 at the point of collision—the driver of 10 vehicles, with two breaks, could pull up his train in about 500 yards, when travelling at twenty miles an hour on a gradient of 1 in 100.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a signalman in the employ of the Brighton Railway—I have been in their service fourteen years, at Sydenham—our telegraph lad, Smith, was with me in the signal-box, and I was to be relieved by another signalman—a Crystal Palace train was timed to run through Sydenham Station without stopping; it was given out to me at 1.31, but it was a little late—we expected it to run under our signals about 1.28, and the Croydon stopping train at 1.32, about four minutes later—before the trains come we receive notice of their, approach from the Crystal Palace bank top, and from Penge—before the departure of the trains from the Crystal Palace they indicate it by four rings from the Crystal Palace, and one ring from Croydon, both which signals indicate that a train is coming—I received a signal on this day from the Crystal Palace at 1.31 to indicate that a Crystal Palace train was coming—that was three minutes after the time that it should have been with us—I also received, at 1.31, a signal from Penge of the starting of the Croydon train—at that time all the sig<lb></lb>nals on both lines were at danger, and, on both trains being signalled at the same moment, I opened the Crystal Palace road and put all the signals for the train to run through—I dropped the home signal, the auxiliary signal, and the junction signal, and put them at "all right" for the Crystal Palace train to come through—all the Croydon signals stood at "danger," I could not alter them—I watched for the Crystal Palace train, so that when he came in sight I could put the distance signal on to protect her behind—I saw both trains coming—they were inside the distance signal when I saw them first—I did not alter the signals, I never touched them; but when I saw that there would be a collision, I threw the auxiliary up on the Crystal Palace line—I threw the arm up to "danger"—that would not affect the sig<lb></lb>nals on the Crystal Palace side at all, they stood at "danger" still—"danger" was up on both auxiliaries—I threw up the home signal as well on the Crystal Palace line, the Croydon one was already at "danger"—that left both the home signals at "danger"—I do not think the Crystal Palace train could have stopped after I gave the signal—while this was doing, the Croydon train was coming on—I could hear the beat of the engine, and that was when I threw the auxiliary up—I saw the collision—it took place, as near as I could sec, below the auxiliaries, nearer the points—at the time of the colli<lb></lb>sion the Croydon engine was leading by five or six carriage lengths, from</p>

               <p>what I could see—the Croydon train was due to stop at Sydenham at 1.32—it was due to leave Penge at 1.29—both trains were late, the Croydon train was three minutes late—three minutes was the allotted time between Penge and Sydenham for the stopping train—if the Croydon train was lead<lb></lb>ing, the Crystal Palace train would run into it—I saw nothing of the deceased man Cooper—the prisoner was the driver of the Croydon train.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a signalman in the employ of the Brighton Rail-way Company—on 8th July I was going to relieve Judge at his signal<lb></lb>box, and I was walking along the line from Penge towards the signal<lb></lb>box—the Croydon train was not at Penge when I left at 1.23 or 1.24—the distance signal was against the Croydon driver, and the auxiliary and the home signals were also at "danger"—when I was about twenty yards on the Penge side of the stop signal and before I got to it, the Croydon train passed me at, I should think, fourteen miles an hour, but I am not a judge of the pace—the steam was on when it passed me until I called the driver's attention to the signal being against him by halloaing to him, and likewise to the fireman who was on the engine—the prisoner was the driver—I saw the signals pulled off on the Crystal Palace line, for "all right"—the fireman of the Croydon train ran to the break directly and put it on, and the steam was shut off for about half a minute and then it was put on again, and it whistled—the Croydon train had not passed the stop signal before the steam was shut off—the steam was shut off first, and it ran some twenty or thirty yards past the signal before the steam was put on again, but I don't know whether the engine had been reversed before the steam was put on again—I did not notice any alteration made in the home signals after I called attention to it—I saw the collision, I was close to it—the driver was almost foul of the junction when the steam was put on again, and the Palace train ran into the Croydon train—I did not see the deceased jump out—the front break of the Croydon train was off, and the wheels were free; but I don't know anything about the hinder break—at the time I saw the fireman go to the tender break the engine whistled, to call his attention to the break—both trains whistled about the same time.</p>

                  </hi>.

               <p>were "all right," for me to go through—I shut my steam off when I passed the Crystal Palace box, on account of the decline, and I ran down at eighteen miles an hour—I was going at about fourteen miles an hour when I shut off the steam; but the train would have a speed of eighteen miles, on account of the incline—the home signal was "all right," for me—I then saw the Croydon train going up to the signals; but it had no steam on; and when I was going close towards the signals I saw that he had steam on, as if he was going to pull into the station—the driving wheels were going ahead—I could tell that by the rods—directly I saw that he had steam on I reversed my engine, and gave the alarm to the guard to put on the breaks—if I had seen that he had steam on before, I could have pulled up sooner—I thought he had mistaken my signals for his—I had not passed my auxiliary signal—I could have done so before any alteration was made in it; but it was altered to "danger" just as I came to it; and I could not do anything more—the Crystal Palace trains are very heavy upon an incline, and it takes a greater distance to pull them up than on the level ground—I went on, I daresay, for 100 or 130 yards after the wheels were reversed, before the collision took place—by what I had done I had reduced the speed of my train very much, and I expected we should have stopped before we got to the Croydon train—we were going about three miles an hour at the time of the collision—as soon as my engine touched the train it threw it off the road, into an embankment—Coomber, who was killed, was riding in the break nearest to the engine, the first break, which has a glass front to it—the Croydon carriages and the Crystal Palace carriages came fide by side—they were thrown off the line; but no carriages were upset, and no one was injured, only pressed together—the steps of the carriages and the handles of the doors were broken—I made a great alarm, and the first guard put on his break, and immediately he had done so he went to the door and jumped out of the carriage—that was before the collision, about 100 yards before it, I should think—at that time I could do nothing to prevent the collision.</p>

I went on towards it, and when I got about ten yards from it, it was raised up, showing 'danger.' I then went on. I saw that mine was lifted up, and the Palace signal lowered. The Palace signal had been at 'danger' before that. I then saw the Crystal Palace train coming; Naylor, who was on my engine, said 'For God's sake, <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, get on, that train will not stop.' I shut the steam off to stop at the station, but seeing the Crystal Palace train I put the steam on again in order to go through the station, ahead of the Crystal Palace train. The home signal was at 'danger;' I could not stop between the auxiliary signal and the points; I was going from sixteen to twenty miles an hour; I was never going less than sixteen miles an hour; I knew that I could not stop between that signal and the points, and I thought that all would be killed, so I put the steam on as the safest way of trying to avoid the mis<lb></lb>chief. It is not right to run against the signals. I had nobody in the hinder part of the train. I had five empty carriages behind. I had just pulled the engine up and let her go again. I have been on railways thirty years; if I had not gone on as I did the mischief would have been much worse."</p>

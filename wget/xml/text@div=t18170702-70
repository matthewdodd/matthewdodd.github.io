On the 18th of June, between twelve and one o'clock in the day, I was in my parlour behind my shop, there was no person in the shop - I had my face towards the shop, and saw the back of the prisoner going from the door, he was on the step outside the door, going out - I had not seen him in the shop; the parlour is some distance from the door. I was coming out of the parlour into the shop, and I saw him go out. I suppose he must have come in as I was going out of the shop into the parlour, my back being then turned. I am certain that I did not seen him until he was going out; I ran after him. As I passed through the shop, I missed a parcel of almonds, which I had put up for a customer. My shop is about twenty feet long - I was about three yards from the door. I pursued, and saw him with the parcel under his arm - He turned round and saw me coming, and began to run, he was walking before-he dropped the pareel and was secured; I picked it up and did not pursue, as no person was in the shop.</p>

            . I am a tailor. On the 18th of June, I saw Mr. Lawrence with the parcel under his arm, the prisoner was running. Mr. Lawrence called out stop thief! I followed and collared him, and told him he must come with me - He said he would come without being coltared. I took him to Mr. Lawrence's house; Mr. Lawrence said the prisoner had stolen the parcel-the prisoner said he was a poor lad, and begged to be let go.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You did not stop me - A. I did; another man was running after him.</p>

               <p>MR. LAWRENCE. I am quite sure the prisoner is the boy that took the parcel. When he came back, he begged I would forgive him.</p>

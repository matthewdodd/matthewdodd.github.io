                  </hi>. I live in Holywell-street, Strand. On Tuesday evening, the 4th of May, I was sitting at my desk, between eight and nine o'clock, and saw the prisoner leaning over the window outside, in a particular position, which attracted my attention—my books were in a recess outside—the window is thrown back, and he was leaning over a row of books—I watched him for a few minutes—he hastily walked away—I stepped out immediately, and missed a book, by seeing a vacancy—I followed him down the street—he stopped at No. 33, and looked in at the window—I collared him, and said, "Young man, what have you there, what business have you with that book?"—he gave no answer—I pulled the flap of his coat back, and it was concealed under it—it was not but<lb></lb>toned, but he held it with his arm—I took him back, and sent for a police<lb></lb>man, who took the book from him—my own handwriting is on the book—I am positive I had not-sold it—I had seen it that morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was called, and I took the book from between the prisoner's jacket and waistcoat—I asked where he got it—he made no answer.</p>

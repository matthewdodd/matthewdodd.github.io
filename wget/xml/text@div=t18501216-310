                  </hi>. I am a hawker. Last Monday I was going from Brixton towards the White Hart in the Borough—the prisoner overtook me—he said, "It is a wet evening"—I said, "Yes, it is"—we walked some way, and he overtook another man—they talked about the weather and the night—we got to Kennington-common, and there the prisoner put his hand in my coat-pocket, and took out a silk handkerchief, and the other articles mentioned—there were two letters and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank-note in my pocket-book—I collared him and said, "Give it to me"—he said, "You shall have it in a minute"—I saw my handkerchief in his hand—he handed it to the other man and ran away—I had looked at my watch while I had been walking with him, it was in my silk handkerchief in the same pocket my book was in—the prisoner rushed into a public-house; I followed him, he rushed out and nearly knocked me down—he had a sack on his shoulders—he ran under an archway and took it off his shoulders, and put it under his arm—I followed till I saw a policeman, and I gave him in charge—he was not out of my sight a minute.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, M</hi> 15). I met Paine on New<lb></lb>ington Causeway—he gave the prisoner into my custody for stealing from his person a silver watch and chain, two gold seals, a key, a five-pound note, and a pocket-book—the prisoner said he had not seen him, and was not in his company.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was coming home and saw this man; we walked together; he did not walk quite so fast as I did, and another one whipped across; the prosecutor came up to me and said, "Where is that man?" I said I had never seen him, only he whipped across the road; I had never touched the prosecutor, I walked before him all the way; he has brought me up to get his own expenses.</p>

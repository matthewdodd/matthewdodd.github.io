               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, do you know her person - A. Yes; I know her to be the same person that came in our shop on June the 10th, about twelve at noon, she came to purchase two caps, they were hanging at the door; she bought the caps, paid for them, and look them away. In the course of five minutes she came in the shop again and said the caps were not the same as were hanging at the door; I convinced her that they were the same; she then took several muslins in her hand and asked the price, which I told her; she bid me within a shilling or eighteen pence a yard of what I asked her; I told her I could not deal with her in that way. There were other customers in the shop; she desired me to attend them, and she would wait. In the course of five minutes I had served the other customers, I told her we had got some remnants cheaper; I took her to another part of the shop and shewed her the remnants, which I sold to her for four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260029"></xptr>shillings; I then told her we had some cheap stockings and very good at two shillings; she looked at them, said they were too coarse, if I could shew her some very good for three shillings; I looked down, I saw her folding something under her gown; I said what is that; she said nothing; I said you have stole something; I looked over the counter, I saw the five yards of printed cotton come from some part of her clothes; it dropped from under her clothes on the ground; I saw it two minutes before on the counter close by her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You were of the other side of the counter - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that whatever view you had was from looking over the counter - A. Yes; I was not of the same side of the counter with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore whether you are correct in saying you saw it fall from her, depends upon whether you were correct in your view - A. I saw it drop from her.</p>

            . I did not go into the shop till the prisoner called me, she was standing by the side of the counter; she had a long train to her gown, she took it up in the train of her gown; she did not know it was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Smith hear it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Smith. I did not.</p>

               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel; called four witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

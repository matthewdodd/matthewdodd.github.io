The prisoner came to the door and rang the kitchen bell, and I opened the door to him; and he asked me if my mistress was at home? I told him she was not; he told me that he saw my mistress at Rathbone-place that morning, enquiring for a man servant to go into the country with her; I told him that she would not be long before she came in, and he might stop; I left him in the passage and went down into the kitchen, and about a minute or two after that I heard the street door shut, and I ran up stairs and found the plate was gone out of the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before had you seen the plate there? - A minute before. And I opened the street door and saw him at the bottom of the street; he was in China-street, and I thought he was looking towards me, and I told a person that was just opposite me, to go after that man in black, that he stole plate from our house, his name is William Reynolds.</p>

On that he got up and delivered the plate out of his inside pockets, and I took it up, and it has been in my custody ever since; it is here.</p>

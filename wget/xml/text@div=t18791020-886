                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, I was married to him on 30th September, last year—he is 42 years of age; I am 27—he had one child by his former wife—we lived together at 3, Grapes Place, Kentish Town—he is a carpenter by trade—on Saturday, 13th September, he went to his work as usual—he returned at 3 o'clock; he seemed as if he had had some<lb></lb>thing to drink—his dinner was not quite ready when he came in—he sat down to his dinner—he sent his daughter out for some tobacco—he said to me "I thought you were going home"—I said "I am not gone, but I am going; I will go n—he said "You shan't"—he said he thought I had got that 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to go home with (I had got 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the savings bank on the previous day)—I said "I will go now"—I went into the washhouse to get some water; he followed me—I told Mm I would go, and I stamped my foot and put my tongue out—he put his arms round my neck and kissed me, and said "Let us forget and forgive the past and be as happy as we ever have been"—I said "No, I won't"—I then went back into the front room, took off my wedding-ring and threw it on the table, and said "I am going home, and I don't want that thing; I will never wear it again"—the prisoner then went on his knees, picked the ring up from the table, and asked me to let him put it on—I was then sitting en the sofa—he said again "Do let me put it on once again"—I put my hands behind me and said "You shan't put that on me any more"—I then went into the wash-house again; he followed me, and said "Do let us forget all this and be all right again"—I went back again to the front room; he followed me, and said he would do all as was in a working man's power to make me happy—I said I had written to my father, and I expected him every minute—he said "Have you really wrote home?"—I said "Yes"—he said "You should not have done that"—I said "1 have, and I expect him every minute"—I then sat down on the sofa again; he sat down by my right side, and said "I can't face your father; I promised to make you happy"—I had not written to my father—as we were sitting together on the sofa he said "If you go home won't you ever live with me again"—I said "No, never"—he said "I</p>

               <p>can't let you go; what am I to do?"—I said "I will go"—he again said "I can't let you go; I will do all as I can for you"—he put his left arm round my waist and said "I can't let you go"—I then saw a razor in his right hand, just raising it up—I put up my left hand, and the razor cut my fingers just across the top of them, and it fell out of his hand—it just scratched my throat—I fell on the floor—I did not know at the time that my throat was cut—I halloaed out "Murder!" and "Help!" all the time—I called to Mrs. Luff and Mrs. Stacey—the prisoner then got the poker and hit me once or twice—I did not see the poker till he hit me with it—I was lying down on the floor—I saw him go towards the fireplace, and he hit me three or four times with it—he never spoke at the time—he hit me across the forehead and at the back of my head—I kept halloaing all the time—I then got up and went to the front door a little way—it opens into the room—the prisoner came and shut it, and while he was shutting it I ran out at the back door and went to Mrs. Luff's, next door—he did not follow me—I found my head and hand bleeding and my throat, but not much, just a scratch—they wiped my face—Mr. Goodchild, the surgeon, was sent for; he bandaged my head, and I was taken to the Middlesex Hospital—I remained there till a fortnight last Thursday—I am quite well now—this is the razor (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was usually kept in the table drawer in the front room—my husband did not use it for shaving; we both used it for cutting our corns—I had seen it in its usual place in the drawer about 10 minutes before he cut me—this is the poker (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw it coming before it came on to my head—he did not strike me so violently as to lose my senses—he was using it with one hand; he had hold of my frock with the other—I was not wearing a cap or bonnet—on the Wednesday morning of the Bank Holiday last August we had some words—he said that he had had a dream that I said in the night to him "Go and mess your own wife about, and leave me alone"—he said "I thought I was with my own wife"—when I woke him I found him out of bed crying bitterly—we had both had a little to drink the night before—he kept on wanting to know the meaning of those words—I did not remember making use of them—he said that the man opposite kept on looking at me so, and had such peculiar looks he could not make it out—he kept on saying that day after day—he said it preyed on his mind—on the following Sunday I took him over to the man's wife and told her what he had said—she told him where her husband was that he was at home with her all the evening—after that he said the man seemed to watch me about so everywhere I went; that we had such peculiar looks one to the other that he really thought it was true—during the 12 months we have been married he used to go to his work regularly—I did not notice any change in his manner before this occurrence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Until this occurrence his whole conduct showed that he was excessively fond of and devoted to me; too much so, I think—I believe this transaction was in consequence of his excessive love for me and jealousy of other people—up to the 6th August he had been an exceedingly I temperate man and a most kind and attentive husband—I have no children—from 6th August he was sleepless at night, and appeared very much excited in his mind—this suspicion appeared to prey on his mind.</p>

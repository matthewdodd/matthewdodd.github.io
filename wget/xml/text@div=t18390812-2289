                  </hi>. I am shopman to David le Bontillier and another, in the Commercial-road. On Tuesday, the 30th of July, about half-past three o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop with another woman, and asked for some narrow black sarcenet ribbon, which I shewed them—they looked at a drawer of ribbon—I served the other woman, and saw the prisoner take a silk handkerchief off the counter, put it under her handkerchief, and then put her hand towards her right-hand pocket—I afterwards saw her take a piece of ribbon out of the drawer I was showing her—I sent for a constable—I saw another piece of ribbon in her hand, but she let it fall into the drawer—Mr. Bontillier went into a room with her at the back of the shop, and I told the prisoner she had a lavender spun-silk handker<lb></lb>chief with a narrow border, and a piece of ribbon—she said she had not—I told her she had the ribbon down her bosom—she then put her hand into her bosom, took it out, and said she had had it three or four months—it had our mark on it—I asked her for the handkerchief—she said she had not got it—I left the room then for two or three minutes, and when I came back the policeman had the handkerchief in his hand—the ribbon was marked "A."</p>

She has bought ribbons at our shop, and might have bought some of this sort, but it is rather a particular kind—there is about three yards of it—the mark is always taken off when we sell it—I should not sell a remnant as this is—I should take it off the block—I cannot swear the other shopmen would take the blocks off—there are four shopmen—I will swear I have not sold this ribbon—I cannot swear about the other shopmen—I have inquired about the prisoner, and find she is the wife of a respectable person.</p>

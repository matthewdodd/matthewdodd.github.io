Do you not under<lb></lb>stand, dear wife, that all this trouble has brought on us by your not telling me you had fallen out with Mary Reardon; if you had told me that, I would have taken her up for ill using you in Cow-cross as she did, and all this misery would have been saved, as you <hi rend="italic">knowed</hi> my temper so well to be hasty; but you know I am equally ready to <hi rend="italic">forgive,</hi> as I trust to God yon are. You and I understand each other too well to suffer other people to make inroads upon our happiness—I have too good an opinion of you to suppose you would have proceeded this length had you not been advised by others; all I have to say now is that we should forget the past and look to the future, and pray to God that we may never fall out again.

If you do not forgive me, and you do prosecute me, you will transport me for life, I am sure you will forgive and forget as the Scripture teaches us to do, and to love one another, if it is only for the sake of our two poor babes. All you have to say when you go before the Magistrate is, that you have forgiven me, and that you will not prosecute me, and that you should like me to go home with you: if you will say this, you will never have cause to regret it. Do not suffer yourself to be advised by any one, look to your only protector in your husband; forgive me this once, my dear Ca<lb></lb>therine, and let us be happy all the rest of our life.</p>

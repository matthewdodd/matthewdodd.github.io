I went over my stable, and when I came down I saw this man in the stable. I thought it was the young man in the stable that assisted me; I said, you have soon got home. Directly the prisoner throwed the coat off his arm. I had hung it up about three stalls from the horse. The prisoner asked for work; I told him I did not know any person in the neighbourhood that wanted a helper. I walked towards the door; then I asked him what parcel that was. I did not know it was my coat. I thought it had been his own; he said it was a coat. Then it struck me that it was my coat. I looked towards the place where my coat should have hung; I found it was off the peg. I took the coat up, and saw it was my coat. I collared him immediately. This is the coat; it is the property of

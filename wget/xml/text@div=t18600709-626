                  </hi>. I live in Duke-street, Aldgate—on the morning of 18th June I was in Bishopsgate-street—I felt a tug at my watch, and saw my coat was shaking—I looked and saw my chain hanging and my watch was gone—I looked about and saw a young man go two steps—I began to call out; he began to run, and I ran after him—he was brought back by a policeman—this is my watch.</p>

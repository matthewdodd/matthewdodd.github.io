                  </hi>. I was formerly an inspector of police—on the night of 26th March, about half-past 9 o'clock, I went to 20, Lant-street, Southwark, accompanied by Inspector Moore and other officers—it is a marine-store shop—the shop-door was open—I proceeded through the shop and front-parlour, upstairs to the second-floor back-room—I saw the door ajar, and a light in the room—on entering, the light was put out—we had lamps—Inspector Bryant had a lamp with him—he turned it on—the prisoners were there when we entered the room—the male prisoner was standing by the fire<lb></lb>place, trampling on some plaster of Paris, metal, and cinders—he was seized by Inspector Moore, and I went towards the female prisoner and took this galvanic battery wire from her hand, wet with solution—I said to the male prisoner, "Well, Tom, we received instructions from the solicitor to the Mint, to pay you a visit; you are suspected of coining—he said "What's the matter? what's the matter?"—I said, "We shall see presently"—I then said to the female prisoner, "Well, Mrs. Freeman, here we meet again"—she said, I don't know what you mean; I never recollect seeing you before"—I said, What, not at Flint-street?"—she said, "That's gone by"—the cinders were steaming hot, but the fire was put out by some offensive liquid, which smelt like acid—I said to Jones, "Is this house yours? have you any ledgers? if so, we have no desire td annoy them, for we have a search-warrant to search the place"—he said "The whole house belongs to me; I have only one lodger, on the first-floor front room"—I then commenced searching, and on a large dish, which I produce, were a number of plaster of Paris moulds in liquid—I found that between the two prisoners—two of the moulds bear the im<lb></lb>pression of sixpences, partly obliterated through being in the liquid, which smelt to me like urine—I could not say whether it was that colour, because the plaster discoloured it—there were a great number of moulds, some of which had the impressions completely effaced and obliterated—some of the moulds that were at the top, in the urine, were warm and smoking—on the landing, in a coal-scuttle, I found a quantity of white metal, also hot—on the stove, in the adjoining room on the same floor, I found this tea-cup (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), with 155 counterfeit sixpences in it, some of them wet with the silver solution—I found an iron saucepan, also hot, containing a little white metal—I found all the other necessary implements for coining, colourings and coating—in a cupboard, under the stairs, I found two galvanic-battery plates, and three counterfeit sixpences (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the officers, who were with me, found other things—I saw them searching.</p>

               <p>room after we had searched—the blinds were not up—I put them up—I am positive they were not up at the time—the wire was wet with solution when I took it out of the female's hands—I know what solution it was, because I tasted it—Jones did not say anything about any lodgers having recently left—he said that he had a lodger in the front room of the first floor—I am quite clear that he did not say anything about a lodger having recently left his house, and having occupied those rooms—I know a man named Wright, and I believe he formerly lodged there—he is under charge here to-day, and has confessed his guilt (<hi rend="italic">see next case</hi>)—the sixpences which I produce were found in the next room, in a tea-cup—I can only state that I believe the liquid was a mixture of the solution that they had been using for coating, for I had the curiosity to taste it.</p>

I accompanied the other officers to this house, in Lant-street—I entered the room with them, and I saw Jones stamping on some cinders, and a plaster of Paris mould—I pushed him on one side and got the mould—there is no impression on it; it is defaced—I also found some basins of sand, one of which had a <hi rend="italic">get</hi> in it—I was at the police-court on 27th March, when the prisoners were remanded—while in the gaoler's room, as he was taking down the names in his book, the female prisoner said to the male prisoner, "I have done some time before, I suppose I shall have to do it again; but I am b----d if I don't do it after I come out, in spite of them; they can't hang me for it."</p>

               <p>this is a catalogue of the things in the order in which I am going to speak to them, made at the time they were brought to me—here are 2 double moulds for sixpences, but so much destroyed that I cannot speak to any of the coins having been cast by them—urine will destroy a mould if the mould is thrown into it in a hot state; but if thrown into it in a cold state, it rather tends to harden it—water will destroy it very much quicker—I have examined 155 sixpences produced by Mr. Brannan, and found them all to be bad—I only selected 6 from each, of the dates 1858, 1859, and 1860, to prove that they were from one mould—these produced by Inspector Bryant are 5 counterfeit sixpences of 1859, 1 of 1860, from the same moulds as the others—there are 5 shillings of 1859, and 2 florins of 1859, from one mould—the next are those produced by Inspector Moore—here is a sixpence of 1857; 2 of 1858, from one mould; 5 of 1859, from the same mould as the others of 1859; and 3 of 1860, from the same mould as the other of 1860; and 4 florins of 1859, from the same mould as the 2 produced by Inspector Bryant—here is a wire and a galvanic battery—when I first saw it there were several shillings in it, one above the other—they were placed there—whether they were found in that state I do not know—here is a part of another double mould; simply the channels are made—I will not venture to say whether it has been used—both the moulds produced, found in the urine, are double moulds for sixpences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you say that placing plaster moulds in urine, in a cold state, will have the effect of hardening them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I found it so from an experiment that I made—not one of these moulds is undefaced; but you can see sufficiently what mould it is, and what it has been used for—they are in a sufficiently good state to tell me that they are moulds for sixpences, but not so good as to enable me to say that any of these coins had been cast from them—this mould has the impression of a sixpence on it.</p>

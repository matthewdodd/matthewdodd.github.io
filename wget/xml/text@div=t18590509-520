I called myself F. and V. Arachtingi and Co.—I am the V. and my cousin was the F.—he is out of it now, but I carry on the same firm—the Co. are several who are interested; they are abroad; they are a great many foreigners, and I do not know them—I have no partner now—Glyn's became my bankers in June or July last; the money the prisoner is charged with stealing ought to have been paid into Glyn's—I believe Glyn's were under large advances at that time, about 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not go to them to ascertain whether the money had been paid in; they sent to me because I drew two checks, and they told me the money was not provided for them—I staled that I had sent 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the prisoner—they did not insist on my seeing their attorney, but I have employed him; I went by their desire to Mr. Mullens—this is where the prisoner debited himself with the salary, where the crosses are—it is down as Woolff's salary—I always knew the prisoner in the name of Woolff, Joseph Adolphus Woolff Zalmanowicz—at the merchant's house in Liverpool, he went by the name of Woolff—I knew when he came to London that his name was Zalmanowicz; this "Woolff" represents him—I had a clerk before the pri<lb></lb>soner, but I dismissed him; the prisoner used to draw bills on me, not as Zalmanowicz; he served me in the name of Woolff, and drew on me in the name of Zalmanowicz; he represents himself in these drafts to be living at Constantinople, and I accepted these drafts purporting to come from Con<lb></lb>stantinople, but drawn by my servant in my own office—I circulated them through Glyn's and other bankers; there was nothing false—I have been in business six months—I have not discounted in London on bills of this cha<lb></lb>racter to the amount of nearly 400,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor had my name on them—I have discounted at Glyn's altogether about 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on these bills, drawn on me by my servant, accepted by me, and purporting to come from Con<lb></lb>stantinople; in addition to that, I had the bills printed with "Constantinople" in printed letters—they were printed in London, manufactured in London, and purporting to come from Constantinople—I consider that perfectly, legal.</p>

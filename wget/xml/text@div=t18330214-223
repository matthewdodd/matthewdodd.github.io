            . I am a bricklayer and builder, and live in Union-street, Middlesex-hospital. I was in Smithfield on a Friday in January, I think it was the 25th, and saw the prisoner with a horse; I offered him 6l. 10s. for it - he rather laughed at me; he wanted 10l. - I gave him my card, and told him if he could not make a better price he might call on me; and in a few minutes as I was going to Duke-street, I saw him treating with a man, and he sold it for 7l. 10s. - the man said, "My name is at the back of the note, my name is Hannell;" he gave him a 5l. note and two sovereigns, but I do not know what silver.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you so near them? A. I had been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140103"></xptr>to Duke-street - the person I wanted was dead, and I returned directly; I did not wait with the prisoner five minutes - the horse would have been a bargain at the money I offered; they were in the act of settling for it when I came up - I had no particular reason to notice what money was paid; I did not know the prisoner before - a letter was sent to me about three weeks ago to come as a witness; I left the letter at Guildhall - I did not ask the prisoner where he lived; the Magistrate told me I need not attend any more, but the prisoner's master came and begged me to attend here - I have several houses; I did not see the name of Hannell on the note.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What colour was the horse? Q. Grey - I sometimes have occasion for two horses, and thought as Spring was coming I should want one.</p>

                  </hi>. My mother keeps a fishing-tackle shop in Bell-yard, Temple-bar—she is married to Robert Joy—I conduct the business for her. On the evening of the 8th of June I was up stairs, and heard the shop-door open—I went down immediately, and found the door open, and saw the two prisoners outside—Joseph had his foot on the step—he asked me if I was in want of any bait—I said "No"—they both went away—I missed a winch, a line, and a hank of gut from the counter, which were safe about five minutes before—this is the line—it is my mother's—it was on the counter—I went I with the officer to Fetter-lane, and aaw both the prisoners—one of them went into a shop, the other remained outside—I was about fifteen yards off—Ralph saw me—he came out and went away—I can swear to their persons.</p>

I was called by Mr. Wright, and went in search of the prisoners, and saw them together in Fetter-lane—Ralph went into a shop, and Joseph staid outside—Ralph came out again, and Joseph crossed to another shop—Ralph turned his head and saw us, and ran off—I immediately took Joseph, and found this line on him—I took Ralph the following night, but found nothing on him—Joseph said, "D—n the line, I wish I had never seen it."</p>

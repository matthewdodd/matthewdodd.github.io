                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Fitch, of Wellington-street. On the 31st of July, about eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner brought these two chairs, and said, "Will you be so kind as to take these? I will call for them to-morrow morning;" and, knowing her, I took them in—I have known her seventeen or eighteen years—she had a good character—my house in not two miles from Potters's</p>

               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">HARVEY</hi> I am a bricklayer, and live in Phillip-street, near the prosecutor. I know that he and the prisoner were living together—I wrote a note at his desire, for her to come to take care of his two children—I know that they have not had a bit of bread for a day together—the prose<lb></lb>cutor has told me so himself, and he has ordered her to pawn every thing, till there was nothing left in the house—he was about taking his wife up—the prisoner came to me and said, that she had seen Potter, and he had told her to take a house, and he would get away his things and come to her, and leave his wife—I have lent the prisoner money to support her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. James William Benson, a jeweller in Cornhill. On the 10th December, between 3 and 4 o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the shop—he asked me to show him some scarf pins—I closed the shop door, and produced from the window some pins on a tray—I put them on the counter—I turned to close the window, and when I turned round again the prisoner had two pins in his fingers, and three pins were on the counter off the tray—there were no pins lying on the counter before—the prisoner asked the price of several of the pins, and having done that he produced from his pocket a common seal stamp, something like brass; it had a sort of ivory handle—he asked me what I could make him three like that for, with three letters on each—I told him the price—he said he thought it was rather high—I said probably I might be able to do them for a little less—he said, "However, what is the price of this pin?" pointing to one in the tray—I told him, and he said it was a light common pin—after that he picked up one of those he had had in his fingers previously, and said it was the prettiest one of all—he asked the price, and I told him 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said it was rather more than he thought of going to, and he asked if I had one with red stones in it instead of blue ones—I told him "No," and I then offered to take 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for that one he had—he said, "I am rather short of cash, I will call to-morrow and buy the pin"—I missed one of the pins off the counter—I stepped round to the front of the counter, and looked on the counter and on the floor to see if the pin might have dropped—I then said, "I miss a pin"—the prisoner said, "I have not got it"—he threw off his coat and asked me to search him, and he asked me to send for a policeman and have him searched—I said I should do so, and I said I must have the pin found before he left the shop—I knocked on the floor for assistance; and as the man was coming up from the back of the shop the prisoner, who had got one hand against the wrist of his other hand, made a motion of his hand towards the counter, and the pin fell on the counter—I did not see the pin in his hand, but I distinctly saw it fall on the counter from the direction of his hand—I said, "You thief," and I told the man to fetch a policeman; and as he was passing through the door the prisoner said, "Pray let me go, consider my character, I will give you half a sovereign to let me go"—the policeman came, and I gave him into custody—I gave the policeman the pin off the counter—the prisoner's coat was then on the chair; it was a body coat—the pin that I heard drop was not on the counter at all when the prisoner took off his coat—he took off his coat after I said I missed the pin—it was worth 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was a stranger to me.</p>

               <p>first instance take a seal out of his pocket and ask about engraving silver seals; he first spoke about the pin—he had been talking about the pin two or three minutes before he took out the seal—he did not go out and come back again—he did not leave the shop at all till he was given in custody—when I missed the pin he said, "I have not got it"—he threw off his coat, and challenged me to search him on the spot—he said, "Consider my character"—he said in the presence of the policeman that he did not care, he had a good character—I don't recollect his saying in the shop, "I can soon prove my innocence, I am a man of respectable character"—he said it at the station, and he said he was in a most respectable occupation—I went twice to the station—I gave him in custody to Inspector Martin, and I gave him a statement of what took place in the shop—I went in the evening again and saw Mr. Martin—I asked if he had found out that the father of this young man was a man of respectable character—I did not say I was very sorry that I had given him in custody; I said I was very sorry that a young man of such respectability had committed himself—I gave the officer in the morning a description of the tray, and the position of the pins that were taken out of the tray—I told him in the evening that I heard the pin drop on the counter, and I told him so in the morning—I did not say, from his hand; I said it fell on the counter—I said in the morning that I heard it fall—I did not simply say that I saw it on the counter; I saw it pass from his hand.</p>

I was called to Mr. Benson's shop on Friday, 10th December, about 3 o'clock—I found the prisoner there in the act of putting his coat on; he was given in custody by the last witness for stealing a pin—Mr. Robertson gave me this pin—the prisoner said, "For God's sake don't, on account of my character," but Mr. Robertson pressed the charge—the prisoner put on his coat and said, "Never mind, I have a good character"—I took him to the station, and found on him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and this seal, he gave his name correctly—this is the pin.</p>

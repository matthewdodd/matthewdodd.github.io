               <p>I was going up Holborn on Tuesday, the night before last, the 18th, the prisoner asked me to give her a glass of gin, it was near Dean-street; I did, there was another young woman with her, we went to the public-house at the corner, I had never seen them before; then they induced me to go home with them, we went home then to <placeName id="t17890225-23-crimeloc113">Cross-street, Newtoners-lane</placeName>

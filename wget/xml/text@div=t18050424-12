             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You, I believe, are a city constable? - A. Yes: On the evening of the 15th of March, about ten minutes before nine, I met the prisoner going up Fish-street-hill; he was coming away from Thames-street, with a cheese under his right arm, supported by his smock frock; I tapped him on his shoulder, and said, my friend, what have you there; he looked at me, and seemed a little struck at first; he said he had a Cheshire cheese; I told him I saw it was a Cheshire cheese; I said, you must excuse me asking and stopping you, but I must know how you came by it; he said he was going up Fish-street-hill with it, he did not know where he was taking it to, but a man gave it him to carry; I asked him if he should know the man again; I said you must find the man that gave it you, or I shall not let you go, nor the cheese; he said he could find him; he then took me to Mr. Smith's, the prosecutor's shop, and either he or I knocked at the door and went into the house; there was nobody at home but the servant maid; I went then with the prisoner to his master, an orange-merchant just by.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you that was his master? - A. Yes. In about five or six minutes I went again to Mr. Smith's, Gardner was at home, and Mr. Smith had just come in, he immediately saw Gardner, and I said, where is the man that gave you the Cheshire cheese; he said, here, that is the man that gave me the cheese? he saw him sooner than I did; Gardner was then coming down the stairs; I said, Gardner, was it you that gave this man the cheese; yes, he replied, I sold it to him for eight-pence a pound; Mr. Smith said what did the cheese weigh; I asked him that too; he said, 28 lb. Mr. Smith said, are you sure of it, he said, I am sure of it, Mr. Smith then asked him how he came to sell it; he looked round, and said, because he was a fool; I then took him into custody. I have had the cheese ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Then immediately when you went back to Gardner, and you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240014"></xptr>asked where was the man that sold the cheese, there was no hesitation that he had sold it to the other prisoner? - A. He said he had sold it, and for eightpence a pound.</p>

               <p>Q. At what time do you shut up the warehouse where you keep the cheese? - A. At eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any person after you had locked it up, get at any cheese? - A. No, I had a partition erected for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the constable bringing any person to your house? - A. My father sent for me, I was at my house; I know no farther of my own knowledge; then the prisoner Gardner said, when I came to the warehouse, will you take the money, sir; I refused.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the cheese to be your property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no mark on it; what is the value of it? - A. About eightpence a pound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Then eight-pence would be the regular price that you would sell it for? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Gardner was the person who regularly served as porter? - A. He has sold cheese; he had no right to sell any thing of that kind at that time of the night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Is there any entry in your book of any cheese sold that day? - A. No; there was a cheese on that day sent to the Lord Mayor; that was thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You have said, that he has sold cheese during the time of business, and he has accounted for it to you? - A. Yes, he always was to leave the money to another to take; he had no authority to put it in the till; when I came in and he was in custody, he offered me the money but I would not take it then; he had no right to sell at that time.</p>
               <p>Gardner's defence. On the 15th of March, about half past eight o'clock at night, Rawlins called at my master's warehouse, and said he wanted to buy a cheese, and there being two cheeses left under the counter, where the cheese stands in the day for sale, I weighed him one, which weighed thirty pounds; after I had weighed it, he said he had not got the money he would call the day following; I knowing the man, and where he worked, let him have it; I was not afraid of the money; I have been used to sell cheese, and firkins of butter, and sides of bacon, upwards of seven years, for Mr. Smith, and never had any fault found; if he was out of the way, I gave him an account of it when he came in, and if it was not paid for, he book'd it, or otherwise I gave him the money; it was not a customary thing to sell cheese so late at night as that, but sometimes I have sold cheese later than that by half an hour, when customers have called in, and never had any fault found about it.</p>
               <p>Gardner called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Rawlins did not say any thing in his defence, not called any witness to character.</p>

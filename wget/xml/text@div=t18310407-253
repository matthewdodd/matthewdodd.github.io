On the 7th of March the prisoner brought this paper to my master's:-</p>

               <p>MR. CUTTER. - If you have got seven yards in one piece of the same kind you sent on Saturday, but not to be entered to Mr. Wyat's account, I will pay for it on Wednesday, and about three skeins of silk to match it, tow sheets of wadding, and three yards of black ribbon half an inch in width; and if you can send the bill to-day, as we want to pay our quarter's bills.</p>
               <p>March 7,1831. Miss BREWER.</p>
               <p>In consequence of this I gave the prisoner the goods as near the order as possible - I had not seven yards of silk, so I sent a remnant of ten yards and a half; I had sent two yards and a half of black silk, and three-quarters of a yard of crimson on the Saturday - the ten and a half I sent was black, as that is a more general article; I also sent four skeins of sewing silk, and I think two sheets of wadding and three yards of black ribbon, half an inch wide, as ordered; I did that, believing the signature to be genuine, and the hand-writing of the lady who was governess in Mr. Wyat's family - I have many times before acted upon a written order from that lady; Mr. Wyat soner is the person who had the things.</p>

            . I am governess at Mr Wyat's, at Dudley-grove, Paddington. No part of this note is my writing, nor was it written by my authority - the prisoner was servant to Mr. Wyat, and I think was discharged about a month or six weeks ago; He had been there nine or ten months - Mr.Wyat is a sculptor, and the prisoner was his errand-boy; I believe he bore an honest character - he was discharged before the day in question.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. What time was the order produced? A. About half - past nine or ten o'clock on Monday morning; Miss Brewer did not keep a separate account - it was entered to Mr, Wyat, as he discharged any thing that Miss Brewer had.</p>

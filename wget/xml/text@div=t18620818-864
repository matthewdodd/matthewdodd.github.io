I keep the Town of Ramsgate public-house, 280, High-street, Wapping—on the 17th I went to bed, having closed my house in the usual way—this box is mine—it was on the shelf in the bar-parlour on that night—I cannot say exactly the sum of money that was in it, but it was all in threepenny-pieces, of which there was a great quantity—it might have been as much as 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had some old copper money in a cupboard under the counter, and in the morning I missed it—I could not swear to it—all that is produced is old—I was collecting the old separately—I am positive that some one got in from the cellar flap—it was shut down the night before in the usual manner—I cannot swear that it was bolted, but I think it was—in the morning I found the tools down in the cellar—they must have got in and out that way; there is no other way by which they could have got in—I am positive it was closed.</p>

She said she was very wet, and asked me to treat her with liquor; we went into a public house in Greenhill's-rents, and I paid for some liquor, and came out, as I was in a hurry to go to market.

I said she should not - she pushed in, and I pushed her out - this money was in a canvass purse, in my waistcoat pocket, and I suppose at this time she took it; I shut her out, and in two minutes missed my keys - I ran down stairs, and found her still outside the door. I charged her with having my keys; she said she had not, and wanted to come in again. I pulled the keys out of her breast: I then felt and missed my money. The watchman took her into a back room, and produced my half crowns.</p>

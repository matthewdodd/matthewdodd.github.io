                  </hi>. I live in Peel-street, Kensington. On the 6th of August I was in High-street, Kensington, with some oysters, in a cart drawn by an ass—I saw the prisoner's husband at the corner of Church-street—my donkey was in High-street, near the corner of Church-street, and I was serving Mr. Humbertson with some oysters-when I drew the cart up to his door, the prisoner's husband brought two bushel baskets, and placed them against the wheel of my cart-when I had served the oysters, I asked him to remove them—he did not do so-a second person then came to the cart for oysters, and in going round the tail of the cart to serve them, her husband hit my donkey, and put him into the middle of the street—(I did not see the prisoner at this time)—I went to him, and asked what he was doing—he said, "Let my donkey alone, if you are drunk, I am sober"-with that he up with his fist, and hit me on the side of the head—I collared him, and threw him into the kennel on his back-not with force—I was holding</p>

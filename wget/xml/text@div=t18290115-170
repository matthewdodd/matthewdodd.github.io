               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You were on very bad terms with these men? A. No; I had not had a quarrel with Harber on the Saturday - he had, at various times, demanded money of me; I usually carried a brace of pistols with me, as I went up the green lanes - one Saturday night, five or six weeks before, the men were all drunk, and were very uproarious; Harber insisted upon having money I was certain he had not earned - he brought a mob of labourers, and swore he would not leave without money; I had a pistol, and I took it from under the cushion, and said, "If any man attempts to break the peace, it will be at his peril;" Harber, and about a dozen others, were in the room at the time, but that was all settled, and, I think, a week afterwards, he came to me and affected to be sorry for it; I did not consider myself in safety among them - I was not only in danger of my life, but my work was neglected; I said, "I think you are a good workman - I think the only apology that can be made, is, that you were drunk; I shall take no further notice of it, if you will go on with your work," and he went on; he left me on Saturday, the 13th of December - on the Friday afternoon, I said,"Harber, you will let me know at what price you will take the next adjoining house," and he said he would; I said, "I would rather let you do the whole house at a price, than at measuring value," and the next day I brought another plasterer on the ground; Harber took offence, and told my foreman he would work no longer, as another plasterer was brought on the ground - he received what money was appropriated for him, on the Saturday, and left; I saw no more of him till the Tuesday, when he and Lee came and insisted upon taking away some articles - I said I insisted upon nothing being removed; I happened to be in one of the buildings, and I saw Lee taking something - I gave him notice that I would have him taken as a common felon; he came again, and gave me some abusive language - Harber has no claim on me.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Whose materials were the houses built with? A. Mine; I paid him so much per yard - the plaster of Paris was taken from the casting-room.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You were building these houses, and found all the materials? A. Yes - the prisoners had nothing to do with the materials, but to use them; I never authorized them to carry any to their own houses.</p>

            . I was employed by Mr. Laing, to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150074"></xptr>make plaster; the prisoners worked on the premises; I saw Skinner there - I saw Harber and Lee in the casting-room; there was a little green box, with about three pecks of plaster of Paris in it, which the prisoners carried away - they went across the common, towards their house; they live together, down Hill-street - this was about five weeks ago to-morrow</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What day was this? A. On Thursday, about eight o'clock in the evening; some of us worked quite late that night - my brother Robert was with me, no one else; I asked Harber where he was going to take it - he said down to the cottages; I watched him, but he did not take it to the cottages - Mr. Laing's houses are in the road, but he went past the cottages - I followed him to the first of the cottages; I do not know that he could see that I was following him; it was eight o'clock in the evening - I did not see him go to his own house; I saw the box again in the casting-room - that was three or four days before he left the prosecutor's employ; I did not tell anybody of this, till he had left Mr. Laing - I heard him say he would have nothing more to do with Mr. Laing; when Mr. Laing asked me, I told him - he asked me whether I had seen the prisoner take any plaster away; he said he would pay me for the day's work that I had lost - he did not say, "I will give you a shilling or two;" I have not told anybody that Mr. Laing promised to give me some money; he did not say any thing about a prison to me - it was a week, all but one day, after I saw it, before I mentioned it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Mr. Laing directly or indirectly offer you any thing to tell him? A. No; I did not tell this before the prisoners were taken, because I thought they would hit me.</p>
               <p>MR. LAING. The value of a bushel of plaster of Paris is about 7s.; I never offered any bribe to Mead to tell me any thing about this, but I said I would pay him his day's work if he lost any time in my employ - he has been working two years on my premises, and has been regularly paid.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not Harber under contract to work for nobody but you? A. That was the impression, but there was no contract.</p>
               <p>HARBER'S Defence. I never took any thing but to use in his employ; we did work at several different places on the premises.</p>

            . I am a surveyor, and was employed by Mr. Laing during the time Harber worked there; it was part of an understanding that Harber was to work for no one but Mr. Laing - there is an agreement to that effect; I wrote it out myself, at Mr. Laing's desire, in Mr. Laing's own agreement-book; Harber was to do the plaster work - I am not aware that it was immediately necessary for him to work at home; he brought originals of particular patterns from his own house, and if I had given him directions to put up a particular enrichment, it might have been necessary for him to have taken plaster to produce it: all the enrichments, with the exception of four, were furnished by him; Mr. Laing agreed to furnish all the materials, and it might have been necessary to take some home - as Mr. Laing's agent I should not have objected to it. During October and November there was work done off the premises, and I gave Harber orders to take materials for a particular job; I was not on the premises in December - I left about the 24th of November.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever give Harber orders when he was taking it to his own house, to say he was taking it to the cottages? A. No.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. LAING. Q. Have you not reason to suppose that upon some occasions this man took the plaster home, to make ornaments to show? A. I never had reason to suspect any such thing.</p>

            . I live in Islington-terrace, and am a plasterer. I have known Harber eight or ten years - I have worked several times with him; when we want to do cast-work we generally take plaster home, and do it at home; I allow my men to do it - it is the general understanding of the trade.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.How came you to add this? A. Because I understand he is taken up for stealing a bushel of plaster.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you expect your men to tell you when they take it home? A. Oh Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. But if the person who has the charge of the plaster knows it, is that enough? A. Yes- my labourers often give it to the men.</p>

            . I have known Harber seven years; I have suffered plasterers to take plaster home, or to do it in building - it is the custom when men do not find the materials, to have it home, and sometimes they come to the shed and ask for plaster; they do not ask the master for it - it is necessary, in order to expedite business, that a person should do casting at home.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. That is done openly, and the master knows of it? A. Not at all times; when the permission is once granted for a man to do cast-work at home. he comes and has it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What are you? A. A master plasterer: if I am working at a building, and want my men to do work at home, they are allowed to take it home, if they come to the shed for it - this applies only in cases where the men are doing work, labour; suppose I do work for a person who finds his own materials, then it is sometimes taken home.</p>

            . I have known Harber nearly ten years; he has done five houses for me - I found every material; I should conceive it necessary in doing ornamental work, for some casts to be made at home, supposing the plasterers to work late at night, and want the ornaments in the morning.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If a man were taking some plaster to his own house, he would have no hesitation in saying so? A.Certainly not, but I should think he was bound to bring it back.</p>

            . I am a plasterer, and live in Cromer-street. I have known Harber nearly seven years. If a master finds materials, and employs plasterers, it is very general for them to take a little home - if a man does the labour only, he is entrusted to take these things at times, when he thinks he wants them, and it would take half his time to go backwards and forwards to ask the master.</p>

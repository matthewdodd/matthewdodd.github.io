On the 14th of October I missed the articles stated in the indictment. I had been ill, and the prisoner nursed me; I asked her if she had seen some spoons? she said, yes; I asked her where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140031"></xptr>they were? she made no answer; at last she said she had made free with them; but if I said nothing she would get them again. I asked her if she had pledged them? she said yes - I then asked her about the shirts; she began crying, and said she would go and drown herself; she went out, and returned in an hour. I insisted on having the duplicates; she took a thread-case out of her pocket - I took it from her, and found thirty-five duplicates in it; she said five guineas would get them all again. I told her she was an ungrateful woman; she said she was guilty, and that I might hang or transport her, whichever I liked. After that she gave me six more duplicates.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. She had been with me ever since the year 1816. She might have taken them at separate times.</p>

               <p>HENRY PEACHEY. I am a pawnbroker. The prisoner pledged eighteen of the articles with me. The largest sum advanced on one article is 6s.</p>

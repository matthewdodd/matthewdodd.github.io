                  </hi>. I live in Princes-street, Whitcomb-street—I was in com<lb></lb>pany with the deceased on the evening of 2d October in the taproom of the Hand-in-Raquet, from about 8 o'clock till half-past 11—between half-past 9 and a quarter to 10, he and the deceased were playing at a game called <hi rend="italic">cottam</hi>—a piece of bread was thrown at the deceased by somebody—he said the</p>

               <p>first one that threw it he would have a row with them—Perkins could not have thrown it, from the position he was in—after that they continued to play for about a quarter of an hour; at the end of that time there was a few words between them—the deceased said, "If you come outside I will accom<lb></lb>modate you"—they went out, and went up Orange-street with several others, and they had three or four rounds—the deceased fell about twice—he fell forwards; I did not see him fall back—this continued about seven or eight minutes—a young man named Broom picked up the deceased and took him away, saying he would not let him have any more of it—they all returned to the Hand-in-Raquet, and the deceased and the prisoner again played together at <hi rend="italic">cottam</hi>—I remained there until the house was closed—during that time the deceased went about his usual business; he put up the shutters—I did not hear him complain of being injured—he was pot-boy at the house—he was very good friends with the prisoner afterwards, and they shook hands—after he had been out he came back with a bit of plaster on his left eye; that had not been there when he went out—he was pretty free as to drink—when they went out to fight they were both very nigh intoxi<lb></lb>cated—the road on which this took place was a macadamised road, but all level—the rounds took place in the middle of the road.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Cartwright-street, Westminster—I was at the Hand-in-Raquet on 2d October—there was a little quarrel between the prisoner and deceased—the deceased said if he would come outside he would accommodate him—they did not go out directly; they played at <hi rend="italic">cottam</hi> in the meantime—they had three rounds in the road—I saw the prisoner strike at the deceased; whether he struck him or no I could not say—I saw them close at the last round, and the deceased fell in front on his head or face—they afterwards returned to the house—I remained there till it closed—the prisoner came in with a little <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> of plaster over his eye; and he said that was all that was the matter with him—I believe he did his work as usual till the house was shut up, about half-past 11.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon in Jermyn-street—on Saturday morning, 3d October, about thirty-five minutes past 9, I was called to the Hand-in—Raquet, and saw the deceased in his room—he was lying on his back on his left side, partly undressed—he had then been dead about four or five hours—he had vomited, and he had also been purged—I made a post-mortem ex<lb></lb>amination on 6th October—there was a slight contusion over the left eye<lb></lb>brow, with a small piece of plaster—the under lining of the scalp was very much congested with blood, and thickened posteriorly, as though from a fall—the dura mater on the left side was distended in front with a large mass of dark coagulated blood, weighing about four ounces—the vessels of the brain generally were very much congested—the brain substance itself was healthy—the cause of death was the extravasation of blood on the brain, from a rupture of one of the veins of the anterior portion of the membrane—that would probably result from some act of violence; that corresponded to the injury over the loft eye-brow: a fall or blow would be likely to cause that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186310260047"></xptr>
               <p>—if the man was of intemperate habits, and in a state of intoxication at the time, that would considerably facilitate such a result.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> From the appearance of the brain when blood is ex<lb></lb>travasated is it not very difficult to ascertain whether an injury is caused by a blow or a fall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is; either might cause it, or it might result from a combination of both—the deceased was about twenty-five or twenty<lb></lb>six—I heard when I reached the house that he had been fighting, and that they found him dead in bed—my assistant was with me at the post-mortem examination—I made notes—I have not looked at them since—the heart was rather softer than it ought to have been—the liver was healthy, and also the stomach, but quite empty—I could not draw any conclusion as to his habits from the appearance of the stomach—the organic structures were exceedingly healthy—the wound on the forehead was about half an inch in length—it was a contused abraded wound, very superficial looking—I do not regard the wound as the cause of death, but the shock received in the blow or fall ruptured the veins—I have heard the evidence—I do not think death could have arisen from apoplexy, in one so young—extravasation of blood on the brain may be caused by vomiting alone—stupor, always accompanies effusion; in this case it must have been gradual—the probability is, that his intemperate habits brought on chronic congestion of the brain, and then, after the fall which caused the injury, the excitement, and probably the act of going up stairs might have in<lb></lb>creased the escape of blood, and he was seized with a sudden kind of stupor; nausea and vomiting supervened; and then, in all probability, he fell bock in a fit as he was undressing.</p>

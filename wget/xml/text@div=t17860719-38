             Ridley, a gentleman who lives near Newcastle town; and, says he, he keeps a stock of good wine, he has wine twelve years old, and says he, you will often crack a bottle with him, he is a hearty generous fellow; and he said he should often come and visit him, and he said I shall bring him to-morrow about this time, when he said that, I looked up to my watch, which was at the side of the chimneypiece, to see what o'clock it was, and it wanted a quarter to twelve; he said Mr. Ridley will want the use of your front parlour an hour or two in the day, and he said let you and me step and look at it, and we went and looked at it, and left the other man in the room, we did not stay a minute, and as we were returning, his friend was coming out, and the prisoner said to his friend, I think we should go, and the other said yes, we will go and call to-morrow, so we went to the street door, and he held out his hand to shake hands with me; I live No. 4, Bentick-street, Soho; I came in immediately, and went into my study, and sat down, and just looking up to see what it was o'clock, there was no watch, the watch was gone, I was quite surprised, I felt in my pocket, and I immediately recollected</p>
               <p>"God that scoundrel has got my watch," then I put my hat on, and went into the street in search of these fellows, but I could not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190069"></xptr> find them; I never got my watch again; I immediately went down to Bow-street and gave information of the persons, and advertised it with a guinea and a half reward; on Thursday, July the 13th, I saw the prisoner,; I am sure it is the very same man; there was nothing found upon him of mine; on Thursday afternoon about six o'clock I was going down to Grea Russel-street, I met the prisoner and another person near the Museum, I passed them, and just as I passed them,</p>
               <p>"Good God, says I, that is on of the villains that stole my watch," I followed them, and looked him full in the face, and I said, How do you do Sir? he made no answer, but looked at me; Well, says I, you never called to see my lodgings again according to your promise; says he, your lodgings, your lodging! Sir; yes, Sir, says I, my lodging; pray Sir, says he, where do you live? says I in Bentick-street, Berwick-street, Soho; Bentick-street, Berwick-street, Soho! says he; and after a little while, says he, oh, now I recollect, now I recollect; says I, what was the reason you did not call? says he I acquainted my friend about it, and he did not think it would suit him, so I did not think it of any matter to call; says I, do you know that the person that was with you took my watch? your watch! your watch! Sir, says he, I will take my oath of it, where is he, oh, he knew very well, says he, I will tell you what, friend, if you will call upon me to-morrow morning, I will give you a direction where you may call; so he gave me a direction, I told him I insisted on having him before a magistrate immediately; says he, mind what you say, Sir, says he, I am a gentleman, and I am a house-keeper below the Museum; well, says I, I am going to Bloomsbury-square, and will walk with you, and take your adress, I proposed to go to a public house, he agreed to that, and we went into a house, and they went into a back room, and rung the bell, and called the landlord, he ordered three-pennyworth of crank, and smiled, and seemed quite good natured, thinking to come over me, but I insisted on having him before a magistrate; by and by he opened the door and went into the passage, I followed him, he turned to the window at the bar, that opens into the passage, and paid for his crank, he then turned and saw me, I followed him, and he went into the back parlour and sell for the lock, then he came up to me and said, what do you mean by this you scoundrel, why do you follow me; I was in great danger, I called in the landlord, and desired him to send for a constable; he refused, and he said he knew the gentleman, he believed he lived somewhere near the Museum; I desired he would send for a constable; by and by the prisoner opened the door and run out, and run away, I followed, and the friend that was with him caught hold of my arm, I gave myself a throw, and gave the other a blow on the breast, I ran after the prisoner, and called stop thief, and in St. Giles's somebody took him, at last I got him down to Bow-street with great difficulty.</p>

               <p>I failed from the river Thames; the ship was taken away by the prisoners, and run into Dungenness; we were all ordered to go on shore, me and four or five more remained in the hold; I went over with the ship; she had a very bad passage; we were taken into a port in Maryland; the evening after we came in we were froze; the captain asked me, if I wished to be an indented servant, he said, he would write out our indentures, and the people would come on board and purchase us; he begged us to tell nobody, as there were about forty that were disposed of to the town of Baltimore; and some of them made a noise, calling them thieves; the inhabitants then began to find it out that they were convicts, they would not admit any to come on shore, nor go to purchase them; the inhabitants then discharged those that they had, and sent them into the woods; I was five weeks on board myself, when they found the vessel was obliged to go to another place, a merchant came on board, and took me to his own house; he asked ninety guineas for me, for three years, and the people thought it was too much; I was a fortnight at his own house, he got me a master who was a quaker, five miles from thence; after he found I was a convict he would not let me stay, he took me down to the place called the Notletts, and put me on board a ship, and he gave twelve dollars for my passage home; I told the captain I should be very happy to stay, he gave me leave to quit the ship, says he, do not let me see you leave it: I travelled night and day for three days, for fear I should meet with somebody to interrupt me and take me, I went to Petersburgh in Virginia, I got work there, this gentleman who purchased me, he was acquainted with this person that I worked for, whose name is Taylor; they happened to be coming through the country, they called there and saw me; the moment he had done so, he insisted on my going with him, that I was his servant; he said, he would send me home; he took me from Petersburgh, and put me on board a collier, and sent me home; I was obliged to come home; I brought some letters for a merchant.</p>
               <p>Court. They did not force you on board? - He said, I was his servant, as he had indented me for sixty guineas; my master put me on board the vessel first, but the captain gave me liberty to leave it; I was exceedingly well satisfied; my master when he called at Petersburgh he brought me and put me on board a vessel, a collier which came from Leeds, at least she went from there to Leeds, and he agreed with the captain to bring me over, the captain of the ship brought me over, when he found I was a convict, he would not let me be about his house.</p>
               <p>Have you any body to prove the truth of all this? - No, my Lord.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. Prisoner, having once received his Majesty's mercy, and having not only abused it by breaking the condition of that pardon and returning, but also having committed another felony since your pardon, I think it right to tell you, that under these circumstances you will do well to entertain but very little hopes of having the King's mercy a second time.</p>

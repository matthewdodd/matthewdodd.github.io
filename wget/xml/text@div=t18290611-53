On the 16th of May the prisoner came into the shop, about five o'clock in the afternoon. and asked for a seal, about 28s.; I showed him a great many - he was alone; after looking at them he said he wanted one that was engraved - I told him I would get him one engraved, as I had none; he said he lived at Hampstead, and that his father was a hay-salesman, and he might not be in town for six months again - I said I was in the habit of riding through Hampstead every morning on coming to town, and I would get him one engraved, and leave it at his father's; he said nothing to that - I turned round, leaving the tray on the counter, and went to get another tray, and showed him more seals, none would suit, and he was going out, but my young man came round and accused him of taking one seal - he said he had got no seal, and appeared much hurt at the accusation, and said he should bring his father to clear his character; I said if he was an innocent lad he could not object to empty his pockets, and that he might have taken one by mistake - he objected to that; I said I should insist on it, if he did not do it quietly - he then took out both his pockets in a very singular way; I said I should come round and convince myself - I came round, felt his pockets, outside, and felt the seal, took it out of his pocket, and gave him in charge; it is gold, and worth 2l.</p>

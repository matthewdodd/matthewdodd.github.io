I am in the service of my aunt, Mrs. Gold, a laundress, at Notting-hill—on 16th December I was with Mr. Grace, in his cart; going up Little Moorfields I felt the cart go back—I looked behind and saw the prisoner at the back of the cart—he had got his hands on the bundle, and when he saw us looking at him he let it go back again—it contained some sheets and other articles—they had been delivered by me to Mr. Grace to carry.</p>

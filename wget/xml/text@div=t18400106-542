                  </hi>I live in Alfred-place, Waterloo-road, Lam<lb></lb>beth; my wife is a milliner and dress-maker. I wanted a servant, and put a notice in the window—the prisoner Morgan came and said she had a niece coming from Monmouthshire—she wished her to come to me, and if I would take her she would write for her to come—she spoke of a Mr. Berry man, a builder, in Vine-street, who knew her, and she said if her niece did not come, she herself would come on the Christmas-day, as I was about having my family to see me—on Tuesday evening, the 24th of De<lb></lb>cember, Morgan came, and continued in my service till I gave her in charge on the 27th—when she had got drunk, and put my house into confusion,—my wife was about discharging her, when a shift dropped from her per<lb></lb>son, but I was not present—Perry came on the morning of the 28th—I had given my son directions to detain her—he bolted and locked the door, and called me—I came down, and asked what she wanted—she said she wanted to see Miss Elizabeth Morgan—I accused her of having been at my house on the morning before, and purloining things—she said she had not, but she had come about a letter—I got a policeman, and went to No. 7, Peter's-lane, Cow-cross—we there found a person who said he was Perry's husband—I found there this tea-pot, my son's cap, and the other articles stated in the indictment, which I can swear to.</p>

Gapper" on it, in my father's writing—the next morning I answered the door, and Perry came in, and asked for Miss Morgan—I said, "Will you walk in, I will go and tell her"—I bolted the door, then went and told my father—he came down, and asked whether she was any relation to Morgan—she said no at first, and then she said she was her sister—she was then given in charge.</p>

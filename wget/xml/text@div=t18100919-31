He kept me off with one hand; and put his other hand behind him, he gave the pocket-book, notes and all, to the woman. He took hold of my jacket and tore it, here is the tear now. I held him until the watchman came up, and gave him in charge of the watchman. I never parted with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say any thing to you - A. Not a word. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Where did you come from - A. I came from Ireland.</p>
               <p>Q. So you had twenty-one pounds of the produce of a former voyage - A. Yes, it was money that I left in England when I went abroad. I left twenty-four pounds, and I got twenty-two pounds of it when I came back, I got it from my sister, she lives in Wright's-buildings, Chick-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always told the same story of it being twenty-four pounds that you left behind you - A. It was twenty-two younds that I got from my sister, I left twenty-four.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not at other times said it was twenty-eight - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you, to this gentleman, when he served you with notice of trial within these two days, say it was twenty-eight - A. I did not; he came to me in the street, I said twenty-four, unless he took it in a mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came on shore on the 19th, from two o'clock till near twelve o'clock at night, when you arrived at Aldgate, had not you spent your time in the alehouses - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you charged this man with having picked your pocket, How many alehouses had you been at - A. Three, as much as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not swear it was not five - A. No; I had spent twelve shillings; I was not drunk, you may depend upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. I cannot depend upon any such thing, you having spent twelve shillings in drink, and then you charged this man with having picked your pocket - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You went the next day before the Lord Mayor, and the Lord Mayor, after hearing your tale, let the man go upon bail - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After he was admitted to bail, did not you go to the prisoner's house, and the watchman with you, and desire him to give you money to make it up - A. I went to a public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that - A. God in heaven knows; I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to that public house did not you go to the prisoner's house, see the wife, and inquire for the prisoner - A. I went with another man, not the watchman, the watchman met us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go to the prisoner's house - A.I did not, I come past it, the watchman said, that is the house where the man that robbed you lodges; he went up to the door, and knocked at the door, he asked if the man was at home. She said, no. He took me into a public house and called for a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. When he asked if the man was at home and she said, he was not, did not he ask where he was to be found - A. I did not hear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she, in answer to his inquiry, tell him that he would be likely to be found at a neighbouring public house - A. I cannot tell; we went to a public house at the bottom of the street, had a pot of beer, I paid for it.</p>
               <p>Court. You are asked the question, whether, after having knocked at the door and asked if the man was at home, did not you hear the person of the house tell him where he was to be found - A. No, not a word.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Before you quitted his house did not the watchman lift up the stick over the woman's head and tell her it would be worse for her husband if it was not settled - A. I will swear that was never in my eyesight.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, did not this man come to the public house and ask the watchman how he dared behave to his wife so, and that he would never settle any such thing - A. I will tell the truth; he never spoke a word to the watchman or me either.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 19th of June, Mackgowen called me, a little before twelve at night; he said, watchman, I have been robbed, this is the man that robbed me. He had hold of him; I took him by the collar and led him to the watch-house, and from there to the Compter. The prisoner said he was not guilty; the other said he never loosed him after he took the money from his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other person about there; any woman - A. No, not that I saw. The prosecutor said there were two women behind the prisoner that took it from his hands.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. He told you where he lived - A. Yes; he told the constable of the night, and desired to send home to his friends.</p>
               <p>Q. You went before the Lord Mayor, and the Lord Mayor bailed this man - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A day or two afterwards did you go to the prisoner's house - A. I might be happening to go through Mark-lane; I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever happen to walk with the prosecutor in Mark-lane - A. I did not walk with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it is quite impossible that you could have called at the prisoner's house - A. I am sure I am not certain; I do not recollect that I saw the prisoner afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. No, no, one thing at a time; we will come to that afterwards. Now do not recollect calling at the prisoner's house at all - A. I do not; it has quite slipped my memory, if I did, I never knocked at the prisoner's door.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you never knocked at the prisoner's door and saw his wife - A. I will not swear it; I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner in a public house in Mark-lane - A. I do; Mackgowen was in my company then.</p>
               <p>Q. Now only half an hour before you went to that public house, had not you called at his house and spoken to his wife - A. I might do it, I really have forgot it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him there, upon your oath did not he reprobate you for going to his house and ill-treating his wife - A. He spoke to me but one or two words, and that was an unbecoming word; I do not recollect it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190018"></xptr>Prisoner's Defence. On the evening of the 19th of June, I went out to meet a friend who owes me some money; I spent the evening at a friend's house; being disappointed of getting the money of my friend, who is here present, I staid with him till about a quarter past eleven o'clock; then I left his house and walked fast home, because I was later than usual. On my coming by Aldgate, seeing this man placed against a post, he asked me the way to Snowhill; I immediately told him. He said, d - n my eyes, what is the use for me to go to Snowhill? I have got no money. I went on about eighty yards, then this villain came and took hold of me, and swore I had robbed him. I believe it is a combination of the watchman and him to make money of me.</p>
               <p>THOMAS LEWIS. Q. Are you a porter - A. Yes, a fellowship porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, in the month of June last, being at a public house called the White Hart - A. Yes, it was after Mr. French was taken up; I saw Ing, the watchman, there, and Mackgowen; the prisoner came into the house. Mr. Russell was in conversation with the watchman when I went into the room; I heard Russell say, you mean to make a property of that man; the watchman said, we will, or it shall cost him his life.</p>

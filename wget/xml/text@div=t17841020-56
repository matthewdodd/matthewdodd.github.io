               <p>Last Monday was a week, I was washing in the back kitchen, and had my yard full of wet linen to dry; I thought I saw the shade of a man's arm in the yard, and I ran up and missed my handkerchief, I turned my head, and the prisoner had the handkerchief in his hand, and I saw him put it into his bosom, I said, you villain, that is my handkerchief; he held up his arm, he was in liquor, I thought he was going to strike me, I cried out, and a man came to my assistance; the prisoner said, my handkerchief was on the line, I ran into the yard to see if any more was gone, and when I came back the handkerchief was dropped in the passage.</p>

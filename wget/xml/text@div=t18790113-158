                  </hi>. I am a draper, of Durnford Road, East Holloway—on the evening of 11th July I was in the Woodman public-house, Colney Hatch—I saw Gould there, and to the best of my knowledge Stratton was standing by his side—I treated them both to twopennyworth of something—a few minutes afterwards, about 10.40, I was going along the path towards the railway station, and was suddenly knocked down by a blow on my head and rendered insensible, but I saw no one—it appears that I received three blows, for I have three wounds; one blow cut away part of my thumb and the nail—I fell—I had a watch in my waistcoat pocket attached to a chain—I missed them, and also 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a bunch of keys—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Quintan helped me up and gave me into the hands of a police<lb></lb>man—I have known Gould twelve months—I have a very slight knowledge of Stratton.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went into the public-house about 10 o'clock, and stood at the bar half an hour—I had been at one public-house before that—Gould I believe bears an excellent character; he has been a customer of mine, and has been in the employ of Mr. Shaw, a builder—I was as near sober as possible—there were eight or ten people in the bar—my watch could not possibly fall out of my pocket, nor did I take it off the chain and ask Gould to take care of it for me, and give it to Mr. Wiltshire, the proprietor of the Woodman, next day, because I was not in a safe state—I did not ask him to mind it for me—I had to walk along the line—I did not fall,' I was knocked down; it was very slippery, and I was obliged to walk carefully—I never saw the prisoners after I left the public-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was not drunk—neither of the prisoners asked me anything at the police-court about my giving Gould my watch to take care of—I had a stick which was found lying on the grass broken in three places. Edward Quintan. I am a bricklayer, of Station Road, near Southgate—on 11th January, about 11.20 p.m., I was on my way home by the path leading to Colney Hatch station, and found Purkis lying on the path about half way between the railway bridges half insensible—his head was bleed<lb></lb>ing very much from more than one wound—I picked him up and set him against a fence while I picked up his hat and handkerchief—I put his hat on, and put his handkerchief, and this part of his waistcoat, which had been torn off and was lying by him, into his pocket—his walking-stick was lying by him broken into several pieces—I took him some distance, met a police<lb></lb>man, and handed him over to him—I know both the prisoners well.</p>

On the night of 11th January, about 11.50, I was on duty, and met Quintan with Purkis in Betstyle Road, Southgate—Purkis was bleeding from more than one wound on his head—he was wearing this hat, which has blood inside it, and the remains of this waistcoat—he was partly insensible—I took him to Southgate Police-station, which is about two miles—I had almost to carry him on my arm—I sent for a doctor, and his wounds were dressed—next night I went with detective Skeates to Stratton's house, 20, Ely Place, Southgate—he is apprenticed to a carpenter—Skeates knocked at the door and said, "Is Frederick in?" to the younger brother who came to the door—Stratton then came to the door, and Skeates said that he was a detective officer, and should take him in custody for highway robbery on Mr. Purkis—he deliberately struck Skeates on the mouth, saying, "Will you, you b——?" and ran through the house—Skeates followed him—I ran to the back-door to prevent him going out, and then went inside and found Skeates and Stratton struggling together—Stratton had got hold of Skeates by a dangerous part of his body—I told Stratton what he was charged with—he said, "I don't care for that, I thought it was something else you wanted me for; I am innocent of this charge"—I assisted Skeates to take him to the station—he was not violent after that—he was searched there, and this silver watch, which Purkis identifies, was found in the watch-pocket of his trousers—I asked him how he became possessed of it—he said that a gentleman gave it to him—I asked who the gentleman was—he said, "I do not know"—I went with Skeates to the Railway Hotel, New Southgate, saw Gould there, and told him he would be charged with highway robbery on Mr. Purkis—he said, "I am innocent of the charge, I know nothing about it"—I took him in custody—I have been in the neighbourhood 10 years, and have known both the prisoners during that time.</p>

I said, 'No', when he dropped it on the grass I picked it up, and put it in my pocket He said, 'That's right' We helped take him down till we got to the railway path, when he fell down again; we took him as far as the first railway signal, when he said, 'I can go now,' and we let him go. He asked me to get his hand-kerchief out of his pocket, and I gave it to him." <hi rend="italic">Gould says:</hi> "I went into Mr. Willshire's on Saturday night, and saw Mr. Purkis there.

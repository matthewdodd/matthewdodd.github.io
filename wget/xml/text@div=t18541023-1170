                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 98). On 8th Oct., in consequence of instructions I received from the prosecutor, Mr. Eman, I watched his pre<lb></lb>mised—he is a baker, in Lee; I was at the back of the house—there is a sort of passage to the bakehouse, at the side of the house—there is a pump there—it was about a quarter to 8 o'clock—I placed myself behind the coal</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185410230120"></xptr>
               <p>cellar door; that gave me command of the back premises—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner come out from the bakehouse; he went to the pump, and took hold of the handle—he looked as far as the water closet, and places round about, as if he was watching—the next day I found the pump dry—he then returned into the bakehouse—I then saw him open the bakehouse door, and I saw the boy come out with a bundle; the boy left the yard, and the man returned to the bakehouse—I followed the boy to the public house, where a young man stopped him, about seven or eight yards from the gate—I asked him what he had—he told me, some flour—I asked him what he was going to do with it—he said his father gave it to him, and he was going to take it home—I took him to the station house—on my way I met a brother con<lb></lb>stable, and told him of the circumstances; he went back to watch the elder prisoner—I examined the bag, and have got it here, with the flour in it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the weight of it is nineteen pounds; it is a linen bag, tied up in an apron—the elder prisoner was brought to the station by the other constable—I searched the boy, and went to the house of the prisoners, and I found six loaves of apparently home baked bread—I got into this place in such a way that no person in the bakehouse could know how I got there.</p>

The last witness came up to me, and made some communication; in consequence of that, I went back to the prosecutor's premises, the passage leading down to the bakehouse—the elder prisoner was in the bakehouse—I waited till he came out, about five minutes; he came into the passage where I was, leading into the street—he was going towards the main road—I asked him what he had given his boy just now—he said, "Nothing"—I asked him if he was quite sure of that—he said, "Yes"—I told him we should be able to show him something—he said he had given nothing out but what belonged to him, some flour—I asked him if he was allowed to take that in his master's absence, and he said, "Yes;</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, carrying on business at Lee. My bakehouse is at the back of the house—there is access to it without going into the house—I have employed the elder prisoner about three months—his employment was about an hour in the morning, to come and assist to set the bread; and occasionally he set the sponge on a Sunday evening—I myself work in the making of the bread—I gave some instructions to the police—on the evening of 8th Oct., I sent for the prisoner to set the sponge—he came about 8 o'clock—he was alone—I saw him come in—his son came about five minutes after him—I was in the house during this time—after some time, information was brought to me that the prisoner was in custody—I went to the bakehouse, and missed some flour from one side of the trough—I cannot swear to the flour—my flour was not unlike that—I suppose the quantity missed to be about 5 quarterns; that would be about 17 lbs.—the quantity in the bag is about 19 lbs.—the bag is not one that I use, and the apron is a thing that I would not send out; they do not belong to me—the value of the flour is about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner had no right to take these things—I never gave him permission—there was no thorough agreement made between him and me; after he had been a month, I asked him what I was to pay him—he asked me what he owed, and I told him about 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for bread and flour—he said he was satisfied, if I was—he always sent for bread and flour to the shop—he stayed two months after that, and sent for the flour in the usual way, and I booked those things against him—that amounts to about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he had no authority whatever to take flour out of the bakehouse.</p>

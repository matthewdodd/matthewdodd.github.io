On Friday evening, 17th Nov., I saw Wharton and Hewson, and went next day to the residence of the two prisoners in Kew-road, Richmond—in the front shop I saw George Bolton—I asked if he had bought any lead from any one lately—he said, "No"—I said, "Are you quite sure of that"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Have you got any lead on the premises"—he said, "No"—I then read a search-warrant to him, and proceeded to search the premises with the assistance of two other officers—Roberts called my attention to a lot of bricks in the yard, under which were these seventy-one pieces of lead—fifty-eight pieces are new weighing about 350lbs.—the old weighs 55lbs.—I searched in the bed-room, and found two lockers containing brass taps, a dozen rasps, and other things—George Bolton gave me the keys—I saw a cart standing close to the heap of bricks which had "George Bolton" on it, with some lead in it in a bag—I brought away the books.</p>

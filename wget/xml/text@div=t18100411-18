            . Q. You are servant to Mr. Jenkins - A. Yes. On the 1st of March, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was coming down stairs, I saw the prisoner come in and steal a piece of kerseymere, I pursued him and cried stop thief; in a few minutes he was brought back, I knew him to be the person that took it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Where was this piece of goods - A. It was on the counter near the door; I saw the prisoner come in and take the piece of goods from off the counter. There was a piece of goods on it, as he went towards the door it tumbled off, and he almost stumbled over it, and by that time I almost came up to him; I am sure it was the prisoner by his dress, and by his face.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew him rather by his dress than by his face - A. Yes, sir.</p>

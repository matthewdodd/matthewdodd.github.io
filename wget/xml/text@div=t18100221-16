            . I am an officer of St. Dunstan's. On the first of February, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, I was sent for to Mrs. Pettit's, a haberdasher; she said, she saw the prisoner cutting her shop window, with two more boys with him; she ran out of the shop and took the prisoner and another boy, the other ran away. I searched the prisoner and found six gold rings upon him and this knife, that he said he cut the window with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say, that he cut the window - A. Yes, the boy said he cut the window with this knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said to induce him to say this -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210011"></xptr>A. I asked him, what the use of this knife was; he said, it was what they cut the window with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the window cut at Mr. Gould's - A. Yes, a small bit was cut out, a child might get his hand in.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Mr. Gould.) This window of yours, when had you seen it whole - A. It was cut on the over night, but not broken; it was as sound as the other part, I had it fastened with putty. They came the next morning, and forced another part out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that the window was whole - A. It was whole, though it was cut on the overnight.</p>
               <p>Q. How large was the hole - A. About two inches square; and the tray where the rings were for shew, came against the edge of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they were taken out that day - A. I am certain they were taken out that day, I had not missed them above a quarter of an hour. I had sent for a glazier, and they were bringing the boy by before the glazier could put the square in.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose shop was this that he was endeavouring to break open - A. Mrs. Pettits, No. 150.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not observed him before your shop, had you - A. I did not take notice.</p>

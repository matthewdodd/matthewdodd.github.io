                  </hi>. I am clerk and cashier in the furniture depart<lb></lb>ment of the bazaar, in Baker-street—the sole proprietor of it is Mr. Wil<lb></lb>liam Boulnois, junior. I know the prisoner—he was one of the salesmen there, and had his regular wages every week—it was his duty to attend to customers, to take orders, see that they were attended to, and receive money occasionally—each salesman was furnished with a card, and on that card the name of the salesman was written—it was his duty to bring any money he received to me, as cashier—I know Mr. Lewis, Mr. Lyttleton, and Mr. Downes—I did not receive any sum from the prisoner on Mr. Lewis's account on the 15th of September—on the 2nd of November I received from him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Mr. Lewis's account—the prisoner said it was not con<lb></lb>venient for Mr. Lewis to pay the whole of his bill at that time, but he would pay the balance about Christmas—on the 12th of January he brought me 25/., and said that Mr. Lewis had just passed through the bazaar in a hurry, and had given him that sum on account—I have since ascertained that the amount of Mr. Lewis's bill, by some alterations and some deductions that he made, was 154<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and of that I received</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant, Peterborough</hi>). On Monday, 15th September, from information received, I went to the Rose and Crown in plain clothes and saw the prisoners in the taproom—I said to Johnson "Where have you come from?"—he said "What the——is that to do with you?"—I said to Fennimore. "Where did you come from?" and be made no reply—I then said to Johnson "You answer the description of a man who is wanted at Dulwich for stealing a valuable chestnut horse on 21st August"—he said "I know nothing about it"—I said "What is your name?" and he paid "What the h——is that to do with you?"—I said "I shall take you into custody") and I had no sooner said that than he came violently at me and knocked me on the floor by a blow in the mouth with his fist—Fennimore attacsed Lovick, and both the prisoners tried to escape—Johnson was on top of me and we rolled over and over, and were up and down together—I kept hold of him—my mouth bled verv much, and he kicked and struck me several times—I called the landlord to my assistance, and we had to put leg-irons and handcuffs on Johnson before we could take him to the station—when Johnson knocked me down Fennimore struck Sergeant Loviock, and they both fell down together—we were all four down close together—Lovick is not here—he is a bigger man than Fennimore, and got the best of him—we had to put Johnson in leg-irons and take him to the station in a cart—he was the roughest fellow I ever saw—Fennimore was handcuffed and walked to the station—they gave the named William Johnson, of Dunstable, dealer; and William Fennimore, jobbing jeweller, 23, Mason Street, Westminster Bridge Road, Lambeth, London—when I asked them before the struggle where they came from in the morning, they said from Hereford—at the station they said they both came from London that morning—I searched Johnson and found on him this bunch of keys without wards (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on Fennimore 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in the stable I found a box, these two butcher's knives (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), several new hemp halters, and several bottles</p>

The box was not locked—I have not got it here—there were a curry comb, an iron pot, and other articles not produced—I struck Johnson in self defence about the arms and legs, to cripple him and prevent his escape—I laid hold of him by the collar after he struck me in the mouth—I shook him about and he shook me—I spoke to him quite civilly, in the ordinary way.</p>

Fennimore resisted for about five minutes—I did not tell them we were police constables—they knew what we were, because we had uniform trousers on—we told them we should take them in custody—I did not hear Fennimore say to Johnson when I told them I should take them to the station "Good God! what does this mean?"—he said he knew nothing about it at the station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector P</hi>). The prisoners were brought from Peterborough on 15th September, and given into my charge at Carter Street Police-station and put among 12 or 14 others, and Cole picked out Johnson; he did not pick out Fennimore, but afterwards said, when Fennimore was detaiued, he believed he was one of the men he had seen—he has not sworn to him—Abbiss identified Johnson—when the charge was entered Johnson said Fennimore had nothing to do with it, he only went for a drive; and when the charge was read he said "I know nothing about the horse stolen from Dulwich; I don't know where Dulwich is; the one I drove through Hawcliff was a chestnut mare"—I said "If the one you had at Hawcliff was a mare, then there is an end of the matter; because ours was a horse"—he said "Well, it did not belong to me, the man went on with it soon after we left the blacksmith's shop"—in Johnson's pocket book was found some nitrate of silver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I understand it and have used it in photography—I know it will turn light hair black, and it has turned the paper black—it would turn white spots into black spots—I believe that is what it is used for.</p>

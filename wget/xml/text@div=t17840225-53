               <p>On the 16th of January I hung this coat in the stable of Mr. Hayes, I was then his coachman, and I went into the house to receive my wages, and when I went into the stable again, my coat was gone.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the stable door locked? - It was fast, but there was a small door that came from the coach-house into the stable; this was between ten and twelve.</p>

               <p>Court to Findley. How came you to buy such a coat as that for ten shillings? - Because<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250127"></xptr> he told me he bought it of one of his fellow-servants, I have not been in business above three months.</p>
               <p>Court. I advise you to be careful how you buy things in that way? - My Lord, as soon as I received that hand-bill, I carried up the coat.</p>

               <p>My coal-shed is by the stable; it rained very hard, and the prisoner asked me to let him sit in my coal-shed: I could not see him take any thing, I am sure it is the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I saw it by the side of the wall, and I picked it up, I saw nobody thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. I think it is very doubtful whether the box coat, or any part of the clothes of the coachman, can be considered as any part of the proper furniture of the stable; which the Judges have generally held to be necessary, so as to have the protection of the strict law: now the bridles, saddles, horsecloths, boxcloths, &amp;c. are the proper furniture; therefore I think you will be very well justified in acquitting the prisoner of that particular penal clause, which makes it a capital offence, that is, its being stolen privately in the stable.</p>

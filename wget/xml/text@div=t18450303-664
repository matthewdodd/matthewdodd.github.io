On Shrove-Tuesday, the 4th of Feb., (I think,) I left the things safe in the large box, and the box locked, and went out about a quarter to ten o'clock in the morning—my wife was ill in that room—I returned about a quarter to eleven—the large box was then moved—I missed it as soon as I came in, and found it in the wash-house—the hinges were both broken off—I missed the money—the tin box was taken, and likewise the small box with the watch and seals—I did not find Madew there when I came home—I expected she was gone to take some stockings for her mother, who was out at work—she told me she was going out and she went out before me, or pretended to do so, but I think they</p>

On the evening of the 4th of Feb. the three prisoners came to our ibop, and purchased various articles, dresses and shawls—I cannot swear to the articles produced being the same—they were of the same appearance—they bought three gown-pieces, such as these, and a plaid shawl—this plaid scarf they purchased on the Wednesday morning—they were all three together—such articles as these were purchased on the Tuesday and Wednesday, when the three prisoners were together.</p>

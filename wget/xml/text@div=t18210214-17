            . I am servant to Mrs. Kent. On the night of the 23d, Mr. Kent went out about half-past six o'clock; a knock came at the door, and a lad asked if Mr. Watson lived there, (I afterwards saw a lad answering his description apprehended with Billet) a knock came to the door at half-past seven o'clock, on my going to the door Doling was there, he gave me a note and said he had brought it from Mr. Williams; part of Mr. Williams's family had been out with the Miss Kents that morning, and as I had never seen him before I asked him if he lived with Mr. Williams? he said No; I asked him where he brought the note from? he said from Mr. Williams, of Hart-street - I am certain he is the man - he requested an answer. I observed two great-coats hanging in the passage as I took the note into the parlour, and as I delivered it to Mrs. Kent, the street door slammed too; I instantly ran out, opened the street door, and shut it after me; Billet stood in front of the area rails; I asked if he had seen any person run out with something on his arm? he said</p>
               <p>"Yes, he ran up that way," (pointing towards Russell-square) I went that way, and asked an old gentleman if he had seen any body; I was in the act of returning when I met Billet walking towards me with his hands behind him. I accused him of being concerned in stealing a coat, and sending me the wrong way; he denied it. Plaistead came up, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182102140009"></xptr>said he had met a man running towards Bloomsbury-square with a coat on his arm. I went with him, but did not find the man. I returned and missed the coat from the passage, it hung there when the note was brought. I saw Billet in custody next day with a lad answering the description of the one who first knocked. I went with Jefferies to the Falcon, public-house, in Sutton-street, and immediately pointed out Doling in the tap-room from among twenty others.</p>
               <p>MR. KENT re-examined. I was present at the prisoner's examination, what he said was not taken down in writing.</p>

            . I went to my mother's, (Mrs. Kent's) with my husband about seven o'clock that night; a great coat hung in the passage, and my husband hung his up also. About half-past seven o'clock the servant brought a note in; he ran out quick, and we all ran into the passage hearing the door slam too. My brother's coat was gone, but my husband's remained.</p>
               <p>HENRY PLAISTEAD. On the 23d of January about half-past seven o'clock, I was in Southampton-row, and met Doling at the corner of the row and Bloomsbury-place, running towards Bloomsbury-square - I was going towards Queen-square. He had a great coat on his left arm, and ran against me; I am certain of his person. I went on past Mrs. Kent's, and about five houses down the servant asked me if I had seen any one running, he was talking to Billet; we pursued Doling, but did not catch him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there a light for you to see him - A. Yes there was a lamp just by the corner of Bloomsbury-place. I looked him full in the face; he was running as from Mrs. Kent's. I saw him again a week after.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you particularly notice Billet - A. I will not swear to him; I had a better opportunity of seeing Doling than him, for I ran against Doling.</p>
               <p>MR. KENT re-examined. I know there was a lamp at the corner of Bloomsbury-place; it has been removed within the last few days. I heard Doling tell the Magistrate a young man at the corner delivered him the note; the Magistrate asked him if he was to wait for an answer? he said Yes; the Magistrate said,</p>

                  </hi>. On 2nd June I secured the door at the back of Mr. Aaron's premises at half-past 10 o'clock—it is a passage leading to Mr. Brown's flatting mills, and in that passage, right and left, there is a house-door—between 1 and 2 in the morning I was called up by the police—I came down, and found the prisoner in custody of two policemen.</p>

On 2d June, about half-past 1 in the morning, I heard cries of "Police," and went towards Clerkenwell-green, and just as I was going past this door, in Clerkenwell-close, the prisoner was coming out of Mr. Brown's flatting mill—he was quite sober—I asked him his business; he said he had got some back premises there, and he had just been to close them up and see them safe—not believing his statement, I took him back into the passage, rang the bell for the foreman, and asked him if he knew the prisoner; he said he did not—while in the passage, I saw the prisoner put his hand in his pocket, as, if to shift something, and I heard something rattle—I took from him this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, a knife, a chisel, a skeleton key, a pick-lock, and some lucifer matches—in order to get to that passage, he must have come through the prosecutor's coffee-shop, over a long wall, that in at the back door leading to the passage—there is a great bar across that door, fastened on the outside; that bar was taken down, and the door leading into the passage was opened, and thus the front door leading into Clerkenwell-close had been opened from the inside.</p>

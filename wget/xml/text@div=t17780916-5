               <p>I am clerk to a proctor in Doctors Commons. I was at Mr. Smith's house on Thursday afternoon the 20th of August, between three and six, drinking part of a tankard of beer with two other clerks in the Commons; the prisoner I understood had been there from eight in the morning; I saw him sitting in the box; I thought he took notice of us as we drank out of the tankard; a person came into the same box the prisoner had been sitting in; he was then gone out; I did not observe him go out. I turned my back to the tankard to speak to the witness that is here; the prisoner paid for the beer he had been drinking, and came and sat down behind us. In about ten minutes I turned about and the prisoner and the tankard were gone. The person that delivered me the tankard came and demanded it; I went out and saw the prisoner about thirty yards from the door; I pursued him, and took the tankard from under his arm; it was under his great coat.</p>

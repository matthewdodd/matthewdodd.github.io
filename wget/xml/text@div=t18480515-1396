                  </hi> I am shopman to Mr. John Moore, a pawnbroker, in Richard-street, Woolwich. On 28th April the prisoner came to my master's shop, and asked me to show him some watches—I showed him two—he did not like them—I showed him seven in all—he then bought a pen<lb></lb>knife for 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I left the watches on the counter—while I was turning to get them I saw him putting something into his waistcoat pocket, and saw him take one watch—he then said he would bring me a friend in the evening—he left the shop—I watched him—he got to the corner and then he ran—I went after him, and charged him with stealing the watch—he produced it imme<lb></lb>diately—I took him back to the shop—he said he did not intend to steal it, but to show it to a friend—he said he would give 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I would let him go—these watched were unredeemed pledges—I found on him these two tickets.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> These were not pawn-tickets but show-tickets for the watches? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they have the price on them—he said he should return in the evening and give an answer—I understood him to say about the watches—he did not propose to buy more than one—he was in uniform—I might have taken him in the shop, but I did not suppose he had been a lad employed in the dock-yard—I would have allowed him to take the watch to show his friends—tradesmen there can easily ascertain who a lad is—I thought the prisoner was not what he is—I thought his dress was assumed—if I had known he belonged to the dock-yard I would not have taken him into custody—when I took him, he at once gave me the watch, and said he intended to return with his friends—he was agitated—Mr. Moore was compelled to have this prosecution.</p>

Yes, in High-street, Bloomsbury: On the 27th of July, I was walking down Chancery-lane, about six o'clock in the afternoon, I overtook the prisoner at the bar, in company with two other persons, near the middle of <placeName id="t18050918-36-crimeloc189">Chancery-lane, by Cursitor-street</placeName>

On looking back, I saw the prisoner at the bar, who had just passed walking from me, in a different direction to which I was then going; he was walking behind me, about three or four steps from me; I called out stop thief, and I called out again, and he rather mended his pace, and then ran away; I pursued him; he ran up Duke's-court into Cursitor-street, from thence into Castle-street; I got up to him about the middle of that street, he was stopped there by some person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him at all? - A. I lost sight of him in Cursitor-street; I saw him the whole of Duke's-court and Chancery-lane.</p>

               <p>Q. You pursued him into Cursitor-street and Castle-street, and he was stopped by a person there before you got up to him? - A. Yes, I lost sight of him in Cursitor-street, in consequence of the number of people that were running after him; immediately upon my coming up to him, there was some one gave me the handkerchief, and the prisoner immediately went down on his knees, and begged my pardon, and hoped I would forgive him, and he repeated it several times, in a very suppliant manner, that he hoped I would forgive him, as I had regained my property; I told him I could not think of doing that, in consequence of his robbing at that time of the day, at six o'clock in the afternoon; we took him into Norwich-court, leading into Fetter-lane, there he made a great attempt to get away, and afterwards he made another attempt.</p>
               <p>Q. In your way to Hatton-garden from Fetter-lane, he made two attempts to get away? - A. He did, and in turning into Hatton-garden particularly he made an attempt to get away; I took him into Hatton-garden, and there I left him in custody of the Police officers, and the handkerchief I left in the custody of Stanton, one of the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there were three persons walking together, of whom the prisoner was one? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know at the time you saw the three persons that you had got the handkerchief in your pocket? - A. I have no doubt of it, I felt for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any body at your pocket? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not aware of your loss till somebody called out? - A. I was wholly unconscious of it; they called out, there were several voices.</p>
               <p>Q. What was become of the other two persons at that time? - A. I do not know; in consequence of my running after him I lost sight of them.</p>
               <p>Q. In turning about after you were informed you were robbed, were the other two persons with him? - A. No, he was alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person they pointed out when they called out you had been robbed, did they point to the prisoner? - A. Yes, they pointed to the prisoner at the bar as the person that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. When they pointed him out to you the other two persons were not with him, were they? - A. No, they were not then.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not know which of the three persons it might be that took the handkerchief from your pocket? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You only know that the prisoner is the man by the persons that apprized you of it that he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180032"></xptr>the thief? - A. Yes, I recollected the moment that I looked back, that it was the man that I had just passed, in company with two others.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I ask him, whether he saw me take the handkerchief out of his pocket, or whether he found it on me? - A. The moment he was stopped in Castle-street, he threw the handkerchief away; here is a gentleman who saw him do it.</p>

             sworn. - Q. What are you? - A. I live with my father, No. 31, Castle-street, Holborn; on the 27th of July, about six o'clock in the afternoon, as I was looking out of the front room of my father's house, I heard a cry of stop thief, and on my looking out of the window, I saw the prisoner running up the street closely pursued; when he arrived at the house No. 4, nearly opposite to ours, he threw a handkerchief over the rails that covered the kitchen windows of the house; I think he took it from his bosom, or a side-pocket, I cannot tell which; I came out into the street and saw him collared by a great many persons who were round about him, I saw him go on his knees, and heard him ask Mr. Marshall to forgive him, as he had got his property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body pick up the handkerchief? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look to the rails to see whether the handkerchief was there? - A. I saw it in his hand when he threw it away, Mr. Marshall's handkerchief is a red and yellow handkerchief; I went to Hatton-garden Office with Mr. Marshall when he was in custody, we walked behind him, and sometimes before him; I saw him make a desperate attempt to get free, and there appeared to be some companions of his in Holborn, who endeavoured to rescue him; the prisoner hung back and made the people lift him and carry him a little way, at last he walked after they pushed him along.</p>

             sworn. - I produce the handkerchief: on the evening of the 27th of July I was standing at Hatton-garden Office, a lad came into the Office and said there was an Officer wanted, a gentleman had got a thief and he was endeavouring to get away; I went down to the gentleman; I begged him to let him go, I said, he will go with me, I know, and the handkerchief was given to me; he solicited Mr. Marshall to let him go; Mr. Marshall said it was such a daring thing he could not think of doing it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To prosecutor.) Is that handkerchief your's? - A. It is my handkerchief, there are my initials upon it, I. M. and this is the handkerchief that was returned to me in Castle-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the handkerchief? - A. It cost me seven shillings about three or four months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the worth of it now? - A. I suppose four shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was drinking in a public-house in Sweet's-alley, on the day this affair happened; I was very much intoxicated, and when I was coming down Chancery-lane, there was no one with me but a young woman whom I met coming out of the public-house, and when I was coming down Chancery-lane I heard a singing out stop thief, and several persons ran before I ran, to the amount of twenty or more; on my running down Cursitor-street, I stumbled, and the handkerchief was six doors a-head from where I fell down, and when I got up again, Mr. Marshall swore that I was the person that picked his pocket; I know no more of the handkerchief than any gentleman in Court knows.</p>

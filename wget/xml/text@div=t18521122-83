                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at 3, Hargravc-terrace, Ber<lb></lb>mondsey New-road, in the parish of St. Mary Magdalen, Bermondsey. On 28th Oct. I went out after 9 o'clock at night, and returned about a quarter or twenty minutes past 10, and when I got a few paces off my door, I saw a man just outside the door—I went towards the door, and it was gently opened as I was in the act of ringing the bell, and two young men came out loaded with cloth—I can identify Smithers as one of those men, but I have some doubt as to Toomer—I saw that my shelves were stripped, and the shop in disorder—I did not go into the shop—I looked in, and then pursued them, crying, "Stop thief"—I followed them to the bottom of Webb-street, where there is a chapel, and a turning to the right, and another to the left—the man I had seen outside the door turned to the left, and the two others turned to the right—it was then called out to me that they had dropped the goods, and about seven or eight minutes after I saw them in custody of the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Bermondsey New-road. On 28th Oct., about a quarter past 10 o'clock, I was coming home from work, and saw the two prisoners in Webb-street, carrying cloth on their shoulders—I passed them about 100 yards, and heard a cry of, "Stop thief!"—I turned round, and saw them throw the cloth into the road—they made towards me—I stopped Toomer, and he struck me at the side of the head which caused me to let go of him for a moment—I went to lay hold of him again, when Smithers turned round to strike me, but I struck him and knocked him down—Toomer then ran past me—they ran down a passage opposite Swan Mead, and I stopped them there—there is a tan yard there.</p>

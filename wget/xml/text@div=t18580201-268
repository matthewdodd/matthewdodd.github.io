                  </hi>. I am eighteen years and ten months old. In Sept. last I enlisted, in Hampshire, into the Royal Horse Artillery—I went through my examination, and was sent to Woolwich—I arrived there one day in October—I was there supplied with uniform and accoutrements—about Christmas, I saw the prisoner in Uncle Tom's Cabin beer shop at Woolwich—Inever saw him before—he came and sat down by my side—I gave him some beer—he said he had a brother in the Artillery, could he see him that night—I said, no, it was too late that night—he said he had to go to town in the morning—I was <hi rend="italic">beerey</hi>—he then asked me to go with him, and I went into the Coach and Horses; I had another pint of beer there—he got up and went outside, and came in again, and called me out, and said, "Now you can change your clothes"—he had two civilian <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> with him, and they had some clothes for me to put on—we went to the back of the public house, and I took my clothes off there—they gave me some civilian's clothes, and they gave the prisoner two shillings—I do not know whether they took my clothes away—the prisoner and I came off, and walked to London—I was to enlist</p>

About 3 o'clock in the morning, of 30th Dec, I saw the last witness and the prisoner, in High Street, Borough; I thought it right to stop them—I said to the prisoner,"Where are you going?" he said, "Over the way"—I said to him, "Why you are a soldier?" he said, "Yes, I know I am"—I said, "This other young man is a soldier, too" he said, "No, he is not; I have been a soldier sixteen or seventeen years; I belonged to the 44th foot, and was discharged at Shorncliff"—I asked him if he had got his discharge, and he produced a piece of paper—I was not satisfied, and I said, "If you are not a soldier, this young man is; he is a deserter"—he said, "I can assure you he is not; I have known him some years"—I said, "Where have you known him?" he said, "At Shorncliff"—I said, "If he is not a soldier, he must have been one;" he said, "No, I assure you, so help me God, he never was a soldier; he has been living round the camp some time; from a boy I have known him"—I did not feel satisfied; I told the prisoner to go on, and I spoke to the witness, and he gave me an account—I sent a constable to fetch the pri<lb></lb>soner back, and he was taken into custody—Spencer told me in the prisoner's presence, that he should not have deserted, if it had not been for this man—he said, "He persuaded me to do it, and got two civilians to get my clothes"—Isaid, "Did you sell your clothes; or how did you make away with them?" he said, "I did not sell them, that man sold them, and he has got the money"—Ithen asked the prisoner if he had got the young man's money; he said, "Yes," he had got 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that was all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was for some sixteen years a soldier, in one of Her Majesty's regiments of the line, serving for some time in India, and passing through the whole of the Crimean campaign; I was discharged some twelve months since, and have since been living with my family; but having no fixed employment, I came up to London to enter the Tower Hamlets Militia; on the day of my apprehension, I had been to see a friend who was about leaving Chatham; and returning back, on my road to London, I overtook the witness; he told me he thought he should go for a soldier, and I advised him to enter the East India service; he said he would do so; we continued talking till we came to a coffee house, where we took some coffee, and then went on; nothing further passed between us till the officer stopped me; he demanded my discharge; I told him I had not got it, but produced a copy of it; he read it, and told me I might pass on; as I was leaving, he asked who the other person was, I said I did not know; he said he should take him for a deserter, judging by the cut of his hair, and he should take him into cus<lb></lb>tody; I believe he told the policeman, in my absence, that he had been a deserter, but I am sure he never mentioned such a thing to me; and what motive he could have in saying I encouraged him to desert, I know not; I have been waiting for trial a long time, which I hope you will take into con<lb></lb>sideration.</p>

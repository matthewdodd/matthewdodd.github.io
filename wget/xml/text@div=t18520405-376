                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger, of Northumberland-alley, Fen-church-street. On Saturday night, 20th March, I was on my way home, about half past 12 o'clock, and saw the prisoner opposite the East India warehouses, about thirty yards from my house—she ran up against me, as though determined to make me stop and have some conversation with her—I did not stop, and when I arrived at my own door I gave her a shilling to get rid of her—when I took my latch-key out she endeavoured to embrace me, and then suddenly ran off—I found my money was gone, and immediately took hold of her and held her—I charged her with taking the money from my pocket, and she said she had not got it—I had taken the shilling I gave her from my waistcoat-pocket, and it was from the same pocket I lost the money—I told her I would take her to the station, and she then gave me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., saying that was all she had got—I took her to the station, and gave her in charge—I was sober.</p>

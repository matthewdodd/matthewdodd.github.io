               <p>Ray. As I was coming home from a Friend's House the 8th of this Month, I met Bewley, and said, - How do you do? - I believe I might say Molly or, Polly, and so I went directly cross the Way to make Water, and she follow'd me. When I had made Water, I miss'd my Watch, and she ran away to Butler, who stood at a Distance. I ran after her, and charg'd a Constable with them both. He desired me, (as the Women deny'd the thing) to search my Pockets; I did so, and found my Watch at the Bottom of my Breeches Side Pocket.</p>
               <p>- Birch. I happen'd to be in the Watch-house when Ray and the Prisoners were talking about the Matter, and I saw Bewley have the Key of a Watch, and some Part of a Chain in her Hand; and she put it between the Folds of Ray's Coat, but I can't swear it belong'd to Ray.

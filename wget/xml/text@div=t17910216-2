On the 15th of January I lost a pair of boots out of my shop, on the Saturday evening; they were sent back to me about six to have a new strap put on; I put them on my cutting board for that purpose, and went into the yard to wash my hands; my wife called to me that somebody had opened the door, and shut it; I went to see who was there, and found the boots gone from the cutting board, where I had put them not two minutes before; I went out and saw nobody; I came back and gave information at Bow-street; my wife could see in the shop so as to see the door open or shut, though a person might by stooping come in without being seen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Alexander John Kerr, No. 67, Grosvenor-street, Grosvenor-square. On Sunday evening, 13th April, I was in my mistress's room on the second floor, at a quarter past 9 o'clock—I heard footsteps in the room above—I took the candle, and ran up stairs to the attic, and as I entered the door I could see the prisoner get<lb></lb>ting out of the window—I saw his face, and he spoke to me—he got out of the window down into the gutter—I believe there is a communication with the next house by means of that gutter—the same person came in again—my candle was gone out then—he came in half way, and took a work box of my own—when my candle was gone out there was merely the light of the window—it was moonlight—the prisoner was brought into the house again in about ten minutes—the window was quite shut down about 2 o'clock, it was not fastened.</p>

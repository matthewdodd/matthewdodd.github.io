I perceived his left hand directed behind him towards my pocket, there was no body near me but him; I began to suspect him to be a pickpocket, and immediately I felt my watch go out of my sob; immediately I siezed him by the collar, and said, you have got my watch; he said I know nothing or it. I called to the workmen for the assistance of their candles to search the prisoner; I searched his right and left pockets but stood nothing there; then I desired the workmen to look upon the ground; they could not find it. Then I went to take him to the Compter, with one of the men to assist me, and the workmen called after me, and said they had found it. I carried him to he Compter, and the day after my lord mayor's day I took him to the Mansion-house, and he was committed.</p>

            . Mr. Caple called for a candle, I and others of the workmen went to him, and he had got the prisoner by the collar, and said this man has picked my pocket. We searched his pockets and about on the ground; but when Mr. Caple was going along with him to put him in the Compter, I picked it up about a yard from the place where the prisoner had stood.

               <p>Whether if this watch should lie in that narrow path it would not have been trampled to pieces; only think of that my good lord. When they had thrown me down by the house side, where they had tumbled me about the best part of half an hour, my good lord, after that there was a signal came that they had found it when I got to Bow church. I never stood still my good lord, I was going along, and going to put my head under a plank, there this man laid hold on me, and said you have got my watch; I said, if I have any I have yours; for, my good lord, I had no watch.</p>

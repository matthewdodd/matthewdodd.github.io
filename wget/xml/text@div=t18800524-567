                  </hi>. I am a blacksmith and live at Hungary Hill, Faraham, Surrey—I went into the Wellington public-house on the 26th April, about 8 o'clock p.m.—the two prisoners came in about 20 minutes after<lb></lb>wards—they called for some beer and I joined them in drinking it—we then tossed up to see who was to pay—there was another man, Cole, who tossed as well—while the beer was being drunk I had occasion to go into the taproom, and while I was there the prisoner Henry Barnett came in and brought some boots in—I identify these boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) as those he brought in—he asked me if I wanted to buy a pair of boots—I said "No," but afterwards I agreed to give him is. for them, and for the purpose of paying him I changed a sovereign with the landlady—I tied tied aces together and put the boots over my shoulder and kept them there till I left the house—when I had drunk some beer I paid for the boots with three shillings and two sixpences—I left the house about 9.58, and walked across the road by myself—I subsequently saw the prisoners standing 6 or 7 yards from me, and we all went up Alma Lane together from the house—that is in the direction of my home, but not in the direction of the home of Henry Barnett—when we had got about 250 yards Henry Barnett Struck me a blow on the right side of my</p>

On Friday, 27th April, about 10 a.m., the prosecutor came and made a communication to me at my house—I went with him to the Wellington beerhouse, and found Job Barnett sitting behind the door of the bar—the prosecutor and I went into the back room together—about 10 minutes afterwards we came back to the front of the bar, and the prosecutor and John Barnett began talking to one another—I called them into the tap-room, as the conversation was running high; John Barnett had a billycock hat over his eyes then, but when we went in it was in its proper position—he was not charged, but when the prosecutor questioned him he was all of a tremble and shake—I asked the prosecutor whether that was the man—he said "I am almost sure, I am almost certain"—that was in John Barnett's hearing, who replied "I was not there, I was tossing here with you last night"—I afterwards went to some work in Martin Webb and Co.'s brick-fields, and found 400 or 500 men working there—I went to the part where he was working, and when I was about 200 or 300 yards in front of the prosecutor he said "Hold hard, Bowyer, here is the man, stop," and he pointed out Henry Barnett—I saw one of the firm, who sent for Barnett, and when he came up he said "What do you want Bowyer?"—I said "I have come about those boots"—he said "What boots?"—I said "I suppose you know nothing about them," and I said to Blake "Is that the man that assaulted you last night?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Are you sure?"—he said "I am perfectly certain he is the man"-Barnett said "I bought a pair of boots at <hi rend="italic">Ned</hi> Stranger's last night and they are at borne now"—the prosecutor said "That is the man I bought the boots of"—Henry Barnett said "What boots? I bought a pair at Ned Stranger's last night and they are at home now, but I never sold them to you"—I took Henry Barnett in custody, and searched him and found these three separate shillings, about threepence in new coppers, and this handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), with three other pocket-handkerchiefs—I accompanied the prosecutor to Henry Barnett's lodging about 6,30, and he identified the boots—they were not actually handed to me, but he said "Those are the boots" Cross-examined by Henry Barnett. You said that you bought the pair of boots at Nod Stranger's, not at Mr. Angel's; you never mentioned Mr. Angel—Blake told me that he was almost certain you were the man</p>

I had a glass of ale with them. I never tee Mr. Blake that night at the bar. I stopped there till 25 minutes to 9, and never took the boots out of my pocket. I got sixpennyworth of eggs and was down at the canal at 6 minutes to 9. I got up next morning and went to my work. As to seeing John Barnett that night I did not. I was about seven yards from this man; he passed me and said nothing. They went to the foreman, and he said "You are wanted." He said "Did not you buy a pair of boots yesterday?" I said "Yes, two pair; one pair are on my feet and one pair are at home." Mr. Bowyer said "You will have to go to the police-station with me." I said "very well." They searched me, and I had three handkerchiefs on me. Mr. Blake took up the white one and said that he could not swear to it.</p>

He said "No." He went away for half an hour and came back with another policeman, called me into the taproom, and he said again "I cannot swear to him." On Wednesday evening at 11 o'clock I was at the police-station after all the public-houses were shut up, and they came and swore to me and said I was the man. I can swear I was at home at 5 minutes to 10 on 26th April, and as for seeing Henry Barnett I did not see him from 8 o'clock on Sunday evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single. On the 31st of December, at a quarter past nine o'clock in the evening, I was waiting outside the Crown and Anchor public-house, in Clarence-street, Regent's Park, to see a soldier in the Guards, named Blandford, who I know—the regiment was quartered there—I was waiting at the door some time—I saw the prisoner go in—he came out in about ten minutes, and asked me if I would go in—I told him "No," I would much rather stop outside—he asked who I was waiting for—I told him—he went inside for about ten minutes, their came out again, and pressed me very much to go in—I did not go in then, but I did the third time, and he called for a pot of ale, which I paid for, as he said he had no money, that his brother had his money, and he was up stairs—I took out my purse, which was in a reticule—I had in it three half-crowns and one shilling, besides a shilling which I gave him to pay for the ale—I emptied the money into my hand, and took out a shilling, and the remainder I put in the purse, and put it in my bag again—another pot of ale was called for, and he paid for that. out of the shilling—he said he knew Blandford, and that he would not come till ten o'clock—I waited there from a quarter past nine o'clock till a quarter to ten o'clock—my bag was on the seat I was sitting on, on the right-hand side—he was sitting close to me—after waiting some time, I was going home—the prisoner offered to go with me, and he went as far as Cumberland-street—he then said, "Good night," and we parted—I then went to Albany-street, to ride home in an omnibus, and as I was looking for the money to pay, I found my purse was gone—I turned-back and told the policeman—we went straight to the barrack-gate, but could find no such person as the name the prisoner gave me, which</p>

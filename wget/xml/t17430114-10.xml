I told them I would not go that Way, so I turned away from them; they whisper'd, and turned to me again; almost against Bridges-street , Bland laid hold of me round the Shoulder, and another took my Hat off my Head, but I cannot be sure who did it; then two Gentlemen came up, upon which I laid fast hold of Bland, called out Watch, and carried him to the Watch-House, and next Day before Justice Deveil. I am sure Bland is the Man that laid hold of me, because I did not let him go out of my Hand, till he was secured by the Watch. I think the Prisoner Brand is the Man who took my Hat off.</p>

Serj. Temple was sent for, and the Hat was found there. This is the Hat (it was owned by Mr Blackwell) As I was carrying them in a Coach to Newgate, Fennell said, that Bland did propose to them both, to take his Hat off, as he said, to get them a Drink. - As near as I can remember, these were the Words; Let us go and take the Gentleman's Hat off, to give us a Drink.</p>

Ever since he has been in my Company, he has been in the Barracks in the Savoy; and by that I have a better Opportunity of knowing a Man's Behaviour than out of them. They are not confined all Night there. He was present when the Roll was called over, but he might go out afterwards. Fennell has behaved well ever since he listed , which was in April; and I believe him to be as honest a Man as lives: Extremely so; a quite sober honest Fellow.</p>

On the 15th of May, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked me to take some stays with her, to shew some servants in Finsbury-square - She said she was cook there. I took ten pair with me. She went down Mr. Montague's area, and told me to walk about. She came up and said if I would leave them the servants would try them on while the dinner was up stairs - I gave them all to her. She told me to call again in half an hour, and bring two dresses with me. She came up again, and walked as far as Featherstone-street with me, and then went into a bird-shop. In half an hour I returned to the house, and could not find her. She was taken about a fortnight after. I am sure she is the woman.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 25th of May, about six o'clock, I found the yard door unbolted. I was the first up, and had gone to bed last the night before. I left the door bolted; I found it shut-to and on the latch; I found the top part of the bar unbolted, and the large parlour window a little open; it never would fasten very secure. I had left it close down the night before, and fastened it with a screw in the middle. I do not know how they could get it open; it was done by somebody outside; the glass was not taken out; there were footmarks under the window outside; they must have got in that way, but how they unscrewed the door I cannot tell. I had left some halfpence and penny-pieces in the till; I do not know the amount; they were gone, and nearly a gallon of brandy was gone out of the bar, out of a small cask. The key of the cellar hung in the bar, and eight bottles of wine were taken from there, and also some eggs.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were there any shutters to the window. A. No. There was no mark of violence anywhere. The prisoner lived servant with me, and left about a fortnight before.</p>

            . I am a constable, I heard of this robbery, and found the windows had been raised; it was a very large back parlour window, and fastened by a screw, but it would not bite sufficient to fasten it down, so that it might be raised up. A whole square of glass was cut out of the bar, it was large enough for a person to get through; there were foot-marks outside the parlour window; the premises are all shut in by gates. I apprehended the prisoner on the Tuesday following. I also apprehended

            . I am a labouring man. I was taken up about this business myself, for being with the prisoner. I was sleeping in Mrs. Grove's left; he came there and trod on me, at three o'clock in the morning of Saturday. I got up at eight o'clock in the morning and left him there; he slept there always; I went no where with him; I only know that he came there at three o'clock - it was getting light. He came up to me at Mr. Southall's about half-past nine o'clock, and then he had about 14 s. in halfpence, and seventeen eggs. We went to the Rose and Crown public-house, and then to Mr. Atkins's the butcher, and got two pounds of beefsteaks: we then went to the Rose and Crown, and had the steaks and eggs cooked. I asked him where he got them; he said he bought them of Mr. Fleming, the grocer, and that he took the money from Mr. Upton, where he had been at work; he is a coal merchant; he worked there three or four days; he asked me to give him 1 s. in silver for halfpence, which I did; another man also gave him 1 s. for halfpence; he then went to the landlord, (Parker) and got 3 s. for halfpence - and afterwards six more shillings; I was in custody three days for this; I paid my part towards the steaks, having 6 s. of my own. On the Friday night he asked me to go with him to rob Mr. Elworth's house.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to propose that to you - A. I do not know - I did not go - I was intimate with him; we slept in the same loft. I was in Mr. Routh's service as a haymaker - I did not know where he got the eggs from. He said he took seven bottles of rum from Mrs. Elgar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence - I left this man at Highgate at eight at night, and saw him next morning at half-past eight o'clock.</p>

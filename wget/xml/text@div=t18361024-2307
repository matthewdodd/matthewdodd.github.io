                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, in partnership with my brother, at 92, Quadrant, Regent-street, in the parish of St. James. On the morning of Friday, the 23rd of September, the prisoners came to our shop—Calligani asked to look at some seals—my shopman reached out two trays for their inspection—Castanos appeared to act as interpreter—he said the seals were for Calligani, and two were selected by Castanos for the other—they were shown to him by Castanos, and he approved of them—Castanos called him his friend, and gave me to understand they were for him—Castanos asked the price of engraving, and a long conversation took place about engraving them—they remained ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—on the Monday following, Bradshaw the officer came, and produced some seals to me—I examined my stock and four were missing—I identi<lb></lb>fied three of the seals he produced—they were worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—another was lost which has not been found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Monday afternoon, the 26th of September, at three or four o'clock, I went to No. 2, Little Lisle-street, Leicester-square, kept by Mr. Coqurel—I searched the room on the second floor, and found the three seals, which I produce, sewed up in the cloak—I found fourteen others in another part of the cloak, wrapped in paper, and bound with black thread, in different parts of the cloak, at the bottom—I showed the seals to the prosecutor, and he identified these three—I went afterwards to Sabloniere's Hotel, and found they did not live there, and were not know.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Calligani</hi>. The address was given to the Hotel, because that day I in<lb></lb>tended to dine there—I had no interest whatever to give a false address—had I been a thief I should not have gone to the same shop again—the seals were not sewn in the lining of the cloak—it is false. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I found them in different parts of the cloak—the lining was sewn, and I toe it up—they were wrapped in parcels of three each.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Lewis Coqurel, and live at No. 2, Lisle-street. The two prisoners lodged in the room which the officers went into, on the second floor—one slept in a cupboard, and the other on a sofa bed in the room—Castanos passed as the master, and Calligani as his servant—they always went out together as two friends, arm-in-are—I furnished the room for them—I have not received any money—they owe, at this time, between 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know that cloak belonged to one of them—I cannot tell to which.</p>

            . I am post-mistress of Staines. On the 19th of October, about seven o'clock in the evening, I received the letters from Chertsey, in the usual way, from Giles, in the office - I saw him open the bag and take them out; a letter addressed to Sheffield would be forwarded by London, next morning at half-past four o'clock - I dispatched the London bag, sealed in the usual way, on the morning of the 20th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At what time? A. About half-past four o'clock - my daughter assists me in the office, but was not in the office that evening; I was in the office from the time the bags were received till a quarter or twenty minutes to nine o'clock, and then only went into the parlour adjoining to get a crust of bread and cheese - I returned again into the office; I took the bag up stairs with me at night, and gave it to the guard in the morning - my daughter was at work in the parlour, and was not in the office at all that night; I remember the night, because I weighed two packets, and I received a letter from the Post-office about this in about a week I think - I have no servant; there is a key to the bag at Chertsey, and another at my office.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Did you return from the parlour into the office? A. I did, and remained there till I sealed the London bag with the office seal - Giles unlocked the Chertsey bag with my key; I took the bag up stairs, and delivered it to the guard in the morning.</p>

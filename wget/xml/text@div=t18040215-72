               <p>Q. Did you ask him how he came by these things? - A. He said he did not know; he was very much intoxicated; I never saw him before; he was detained till the next day, and then he found bail till Monday; and then he appeared again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. He found bail, and on Monday he appeared when a prosecutor appeared? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar on board of your ship; was he left there in care? - A. I left him in possession of my ship cabin on the 28th, and told him likewise to take particular care of the cabin.</p>
               <p>Q. What hour of the day? - A. About half after four o'clock, as soon as I got the ship moored.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go back to your ship? - A. On Monday, the second day following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your trunk meddled with? - A. When I went into the cabin, I wanted to shift my clothes; I found my trunk open; my trunk was not locked when I went away; I found several things were taken out; I lost three pieces of Nankeen, one piece was gilt; I lost some cocoa-nuts and some segars, I cannot rightly tell the number of either; an handkerchief, and a number of things.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you lost a ship's block? - A. I cannot rightly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these things; the handkerchief first; is that your's? - A.It is very much like one that I had; I cannot say perfectly that it is the one I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of these African sashes? - A. I have seen them with one of the men,

               <p>Q. Now, with respect to that Nankeen, had you cut it or a black? - A. It was cut by a black; upon my word, I cannot say it is mine; as for the ship block, it is more than I can say; we had several.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Is there any particular thing now shewn you that you will positively swear to? - A. I cannot exactly say.</p>

               <p>Q. Is it a good thing or a bad thing to tell a lie? - A. It is a bad thing.</p>
               <p>Q. If you tell a lie upon oath, what will become of you? - A. I know a lie very well; if we do, we go in the bad world.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner go out of the ship that afternoon? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him do any thing to the things that are there? - A. No, I did not see him; there were a good many other officers on board.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have cut Nankeen in the same way before now? - A. Yes; I have cut the six yards off; I have cut them in two; I have cut them out for trowsers.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you make trowsers for besides the captain? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you are in the West Indies you do? - A. Yes; I cut that out myself; they are in the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the only reason you know them, because they are in the ship? - A. The trowsers I lost when I came on board the ship; I did not see the man take that; I have no doubt it is the captain's.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know what is in the trunk? - A. Yes, I have packed it sometimes.</p>

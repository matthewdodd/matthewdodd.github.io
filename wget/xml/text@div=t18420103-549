                  </hi>. I am single, and am a servant at No. 89, Brunswick-square. Last Sunday evening, about a quarter to nine o'clock, I was returning from John-street chapel, Bedford-row, and passing the Foundling-hospital, I felt my watch taken out of my pocket—there was no crowd—I was not aware that any one was near me till I felt it go suddenly—I directly turned round, and saw a boy and a man behind me—I caught the boy, and asked him what he had got—he directly turned round to the man, and spoke to him—I let go of the boy to convince myself that the watch was gone, and while I did that they both ran up Lansdown-place, which leads by the side of the Foundling-hospital to Brunswick-square—I followed, calling "Stop thief—I lost sight of them—the man was caught in Grenville-street, which goes from Brunswick-square to Guild<lb></lb>ford-street</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184201030116"></xptr>
               <p>—he was caught near the Guildford-street end—when I came up, a number of people had the prisoner in custody—he is the man who was with the boy that took my watch—I am sure of that—when I got up to the crowd, I asked if they had got the boy as well as the man, because the boy took my watch (I had seen the boy at my pocket—I stopped him directly, and asked what he had got—he directly turned round to the prisoner and spoke to him—the prisoner was quite close to the boy, they could touch one another—the boy was not taken) the prisoner was taken to the station—I went with him and saw him searched—a gold watch and chain, some gold rings, and some silver was found on him—my watch was a silver one, and had an old black ribbon to it and a key—I saw it next morning at the station—this is the watch-ribbon and key, now produced—I have had the watch ten or twelve years—it is worth 80<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I bought it myself for two guineas second-hand—I said the prisoner was the man when I first went to the station—I had no doubt about him—I went home to my master and told him about it—I was afraid to stop any longer for fear of offending my master—before I charged the prisoner I went home and told my master what had happened, and excused myself for being out so late, as he knew chapel was over—my master went back with me to the station, and I charged the prisoner.</p>

I was in Brunswick-square on Sunday evening, a little before nine o'clock, and heard a cry of "Stop thief"—on turning round I saw the prisoner running—I went up to him and endeavoured to take him—as I was going to take hold of him, both his hands flew up, as I thought, to strike me—his hands were inclining towards the railing of the inclosure—there is a small foot-pavement by the railing, and he was close to the curb, about two or three feet from the railing, merely the breadth of the pavement—he immediately altered his course, turned, and ran into Grenville-street—I pursued and took him at the end of Grenville-street, near Guildford-street—he was nearly out of breath at the time, and when he spoke he said, "What do you stop me for?"—I held him, and in a few minutes Cayford came up with the prosecutrix—we then took him to the station and searched him—I took from him a gold watch, some gold rings, and other articles, which have since been given up—at the station he refused to give his name and address.</p>

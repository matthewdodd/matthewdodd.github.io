In the evening, I saw a handkerchief with a bundle, handed out of the lighter, into an empty lighter. I told Mr. Linton, whom I am employed under, of it; he ordered me to go and fetch it; I went, and found a handkerchief, with about 20 lb. of tobacco tied up in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who handed it out of the lighter?</p>
               <p>Ward. I do. It was the prisoner at the bar: I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other people in that lighter at that time?</p>
               <p>Ward. There were three or four people in that and the empty one; there was only one in the lighter with Beckett.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who received it?</p>
               <p>Ward. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the tobacco shipped in casks?</p>
               <p>Ward. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any of the casks with the head out?</p>
               <p>Ward. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the tobacco was taken from?</p>
               <p>Ward. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose tobacco was it?</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know who gave it to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Ward. I do not: I don't think the prisoner at the bar was guilty of taking it out of the hogshead.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was?</p>

            . This evidence is a servant under me, to take care of these lighters, and other goods, upon the keys: he called me in the dusk of the evening; I stepped forward, with a candle and lanthorn in my hand: he said, I saw a handkerchief handed out of the lighter into an empty lighter; I bid him go and fetch it up; he did; I carried it to a house in Dark-house-lane, and laid it down. After the prisoner came in, I asked him if he knew who took the tobacco? Mr. Ward<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176401130023"></xptr> said, Beckett was the man that handed it out of the lighter; then I carried him to the Compter; I did not see him handle the tobacco at all; neither am I of opinion that he was the man that opened the hogshead, and took it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you believe it was taken from?</p>
               <p>Linton. From out of a hogshead.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you believe that?</p>
               <p>Linton. There had been a hogshead opened, and it was put close too again; but when we came to examine it narrowly, we found some tobacco was missing.</p>
               <p>Q. to Ward. Did you examine the hogsheads?</p>
               <p>Ward. I did immediately, and found one of the heads was hollow; it went in.</p>
               <p>Q. to Linton. Whose tobacco was it?</p>
               <p>Linton. It was the property of Messrs. Bucannan, Hinman, and Lankaster; there was no other tobacco that was shipped, but theirs; I have known the prisoner 8 years, and never heard he was detected in any bad action, nor ever saw any thing bad of him. I don't believe he was the man that opened the hogshead.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain your reason for your belief?</p>
               <p>Linton. All the reason I have to believe that, is, I never saw him down in the lighter; he was at the end of the lighter, holding what we call the Guy. I always looked upon him to be an honest hard-working man.</p>
               <p>Q. How much tobacco was missing?</p>
               <p>Linton. It is impossible to judge; but according to my opinion, there was more than 20 pounds missing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was working at the tobacco; I never saw the handkerchief, and know nothing of it. There were five men along with me.</p>

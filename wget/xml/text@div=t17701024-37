            . The prisoner brought a horse to the Boar and Castle in Oxford Road, where I am hostler, between eight and nine on Wednesday morning; he desired me to take care of him. The horse had sweated, but the sweat seemed rather dried on. He said he came only from Barnet that morning, and that he had walked him all the way from Highgate. I gave the horse a food; he went to the farrier's to have him shod; when he came back, he asked me for a pair of scissars to cut the horse's tail; he had a switch tail, but the prisoner cut it shorter. He asked my advice, whether he should send him to grass; I said, it would hurt the price of him. He borrowed a halter of me, and had him taken to the Repository.</p>

            . I am a farrier. The prisoner came to me on Wednesday morning the third of October, and asked me to go and look at a horse he had got at the Boar and Castle. I went with him; his feet were ragged, and looked ugly. He asked me if it would not be right to send him to grass; I told him, I thought he had better sell him. He asked me to shoe him; I told him, we were so busy, we could not. He desired me to take him to Mr. Langhorne's Repository. He said, he had him in a chop, and he stood him in about six guineas; and that as he had him so cheap, he was afraid something was the matter with him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you acquainted with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Dow. He worked in our shop; that was the way I became acquainted with him. I know he had two horses before; I saw them stand at a stable in Bartholemew Close.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner deal in horses?</p>
               <p>Dow. Yes; he used to buy horses that were sick or lame; sometimes he brought them about again, and sometimes he lost money by them.</p>
               <p>Ibbetson. On the Friday following Mr. Jones came into our yard pretty early in the morning, and said he had lost a horse, which was in our yard. I desired him to make an affidavit of it, and let me have it; and I desired him to appear as little as possible, that I might detect the thief. After the sale, Dow came and asked after the horse; I took him into custody. Whilst we were asking him some questions, the prisoner was observed loitering about the gate, which caused as to suspect him; we desired the constable to take him into custody. When the constable brought him in, Dow said he was the man that delivered him the horse, and gave him the note.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say when he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Ibbetson. When he first came into the room, and Dow challenged him with having given him the horse, he said, What, do you say it was me delivered the horse? Dow said yes; then the prisoner sat down; he held down his head, and appeared as if he was much in liquor; he said he was very sick, and desired to go out; he came in again in about five minutes, and then talked very sensibly.</p>

Dow said yes, and you gave me the note; the prisoner said that is a lie, I can't write. He sat down, and seemed as if he was going to faint; he begged to go out, and he sat upon the bench in the yard; he said I am very drunk, I am very sick. When he came in again, he said he had had a rap for a horse; before my Lord Mayor next day he said he bought it in Long-lane for six guineas or 6 l. and he said he thought it was stolen.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday morning, about eight o'clock, I met a man by Long-lane, near the Charter-house, upon a rough cart gelding; he asked me if I could help him to a customer for him; I said I would buy him myself, if he would let me get a guinea or two by him. When I examined the horse I found he had bad feet, and weak eyes; he asked me eight guineas for him; I asked him if he was found; he said he was to the best of his knowledge. I offered him six guineas, or three half guineas and a watch I had. We agreed for six guineas; I had not money enough, so I went and pawned my watch for two guineas and a half, and paid him six guineas. Here is a men here that saw me buy the horse; and I can bring proof where I was on the night the horse was stole. They have misrepresented what passed; they said to Dow, is this the man that delivered the horse to you? he said yes; I said no, it was the hostler. I said the horse is my property, I don't deny it. The man I bought the horse of said he came from Dartford in Kent, and that his name was Wood; he looked like a creditable countryman; I suspected the horse was not found; when his feet were shod I found he had good feet. I asked Dow's advice whether I should send him to grass; he said it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177010240016"></xptr> would be expensive feeding him to grass, and advised me to sell him, I told him he should have half of what he sold for above six guineas. I made out a note in the name of Wood, that I bought it of. I have bought many horses in Smithfield, and paid for them, and put them up in that man's stable.</p>
               <p>Q. to Wood. Did he say at first that it was his horse?</p>
               <p>Wood. No; he denied the horse, and said he did not give it to Dow.</p>

               <p>Apron Brown. I live with one Mr. Thompson, who deals in horses. I am his rider. I have known the prisoner about a twelve-months. On Wednesday, the 3d October, the prisoner bought a horse in Charter-house-lane, of a lusty country man, who was dressed in a dark brown coat and waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it?</p>
               <p>Brown. Between nine and ten in the morning. It was a black cart gelding; he gave him six guineas for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present during the whole time of making the bargain?</p>
               <p>Brown. No; I happened to come down the lane, and I saw Barton and the farmer together; I stopt to see whether they dealt or no. Barton asked the price; he said eight guineas; he bid him six; he went to pawn his watch for to make up the money, then I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the man say where he had brought the horse from?</p>
               <p>Brown. He said he brought him from Dartford in Kent; that he had been to Highgate for some cash; that he had been disappointed, and that made him sell his horse.</p>

I saw the prisoner in the chapel about ten minutes before I lost it: he appeared to be listening to the sermon; I felt a push against me, and found my handkerchief gone - the prisoner was close behind me. I went out, and fetched a constable - when I returned he was still there, and was taken into custody, and as he was going to the watch-house it fell down, inside his trowser - he said he had not got the handkerchief about him; he had one of his own. which he took out of his pocket, and said that was the only one he had.</p>

            . I am a constable. I tapped the prisoner on the shoulder, and he came out with me. He took out a snuff-box and a knife, and I believe a handkerchief, and unbuttoned his waistcoat to shew me that he had no handkerchief about him. As we were going to the watch-house it fell down his trowsers, and got round his aucles; he said he knew nothing about it.</p>

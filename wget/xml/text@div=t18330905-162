            . I live with my mother, at Ranelagh-place. On the 8th of July, I was in company with William Upjohn, in Mr. Cubitt's fields, near the <placeName id="t18330905-162-crimeloc897">Willow-walk, over the Grosvenor Canal</placeName>

I was with Jones throwing stones, on the 8th of July - I heard a gun go off - I was hit at the back of the head - I turned round and saw who fired at me - I thought it was a man in a velvet coat, it appeared like a velvet coat; I saw the man's face, but the prisoner is the man I am sure, I saw his face, I did not hear him say anything for I was stunned; I heard the gun but nothing else; I was stunned immediately the shot hit me; I took and ran a little way and then fell; I did not look round as I was running; I turned round directly I was shot, I thought it was a stone hit me, and when I turned round I saw the man, I am sure it was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you think you were so much stunned, that if a man called out"Halloo, I have caught you," you could not have heard it? A. Yes, I could hear nothing; being stunned did not hurt my sight as well as my hearing; there was a hedge between me and the man, and a ditch, it was a very high hedge and pretty thick; the man was in the garden and I in the field - the trees were in leaf.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How high was the hedge, could you see over it? A. Yes; we were down in a hollow, the hedge went up high - we could see right into the garden; I saw the man's face, I saw him come from the tree two or three steps, his face was above the hedge - I could see him quite plain, I did not see him till after the shot was fired.</p>

            . I am house-surgeon of St. George's Hospital. Upjohn was brought to me on the 8th of July, I examined him, he had about fifteen small wounds on the left-side of the head, in the back part - I did not take any shot out of his head - I fancied I felt shot there but none were discovered - there is no other surgeon here; he had been to another surgeon before - he was discharged on the 24th of July; the wounds were such as would be caused by the shot of a gun.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Would not coarse powder make such wounds? A. If the gun was near enough, but not that kind of wound - I examined the wound to see if I could discover any shot, but found none.</p>

             (policeman). I went with Mrs. Upjohn, the boy's mother, to the prisoner's employer on Wednesday, the 8th of July. I saw the prisoner there, and asked him where the gun was which he shot the boy with; he told me it was in the yard, at the back of the house - I asked him if he would let me have it, he was going back to fetch it, when one of the servants brought it to me; he said, he shot at the boys, but did not mean to shoot them - he also stated that the boys were throwing bricks into the ditch, to get over into the garden to steal the fruit - he said, he took the gun up, but he meant to shoot over their heads; he did not tell me how it happened that he shot them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He told you he did not mean to hit the boys? A. He said he took the gun up and shot at them, but meant to shoot over their heads - I have seen the place many times - there is a hedge, but it lies in a hollow, and the ditch lies in a hollow also - the boys are very low in stature.</p>
               <p>ROBERT JONES re-examined. The man who fired the gun was about ten yards from us. I was at the doctor's with Upjohn, the doctor brought a light and examined him, and said, he was to be taken to the hospital immediately - he did not take anything out of his head, he felt his head, nothing more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there any fruit in the garden? A. Yes, I knew that very well - I had never been there before; I cannot tell whether Upjohn had - I have not been into any garden since; I do not know Mr. Martin- I have been at liberty ever since; I was never taken on any charge of stealing fruit.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). Gentlemen; - I most solemnly assure you, that when I saw the boys bringing the bricks from the kiln for the purpose of making a bridge over the ditch,(and by that means get into the garden to commit their depredations and plunder,) I was standing at the hovel which is in the garden, and as soon as I saw the boys I called out to them. I asked what they were doing there, and told them to be off. I left the hovel and approached towards the ditch; as I walked along, my feet got entangled amongst some potatoe haulms - I stumbled: I had the gun in my hand; it was loaded with only half a charge of powder, and a few sparrow shot. The gun was full cocked; in stumbling, I must have jerked the gun, which went off. I saw the boys run away (three one way and two another); I was quite unconscious of having done any injury, nor could I have supposed it possible from the situation in which I stood; and when it is considered that the hedge which is on the garden side of the ditch is one foot and a half through, and five feet high, closely set with poplar and elder trees, it would appear impossible to be otherwise than of a purely accidental nature, and the charge must have passed through the hedge and hit the prosecutor without my knowledge. I did not hear any person call out, and concluded that the boys had been frightened away. I returned back to the hovel, and remained on duty my usual time.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM UPJOHN re-examined. I felt a probe going into my head, but don't know whetherany thing was taken out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, in the City of London—I have a private residence in Porchester Terrace, Bayswater—I am principally con<lb></lb>nected with the Greek trade—I have known the prisoner about eighteen years—many years ago he established a list for the information of mer<lb></lb>chants, with respect to the arrival and departure of vessels laden with corn—I was originally a subscriber to that list—after it had been established a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186808170011"></xptr>
               <p>few years, a Mr. Dornbush started a similar publication, which became very extensively patronized in the trade, and the prisoner's list was not so much patronized—Dornbush's list was established about ten years ago—for a certain time I continued to subscribe to both lists; I then discontinued the prisoner's list, and continued to subscribe to Dornbush—I have never had any quarrel or disagreement with the prisoner—in the beginning of Sep<lb></lb>tember last, I received this letter from the prisoner—it is his writing—these other letters are all his writing—(<hi rend="italic">Letters read</hi>: "10th September, 1867. Pray remember Mrs. Fermi and her six children, and help Mr. Zariff on their behalf. They are regularly baptized Christians, and not Jews, whom it is now the fashion to throw, like dogs, into the Danube." "16th September, 1867. This family will be lost by the poverty inflicted upon it There is no time to lose. I proclaim it in time; it admits of no more indifference. With this I sound the alarm for the second time. You yourself will be my witness. Seven Christians; you understand. Pray run and see Mr. Zariff. Save the Christians."—(Mr. Zariff is a Greek merchant)—"17th September, 1867. Now pray listen to me well. The list must come back to me, according to solemn engagement when Mrs. Fermi went to Falmouth for it; or there must be arbitration, as accepted, before two gentlemen. I have now additional witnesses to testify on oath to my renewed peaceful steps. Call a meeting, even to the temporary neglect of your own affairs; and, I say so advisedly, the ruin produced is without parallel. This is my last word; I have done. Wisdom in time." "23rd September, 1867. To my own additional credit, I will add that the asking people to subscribe again, even if some would, it would only be for a year, and at the end of that I should be in the same plight again. Patchwork, with this prospect of quickly returning calamity in my spoliation, is abhorrent to a man of my age and declining health. Justice alone! I ask and beg all to obtain it for me. I do not profess Judaism; and if I did, I would undertake to show that a Jew is a man, by heaven! for all that. Stir, I implore you, and get me back the position and respect that are due to me." "3rd October, 1867. I saw Mr. Roselli. It is no farcing matter; never in the world there has been a subject more serious. To repeat its substance once more; one of these things must be done: 1st. The morning list to come all to me, as agreed when Mrs. Fermi went to Falmouth; or, 2nd. Arbitration, as accepted, before two gentlemen; or, 3rd. I give up my own list on receiving 14,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., yielding, at five per cent, the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year 1 cleared; or, 4th. The promoter of my spoliation to buy the other morning list, and give it to me in reparation. So everything has now been said and written, and wisdom in time recommended. Deeds alone, and quickly remain to prove that Justice must prevail, and that there is no Jew to throw into the Danube here, and no Christianity to shelter malefactors either." "21 Oct, 1867.—First steps in the beginning of the end. Mrs. F. is going, mad. At 2 this morning she upset the house, and ran away in her night-clothes. After much search she was found delirious in the garden. She talks of drowning herself and all the children. For the information of our assassins."—"31 Oct—To Mr. Zariff. Mr. Melas spoke to the man hired to assassinate me, and that man insulted him grossly. To-day boiled rice for all. Make the sign of the Cross."—"To Mr. Melas. 31 Oct, '67. So the man insulted grossly even you. To-day boiled rice for all. Make the sign of the cross."—To Mr. Ralli. Nov. 5, '67. In all solemnity save me from my approaching death by a broken heart; get back for me, for my</p>

               <p>wrecked large family, my property; move heaven and earth for it I im<lb></lb>plore you once more in all solemnity."—"Mem. Mr. Melas will please to send, or see Mr. Ionides, and make the appointment; Mr. Fermi will call in the course of the day for it." Shortly after the receipt of the letter of 31st October, I had business which took me abroad; I think it was about 10th November—(<hi rend="italic">Two other letters from the prisoner, dated 8th November, were also put in and read, describing the illness of his children, and the poverty of his family, and charging it upon the "dastardly malefactors" who recoiled at the ruin they had caused</hi>)—This paper is a pen-and-ink sketch of the neighbourhood of my house—it is in the prisoner's handwriting—it pretty accurately describes the locality of my house, and the streets leading to and from it—there are the names and addresses of a number of Greek merchants written on the other side—that is in the prisoner's writing—about 10th November I had occasion to go abroad—I remained abroad until the beginning of May—soon after my return, I received some other letters in the prisoner's handwriting—this is one—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">th May, to a similar effect, and stating that his earnings had amounted to</hi> 700<hi rend="italic">l. a year, which, capitalized at</hi> 5<hi rend="italic"> per cent., would give</hi> 14, 000<hi rend="italic">l., which he had claimed, and had been refused, instead of which he had only been offered charity, which he detested—he alluded to his own and his family's sufferings, and urged the necessity for immediate help and an appointment</hi>)—Upon the receipt of these letters, I placed myself in communication with my solicitors—I made no appointment—"4th June, 1868. I this day hand this memorandum to Mr. E. O. Ionides, to show round to his Greek friends. My home cannot hold us any longer, and we must leave or be ejected. Where to go it is impossible to foretell. I call attention to the Greeks, that such a state of things would induce any other man to destroy his whole family. With me they are safe; but I bring to the Greek knowledge that my wife—I cannot be responsible for what she may do, especially as I found her one day sitting alone in great gloom, and she told me she was thinking of shutting the children inside a box, and herself sitting over it till they should be smothered to death. They are seven in all, with the mother, all baptized Christians, and still entirely ruined by Christians, who mistook them for Jews."—I wrote this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and directed it to the prisoner—it was returned to me in an envelope, with the prisoner's writing on it—this is the letter:—"19, Old Broad Street, 12 June, '68. Sir, I am surprised that you should continue to annoy me with your letters. You are well aware that you have no species of claim upon me, and you must distinctly understand that under no cir<lb></lb>cumstances will you obtain any money from me, and if you again trouble me I intend to apply to the police, and cause you to be sent to prison."—This other letter is the prisoner's writing:—"11 June, 1868. To Mr. Melas. Move, and save this family. I propose that the Greeks and their friends would do as enclosed, and Mr. Coventry is ready to lend the Greeks every amount of co-operation. Save the adoration of Jesus, and before I die, let me see their existence securely restored."—The other papers (<hi rend="italic">looking at several</hi>) are also in the prisoner's writing—in one of the letters there ii the expression, "Make the sign of the Cross"—I understand the meaning of that to be, "Prepare for death"—it is an Italian expression—I am a Greek, but I understand Italian very well—that is the acceptation of the term generally among Italians.</p>

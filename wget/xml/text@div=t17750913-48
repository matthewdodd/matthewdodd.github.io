I had three shillings and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177509130037"></xptr> three-pence about me, some in my breeches and some in my coat pocket; I don't exactly know how much in one, and how much in the other, but all was taken from me; they asked me where I was going; I said, home; one asked me if I had a watch; I said, no, I had not. The prisoner laid his left-hand upon my breast, as I was not very willing to lie still, and said, if I did not lie still, he would murder me. When they had got what I had in my pocket they let me go; I immediately got up, and a watchman and I pursued him; at the King's-road-Bar, the watchman seized the prisoner; that was not more than five or six minutes after I was robbed. I was just behind, and came up upon the watchman's seizing him. I told the watchman he was the man; they took him to the watch-house; I had never seen him before; it was a star-light night; I saw enough of him before he knocked me down to observe him; I took more notice of him than I did of the other man, because he held me down.</p>
               <p>Valentine Fitzgerald. I am a watchman. Atkinson came to me that night about half past eleven; when I was about the Wheatsheaf going my rounds; he told me he had been robbed by two or three men; I pursued them, and by the turnpike I seized the prisoner. I saw at the same time, two other men going along by Bloody Bridge, but I cannot say the prisoner was in their company. Atkinson was at this time a little behind; when I came up to him, I told him, unless he could give a good account of himself, I would carry him to the round-house. Atkinson at this time came up, and said, watchman, that is one of the men who robbed me; I asked him if he was sure of it; he said, I am certain; upon which I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. From the Jury. Did Atkinson appear to be sober?</p>
               <p>Fitzgerald. He seemed to be as sober as he is now.</p>

               <p>I was going home about half after ten; I went into the sign of the Coat at Pimlico, I had a pint of beer there; I staid some time, I don't justly know how long, being somewhat in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. To the Watchman. Did he appear to be in liquor when you took him?</p>
               <p>Fitzgerald. He might have drank something, but he could talk and walk as well as I could.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-constable attached to the post-office—on the morning of 3d September, I went to the Northern District office before the letter carriers came, and placed myself in a position where I could com<lb></lb>mand a view of the water-closets—about half-past 6 o'clock I saw the prisoner come into one of them—he bolted the door as soon as he got in, and put a piece of paper against the ventilator of the closet through which I was looking—I pushed that a little aside, and still had a view of him—he then took two letters from his pocket, tore them open and took some coin from each of them—I could not see what sort of coin it was—he tore the letters up and put them down the pan of the closet—he then took a third letter from his pocket, tore that open and took something from it—he had not, during this timer unfastened his things at all—I pre<lb></lb>vented the water from flowing into the closet, and then went round to the door of the closet—whilst waiting at the door, I heard two pieces of coin drop on the stone floor of the closet in quick succession—about four minutes after I got to the door be came out—I took him to the comptroller's room, leaving Crocker, a police constable, in charge of the closet—at the inspector's room I saw Mr. Clare, the inspector of letter-carriers, and told him, in the prisoner's presence, that I had seen the prisoner tear up some letters and put them down the pan—the prisoner said he had not done so—I then searched him and took four sixpences, loose, from his waistcoat pocket, and also a purse from his trousers' pocket, containing 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a key—he gave me his address, and said the key would unlock his box in that room—he lived with his mother—I went there and found in a large box a smaller box, and also some keys, which he told me would unlock the little box—in that I found twenty-eight sovereigns and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in postage stamps</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186109230046"></xptr>
               <p>—the stamps were in two pieces—they have never been put on letter—I afterwards went with Blackburn, the plumber, to the closet, and saw him take some fragments of letters and envelopes from the pan of the closet, which he handed to me—I pasted them together—I found six envelopes—one addressed, "Mr. G. Cunnington, 16, Metcalfe-place, Pentonville-road, near the Angel, Islington"—that bears the Margate post-mark of 2d September, and the Northern District mark of 3d September—the second is, "Elizabeth Rice, 9, Highbury-terrace, Islington, London"—it bean the Leatherhead post-mark of September 2d, and the Northern District post-mark of 3d September—there is a third addressed, "Mr. J. Hislop, 23, River-street, York-road, London"—that bears the Wellington post-mark of 2d September, but the London post-mark is not plain enough to see—there is a fourth letter addressed, "Mrs. Graham, 11, Church-street, Upper-street, Islington, London," bearing the Thetford post-mark of 2d September, and the Northern District office mark of 3d September—there is a fifth addressed, "Mrs. Preston, Lower-road, Islington, London," bearing the Torpoint, Devonport, poet-mark, of 2d September, and the Northern District of 3d September—the sixth is, "Mrs. Henry Wallace, 9, Royal Henry-walk, Pit<lb></lb>field-street, Hoxton, London," bearing the Guernsey post-mark of 2d sep<lb></lb>tember, and the Northern District of 3d September—I was at those water<lb></lb>closets, that morning, before any letter-carriers arrived at the office—one person came into the closet about 6 o'clock—I watched him—he did not tear up anything or put anything in the pan—no other person besides him came.</p>

                  </hi>.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186109230047"></xptr>
               <p>on the morning of 3d September—the prisoner was there on duty dividing the letters—that was about half-past 6 o'clock—I saw him leave his seat with three or four letters in his hand, and return without them—he shortly afterwards got up again and went towards the door leading to the letter-carriers' water-closets, to the water-closet of which Bingham has spoken—about five minutes, perhaps, after I had seen him leave his seat Bingham brought him to me in the comptroller's office, and told me what he had seen—I asked the prisoner if that was so, and he said, "No"—I asked him if he had any letters in his pocket—he said, "No; at least I think not"—I told the police-officer to search him, and he produced from his pocket four sixpences, and a parse, and other things—I gave him into custody—all those letters, which have been produced might have come to the prisoner's hand in the course of sorting—they were not for his district—I asked him if he had been sorting that morning—he said, "Yes"—I asked him what sort of letters, and he said, "All sorts of letters."</p>

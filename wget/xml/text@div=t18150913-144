In the early part of the year 1813, we were possessed of a good many houses, which we built ourselves; I believe we had about eighty cottages of different sizes; some in Summerford field, Mile end; Others in Globe fields. They were of considerable value; I had no dealings with Birch before the year 1813.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Q. Were you in that year, at all embarrassed for money, and if so, at what time - A. About April I was a little pushed for money, but it did not arise from insolvency, but merely from a temporary run which we had not at that time the means of supplying. The first of my creditors that were the most pressing, was Mr. Norman, of Earl street. The next was Mr. Bumford.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you recourse to Birch - A. Yes, I sent for him to become one of my bail.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you sent for him for that purpose, was there any account subsisting between you - A. Not any. He did not become my bail, but prefered to pay the debt; for which Mr. Bumford accepted a bill as security for eighty pounds four shillings. Birch agreed to the security. and Mr. Bumford gave him a bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the bill - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Bill read, drawn by Miller and Leavitt, accepted, by Bumford, and endorsed by Birch.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181509130052"></xptr>Q. Is that endorsement Birch's hand writing - A. It is; eighty four pounds four shillings; but there were some little expences, the sum for which I was arrested was not so much, but the bill was drawn enough to cover the expences. I think Mr. Birch, and Mr. Bumford to the best of my reccollection, went to pay that bill. I afterwards had a communication with Birch on the state of my affairs; I told him I was affraid of being arrested by the same party; and asked him, if he could lend me the money to pay the bill which amounted to a hundred pounds. He said he had not the money, about him, but recommended me to call upon Mr. Gower: after seeing Gower, I returned to him for the purpose of seeing if he knew any body who could lend me the money. I told him I had applied to Gower, who was in company with a gentleman named Kinnaird. Mr. Kinnard said he had been making a purchase, and he did not know how he stood upon his bankers; books, but he said if I would join Birch in a bill for a hundred pounds he could give me a draft, which he did; and that bill was paid afterwards by Mr. Birch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Birch ever after that. get the hundred pounds from you - A. He had more of me; I think the bill became due in May, and some few days afterwards, I handed him the money; or he had money's worth of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you say, that after this you received some money - A. I received money on the 19th of May, on an annuity deed.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person who paid you - A. Mr. Brownsworth; and my solicitor was Mr. Christie. I went to execute the annuity deed in company with my partner, Leavitt; Birch, and Reynolds a publican and builder, at that time living at Mile end; to Mr. Christie's office. Birch went with me to give security on the annuity, against my being a bankrupt in two months. I received four hundred and eighty odd pounds. Leavit, Birch and Reynolds dined with me, on the same day at the top of Fleet street. After dinner, I withdrew with Birch, into the next room; and gave him nearly the whole of the money at that time; I can't say exactly how much, but I think about four hundred pounds. After that we adjourned to Mr. Nelsons, in the neighbourhood of Temple bar; for me to assign to Birch eleved houses; and I did assign them, Mr. Nelson had been spoken to before I gave him instructions to make a lease to assign the houses over to

            . Before I went to Mr. Nelsons, I had deposited an agreement, in Birch's hands; which I executed in going to Mr. Nelson's; Mr. Birch executed part with me. About the same quantity of money that I gave him before, he returned the same sum of money to me in Nelson's presence. We then left Nelson's office, and returned to the eating house; I returned him the same money in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you return it to him again - A. I returned it to him, that he might keep it; and to draw it as I had occasion. We then parted for the day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Making him your banker - A. Yes. The next morning, I called upon him for a hundred pounds to pay the bill, with the joint acceptance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Was that the hundred pound bill upon which Kinnaird's draft was granted - A. Yes, Birch paid it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hundred pounds, applied to the eighty, pound four shilling bill - A. No, I went to him, and he gave me a hundred pound note to pay the eighty pounds four shilling bill with, which I went to Messrs Down, Thornton, and Co and took up the bill, kepping the overplus myself.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time did you come to any agreement or understanding of money matters - A. Yes, I told him of the state of my affairs, and told him I was involved in difficulties. He persuaded me to assign eleven more houses, besides the former eleven to him, to raise money upon them to supply my wants.</p>

               <p>Q. Was this the proposition to you - A. It was; and I took steps towards carrying it into effect; Mr. Nelson was employed to make out the instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was this done - A. I think about June, and the other was about the 20th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you execute any deeds then - A. I did; and deliver them into Birch's hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Notice had been given to produce those deeds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. The deed was made over. Yardley made the assignment over, and the money was paid at Yardley's office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Miller. Nelson was employed to make out the ground land instrument, and Yardley was employed to make assigment to Birch, to the amount of three or four hundred pounds, paid by Birch to me; that money was part my own, and one or two of the bills were his, and one was mine. He had received about three hundred pounds of me.</p>
               <p>Q. What bill was it of yours that he paid back to you - A. On the bill of twenty pounds. After I left the office, I returned to Birch, and paid him back the money, and all the bills; not all the money, but the greater part. He was to keep it in security for me, and I was to draw it when I wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. Why was not Yardley employed to do this - A. Because he was Birch's attorney, and might be suspected.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the next application? Was it to make him owner of the property, that he might raise money for your use - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did he do it rather than yourself - A. Because I was in difficulty, and he could do it without any.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it customary for him on these occasions, to ask you for a voucher - A. Yes; he used to write it down upon a piece of paper, and make me sign it. I kept account against him, and he kept another against me.</p>
               <p>Q. After he made this proposition to you about the sureties, did you go to him again to raise money - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How many houses were assigned to him - A. Twenty-two; and the value about one hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did you make over to him after that - A. Nineteen, and part of two.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the value of the forty-one houses - A. About two thousand pounds; seven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181509130053"></xptr>hundred pounds were raised upon the twenty-two first houses; and that seven hundred pounds went into Birch's pocket. In the whole, I might have got of that, between two and three hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. How much in the whole did you receive from Birch for all the houses - A. I don't think that I received a shilling. I received about three hundred pounds for the annuity deeds. This transaction happened previous to my bankruptcy. The last time I assigned over any of my property was on the 7th of September, 1813. After September, my affairs pressed upon me, and I had a communication with Birch.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you - A. He said the best thing would be for me to be a bankrupt; he persuaded me after that time to be a bankrupt; it was arranged two months after the 7th of September, that he should strike a docket against me, for the purpose as he said, for me to have part of the property back again, namely the houses, that I had assigned over to him. At this time, and not before, I had a communication with the prisoner Dowding, at his own house, at Mile End.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to go there - A. We had often met at a public-house. Birch was present, and they pursuaded me to issue out some accommodation bills; which I did, in a considerable quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by accommodation bills - A. Bills which they were to give to fictitious creditors, to prove under the commission of bankruptcy, upon my estate, in order for me to procure the certificate. The property was to remain in Birch's hands, until after the bankruptcy, and then he returned to me, that I might pay such creditors as I thought proper. There were some stamps procured, some of which, I signed in blank; some Dowding wrote, and some I filled up myself; some of them were made complete, and one or two were filled up by a person named Grey, and there was another person, whom I don't know; I gave the biggest part of these bills to Dowding, for him to circulate them to different people; he was to give them to whom he thought proper; I signed one for Dufton. Dowding gave them to different people. Birch had only one to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the description of that one - A. It was for three hundred and forty-nine pounds nineteen shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and him before you drew this bill and gave it to him - A. He told me to get a bill drawn up for him, that he might appear the biggest creditor; Dufton wrote the body of that bill, and I signed it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any consideration pass between you and. Birch for that bill, at that time, or before - A. None</p>
               <p>Q. Was he your debtor, or you his - A. He owed me money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards meet Birch - A. Yes; Dowding and Hughes were present.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know a man named Rigs - A. No, not until after the docket was struck, and he was to do it. We some times met at Birch's house, near Finsbury-square. It was on the 27th of November that I attended the bankruptcy at Guildhall,</p>
               <p>Q. Had you continued up to that time in your own residence, or had you removed - A. I removed on the 7th of November, from Hinton-street, to No. 7, Ropemaker's-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to move - A. Birch persuaded me to move, and had taken an apartment for me.</p>
               <p>Q. In what name did he take the lodgings for you, and what name did you assume - A. The name of Thompson.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of your goods - A. They were removed after I was removed, as I was told, by Birch and Dowding.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did Birch remove you to this lodging - A. He advised me to keep out of the way of my creditors, that he might have a docket struck against me, and for me to keep out of the way until it was struck. I passed by the name of Thompson. Birch used to come and see me two or three times a day. He told me my goods were removed a week afterwards, and said, he assisted in removing them; he said he would keep them for me, until I got my certificate, and he would give them to me afterwards. Before I went to Guildhall, Birch and Dowding told me what had been done with some of the bills; Dowding told me he had passed them away to different persons; he said, Dufton had one and Kent had one; he told me other names, but I don't recollect them; and he had some himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there at that time, any debt owing from you to Kent, to Dufter, or to Dowding - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he name a man named Drake - A. Yes; Dowding told me Drake had a bill; Drake lived in Whitechapel, and was not a creditor of mine. I had met Birch and Dowding at Drake's house by appointment, to talk over these affairs. Dowding used some times to talk it over in Drake's presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Where and whom did you meet on the first morning that you went before the commissioners at Guildhall, on the 27th of November, or thereabouts - A. I met Dowding at Birch's, and that was before I went before the commissioners; we had some conversation. They went with me to Guildhall, and it was appointed that Dowding should meet us that morning, to go with us to Guildhall, to prove my act of bankruptcy; a man had been procured to go and prove it, but he would not go; and Dowding went into the street, and brought in a man named Nobles, who was to go before the commissioners to prove the act of bankruptcy. We all went then to Guildhall; Nobles was examined before the commissioners, but I was not present. After the examination was over, we went to an eating-house across Cheapside, and there one was speaking about the bills; but nothing was said about assignees. Birch was intended to have been an assignee from the very first. The next meeting was to be on the 4th of December; Briggs, Hughes's clerk, wrote out some depositions to prove debts. I saw several strangers with fictitious bills, which Dowding had given them. When I went to Guildhall, I saw young Dufton, Birch, Robinson, and several others offer themselves as creditors. On that day there was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181509130054"></xptr>a dinner after we came from Guildhall, and Birch asked several to choose him as assignee, and Mr. Reynolds, who was not present. I understood that the persons who were to prove these fictitious bills, had make Reynolds and Birch assignees, were to have a pound a piece. Afterwards there was a conversation in my presence between Birch and Dowding, at Dowding's shop, and Birch said, if there is not enough bills, never mind a few pounds in stamps, let there be bills enough. Accordingly some more were made. Hughes thought there was not sufficient proved when we applied to him; altogether, there was about one thousand pounds worth of bills. I was not to let the just creditors prove their debts, by Birch's and Dowding's direction; and I was to say the fictitious bills were just debts; and if I was asked what consideration was given for the bills, I was to say, I lent my acceptances to Dowding and others, and they had been passed away. Those houses which I had disposed of to Birch, I was to say, he had bought, and paid for. On the meeting, on the 11th, some were proved, and some were rejected. On the third meeting, they asked me, in Birch's presence, where my residence was? and Birch interposed, and told them where I lived. I made no answer where I did live. I was previously told by Birch, not to give them a direct answer. The commissioners enquired after my books; I told them some were at Hughes's. A messenger was directed to accompany me to get them; and as I was going along, Birch stopped me, and said, he was my bail, and would not let me go; nor did I return to the commissioners; but Birch took me away. Birch paid for the dinner at the tavern, where the men who held the bills, dined. I was not at that dinner. Birch, who paid my lodging in Ropemaker's-street, said it was necessary that I should remove; which I did, to a lodging in Cripplegate, where I remained until the 6th of January, when I surrendered to the Fleet. My books at that time had not been delivered to the assignees. It was Birch that told me to go to prison. (Book put into the hands of the witness.) This is one of my account books. Here is a cash account, in which, there is an alteration made by the direction of Birch, of the sum of three hundred and ninety-six pounds nineteen shillings and sixpence, and is in my handwriting. I did not surrender my books to the commissioners, because Birch persuaded me not. (The witness now proceeded, by the direction of the counsel for the prosecution, to mark several false entries in his Book, which he had made by the direction of Birch.) I was supported in the Fleet by Birch, and after that, went to the King's Bench. After my surrender, I submitted to an examination before the commissioners, and was committed for gross prevarication, I had seven examinations, and had the assistance of counsel, Mr. Montague; for all of which expences, Birch paid.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I was twelve months in prison before I gave up the second account; and that I gave up because I saw my error.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the prisoner Dowding. I have bought blankets of you; I know you are a cloth-draper, and had large bill transactions with you; you were in the King's Bench for one of my bills; but I believe you have got most of the money or goods for it.</p>

            . I was present at some meetings before my husband's bankruptcy, with Mr. Birch and Mr. Dowding; and heard them propose to effect the act of bankruptcy. I heard them planning about it; but I don't think they were very anxious that I should hear. I saw some of the fictitious bills made. My husband left his house on Sunday, the 7th of November, and assumed the name of Thompson. Birch came the next morning, with a young man, named Thompson, before it was day-light, and moved part of the furniture. After it was removed, I went to Ropemaker's-street. After the second meeting of the commissioners, we removed to a tobacconist's, at Cripplegate. Dowding came very frequently while we were in Ropemaker's-street. Birch supplied us with money while we were in lodgings. My husband remained in lodgings until he surrendered to the Fleet, where he was about five weeks, and in the Bench about a year. Birch supplied him with money while in confinement.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. We were not intimate with Mr. Birch. I never asked him to move a bed, nor said, it would be a bad job to lie at the back of my brother-in-law; I never said to any one, I never saw any person hanged, but would make a hanging match, and go to see Birch.</p>

After that, I saw them at Mr. Reynold's public-house, the Collingwood; while I was there, Dowding requested me to present a bill of Miller's. (Bill put into the hands of the witness.) This is the bill: Dowding's name is written upon it, and so is mine. I tried to pay it away. but did not succeed. Dowding asked me to go to Guildhall, to prove the act of bankruptcy.

I went to the meeting to prove my bill, but did not like to attempt, as I saw so many. I returned to the French Horn, and saw about thirty persons there come for dinner; some of them were persons whom I had seen at Guildhall,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181509130055"></xptr>attempting to prove bills. Birch did come into the dinner room, but took Miller away with him; I saw them send Miller for his books with a messenger from Guildhall; and I saw Birch insist on taking him away, saying he was his bail. Several people made a piece of work with Dowding for their pound notes, which they were to have, for proving their fictitious bills; and particularly one Drake. Dowding said he was afraid he should have to pay all the expences, because Birch and Reynolds had not been chosen assignees, Dowding told them to hold their tongues about it; but some of them wished to have their money, and wanted to go home.</p>

I saw Dowding give to a man named Taylor, a bill for ninety seven pounds, ten shillings; which he was to prove on the estate. (Bill put into the hands of the witness.) That is the bill. (Another bill put into the hands of the witness.) That is the bill, with which I was to answer the same purpose. Dowding said it was a mere matter of form; I said it was a matter of form I did not understand, and did not like. I saw Dowding give bills to other people at the French Horn; and I went to Guildhall with them, but did not attempt to prove my bill. I afterwards went and dined with them.</p>

            . I assisted Mr. Birch in removing my brother's goods. We used to begin between five and six in the morning, before it was light. We used to leave off about a quarter before seven; some of the goods were removed to Dowding's but Birch told me to say, that they were all gone to Globe fields, and to make as much a fool of myself as I could; and to speak as broad as a countryman; some went to No. 1, Ann street, Globe fields; which was an empty house. The rest, six other loads, were taken somewhere else that I dont know; by a young man named Thompson. I afterwards received orders from Birch to break open No. 1, Ann street, as if there had been thieves; and I was to say that to Mr. Bumford, or to any of the creditors, that should ask me; I took the things out of the house, by Birch's orders, and was to say this to make it appear they had been stolen. I broke open the door with an axe, by his direction. Soon after this, my brother got into the Fleet, and I saw Birch and him looking over some accounts there, and papers; and I saw my brother sign some blank papers, by Birch's request. I have carried money from Birch to my brother; I received a paper from the commissioners summoning me to attend them, which Birch told me to lose, and not to attend. A second came, and a third came; and Birch told me not to attend until they fetched me; and then he said, I was not to know anything. Dowding also assisted me in moving the goods. Birch said if I got into prison, or any trouble, I should not long he in it; he would get me out.</p>

            . I know Miller and Leavitt, and was a creditor of theirs in November, 1813. Miller told me he was going to have a docket struck against him, and he would make it all right afterwards with me; and in consequence of that, I promised to be his friend. He asked me to attend the first meeting, and prove my debt; I was also to attend the choice of assignees; and was to chuse Birch and Reynolds. After dinner, Birch called for the bill and paid it.</p>

I told him I did not know the parties; and afterwards he said, if I would only go and prove the bill at Guildhall he would give me a one pound note.

               <p>MR. EDWARD BUMFORD. At the time of the dissolution of the affairs of Miller and Leavitt, I was a creditor of theirs to the amount of several hundred pounds. At the meeting of the commissioners, several persons attempted to prove bills; Mr. Sheffield as our solicitor, cross-examined them, and their proofs were rejected. Miller was asked where he then lodged, by Mr. Sheffield; he hesitated, and then said No. 2, Neck lane. He was then asked whether his books were to be found there? then Birch said, he lived at No. 7, Ropemaker street; and he took the lodging to keep him from wandering in the streets. He was again asked where his books were? and after some hesitation, he said at Hughes's his attorney's in Dean street, Fetter lane. He was then ordered to accompony Mr. Codd and me to Hughes's, to deliver up the books. On our going into the hall, we were surrounded by a number of persons, who had been offering to prove bills; amongst whom was Birch; Birch took hold of Miller's left arm and said to me, he shall not go with you, he shall go with me; I am his bail. In fact, Miller was rescued from us. I went back, and the commissioners were dispersed. I then went to Hughes's but could not get the books. I then went to No. 7, Ropemaker street, and enquired for Miller by name, but could not find him I went to Birch's also, but could not find him.</p>

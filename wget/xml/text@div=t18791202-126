                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer G</hi>). In consequence of information I went on 18th November to Mr. Smith's, a pawnbroker's, of Byfield Street, Hoxton—I received this umbrella from there—next day I apprehended Sowden—on the way to the station he said, "You see that woman on the opposite side?"—I said "Yes"—he said, "She has got the rest of the silk; if you will allow me to go into the public-house I will tell you all about it"—I allowed him to go into the public-house—he said, "A man that comes from Brixton brought the umbrellas to my place and the silk, and asked me to get a customer for it; two I got a man to pawn for me, one I sold to a man of the name of Harris in Hoxton, and the silk I left at Mr. Blackett's in the City Road"—he had been then told the charge by Osborn, and then he said he knew nothing about the robbery—he was then taken to the station and ldentified by Mr. Blackett as the man who left the silk, and he Mid, "Tee, I did leave the silk."</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Before the Magistrate Lloyd and Wotherspoon said they were not guilty. Sowden said:</hi> "It was brought to me, and they said it was bought at a sale, and when I found from the landlord it was different he said, 'There is some property in the house you ought to get rid of.' I went upstairs and asked my wife, who was ill in bed, if there was anything left here. She said, 'Yes, a parcel with five umbrellas, left here by the name of Wotherspoon,' and I could hardly believe it. With that I took the umbrellas and the piece of silk to the man on Saturday, and when I found it was got wrong—folly I left it there, and would have no more to do with it".</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Lloyd, in defence, said a young mem asked him to pawn two or three umbrellas for him when he was waiting about far a job, and as he had left two or three children without breakfast he was glad to earn a few shllings. The key had been in the door of his room ever since he lived there till his wife brought it to him in the cell on the Sunday. Wotherspoon said he was perfectly innocent and knew nothing of the charge. Sowden said a person who was ill asked Mm to sell the goodsf saying they were bought at a sale, and he tried to sell them.</hi>

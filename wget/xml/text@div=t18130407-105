On the 18th of November the prisoner came to my shop; I am sure of his person. He asked for a quarter of a pound of iron wire; that would be three-pence. I told him I would serve him directly. I was serving a customer at the time, and another was waiting. I left him at the counter. He was of one side, and I the other. There is a recess on the counter, about a foot high. There is some holes in that recess with locks in these holes. They were within reach of where he stood. I gave the drawer to the customer. I was first serving for him to take an article out. He asked me to get a handle to it. I went to get an handle to it, and then I went to the vice, to put the handle on. Mr. Read told me the prisoner had taken something. I asked the prisoner if he had got any thing of mine. He said, no. I observed his pocket bulky. I put my hand down, and felt something hard. I told him I insisted on seeing what was in his pockets. He pulled a paper parcel out of his pocket, and put it on the counter. I took the goods, and said, is not that my private mark. That parcel contained box locks. I told him, I thought that was not all. He pulled out another paper that contained box locks. He afterwards took out two more papers. Three of the papers contained twenty-five box locks and one paper of desk locks.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. On this day I was in Mr. Bond's shop. I saw the prisoner there. There is a place on all ironmongers counters, which we call pigeon-holes. I was at that place; I saw the prisoner take three papers out of the pigeon-holes, and put them in his pocket. I and Mr. Bond challanged him with it. He took the papers out of his pocket, and tried to shove them in the pigeon-holes. I did not see him take the fourth.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Bond and Woodward.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other person in the shop except Mr. Bond and yourself - A. No. I came into the shop; the prisoner had a little bit of wire in his hand. He asked me to serve him. I got a bundle down that was not exact the size. I was going to get another bundle down, and Mr. Read challenged him with a paper parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him move towards the pigeon-holes - A. While I was serving him he had his hand over the place. I did not see him move his hand into the pigeon-holes. I afterwards saw the papers taken out of his pocket. I am quite sure they are my master's property.</p>

               <p>THOMAS BARKER. I am the father of Mary Barker. - On the 14th of August she went out with the child, who had a shawl on; she returned about three o'clock, without the shawl.</p>
               <p>MARY BARKER. I am nine years old. I was coming from my grandmother's, in Whitecross-street; I met a lady, and I met the prisoner at the corner of Banner-street - she asked if I knew the lady, and asked where I was going - I said, home to Old-street: she said, "Don't go up Whitecross-street - there is a mad horse tumbled down;" she took me up Banner-street, and wanted me to go to the field, then took me to the mad-house - she took me up Brick-lane, and said my mother wanted the shawl, but I would not let her have it till I got opposite our door; she then took it, ran over, and pretended to give it to my sister; I went in soon after, and found my mother had not sent for it.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. On the 9th of October I met Mary Barker, who pointed the prisoner out, with three other girls; she said she was certain she was the girl who took her shawl - I asked the prisoner to go with me to the child's father; she said she had no objection, but went reluctantly.</p>
               <p>MARY BARKER re-examined. I know her by her talk, and her face - I was about an hour and a half with her.</p>

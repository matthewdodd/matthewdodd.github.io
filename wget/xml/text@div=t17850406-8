               <p>I am a cooper; the prisoner worked journey-work with me at the time that he offered these staves to sell; which was about the 8th of March, he offered twenty-nine staves to me to sell; he brought them in a bag at two or three times; at last he brought the heads, and on one there was a mark of Munday, and on the other the mark of Charrington; then I told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060019"></xptr> him I would not have any concern with them, because I thought they were stolen; I desired him to take them away; he said he would, but he did not; I informed the prosecutors, and they came and claimed them.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the staves belonged to these heads? - The prisoner told me they did; he told me there were fourteen or fifteen.</p>
               <p>Is that about the quantity? - Generally, but sometimes there are more and sometimes less; he said he bought them of a young man; he scratched the burnt marks out of the head of the casks, after they were brought to our house, as he told me.</p>

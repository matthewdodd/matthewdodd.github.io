                  </hi>. I am a labourer, in the employ of Mr. Grimwade, a farmer at Sheepcote-farm, Harrow. On the 7th of March, in consequence of instruction from my master, I watched the prisoners, about a quarter to six o'clock in the evening I went to the stable for a truss of hay for my nag, and then returned to a barn—I saw Weatherly, the hay-binder, making hay<lb></lb>bands bands—I saw him cut two trusses, and lay them down beside the cart—he bound them—he then got up in the cart, and began to load it—Lancaster handed up the hay to him—he put up two trusses first, and then put up thirty-six trusses more—that was two trusses beyond a load—Lancaster was helping load them all.</p>

In consequence of directions from the prosecutor, I went to his premises, on the morning of the 8th of March, about half-past two o'clock—Lancaster came into the rick-yard about a quarter to four, and took away about half a truss of hay—there was a load of hay loaded on the cart in the rick-yard—he took it out—I followed him from Harrow to the New-road, Chelsea—he went into Mrs. Johnson's shop</p>

               <p>there and came out—I went and asked how many trusses of hay he had in the cart, he said he did not know—I then went and asked Mrs. Johnson if she had bought the hay, she said she had—I saw the hay unloaded, and after thirty-six trusses were put into the loft, two trusses were left in the bottom of the cart—I asked what he was going to do with those two trusses—he said he should have left them there—I took him into custody—I had counted the hay with the prosecutor before it left—I could only count thirty-six trusses—if there was more, they must have been concealed in the bottom.</p>

I was in company with Phil<lb></lb>lips, on the morning of the 8th of March, on the prosecutor's premises—I accompanied him to Chelsea—when the hay was stopped there Phillips went and asked Lancaster what he had got outside, he said he did not know that he had got any more than a load of hay, and while I was in the shop Mrs. Johnson asked him whether he had got any more than a load of hay, he said he did not know that he had—I went into the loft and counted the trusses of hay out of the cart into the loft—there was thirty-six, and two remaining in the cart, besides one truss which was for the horses—there was thirty-nine trusses in the whole—I afterwards returned to Harrow, and apprehended Weatherly—I cautioned him not to say anything to me except he thought proper, as what he said to me would be used in evidence, either for or against him—on our way to the station, he said he was afraid it would be found out, that Lancaster had said to him he wanted two trusses of hay, and it would be all right—after we got to the station, he said he could not sleep all the night before, for fear he should be found out.</p>

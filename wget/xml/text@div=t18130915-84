On the 27th of June, about half after ten at night, I fell in company with the prisoner in Whitechapel; I had been to see an acquaintance in Spitalfields; I fell in company with the woman at the corner of Essex-street, Whitechapel; I asked her the way to Execution-dock, I wanted to go to Deptford; I thought I could cross from Execution-dock to Deptford. I was the worse for liquor. She said it was late, I had better come and get a bed; I said. I would rather go home. She catched me by the breast, she said come along, go to bed, you cannot get home. I went up stairs with her into a room in <placeName id="t18130915-84-crimeloc496">Essex-street</placeName>

I said, I would not sleep there; she shoved me down, and said I must strip and go to bed; she pushed me down on the bed, she pulled my watch out of my fob; she ran out of the room with my watch, and shut the door. It was a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the watch since - A. Yes; at the pawnbroker's. I gave five guineas for it; I had it three years; it is worth two guineas. I remained in the room about a quarter of an hour; being a stranger I did not know what to do, and then a man shoved the door open, and muttered some words in a threating tone of voice; he collared me, and knocked me down; I got up, and struck him, and scratched his face; he did not say what he was. When I scratched his face, he knocked me down again, and when I was getting up, he shoved me out of the room; my hat fell off; he took it up and looked at it, and threw it out of the room after me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him since - A. No. He followed me into the passage, and struck me; this room was up two pair of stairs. A man opened the door in his shirt, with a candle in his hand; the man left me alone, and went to him, he called him Jack; he said see the way this fellow has left my face, shewing his face to the man; I saw his face then, it was all over blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that man the prisoner at the bar - A. He was about the size of him, I cannot swear to the man. Jack shut the door, and he knocked me down again in the passage, and there I laid till day light.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the last blow deprive you of your senses - A. Yes, entirely; I lay in a gore of blood until the morning; I could not see out of my eyes; when I got up I went into the opposite room to where I had been robbed; I told a woman and a man how I had been robbed; they directed me to go to Lambeth-street office. I went to the office; I described the woman to Dalton, the officer, and the prisoner; the woman was brought to the office; I knew her again. I told the officer I was quite sure she was the woman that robbed me of my watch, and I now say upon my oath, she is the woman.</p>

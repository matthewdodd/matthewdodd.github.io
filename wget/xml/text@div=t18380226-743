In consequence of something which happened, I fetched the prisoner to my master's shop on the 2nd of February—as we were bringing her into the shop, two shawls fell from her, and these other two we had detained—they had been brought to the shop before she came—I saw the private mark on one of them, which led me to suppose they belonged to the same person—I detained the prisoner, and gave her to the officer.</p>

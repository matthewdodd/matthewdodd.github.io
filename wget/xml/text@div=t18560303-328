It has been left by an aunt, dying intestate, he has token this property as heir at law; the will may be seen in Doctors' Commons: 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. having been paid, and 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is to be paid in a month. I believe him to be an industrious, upright, trust<lb></lb>worthy man. I am not known at all in London. Yours, etc., J. W. Col<lb></lb>lins." "Gendlemen,—I know Mr. Henry Jackson and family quite well; he has been selling some land left him by a relative to a farmer here. I have no hesitation in saying that his position and circumstances are good, himself and family very respectable. I have no doubt any engagement he may enter into will be duly attended to.

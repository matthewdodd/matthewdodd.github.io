On March the 28th, Mr. Knott put some bank-notes between the bed and the matrass. The next morning we found they had been undone. I was sure there were some gone: I could not tell how many. I looked in her box on the Sunday fortnight after the money was taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 1st of April did you there see a one-pound note - A. Yes. I knew it again. I had written upon it when I took it. I knew it to be my husband's property. I sent for Miller, the officer. He searched the box, and the note was not in the box. The note was afterwards produced to me at the office.</p>

She immediately cried out for assistance, upon which two other women came up, and she gave something to them. I suppose my money. As she took her hand out of my pocket, she drew my pocket almost out, I am sure it was the prisoner's hand that was in my pocket. My money was lose in my pocket. I could not see what it was she gave to the other women. She shoved her hand in their face. I took her to the watch-house, where she was searched, but nothing was found upon her.</p>
               <p>Was any one else near when her hand came out of your pocket? - Nobody so near as she was. She called out to the others; they come up and blasted her, and bid her give it to them.</p>

               <p>I had been at a christening, and had drank rather more than did me good. As I was coming down Ludgate-Hill I was sick. I turned up a court; two women were coming out of the court, the gentleman laid hold of me, and said he believed I was one of the women he was with. He laid hold of both my hands, and led me to the watch-house. I was searched immediately, and nothing found upon me but a shilling and a thimble. He never loosed my hands till he brought me to the watch-house.</p>

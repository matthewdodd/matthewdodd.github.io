On the 17th of April I told her I should like to examine the bedding; I went to take the bedstead down, she then told me it was deficient of every thing; I said, you have not taken away my bed, have you; she said, yes. When I found all my things were gone I took her in custody; at the watchhouse she said I should find the duplicates in the room; I found all the duplicates, except of the bed, which was pawned for one pound five shillings, and when I went to the pawnbroker's it was taken out. I found all the property except the bed.</p>

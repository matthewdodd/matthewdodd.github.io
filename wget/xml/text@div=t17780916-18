I discharged her upon a regular warning; I had no intelligence of any of these things till the 31st of August. On the day after the prisoner quitted my service, I gave her a good character upon an application to another place, but did not know to what place she was then going. Two or three weeks after she had quitted my service, having occasion to use some of these particulars, I then discovered they had been taken away; I suspected the prisoner, but did not know where to find her; part of the things were found on the 31st of August by an extraordinary accident. Mr. Seddon, a jeweller, in Salisbury-court, Fleet street, is employed as a workman for my brother; my brother went to Mr. Seddon's, he was let into the house by the prisoner, who had my gown upon her; he gave me information of this, I went to Mr. Seddon's, I saw the prisoner with my gown and petticoat on her; upon searching, some of the things were found in her box, and others of them in the kitchen, in her possession; some of the things were afterwards found in the possession of the prisoner's sister: the prisoner's sister was three times at my house, in order to see the prisoner.</p>

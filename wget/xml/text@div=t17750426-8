            . On Sunday was five weeks the 19th of March, I was coming to London from Bath; I called at Patridge's at Salt Hill, and desired him to let me have a good pair of horses, that would carry me over <placeName id="t17750426-8-crimeloc37">Hounslow-heath</placeName>

The boy drove at the rate of a mile in three minutes and a half and four minutes Mr. Penwarne was in the chaise with me, and his servant rode behind the chaise; I delivered him a pistol; we were stopped just at the enterance of the last heath towards Hounslow; which I find since, is called <placeName id="t17750426-8-crimeloc38">Butcher's Grove</placeName>

I saw at a distance two men coming from the Heath into the road, they road, they rode on at a moderate rate towards the chaise, it was between the two Heaths; we were going at the rate of fourteen or fifteen miles an hour, they were coming moderately on at the rate of five or six mile an hour: when they came within about five yards of the heads of the horses, one dropped on one side of the chaise, and the other on the other, and came up to the body of the chaise; just as they were about the windows of the chaise, the man on the right hand of the chaise cried Holloa, stop, and the chaise immediately stopped. I find since that that was Barret , by his being taken in the situation in which he was with his hair over his shoulders, I laid hold of a pistol and dropped my own glass, the glass on that side was up, we were going so fast I suppose it was all done in two or three seconds before they came to the chaise door; as soon as the man upon the right hand side cried holloa stop, he said d - n you down with your door, as soon as my glass was let down, the man on the left hand side run a pistol into the side of the chaise, and said, d - n your blood deliver your money, or I will blow your brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a pistol was it.</p>

               <p>Pike. It appeared to be a short pistol, the lock was on the side of the barrel in the old fashion way, I leaned forward to look at him, he cried G - d d - n you, he swore very much, he appeared very drunk. I told him not to behave ill, and he would have what he wanted presently; after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177504260006"></xptr> that, he swore very much; he was not I suppose pleased at my looking at him; he said God d - n you be quick or I will blow your brains out; at the instant, I was lifting my pistol to fire at him, for I thought myself in great danger from him as a drunken man: at that instant the pistol came in at the other door, and the other man said d - n you deliver your money instantly; finding there was one on each side, I thought I had better desist.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose that pistol was presented to the other gentleman in the chaise?</p>
               <p>Pike. It was in the chaise door; they endeavoured to avoid shewing their faces a good deal, but I saw the faces of both of them. I gave them more than five shillings: Gregory was on the left hand, my side of the chaise, Barrett on the other side. I gave my purse to Barrett, and so did Mr. Penwarne.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to give your purse to the man on your side?</p>
               <p>Pike. He appeared to be drunk, he reeled upon his horse, I imagined he was in danger of falling from his horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give your purse as well as the five shillings?</p>
               <p>Pike. Yes, Barrett said, when I gave my purse, let the gentlemen off. Barrett behaved exceeding well, very decent; he did not appear so violent, nor did I apprehend myself in so much danger from him as Gregory; I thought that, as a drunken man, he might have inadvertently fired, and his pistol was within a few inches of my head. As soon as I had delivered my purse, and Barrett had left me, Gregory said, Now G - d d - n you, now for your watches.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they both demand your watches?</p>
               <p>Pike. Yes, I told him I had none: he said, G - d d - n you, say upon your honour. To comply with his whim, I said, I had none upon my honour; he bid me say so again, which I did; then he said to the driver, D - n you go on, or I will blow your brains out. The driver drove on to Hounslow: when we came to the corner, there were some lusty young fellows standing there. I said, my lods, I am this moment robbed, there is forty pounds a piece reward for you, and I have a brace of pistols, and you may have the horses. They swore they would go after them. I ordered the driver to get fresh horses, and go to London. I was a good deal fatigued, I had come from Bridgwater, which is near a hundred and fifty miles that day; and I got into London about eight o'clock: I went to the coffee house, and sent for one of Sir

               <p>Pike. Perfectly so, I verily believe them to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not undertake to say positively that they are?</p>
               <p>Pike. I beg to be excused saying that; the one rode upon a bay horse, the other upon a black horse; the person that was upon my side upon the left hand, was upon a black horse or a more: the person on the right side of the chaise, rode upon a bay horse.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might they be at the chaise?</p>
               <p>Pike. Five or six minutes, as near as I can recollect. I have received a letter respecting the prisoners, from one Littleton.</p>
               <p>Court. That is not evidence.</p>
               <p>Pike. I mention it with respect to the person that wrote it, that it might be found out, but I don't mention it as a circumstance of any disadvantage to the prisoners, not in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Pike. We came to town on Sunday evening, the 19th of March, I believe it was last Sunday was five weeks. Sir

             had sent to several people in town. That letter was left for me at Mr. Reddington's, in Fenchurch Street; and in consequence of that letter I went to Bow-Street, I saw Barrett<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177504260007"></xptr> in the room: he had flaxen hair; he had irons over his hands: this was about eleven, next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they both at Sir John's, or only one?</p>
               <p>Pike. I saw but one in the room at that time. Barrett, who I thought to be the same person that was upon the right hand side of the chaise: the other was brought to Sir John Fielding's before they were examined.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw Barrett there, did you recollect, that, that was the man that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Pike. I did verily believe it was; I said so at the time:</p>
               <p>Q. Had you such a recollection of him, that you could say with a degree of certainty that he was one of the men?</p>
               <p>Pike. I do verily believe that he was the person that was upon the right hand side of the chaise; his hair was then loose about his shoulders, as it was when he robbed us. I was introduced into the back room, where Sir John was sitting: Barrett was in the outer room, with his hair down. I sat about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour in Sir John's room, when they were both brought in, and examined together. I had a bad crooked sixpence in the purse, I received it in change; I put it into my green purse, and gave it altogether into his hand. When Sir John ordered them to be searched, there were two farthings taken upon them, about eighteen or nineteen shillings in silver, and a bad sixpence. Sir

               <p> Q. You took the chaise at Salt Hill.</p>
               <p>Pike. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, it was between five and six; might it not be near six?</p>
               <p>Pike. I apprehend it was nearer six than five.</p>
               <p>Q. You were very fortunate to get a good pair of horses; that went at the rate of fourteen or fifteen miles an hour?</p>
               <p>Pike. We were drove a mile in three minutes and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be coming from Salt Hill to the place where you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Pike. I do suppose we were not quite fifty minutes coming: I had my watch in my portmanteau when we were robbed; but when I came into Hounslow I asked what o'clock it was, they said, between six and seven; it was not quite seven.</p>
               <p>Q. If you set out at near six, I suppose it must be pretty near seven when you was robbed. This was pretty near Hounslow?</p>
               <p>Pike, Yes, we drove pretty fast, as we did all the way. We came from Salt Hill to Hounslow in less than sixty minutes, and were robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Partridge's is about the twenty-second mile-stone, I believe?</p>
               <p>Pike. Yes, I paid him twelve miles, from Salt Hill to Hounslow.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you saw these men upon the road some time before they came up to you?</p>
               <p>Pike. They came into the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Your chaise was going at a prodigious great rate, and the glasses were up: it was impossible to make much observation upon them then?</p>
               <p>Pike. I could see them clearly through the glass.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said, they avoided shewing their faces?</p>
               <p>Pike. They passed the chaise, and immediately cried, holloa stop.</p>
               <p>Q. I observe you give your evidence with great caution of the sixpence, and as to the persons of the men; that you will not be positive they were the men?</p>
               <p>Pike. I should be very sorry to prejudice the court, I would rather go on the other side. I feel a great deal in my own mind upon this occasion.</p>

            . I was in the chaise with Mr. Pike on Sunday evening, March the 19th. When we came to Salt Hill, Mr. Pike seemed to be dubious of our going over the Heath; we did not stay, I believe, at Salt Hill five minutes. It was nearer six than five when we left Salt Hill: we desired Mr. Partridge to give us a good pair of horses to put us over the Heath as quick as possible; we asked for four, but he said, there was no danger in the world, and he would give us a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177504260008"></xptr> pair of horses that would carry us over exceeding well. We passed over the greater part of the Heath very safe, till we came to the latter part of the Heath, towards Hounslow. Just as we were entering the latter part of the

I put my hand in my pocket and gave him, to the best of my remembrance, about eight shillings, though I think rather more.</p>

               <p>Q. In what manner was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. In a light colour beaver surtout coat; I did not observe what cloaths he had under it, as it was buttoned; his hair hung about his ears, and was pinned at the sides; his hair hung down very strait. I saw them at Sir

               <p>Q. How long might he be at the chaise?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. He did not detain us above five minutes: he behaved as civil as could be.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him at Sir John Fielding's, was his hair in the like condition as when he robbed you?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. Yes, I remarked his hair a good deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of Gregory?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. No, I never so much as looked at him, I heard him swear a good deal, and thought he was drunk, by his talk.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the evening was it, that you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. I suppose it might be before seven; we drove at a great rate. I did not observe him till I saw him put his hand into his pocket and take out a pistol, then it struck me a good deal; I thought what his errand was immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. What coloured horse was Barrett on?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. It struck me that it was a bay.</p>

               <p>Q. You say, you set out from Partridge's at near six o'clock in a chaise and pair?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many miles did you come an hour?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. I should suppose twelve or fourteen miles: the horses set off a gallop, and never stopped galloping till we came to a little town, I don't know the name of it, I believe it is Cramford.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be before you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. About fifty minutes, I should suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, it is about twelve miles?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you came it in an hour?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. I had not a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. You took no notice of these men before they came to the chaise?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not surprised at all?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he be at the chaise?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. I believe, about five minutes; he was not there so long as Gregory; Gregory was not easily contented.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. No, very good light.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave him eight shillings, did you give him the money directly?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. Yes.</p>

               <p>Penwarne. No, he asked me for my watch, he stood at the chaise door still.</p>

               <p>Penwarne. I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Valentine Crew. I was behind the chaise on the 19th of March. When the chaise was coming to town, it was stopped at Hounslow Heath: just as we got to Butcher's Grove, I saw two men coming up to the chaise; I took particular notice of Barrett before he came to the chaise. Barrett rode a brown bay horse: when they came to the chaise, Barrett twice cried, stop; the driver pulled in; and he said, down with your glasses: the other was up close by the driver's side. He cried, down with the glasses; which they immediately did; then he said, I want your money. He was on the right side of the chaise: in less than a minute Gregory came from the driver with another pistol, and said to me, D - n you, if you stir I will blow your brains out. I had a single pistol, with which I was going to blow Barrett's brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was Barrett?</p>
               <p>Crew. Yes, I am certain of it. I did not take the pistol out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you was going to fire?</p>
               <p>Crew. I did not take the pistol out of my pocket; I unbolted it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Gregory see what you was going about?</p>
               <p>Crew. I do not know; he came round by the wheel of the chaise, fronting the hind wheel, and said, if I stirred, or to that purpose, he would blow my brains out, and said, Deliver, deliver, or I will blow your brains out directly. Barrett, I believe, had got the money, and Gregory demanded the watches.</p>
               <p>Q. Barrett demanded the money of Mr. Pike?</p>
               <p>Crew. Yes, and said, D - n your blood deliver directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the two prisoners: what do you say as to Barrett?</p>
               <p>Crew. I say, he is the person, but his hair was not done up as it is now. Barrett was on the right hand side of the chaise. I am positive as to Barrett; his hair was hanging strait over his shoulders, in the same manner as it was when he came before Sir

             the next morning: there were about forty people in the room at he Justice's: as soon as I opened the door, I recollected him and said, that is the man, he was standing up against the chimney piece.</p>
               <p>Q. What cloaths had he on?</p>
               <p>Crew. A light coloured great coat.</p>

               <p>Crew. I believe it was about eight minutes before seven o'clock; I had my watch in my hand about ten minutes before, when on the other heath, it then wanted a quarter of seven; it was not above five minutes after. I observed how long we were going the mile.</p>
               <p>Q. The money was given directly as the glasses were put down?</p>
               <p>Crew. No, it might be a minute and a half after. When they had got the money, Barrett asked, if they had any watches? Mr. Pike, and Mr. Penwarne said, they had no watches: the prisoners said, have you not, upon your honour. They said, they had not, upon their honour: then they bid the driver drive on.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw Barrett, you saw his hair?</p>
               <p>Crew. I saw his features before he came to the chaise, just as he came to the horses head, before the chaise stopped.</p>

            's. I was returning to town, about eight in the evening. I stopped at the Sun, at Hounslow; the landlord informed me, two gentlemen had been robbed in a chaise, on the Heath. And Mungo, (which is a name they call the last witness by) drove it, who was over the way. I went over to Godfrey, and he gave me a description of the men: he said, one had his hair about his ears, and the other was very much in liquor, and had had a fall from his horse: he said, they were two young men; one was mounted on a black mare, and the other on a bay gelding, which had been let blood. Upon receiving this information, I said, I had seen two such men on the Heath between five and six o'clock, and could tell them from a thousand.

I asked the landlady, if such men were there, describing them, she said, yes, they had supped, and were just going to bed. I desired to see them; we went up stairs, I laid hold on Gregory, and found this pistol, (producing it) in his pocket: just after I had found it, he said, d - n my blood, I ought to have another. Just as he was speaking this, the hostler brought in another, which he had dropped at the stable door, which exactly matched that I had taken from him. I then searched his pockets, and found a guinea and half in gold, fourteen shillings and sixpence in silver, a bad sixpence, eight pennyworth of halfpence, and two farthings. Mr. Othen took this pair of pistols out of Barrett's pocket, (producing them.)</p>

               <p>Othen. When we came to Hounslow, we stopped at the Sun. Mr. Holmes, who keeps the Sun, informed us, there had been a robbery committed, and said, he would fetch the post boy: he did, and the post boy said, the chaise was robbed by two little men; that was all I heard him say about it. I did hear him say something about his hair. I went with Bryant to Longford: I enquired at the King's Head, at Longford, if they had seen two such men as I described; they said, there were two such young men in the house. Bryant went into the room first, I followed him, he laid hold of Gregory, and took a pistol out of his pocket: I laid hold of Barrett, and I took a pistol out of each of his pockets; these are the pistols, ( which are produced.</p>

I agreed to go with him; his horse was taken lame, that we could not proceed any further than Longford that night: just as we were going to bed there, these people came, and said, there had been a robbery committed on the road, and they believed we were the people, and accordingly they took us to Bow Street.</p>

               <p>On the Sunday, before I was taken, I had engaged in a party with a company of comedians, I met with Gregory, and asked him to accompany me. We dined at Kew Bridge, and stayed till four in the evening: accordingly we set forward; my horse became lame, I had him bled at Hounslow, for which I paid sixpence. By the time the horse was bled it was quite dusk; accordingly, I said, to Gregory, we must keep up a sharp pace, or else we shall be very late before we come to any place: we rode on, it was quite dark before we got two miles over the Heath. I said, then we would put up at the first house we come at. It had been a very rainy day, I began to repent of my undertaking, because it was such a rainy day. We were riding fastish, I was intimidated; he said, you have got pistols, you can defend yourself. I said, I was not used to be out of an evening, I was not found of it; I would therefore put up at the first house we came to. Accordingly we put up at the King's Head at Longford; we asked if they had any thing for supper; we went first, and saw the horses safe in the stable, and desired them to be taken care of: the lame one, the ostler said, he was very lame, but believed, he would be able to proceed on the journey in the morning: we desired to be called early. After we had been in the house about an hour, two men came in, one, a man of Sir

            's, the other a servant of Lord Berkley's. I thought they might be people come to the house as we were; one of them came up to me, and said, young man, I must search you, and collared me, and he pulled a pistol out of my pocket. I then asked his reason for searching me, he said, there had been a robbery committed on Hounslow Heath, and he imagined we were the perpetrators of it. I well knowing my innocence, readily consented to let him search me; I knew he must execute his duty, and therefore, I consented to it immediately. I did not know I should be tried to-day, my witnesses are to come out of the country.</p>

               <p>GEORGE CLARKE sworn. - Q. Were you in the neighbourhood of Harrow this month? - A. I live at Harrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner the beginning of this month? - A. I saw them on the 4th of this month at the Police-Office; William Loosely, the owner of the mare, had taken his passage to go to the West-Indies, and he could not carry on the prosecution on that account; the Magistrates at Bow-street desired to know if any person there could prove the mare to be the property of

               <p>Q. Had Loosely had the mare some time? - A. Not long; perhaps six weeks or two months, I cannot say exactly; I live next door to Mr. Loosely.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time you saw it on the common? - A. I had been about buying it, and I had had her upon trial, which made me more particular in taking notice of her; it was a bay cropped mare.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the mare at the Police-Office? - A. Yes, and I knew it to be the same mare; it was shewn to me by James Martin.</p>

            Within about two miles of Harrow; they were going towards Harrow; I had a search-warrant, going to search a house at Harrow for stolen goods; I had a suspicion they were going on the common, as I had seen them before about Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you watch them? - A. Yes; they did not go into Harrow, but went within one or two hundred yards of the town; they stopped there about ten minutes, and then came back upon the common.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow them at any distance? - A. Yes, about two or three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them do any thing? - A. Yes, I saw them drive the mare off the common.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the mare? - A. Yes, very well, it was Mr. Loosely's mare; I saw them drive the mare into a lane; it was then rather after five o'clock; I went and got two men to assist me, John Martin and

               <p>Q. How long were you gone? - A. I might be gone about ten minutes; when we came back, we found the same two men surrounding three horses, and trying to catch one of them, but they could not; and when they found they could not, they returned to the lane, and put the bridle on the other horse, and was riding off with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark or light at that time? - A. It was rather dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see which put the bridle on? - 
               <persName id="t18020217-26-person312">A. </persName>
            They were both together; Denham put the bridle on, and Heals put a spur upon his own heel, Denham lifted him up, and away he went off with the mare; Denham walked by the side; Heals had got about one hundred yards down Greenford-lane before I stopped them; I told them the first man that ran away I would shoot him; one rode off, and the other ran away; the first man I caught I knocked down with the butt-end of my pistol, that was Heals; I called for assistance; two young men came up, and I desired them to hold Heals while I went after the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you catch him? - A. Yes, after he had run about two hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with them at that time? - A. We carried them to the cage; Denham had got about four guineas in his pocket, which he said he would give us if we would let him go; I kept one of them in the cage, and the other I slept with all night at my own house; the next day I took them before a Magistrate, and they were committed; I found that Heals lived at Harrow some years ago, but I did not know him then.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you watch any men upon the common? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the men do any thing? - A. Yes, I saw them put the bridle on.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who the men were? - A. Yes, Denham put the bridle on, and the other got up upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do afterwards? - A. They went away with her; when Martin called out, we came up to assist him, and they were secured.</p>
               <p>RICHARD GINGER sworn. - Q. Did you assist the two Martins in securing the two men? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the prisoners the same men? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see one of the men put the bridle on the mare, and the other get upon her? - A. No, I did not; I was about one hundred yards off; I afterwards assisted in securing them.</p>
               <p>Denham's defence. I went with this man to look after an ass and soal; we were informed it went towards Harrow; the mare had belonged to this young man before it belonged to that gentleman; we heard in Covent-garden market that it was stolen or strayed, and we found it upon the common; we meant to take it home; we did not mean to make a property of it.</p>

               <p>The prisoner, Denham, called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Heal's defence. The mare was mine; I sold her at Langhorn's to this gentleman, and we heard in Covent-garden that it was stolen or strayed; and, seeing her upon this common, while I was looking after my own property, we meant to take it to the man that owned it.</p>

               <p>months—she lived in the prisoner's house, 4, Princes Street, Red Lion Square—in consequence of a letter I received twelve months ago from some person unknown, I went to Eagle Street and found the deceased girl suffering from a wound on her shoulder, where she had been burnt some years before—it was about the size of a shilling—she also had a black eye, and a slight mark on the other eye—I knew the female prisoner before she married the male prisoner—I understood that they were married, as her name is now Robinson—on 29th August I was called to Red Lion Square, and found the deceased in bed in an emaciated condition and very dirty with maggots and lice—I noticed vermin all over the bedding—the step-mother told me that the girl used to sleep at night, not on the bed where we saw her, but on the ground, and that the bed belonged to her and her husband's children—the doctor ordered nourishment, which I supplied—I had a case at Clerkenwell Police Court at 2.30, after which I went back and found the beef which I had supplied still in a cupboard, untouched—I was told that she had had some of the brandy, but I thought not, and gave her some—I saw her twice daily—she died on 8th September—the father is a book<lb></lb>binder—I was present when he made a statement before the Coroner.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">This statement by the male prisoner, not on oath, was that he was a book<lb></lb>binder, and was the father of the deceased, who lost her mother two years before; that he married the other prisoner eight months afterwards, that the deceased suffered from epileptic fits, that he gave her all the food he could afford, but she was always crying. That she had diabetes, that she washed lierself, but whatever was done the vermin would accumulate</hi>). I saw the girl the day before she die I—she was too ill to be moved—her age was nineteen or twenty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The father said that he earned 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week when he was in work—he was in employment when this happened—there may be eight children of his and hers, but not at home; I saw four in the room, and this girl made five—one of her children is in Liverpool—the mother informed me the girl was ill with diarrhoea—no one had been to me with an order for medicine—I did not take the meat and brandy to her, they were sent, and I cannot say at what time they arrived—I believe the meat was cooked directly it arrived—the remains of a stew were in a dish in the cupboard, and some bread—I asked where the beef-tea was, and there was the beef in the cupboard—I should call the girl an imbecile, she was incapable of follow<lb></lb>ing any occupation—I never spoke to her but once.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I practice in Great James Street—I first saw the deceased about August, 1872, she then had a contused eye, and it was alleged that her father had been ill-treating her—she had a large burn on her left shoulder, and the father said that she was subject to fits—I only saw her once—on 10th December I made the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—her body was extremely wasted, and there was a large old scar on the top of the scalp, which had healed; on the back of the left shoulder there was a superficial scar, about two inches in diameter—the intestines were devoid of fat, thin, and semi-transparent, the lungs were perfectly healthy, but their bases were congested, the heart contained a clot of discoloured fibrine, the stomach contained undigested food, its coats were thin—the convolutions of the brain did not sit well together, indicating a low intel<lb></lb>lectual state, and at the posterior portion of the right hemisphere of the brain was a small cist—she was in a very filthy state when I saw her alive—my opinion is that she died from inanition, for want of proper nourish<lb></lb>ment, there was not sufficient disease to account for that extreme wasting—deprivation of food would account for the exhaustion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not attended the family, only the grandmother—this hospital card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) has Dr. Buzzard's name on it—it expired on 2nd March, but it does not say that she was under treatment for that time—I find that she was admitted on 2nd November, 1870; it was renewed on August 9th, and expired on November 9th, 1871—that is a full year—I infer from that that she was under treatment at that time—she was under treatment at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, for the burn on her shoulder, from June, 1868, to March, 1869 (<hi rend="italic">looking at another card</hi>)—the small cist, I found, would account for the fits—a girl so affected might fall and be burned—that would account for the bruises and marks I found—there was one unhealed wound—I had attended her twice daily for eleven days—I asked the Guardians to supply a nurse, who was there two or three days, and everything was done for her—they told me that she had been fed, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187309220030"></xptr>
               <p>she told me herself that she had had what I had ordered for her—I found food in her stomach—she had diarrhoea when I first saw her—it did not continue till she died—it was not serious, as she did not vomit—I should say that she was certainly not suffering from diabetes—she passed her water involuntarily—there was congestion of the lungs, but that was simply due to the mode of death—there was no heart disease—people who die slowly have discoloured fibrine—the tumour on the brain set up congestion at cer<lb></lb>tain periods, when she had the fits, every four weeks, I suppose—she did not die during a fit—I should expect to find some active disease to account for what I saw—I don't know whether she was obstinate, and took things at some times and not at others—we have quite a different state of symp<lb></lb>toms in hysterical cases—Dr. Grant saw her five times, and he attended the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—he is not here—the diarrhoea was checked, and it returned and was checked again—she passed her faeces involuntarily, and they were not relaxed, and there were foeces in the lower bowels, which would not have been the case if she had had diarrhoea, but if she got up from bed, or used any extraordinary exertion she might die from syncope—diarrhoea has some<lb></lb>times that effect, if it is not checked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The state of the heart precluded the probability that she died from disease of the heart—her arms were very much emaciated—she died from <hi rend="italic">asthenia</hi>—the success of any treatment at the hospital would depend upon her having proper nourishment, and being taken care of—I have never seen a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> where we could not find the cause of death out—she was so feeble that I could not judge whether she was of weak mind.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there, on the part of the patient herself, a dislike to food? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say that she would take food which would not do her any good and not take the food which was ordered for her; many people lose their lives like that, but I cannot form any opinion whether that was the case here—I can only say that if she had had proper food the condition of her body would have been better than it was.</p>

I am married, and live at 13, Ellrick Place—I have known the prisoners four years and three months—I have been in the habit of going to their room; they are my neighbours—he always seemed a most kind and affectionate husband and father—I never knew him strike or ill<lb></lb>use the deceased, she was treated the same as the rest of the family; in fact, better, for she was always hungry, and would eat anything you gave her at any time—she was always delicate and sickly, and so was her mother—I have seen her in their present house; she was treated there as before—I had not seen her since Mrs. Robinson was confined, six or seven months ago.</p>

I live with my aunt and grandmother, at 4, Princes Street, Red Lion Square—the prisoner and his wife are my aunt and uncle, and the deceased girl was my cousin by marriage—I used to go to their house every day—she was treated very kindly indeed by her father and mother, as kind as a mother could do it—I have been there when they were eating, and she had as much as her mother could afford to give her, as much as the others had—there was plenty of bread and other things in the house—the girl was delicate and subject to fits—she was hungry and <hi rend="italic">avaricious.</hi>

            Did you know the prisoner before that time? - No. I shewed him the handkerchiefs, and he seemed to approve of them; they then began to measure them, and wanted to know if the handkerchiefs were square, and got me to lay the yard stick on, to know if they were square; in the mean time the prisoner had conveyed away six handkerchiefs; they were laid on the counter; I had shewed them to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you miss them? - Before they were well out of the shop; I did not see him take them.</p>
               <p>Q. What steps did you take when you found the handkerchiefs missing? - I went round the counter and opened the shop door, and called out stop thief! Mr. Weedon, the next door neighbour but one, came to me and asked me what was the matter? I told him, and he pursued them; they were going down Whitechapel as hard as they could run; I told him the man in the blue jacket had got them in his breeches; I saw the projection of them in his breeches before he went out of the shop. Mr. Weedon brought him back to the shop, and when he was brought back, the prisoner took the handkerchiefs out of his breeches, and threw them to the ground; they are in Mr. Weedon's custody.</p>
               <p>- WEEDON sworn.</p>
               <p>I was called upon to pursue the thieves; I took this man in about a hundred or a hundred and fifty yards from the shop; I did not search him till I brought him back to the house; when I got into the house I did not see him take the handkerchiefs out of his breeches, but I see them on the ground, and I took them up; they are here; they have been in my possission ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is my mark on them, my own hand writing; twenty-three shillings is the prime cost of them.</p>

            To Bingley. How was you employed when they were taken from the counter? - The other man asked me to measure the handkerchief, to see if it was square, and I took it up in my hand, and held it up by the corners, holding it before me to measure it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that covered there? - It did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going along Whitechapel-road, and I met a man that I used to work with, and he asked me if I would go with him to buy an handkerchief? I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160021"></xptr>said did not care, I would go with him; and we went to this shop, and he looked at a cotton handkerchief, and he did not approve of it, and we both came out together, and this gentlewoman in the shop said that how we had stole some handkerchiefs; and she had us taken, which there was never nothing of the kind, nor I never had the property in my possession.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

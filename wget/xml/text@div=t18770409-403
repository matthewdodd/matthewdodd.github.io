I live at 25a, Cowper Street, Waterloo Road my husband is a printer—on March 20th, about 2 a.m. I was in bed and heard the prisoner singing and dancing on the next floor—I called my little boy out of bed and sent him up—he cried out for me—I went upstairs and Caine came out on the landing and used bad language, and kicked me in the</p>

Mary York opened the door, and I then saw you dancing; I stood on the landing, you came out and Mary York stood in the doorway—the landing is very small—Mary York had a candle in her hand—there is no window on the landing—two people could not pass on the stairs without turning—my father and mother quarrelled on Saturday morning, but not on the Sunday—the window has been broken a long time.</p>

I lived in this house, but have moved about a fortnight to 21, Chatham Street, Walworth, on account of the bother—the prisoners came home the worse for drink and called for a light, I gave York one—she asked my daughter to fetch her a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. candle, I said she could not—she asked me to have some <hi rend="italic">bacca</hi>—Caine then told her to go to bed, and I put the candle out to prevent fire—they went to bed—between 3 and 4 o'clock, Mrs. Montague came home and rattled the door and asked for a light and made a great noise—I said "If there is any grievance between you and <hi rend="italic">Liza</hi> settle it in the morning"—she used a bad word and sent the door in—I then heard scuffling, but did not see her again—my husband would not let me go to her—she is fond of fighting and tearing.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, R</hi> 38). On Sunday evening, 23rd May, I went to the prosecutor's at the Gloucester Tea-gardens, at Greenwich—I went into the kitchen—I saw the prisoner there; she was acting as a servant—I told her she was suspected of robbing her master of a quantity of tea and sugar—she said she had not done anything of the sort—I told her she and the other servant must be searched, and turn their pockets out—they immediately ran behind the fire screen—the prisoner was <hi rend="italic">fumbling</hi> about and stooping down—I went behind the screen, and requested Mr. Larkan to get a light and look under the stove—he did, and pulled out this apron, which is made into a sort of bag, and there is a little piece of print attached to it which I compared with a gown the prisoner bad on at the time when I got to the station, and there was a place from which I could see that a piece like this had been taken—there was a place corresponding with this piece, which I cut away out of her dress just by her pocket at her side—before I took her to the station I asked her how she accounted for this tea which I found in the apron—she said she found it down in the cellar amongst some wood that morning, and if I went down and looked in the oven I should find a teapot half full of ale.</p>

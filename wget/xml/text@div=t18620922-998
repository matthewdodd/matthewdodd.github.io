                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Mr. Lavers, of Plaistow Marsh, as watchman—on 3d September, in consequence of order I re<lb></lb>ceived from him, I noticed the prisoner—I let him out at the gates at a quarter to 4 o'clock in the morning—he had with him two nose-bags full, and a piece of a sack full, and a truss of hay—he drove two horses—I let him out on the Friday following at 5 o'clock—he then had two nose-bags and part of a sack full, and a whole sack full and an arm full of clover-hay—I have been three years in the establishment last March—I got up in the cart and examined the sack—it contained out clover, out hay, and oats—I saw no beans.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a contractor, and have works at Plaistow, and also at Harrow—the distance from one place to another is sixteen or seven<lb></lb>teen miles—the prisoner has been in my employment since January—on Wednesday, 3d September, I was at Harrow, when he arrived with the cart, and two horses, about 2 or half-past—a totally filled nose-bag each horse would be as much as they could consume in the whole journey there and back—the men were invariably told on all occasions to take a day's supply only, so as not to have anything to take home at night—a sufficient supply is one totally filled nose-bag for each hone—I find they cannot consume more with other men—it is impossible that the prisoner's horses could have consumed two nose-bags full, a sack and part of another sack full, and a trust of hay, before they arrived at Harrow—I spoke to him when he arrived; but not on the question of forage—he then had two nose-bags not a third full—on the Friday he arrived at Harrow between 2 and 3 o'clock—I should say each bag was then rather more than half full, and there might have been a double handful in one sack, but not sufficient to call any—I should say that the sack had not been cleanly shook out, there was just a little in the corner—I asked him if he had brought any forage for the horses stationed at Harrow, on Wednesday—he said, "No, I was not told to bring any"—I said, "Well, that is rather stupid; you are sure you did not bring more down on Wed<lb></lb>nesday than you wanted, and you did not bring any to-day?—he said, "No, I only brought the allowance "—I said, "No, you have none to spare"—he said, "No," and left—after his return, I made special inquiry as to what he had started with—it is simply impossible that the quantity taken on Wednesday could have been consumed by the horses on their journey to Harrow—I then went to Tower-street, and got the assistance of a detective, and gave the prisoner in custody—I repeated the whole of the conversation I have now given, and asked the prisoner whether he had taken any forage back to the stables on the Wednesday evening—he replied "No"—I asked him whether he took any forage back with him on the Friday—he replied, "No"—I asked him again, and he said that he had a little left in the bottom of the bag; it might be a double handful—I said, "Had you any hay, or</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186209220108"></xptr>
               <p>any clover?"—he said, "No"—I called an officer, and gave him in custody—the prisoner said to me, in the presence of the constable, that if I would forgive him it should not occur again—he pleaded hard for forgiveness, and said that it should not occur again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you any horsekeeper, or person who has control of the fodder? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No one specially appointed for the purpose; the carmen take it from the chaff-cutter, and put it in the bin—it is given out to one man who cuts it up, and it is placed in the bin—he is not here—that quantity of corn is calculated to last a certain time—it is accessible to all the men, and they help themselves just as they like—I have told the prisoner expressly that he was to take out a nose-bag full for a day—my standard is a well filled nose-bag—there is a great deal of difference; if a nose-bag is well filled it will hold considerably more—I gave the prisoner no particular orders on this occasion—I told him about the time he came into my employ to take a well filled nose-bag for each horse—I do not remember saying that to him, but it is my invariable practice with a new man—if I said before that each nose-bag was fall when he arrived at Harrow I stated what I did not mean; there was very nearly half as much more on Friday as there was on Wednesday, and on the Friday there was a little in the sack besides—I should think he would feed the horses twice coming, and twice going back—I should allow fifteen hours there and back, but he was much longer than he ought to have been—I did not say so to him, because he had the work to do in the day—I do not know what time he started—I have no foreman during the night, there was one at 6 o'clock or a quarter to 6, but the men have their orders—he simply delivered his load at Harrow, turned round, and went back again; they go back wonderfully quick in proportion to what they come—the horses know the road better, and they have no forage to take—I was within a few yards of the cart wheel when I asked him what he had brought—the two watchmen should both be on duty at Plaistow when he left.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the prisoner authority to take a larger quantity than the two nose-bags full? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, and the trust of hay is the great difficulty.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What proportion does a sack bear to a nose-bag? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Hardly four to one—a sack would not tightly fill four nose-bags—over and above the nose-bags a man might take a double armfull of hay, and that would be consumed—this would not be more than was required, unless they had the note-bags full.</p>

               <p>Q. Was your house at any time broken open - A. On the night of the 6th of April, from the hour of ten and six the following morning, which would be the 7th, the casement window of the washhouse, which was closely latched, was taken out, and some iron hooping nailed against it was pulled away; he then got into my washhouse, and into my premises; some person did; I do not mean to swear it was the prisoner, of course. From there to the dwelling-house by another window, from whence was stolen a writing desk, which was mine, and eight shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. The desk is not in the indictment - A. He took it out in the garden and broke it open, and took away the silver in a bag, containing ten pound and sixpence in silver and the bag, and left the desk in the garden. Another bag with three shillings and sixpence in copper, the remains of the contents of the desk, was left in the desk in the garden, and from the house he took eight shirts; I value them at two pounds; one shift, six shillings; five pocket handkerchiefs, five shillings; a child's frock, two shillings; and one pair of child's shoes, two shillings. On the following day I was given to understand that a man was taken up at Hackney with a great deal of wet linen upon him, and a bag containing silver. He was taken at the Brook at Hackney. That is about seven miles from our house. This is the linen.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these things, and tell me whether you can identify them - A. There are seven shirts; they are mine; I can swear to the child's shoes, two shillings: and the frock, two shillings; and four handkerchiefs, two shillings. I recognise the silver particularly by two pieces of money in the bag. I will swear to a shilling and a sixpence; they were altogether in the bag in the desk. There is in the bag now nine pound eighteen shillings; when my house was robbed there were ten pound and sixpence, which with what was found in this bag and the other bag exactly makes up the same amount. They were found upon the prisoner.</p>

            . I am constable of the night, in Hackney. On the 7th of April, a quarter before five in the morning, two patrols brought the prisoner into the watchhouse. I found all the linen on him, them articles that have been spoken to by Mr. Mills, and a screw-driver, a box with matches and phospharus, and a piece of candle. This screw-driver I fitted to many of the marks on the desk; it fitted the marks exactly.</p>
               <p>- IVES. I am a patrol of St. John Hackney. I stopped this prisoner a little before five in in the morning on the 7th of April. I found this property upon him that is now produced before you. I asked him how he came by it; he said he brought it from Norwich; afterwards he said he bought some of it from Woodford.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I was stopped Preston and Wells were with me; they came all the way in my company from Epping; they came in company with me to Lea-bridge; at Lea-bridge I found the property concealed in a sack in a ditch. Preston and Wells were with me; they are not here; they are the people I want. Pardon the presumption of an old weather-beaten sailor. I am in Greenwich hospital. Restore to me an old silver watch which I have been possessed of twenty years, a pair of spectacles, and a tobacco box, which articles have been detained from me.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I saw a person in the shop; but I cannot say it was the prisoner - I went to the back premises, and heard a woman go from the shop; I came in and the soap was missing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you not heard that she is of a very respectable family? A. Yes.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner about ten o'clock in the morning; which was half an hour after the soap was missing - she had a parcel tied up in a light brown paper, and wrapt up in her apron; I do not know what was in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know the time? A. Because the prosecutor's daughter came to ask if I had seen a person pass with a black gown on: I had only seen the prisoner once before, which was on the Thursday.</p>

            . I am porter to the prosecutor; the soap was packed up for me to take to Deptford - I saw it on the counter, in a whitey brown paper; and when I came to take it, it was gone - I went to the prisoner's house with my master and the officer, and saw the ashes turned up in the dust-hole; where I found this soap, in this apron.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who else lives in the house? A. Mr. King, a widower, lives in the lower part; the prisoner lives up stairs.</p>

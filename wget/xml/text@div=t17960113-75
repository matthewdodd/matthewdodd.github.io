               <p>I live in Bow-street, Bloomsbury: On the 8th of January, a woman brought a sheet to our shop, who had frequently brought things in the name of Bartlet; upon asking her, whether it was her property, she said, it was not; that she brought it from Mrs. Bartlet; on her saying so, I took it in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you understand the woman's name? - A. Her name was Barnes; I lent her four shillings<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130121"></xptr>upon it; the next day, Mr. Payne, the prosecutor, and the constable, came to our shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sheet produced? - A. Yes; I had the sheet with me.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Payne, of Brompton: On the 7th of January, I hung the sheet up to dry, in the drying ground.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to the manufactory? - A. Very near; within a few yards; I hung it out in the morning; I left it out all night; I saw it about five o'clock; I missed it the next morning about nine o'clock; I suspected the prisoner, and told my master; my master took an officer, and had him taken up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Payne. On being informed, that the property was gone, I returned to Brompton; I was in town at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing but the sheet taken? - A. No; I returned to Brompton; I called in one of the men, not the prisoner, and asked him, why he did not tell me his suspicions, over night, and desired him to call in the prisoner to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him you wished him to confess any thing, or tell him, it would be better for him? - A. I said, Thomas, it will be better for you to tell the truth; after which, we went and searched his apartments, in a street in St. Gile's; I do not recollect the name of the street; he said, he lodged there, and his wife had the sheet, and gave the direction to me; and the officer, on searching his wife, found a duplicate of the sheet, where it was pawned; the officer, and I, went to the pawnbroker's, and the sheet was produced; the next morning, I sent my servant to look at it, to ascertain whether it was mine or not.(The sheet was produced in Court, and deposed to by Skip).</p>
               <p>Q. Could any person have access to the place at night? - A. Yes; but we have a watchman.</p>

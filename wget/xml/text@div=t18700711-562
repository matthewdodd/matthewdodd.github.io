I am a sailor—on the 16th August, 1869, I went into the Wade's Arms, Poplar, with a friend—I had nothing to drink there—the two prisoners were in there at the time—I knew them before by sight—I don't think they knew me—I remained in the house five or ten minutes—when I went out the prisoners followed me, and ran after me—I slewed round and asked why they were running after me—they said "Come and have a glass of something to drink"—I said "I refused you in the Wade's Arms, why do you follow me?"—I tried to get into Davis Street the back way, and the prisoners made a rush and shoved me into the middle of the road—I went on toward Chrisp Street, and they hustled me into one of the bye-streets leading into the West India Road—Kelly tried to tear the back of my vest—I tried to shove them off, and lifted my left hand out of my pocket—he then held my hand so that I could not get it to my pocket again, and McCarthy took the purse and ran off—Kelly also ran off—I went and lodged the complaint at the station—I had had six or seven small glasses of ale—I was perfectly sober—I suppose they were about two hours before they accomplished their task—I did not see a policeman from the time the prisoners first attacked me—I saw McCarthy again in the Royal Standard, a beer-shop in Wells Street—I did not make any accusation against him—I went in to have a glass of ale—I knew him and recognized him—I went out, and he came out after me—I looked for a policeman, but could not find</p>

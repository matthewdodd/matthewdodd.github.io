             sworn. - I am a rigger, I worked with Edwards: On Wednesday evening, the 14th of November, he missed his pocket-book, and we looked round with a candle and lanthorn, and could not find it, and then he said he must give it up as a bad job; he said, he recollected he pulled out his pocket-book and lent five shillings to one John Henty, and he did not know any thing of it afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say where he pulled it out? - A. Yes; he said he was sitting upon a bench outside the door, about two feet off the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say at what time of day or night it was? - A. No; he did not.</p>

             sworn. - I happened to be in the house of Burton, at Blackwall, I think it was the night after Edwards had dropped the pocket-book; he came into Burton's, and said, he had dropped a pocket-book, and whoever had picked it up, and would return it to him, he should return them to half the amount of the contents; upon which he said, there might be eighteen or nineteen pounds, in notes and cash; at the same time, I asked him where he thought he had lost it; he said he could not say, but he thought he must have lost it in the box where we sat, at the same time, or at the bench without the door.</p>

            (To Edwards.) On the Tuesday night, when you lost the pocket-book, how were you dressed? - A. In a jacket and trowsers; my pocket-book was in the right-hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any person, standing near you, easily get at it? - A. Yes; he sat on my right-hand; I had a very large pocket in my trowsers, which being stiff with tar, he might very easily put his hand in and take it out without my knowledge.</p>

            When had you last seen it? - A. A man had called me to Mr. Burton's door, and asked me to lend him a shilling or two; I put my hand into my pocket, and pulled my pocket-book out with my right-hand and put it into my left, and held it there till I put my right-hand into my pocket again, and I pulled out four half-crown pieces, and two or three shillings; I told the man there were five shillings for him, as I owed him some money; I then put my pocket-book into my right-hand pocket again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not possible you might drop the pocket-book near the door? - A. No; to the best of my knowledge, I am sensible I put it in my pocket at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you, the next day, represent it as having lost your pocket-book either at the door or the bench? - A. No, they misunderstood me; I said, the last time I had it was at the bench, outside the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you perfectly sober at this time? - A. Yes. Both <rs id="t17981205-1-verdict5" type="verdictDescription">

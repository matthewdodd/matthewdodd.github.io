I told him I did not wish to buy her, I did not want her; he said he would be very much obliged to me if I would buy her, for she was so very heavy with sold that he did not know what to do with her, if he put a load on her she would lay down.

               <p>Q. Where did you get this ass you sold to this gentleman, Mr. Stone? - The prisoner came to me on Thursday morning, and knocked at the door, I live in Hare Walk, Hoxton; he came about seven o'clock, he brought the ass to me, and asked me if I would let him put it in my stable, for the value of a couple of hours; then he went away, and I went to market about my business; about two hours after that he came again and said, that he was very much distressed for money, and asked me if I could help him to a customer for it; I told him I believed I could. I took it to Mr. Stone's and asked a guinea for it; Mr. Stone said it was not worth above half a guinea, but twelve shillings was the most he would give for it; he gave me the twelve shillings, I took the money to the prisoner and he gave me eighteen pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him how he came by it? - I did not ask him, he said it was his own property, he bought it on the road. I was coming by on Friday night at the officer's door, and I saw the officer Armstrong, and he told me he had been looking about for a whitish ass very heavy with sold, and string halt behind; and says he, if you can give me any intelligence of it I will give you a guinea; so with that I told him if I should happen to hear of any thing I should let you know. This was about ten o'clock, at his own door in Kingsland-road; I afterwards came back to him and resigned myself to him, and I went with the officer directly and took the prisoner. I went home to my wife first to know whether it was the same ass by the description, that Mr. Armstrong told me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you return to Mr. Armstrong? - In about ten minutes, or hardly so much. I told him I had sold it, and was employed by the prisoner to sell it for twelve shillings, and he gave me eighteen pence, and he took me into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give evidence before the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you ever know the prisoner before this transaction? - Yes, I have seen him before about the country, but I did not know but it was his own property; I never had any dealings with him, I am sure of it.</p>

I then says, George, you must get up, I said, I am come to take you, for that ass that you employed Bull to sell. I found him at a lodging house in Kingsland-road, in bed with his wife; he said, he employed him to sell it, and he said, he bought it of a man about nine miles from London. I asked him how long he had had it? he said, he had bought it the Saturday before. I asked him if he should know that man? he said, he did not know but he might; he said, he brought it of that man for eight shillings and six-pence, he bought it on Edmonton-road, about nine miles from London. I asked him if he bought it the Saturday before where he kept it; hearing by the hand bill it was only lost on Thursday; he said, he turned it out on the Common. Mr. Harper took both the prisoners and put them in our watch-house, and we went to Mr. Stone's house, I told him I had a little business with him concerning an ass he bought; he told the boy to drive it out, and it was delivered to us, and it was identified by the witnesses at our office.</p>

I have known this man, Mr. Bull, above these twenty years, and I went to him and told him I wanted to sell it, and he said he would go and sell it, and take the ass on his own hands, and nobody should know it was mine, and he had three shillings for felling of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Bull by it? - I carried it to Bull and asked him to put it in his stable, and he told me he could help me to a customer; and he told Mr. Stone it was his own property, and that nobody had any thing to do with it. I have not a friend in the world.</p>

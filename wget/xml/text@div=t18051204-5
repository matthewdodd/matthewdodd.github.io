             sworn. I am clerk to Messrs. Lucas; on the 4th of November I saw the prisoner at the bar go to the case of hats on <placeName id="t18051204-5-crimeloc33">Wiggins's lower quay, Thames-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18051204-5-crimeloc33" type="placeName" value="Wiggins's lower quay, Thames-street"></interp>

I told him he had stole my hats; he replied, Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040011"></xptr>Dunn, if I had known them to have been your hats, I would not have taken them; he was persuaded by some of his friends to give me the hats; he opened a cupboard, and gave me a dozen; they were the hats that were out of the case; I have no doubt of it, I produce them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. - Q. You produce these hats do you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went before the lord-mayor, did you not. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you state there that you had not seen them? - A. I stated exactly the same as I do now.</p>
               <p>Q. What hats do you call these? - A. They go by the name of Leghorn straw hats.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the hat trade? - A. I am not in the hat trade.</p>
               <p>Q. What are called straw hats, and what are called Leghorn straw hats? are they not very different things? - A. No, they are not, they are Leghorn hats; we pay duty for these in the name of Leghorn hats.</p>
               <p>Q. This man, when he came into the public-house, told you he had found some hats? - A. He did not tell me that he found them.</p>
               <p>Q. That he picked them up? - A. He did not say that he picked them up? he said, Mr. Dunn, if I had known they had been your hats I would not have took them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the prisoner afterwards, that night? - A. No, I did not, I left him for that night.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave him? - A. I was positive I could find him when I wanted him.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was taken the next day had you any conversation with him on this subject? - A. He sent for me to the Counter, I then told him, if he could tell me where I could get the other part of the property that was missed it might be easier for him, but he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose wharf were they on? - A. They were in Mr. Lucas's and Co's custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 4th of November I was working on board the craft, I was coming up Wiggin's quay from Young's quay, I saw a parcel of hats lay, one on the top of the other as they do here. I took them up to the public-house to know who was the owner of the hats; when the prosecutor came in, I said if you have lost some hats here they are, and if I had known they were yours I would have delivered them to you: he took the hats, and told me to go about my business; I went home and staid there till about six o'clock, and they came and took me. This gentleman did not come into the public-house till I had been there three or four minutes, and he swore before the Lord Mayor that he did not see me take the hats; he saw me on the quay near the case where the hats were.</p>

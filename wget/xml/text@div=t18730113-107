                  </hi>. I am agent to the Mint authorities in these cases—I was in Wilderness Row on Saturday, 21st December, about 5.30 in the evening, with Kenwood—I saw the prisoner standing at a public-house window and look at something in his hand—I stepped across and said "Well Mr. Morgan, what have you got there?"—he said "Nothing"—he sud<lb></lb>denly stooped down—I seized him by the collar—he kicked violently at that time—I seized him by the left hand—Kenwood came to my assistance—he kicked at Kenwood also—Kenwood took him by the right hand; he tried to force his hand open, but without success—at that time Inspector Bryant came up—he came in front of the prisoner and commenced searching him—from his pocket he took two packets—a crowd assembled, and we were compelled to push him into the public-house—the packet contained twelve counterfeit florins separately wrapped in paper with paper lapped between them in the usual way—Kenwood gave me a sovereign, and he succeeded in taking another florin from his right hand—I said "Morgan, these are counterfeit, you will have to account for the possession of them"—he made no reply then, but afterwards stated "A man gave them to me to hold"—we took him to the Old Street police-statien, and he refused his address—some good money was found in his possession.</p>

I was with Brannan on 21st December—I have heard the statement he has made to-day, and it is quite correct—I found the sovereign in the prisoner's waistcoat pocket and the florin in his right hand—he resisted very much—I searched him at the station, and found a half-crown, a florin, two shillings, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze in good money—he said that a man had given him the money—on the follow<lb></lb>ing Monday, the 22nd, I went to his cell, and he then said he could get out of this for he kicked his foot against a packet at the bottom end of Wilder<lb></lb>ness Row—it was done up in paper, and he was looking at it.</p>

I was in Goswell Street on this occasion—I saw what took place, and went up to assist the other two witnesses—after we got the prisoner into the public-house I found a brown paper parcel in his left-hand trousers pocket, the packet which has been produced, containing two parcels of counterfeit florins, which I gave to Mr. Brannan—I proceeded to search him further, but he said "You will find no more, you have got all"—he gave the name of William Watson at the station—he refused his address—I made that statement at the Police Court, and he said "I now state my name to be William Morgan and not Watson."</p>

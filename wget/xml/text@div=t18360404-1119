                  </hi>. I am a smith, and live in Little Suffolk-street. On the 27th of March I met the prisoner between three or four o'clock in the morning—I had been having a walk with Eliza Proctor, and I went to sleep with her at a house in Kent-street—I had known her before—I left my money in my clothes pocket, on a chair by the side of the bed—there were two beds in the room—there was nobody in the room when I went in—I was awoke by Proctor, who told me I was being robbed—I immediately got out of bed, and a young man who was in the room with the prisoner, kept her in the room while I dressed, and went down and got a policeman, and gave her in charge—I lost half-a-crown, five shillings, and about 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in halfpence—she was searched at the station-house, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. found on her—the half-crown was found.</p>

                  </hi>. I have known Kirby twelve months—I am his sweet<lb></lb>heart—I get my living by waistcoat work—I met him on the 27th of March—I went and slept with him in this room—the prisoner was not there then—I was awoke by hearing her jingling the money, and saw her taking it from the waistcoat-pocket—she put it down her bosom—there was a man in the room with her—I told Kirby, and the young man kept her there while the prosecutor fetched a policeman—the young man told her she had got the prosecutor's money—she said she had not—when the policeman came I believe some of it was found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. Kirby came for me—I went with him to the house—and found a young man holding the prisoner in the street—I went there hearing the cry of, "Police"—Kirby said she had robbed him—he could not exactly tell what of till he got to the station-house, and there he said he was robbed of 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner was very violent, and fore most of her clothes off, and would insist on being searched—she said she had no money about her, but I found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver and 6 3/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper on one side in her stays—she said she had no more, but on the other side of her stays I found a half-crown.</p>

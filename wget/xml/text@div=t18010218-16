               <p>JOSEPH LIFFORD sworn - I am in partnership with my brother, William: I had missed a quantity of new rope from my rigging-house, and Thursday, the 5th, between one and two o'clock in the morning, I went into the rope-ground, and listened if I could hear any body in the premises, and I heard some person walking in the rigging-house; I immediately went in doors to the man who had the keys of the rope-ground, I unlocked the wicket, and as soon as I went in I saw a man's coat tied up with rope in it, about thirty-five yards from the rigging-house door; I then went up the ladder into the rigging-house, with a candle and lantern, in my hand, and found the door open; as soon as I went in, I saw the prisoner lying upon some yarn, asleep; I immediately went down again, I did not wake him, and went into my yarn-house; about four o'clock the man awoke, and came very softly down the ladder; he stopped about five minutes listening if any body was about, and then he went on past where I was, very slowly, to the gate where I had seen the property; he stopped at the gate a little time, and then came back again, past where I was standing; he then went very softly again past where I was, down to the gate; I then heard a creaking, as if somebody was getting over the gate; I went down very softly, and the property was gone; I then unlocked the wicket very gently, and went out, the prisoner was standing outside the gate, with the bundle tied up at his feet; I immediately caught him by the collar, and asked him what he had got there; he said, he had only got a little rope to buy him some bread; I told him if he offered to stir I would knock him down; he rushed from me, and I stepped before him and knocked him down with a stick that I had in my hand; I made him take the rope upon his back, and I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he work for you? - A. I never saw him at work myself; but I understand from my foreman he did work two days for me two months ago; the rope that I found in the bundle was old rope, such as we used to bind new rope with; we are rope makers.(

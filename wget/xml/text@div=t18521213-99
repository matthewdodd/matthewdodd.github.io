                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, A</hi> 405). About 5 o'clock in the morning of 28th Nov., I was on duty at King's-cross, and saw the prisoner—he had this basket, containing some bottles of Champagne, and twenty-five towels tied up, and five tablecloths—I stopped him, and asked him where he brought them from—he said from the Mitre public house, Holloway, and he had started from there at three o'clock—I said, "You have been a long time coming from there"—he said he was going to Notting-hill with them, and had to be there at 5 o'clock; it was striking five just as I was talking to him—I was not satisfied and took him into custody, and took him to the station—as we came along a young gentleman passed, and the prisoner said, "That is one of them that was in company with me when I did it," but he had got quite out of sight at the time he said it—I am sure of the words be used, he said "He was one that was along with me when I did it"—I found on him twenty-two farthings, and a piece of wax candle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I told the policeman that I had them given to me by two men to carry, and they told me if I was stopped to tell the policeman I was going to Notting-hill with them, and that I came from Holloway. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He said that after we got to the station—he looked back after the person had passed some little way—I said to him, "I think you know him, don't you?"—he said, "Yes; that is one of the men that was concerned in the robbery with me."</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Queen's Arms, in the Caledonian-road. On 28th Nov. I went to bed about 1 o'clock—I was the last person up in the house; I locked up the house all safe—I was called up by the police, somewhere about 8 o'clock in the morning—I was the first person that went down stairs—I found the bar had been completely ransacked, all the drawers and tills were taken out—the front door was left open, and the window where the party got in was closed again; they had got in through the fanlight over the door; that was large enough for the prisoner to get through—it was closed—it closes by a cord—a person getting through there could have access to the bar, and could open the door inside so as to get out—there is no lock to the door, but two bolts—there were marks on the dust on the ledge of the fanlight, and there was mud on the plate glass inside the door,</p>

               <p>where he had slipped down from the fanlight, and at if fingers had been wiped—I missed some tablecloths, napkins, glass cloths, three bottles of Champagne, half a dozen bottles of stout, and some towels—the Champagne was on one of the shelves in the bar; I observed marks of wax on the drawers, and in different parts, exactly corresponding with the colour of this produced—my house is about 200 yards from King's-cross—I know the things which the constable has produced; I can speak to the napkins; I have others which correspond with them—I know these aprons by con<lb></lb>tinually wearing them every day—they were made at home by one of my barmaids; she is not here—I know them by others which correspond—this one has my initials, "C. W. 12" on it—I lost several farthings—these were the sort of bottles I lost—I cannot identify them from any others—I missed three bottles of Champagne.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On Sunday morning, two men came up to me and asked me to carry a bundle for them—they gave me a lot of farthings which I was to have for carrying them; among the farthings was a bit of candle—I did not notice it at the time: I was to carry the bundle, and meet them at King's-cross; they had another bundle with them, a bigger bundle.</p>

                  </hi> I am a seaman. The prosecutor has been living in the house where I do, and the prisoner also, for a few days—he and the prose<lb></lb>cutor came in on 29th Oct., between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening—they were both a little the worse for liquor, but not to say beastly drunk—the prisoner was not so drunk as not to know what he was about—they were sitting down, <hi rend="italic">chaffing</hi> each other, and having words—I had occasion to go into the back yard, and there was no one in the room but the mistress—when I came in, the prisoner and the prosecutor were both stripped, and had a knock or two—the mistress told me to tell them to go out—I ordered them to go out and fight, or else not at all—they sat down, and still had words—the prisoner then got up, and went up two flights of stairs, and was there, I suppose, ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—the prosecutor then wanted to go to bed; and the mistress said, "No, sit down, and let the man get to sleep, and there will be no more quarrelling"—she took the prosecutor by the jacket—he got from her—she gave me the candle, and said, "Go up with him, or there will be more fighting"—I went up with him—I had the candle and candlestick in my left hand, and was pushing him up with my right hand—when we got up to the landing I saw the prisoner standing—words took place between them, but I did not take notice what—I tried to get them apart, and to shove the prosecutor along—I saw them strike at one another, but I cannot tell whether they hit one another—I kept breaking them off—I think the prisoner struck first, because I was <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> the prose<lb></lb>cutor along—he was highest up on the stairs—he was behind me, and struck over my right shoulder—I did not see any knife on the first or the second blow. but at the third blow I saw the knife in his hand—I saw the blood and I <hi rend="italic">sang</hi> out, "Murder! murder!"—the prisoner was sober enough to run down stairs—I went down with the prosecutor, and the policeman was just come in—the prisoner was sitting down by the end of the table, and was going to</p>

               <p>shut the knife—the policeman made him stand up, to search him, and a man said, "I saw something fall at his feet;" and the policeman picked up the knife at his feet—the prosecutor was taken to the station, and the doctor came to him—one of his wounds was near the end of his nose, one on his lip, and one on his arm—that was just cut through his clothes, but was not so severe as the wounds on the lip and the nose.</p>

                  </hi> I live in high-street, Shadwell, and am surgeon to the police. I saw the prosecutor on the night of the 29th Oct., at the station, bleeding profusely from an incised wound over the nose, which had nearly taken off the end of the nose—there were two wounds on the left side of the upper lip dividing the lip, and an incised wound on the left arm, which was not very deep—his flannel waistcoat had been divided with the incision—I dressed the wounds, and saw they were going on well—I think I saw him again two days afterwards—the wounds were healing then—this clasp-knife would have caused the wounds.</p>

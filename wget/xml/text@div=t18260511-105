I have a small garden in the front of my house - I saw the pots safe on the Sunday night; I lost in the whole thirty-six pots, which were taken at three different times. Some were taken between Sunday night and Monday morning; there is a railing round the garden. I saw the plants again at Lambeth-street Office, but they were in flower. I took one as a sample of them - this was on Wednesday; I cannot swear to them now because the blossom is gone. I swore before the Magistrate, when the blossom was on - the pots there produced were those of which I was robbed - I knew them by the sticks, the strings, and the mould. There is one pot here which was never mine in my life.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Look at this desposition - is the signature to it your hand-writing? A. Yes, but I did not understand the paper then. I cannot now say whether these were my pots or not; I did not swear to the pots before the Magistrate; if they have so put it down it is put down wrong - if I marked the pots I cannot swear to the marks, and I never will.</p>

            . I am an officer. I attended at the examination, and heard the deposition read, which was made out by Mr. Harvey: it was read over to the prosecutor before he signed it; the pots which I have were marked by the prosecutor, with his own knife, with two notches, as they appear now - they are the same as were at the office.</p>
               <p>JOHN TIPPER re-examined. It was after I left the Magistrate that I marked the pot.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GOODING. They were marked in the office.</p>
               <p>JOHN TIPPER. It was at the public-house, after I left. I will not swear to the mark - I cannot swear to them with a safe conscience - I cannot swear whether the stick is my cutting - I did not swear so before the Magistrate - I did not swear before the Magistrate that I knew the pots - I took a sample with me of the flowers, to compare with them.</p>
               <p>Mr. SERGEANT ARABIN. Here, read part of the witness's deposition: - "I am positive the pots now produced were mine - I know them by the sticks, by the strings with which they are tied, and by the mould."</p>

            . I belong to Bow-street. About half-past eleven o'clock on the 17th of April I met Bonwick with five pots - I asked where he got them from; he replied from his brother's garden, in Dog-row - I said,"Have you got the key?" - he said, "No, it is left open." I detained him.</p>

            . I belong to Bow-street, and was in company with Gooding and Robinson. I met Bonwick and Phillips in Baker's-row; when they saw me look at them they turned back, but I apprehended them. Phillips had four pots on his arm - I found a key in his pocket, which he said belonged to his house, in Robert's-place, Green-street, Spitalfields; I went there, and found a young woman - Gooding went up stairs, and there we found three other pots. Phillips' wife said to Hutton,"You got them, Harry, and you know from where;" as we were going to the watch-house he said something about Mutton-lane, which induced us to go there; we saw the prosecutor, who said he had lost fifty pots. Tipper said he could not swear to the plants, but he could to the pots and the sticks, because he cut them with his own knife. After he signed the deposition he marked the pots with his knife, and made two notches on them; he desired the publican, where they were left, to water them. Tipper has since declined to prosecute - when I went to him yesterday they would not open the door, but went up stairs to speak to me.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GOODING. I was with the last witness - what he has said is true.</p>
               <p>COURT to JOHN TIPPER. Q. Were those pots marked by you? A. I marked some pots, but I will not swear to these - any body might have marked them; they were marked in the public-house, and not in the office. At the time I marked them I knew them to be mine. I marked them, because the officers wished me. If I had had the care of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110049"></xptr>them ever since I could have taken my oath. I was rather tipsy at the time I marked them.</p>

On Sunday, the 3rd of January, while I was at dinner, the prisoner came and asked if I was going out that afternoon—I said I rather expected a friend would call for me about three o'clock, and then I should go out, and did not know what time I should be in—my friend came—I went out—I returned about a quarter before five o'clock—I was let in by the under-porter, who told me he heard some one in the shop—I went and got a policeman, and then I said aloud that I would go to Turnham-green, to fetch Mr. Rumball—I went, and on our return we found the prisoner in custody in the kitchen, and the policeman had got this property now produced—it is my master's—the prisoner was covered with soot, as though he had been up a chim<lb></lb>ney—the carpet had been torn up at the side, and the trap-door leading from the shop to the vault beneath was partly open—on many of these</p>

                  </hi>, I am a constable of Plumstead. Mr. Richard Beau<lb></lb>mont Burnaby is a captain in the Royal Artillery, and lives at the academy, on Woolwich-common—I know the prisoner—his friends are very respect<lb></lb>able</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183902040248"></xptr>
               <p>—his father is a pensioner of the Royal Artillery—on the 5th of De<lb></lb>cember, about eight o'clock at night, I saw him with something under his arm at the corner of a plantation attached to the academy—I said, "What have you got there?"—he dropped it and ran—I said, "It is no use to run away, I know you"—I pursued him to Jackson's-lane, and there lost him—I returned to where he had dropped something, and found a leg and loin of mutton—I knew the prisoner, but I did not know where he lived—his jacket was afterwards found at his father's, in Jackson's-lane—it had a small piece of meat on it and some marks of fat.</p>

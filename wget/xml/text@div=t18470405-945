On the 17th of March, about ten minutes to ten o'clock, I went with James Badkins and William Gobart, the deceased, to Hare-alley, where the prisoner lives—when we were at the top of the court Gobart asked me to go and call the prisoner—I went and called out, "<hi rend="italic">Tom, Bill</hi> wants to speak to you"—the prisoner came down, and came to the top of the court—Gobart asked him for his things he had helonging to him, which were locked up in his box, that was the first thing that was said—the prisoner said he should not give them till such time as he paid him, and he did know that he should give them</p>

               <p>to him then, and if he stopped there a minute he would put a bullet through his head—I turned round and said to Gobart, "Bill, I am going, I am not going to stop to be shot at"—I left him and went to my own place, about twenty yards off in the next court—when I left the prisoner was going down the court—Badkins and Gobart remained—the prisoner's house is about twenty feet from the top of the court—I went up stairs, and in not more than two or three minutes heard the report of a gun—James Badkins came and called me—I went down stairs, went up Haare-court, and saw Gobart lying in a pool of blood in the court—he drew his breath—I did not hear him speak afterwards—I did not see the prisoner then—I went for a doctor.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 201.) On 17th March, about ten o'clock at night, I was on duty in Shoreditch, and heard the report of fire-arms—I went to the spot—before I got to Hare-alley I was called—I went to No. 3, in the court, and found the deceased—I lifted him up, and saw the ramrod of a gun near him—in consequence of what was said, I went up stairs, and found the prisoner on the first floor, with a gun in his hand, in the act of giving it up—I took it from him—his father was there, and said something about what he had done—the prisoner answered, "I have had my revenge; he has injured my sister and <hi rend="italic">others of mine,</hi> and I have had my revenge, and if had not done so he would have taken my life"—I had told him that Gobart was dead—I took him into custody, he went quietly with me—I searched him, and found some shot on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in High-street, Shoreditch—I found the body of the deceased lying in the passage, in a pool of blood—I found a gun-shot wound on the left side of the neck, which I have no doubt caused the death—the carotid artery and jugular vein were wounded—I extracted the shot.</p>

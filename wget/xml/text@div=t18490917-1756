I took Chambers into custody for stealing guns on the 27th June—from what he said to me, I went to the prisoner's house, in Back-lane, Whitechapel—he is a small master gun-smith—I told him I came for the gun-stock that he purchased from Chambers for a shilling, and that Chambers was in custody—he said, "Very well, come into the shop"—I went in, and he produced the gun-stock—I said, "You must know that this is stolen, you bought it from Chambers?"—he said, "I did not buy it of him, I lent him a shilling on it"—in coming along he was asked if he received any more property from Chambers—he said, "Yes, come back"—we went back, and he gave me the gun-barrel and lock—he said that Chambers left them there.</p>

On Wednesday the 26th of November, I was waked as near as I can judge about three o'clock by Mrs. Ellicott. She asked me what noise that was? I told her, I apprehended the servants were moving the tables in the passage. She said, that could not be, for it was quite dark. She rang the bell, upon which we heard some people coming upon the stairs. The first word I heard was, come up directly. We jumped up out of bed immediately. Mrs. Ellicott, slept on the side of the bed nearest the door. When I was out I heard my daughter's room door open, which is on the same floor, (the two pair of stairs) I heard somebody in the passage say, D - n your bloods we will murder every soul in the house. Mrs. Ellicott cried out, almost immediately, Lord bless me, the door is open; it fastens with a drop-bolt. I had forgot to fasten it, it was open and somebody was coming in; she went to the door and pushed it close; I hurried as fast as I could to the door; while she was at the door, a person said, D - n you if you do not open the door, I will murder every one of you, or to that effect, which voice was the same as the prisoner's at the bar. I did not see the person.</p>
               <p>Question. How soon after did you hear the prisoner speak?</p>
               <p>Ellicott. I think it was on the Friday, this was Wednesday the 26th, (on Friday the 28th I saw the prisoner.) when I came to the door I thought I could have pushed it too; but I found there was something put to prevent our shutting it, then Merritt called out to some others to come up directly, he called out come up directly. The door then was attempted with a considerable force: (there was a hanger with a scabbard put in between the door and the door post) by a great number; how many I cannot tell; when I found that by my own force, I could keep them from coming in. Mrs. Ellicott went across the bed to reach me a pair of loaded pistols that I had at my bed side; and at the same time rang the bell again very hard. I could not tell at first what they had put into the door; I took it to be a piece of stick, and Mrs. Ellicott tried to break it: on the bell being rung, the servants who lay over our heads came down: I still kept the door fast: I found then I could get it closer than before, so as to drop the bolt down and fasten the door; as soon as I had done that, I ran and threw up the sash which looks into the lane, and called out thieves: I saw my own three servants in the street in their shirts, they asked me which way they were gone; my servants did not say any thing to me as they came down stairs, so that I did not know that they were gone down. I opened the door and went down. After they had dressed themselves, I sent them on horseback in pursuit of the robbers; then I raised some carpenters that were at work in the neighbourhood, and they also went in pursuit; and I sent information to Sir

               <p>Ellicott. No. I lost the several articles mentioned in the indictment, ( repeating them.)</p>
               <p>Question. Did you find any of these things again?</p>
               <p>Ellicott. Respecting the thirty-hour alarum there was an advertisement in the news-paper some days after that such a thing had been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177412070014"></xptr> found in the fields near the sluice-house, a few days after. My house is remarkably well secured; the window-shutter they broke in at is a strong deal-shutter, there is a strong iron bar that goes across; when I came down, upon finding they were gone out of the house, I went to see how they came in; the rabbit of that joint of the shutter; was cut so as to get at the hinges, and the hinges were forced off; I apprehend they had bent the bar, so as to slide one part of the shutter behind the other, then there was a vacancy for them to get in; ( they are folding shutters) this let them into the back kitchen; when they had got there, the door that comes out of that kitchen into the common kitchen is very strong, it was bolted in the inside; they wrenched that bolt quite off, that let them into the common kitchen, the door out of that kitchen that leads into the body of the house was bolted as the other, and that was likewise broke open.</p>
               <p>Question. Where was the plate left?</p>
               <p>Ellicott. My orders are always, that the plate should be carried up into a place made on purpose in the room the servants lie in; but the footman negligently left them below when they went away. On my squeezing the room door so fast to keep them out, they could not get away the scabbard, but they

             the hanger out and left the scabbard behind. When the prisoner was taken, there was a hanger found without a scabbard that fits it, this is the scabbard that was left in my door; (producing it) I observed when the scabbard was between the door that Mrs. Ellicott tried to break it off; the hanger goes in just so far, if it hadgone quite to the end, she could not have bent it at all.</p>
               <p>Question. How do you know the hanger was in the scabbard at the time Mrs. Ellicott attempted to break it?</p>
               <p>Ellicott. I felt them attempt to draw it out, and after they had drawn it out, I was able to shut the door.</p>

               <p>Mr. Ellicott. Here is a piece of a small cupboard door that is broke open, it appears upon examination, that one of these chissels exactly fits the place where it is broke open; at one end there is a kind of claw which answers exactly to the marks; at the small end here is a little gap, there is even the mark of that gap upon the door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ellicott's Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Question. You was waked out of your sleep?</p>
               <p>Ellicott. Yes. I heard the noise which confused me.</p>
               <p>Question. There was a great deal of noise in the house I suppose?</p>
               <p>Answer. After I got up there was.</p>
               <p>Question. There were several I believe?</p>
               <p>Answer. It is impossible for me to tell, the door was too. I am confident there were more than one; we supposed at the time there were three or four.</p>
               <p>Question. There were more voices I believe than one?</p>
               <p>Ellicott. I believe there were. I heard the man's voice that was in my daughter's room; but not distinctly.</p>
               <p>Question. Being waked in this manner, you must be somewhat flurried?</p>
               <p>Answer. Yes. I believe there is nobody here, but would, I have as much presence of mind too, I believe as most people.</p>
               <p>Question. You must be something agitated, especially at the cry of murder?</p>
               <p>Answer. I was not alarmed at that; when I got out of bed first, I was alarmed, but when I found I could keep the door, and had a brace of pistols; I cannot say I was so much alarmed then.</p>
               <p>Question. But against so many men?</p>
               <p>Answer. I had three stout fellows in the house, besides myself.</p>
               <p>Question. I should suppose there must be more voices heard than one?</p>
               <p>Ellicott. I did hear the voice in my daughter's room, and Merritt's; they were the only<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177412070015"></xptr> voices I heard; I heard him say, if you don't lie still; I will blow your brains out.</p>
               <p>Question. You heard a voice you believe to be the prisoner's?</p>
               <p>Ellicott. The voice I heard at my room door, I believe to be the prisoner's.</p>

               <p>Question. Are you sure it is Miller?</p>
               <p>Godfrey. Very sure.</p>
               <p>Question. What compass of time, did you see him?</p>
               <p>Godfrey. A quarter of a minute, he was dressed in a brown great coat, and his other cloaths, snuff coloured, I did not see his waistcoat; I never saw him before; I made the best of my way to the door, but they got out of the door, before I could see which way they went.</p>
               <p>Question. Was it a dark or light night?</p>
               <p>Godfrey. Very moon light.</p>
               <p>Question. Did you hear a noise of more persons than one?</p>
               <p>Godfrey. I heard a very great noise; I heard Miller's voice; he said, d - m you make haste, they are upon us. I was coming down the stairs when he said that.</p>
               <p>Question. Have you seen Miller since, and heard him speak since?</p>
               <p>Godfrey. Yes; and believe it to be his voice.</p>
               <p>Question. Did you see the place they broke in at?</p>
               <p>Godfrey. First they got a ladder, and got down into the area, the ladder was left there. They broke open a gate at a carpenter's, where they got this ladder from: it is a sash window, they pulled the sash down, and pushed aside the shutter. I saw the cook maid bar the shutter, over night. They broke the bolt off that kitchen door into the best kitchen, from there they got into the body of the house: those doors were fast, I saw the footman bolt them. They broke open a great chest that was in the passage, up one pair of stairs.</p>

               <p>Question. Was the prisoner upon the stairs?</p>
               <p>Miller. I cannot say he was with us, I cannot remember where he was in my flurry. I know Hatchman and I were in the room. I believe he was, but I cannot say punctually; Mr. Ellicott shuting the door fast, the hanger came out without the sheath. They pulled it out; it was in the sheath when it was thrust in at the door. Mr. Ellicott said, give me my gun, I will blow their brains out. We all ran down stairs, and made our escape. We went down the lane, towards some fields, we took the property out of the bag and put it in our pockets, and we left the clock and tea chest in a field, and the cane I believe.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177412070017"></xptr>Miller. We had all cut-lashes and pistols, Hatchman, and I and Nimmey, had all a lash a piece, and a pistol a piece, and Yapper had a cutlash of his own, that he brought with him, which he carries about him for fear of being taken, because he has returned from transportation; I was the person that went last out of the house, we had three bits of candles, but I was the last that left the house, I took the key and put it outside the door and tried to lock it, but in my flurry I did not know whether I locked it or no.</p>

               <p>Answer. I don't remember any such thing.</p>
               <p>Question. Do you remember any expressions used at Mr. Ellicott's door.</p>
               <p>Answer. I remember we said d - n you make haste and open the door. Hatchman, or Matshumet said that.</p>
               <p>Question. Did you hear the prisoner make use of any expressions?</p>

               <p>Answer. About five guineas: Hatchman was at the receiving of the money, he gave me mine and said he would give the others theirs.</p>
               <p>Question. Had the prisoner any arms?</p>
               <p>Answer. I don't remember he had; he was a little bad in his limbs and was not able to use any.</p>
               <p>Question. What did you carry all these things away in?</p>
               <p>Answer. In a big apron, till we came to the fields, then we put them in our pockets.</p>
               <p>Question. Who carried you this apron?</p>
               <p>Answer. It belonged to Yapper and Hatchman, or

               <p>Answer. We had such a one; I cannot say whether this is it, but we had a chissel, besides a socket chissel.</p>
               <p>Question. Who did that chissel you had there belong to?</p>

               <p>Question. Do you remember when Merritt was taken up?</p>
               <p>Answer. Yes, I was coming out of the ship-ale-house, at the bottom of the lane; I went up the lane to go the nearest way into Goodman's-fields: Pagett stood at the door as I was walking by; he ran a-cross the way, took hold of me dragged me to the house and throwed me down; Farrell said he would knock my teeth down my throat or kill me: I said I would go quietly.</p>
               <p>Question. Was not you going into the house?</p>
               <p>Answer. No, so help me God.</p>

             and Nimmy, and Matshumet came to my house the day before Mr. Ellicott's house was broke open, they said, they were going to rob a Jew ladies at Highgate; and asked me if I was willing to go with them; I was very poorly, I had work to go to, and thought it would be best; they said, it was a Jew ladies, and she had a Jew maid. (This Yapper is a Jew,) and the Jew maid was to leave the door open for us to go in, and after the house was robbed, he was to be married to this Jew maid: I went along with him to Highgate to do the robbery; when we came there, the house was all fastened: I had much ado to walk there; when we found we could not do that house: I went a little way down Hornsey-Lane with them. I said I was not able to walk any farther; I must go home: I did, and know nothing about Mr. Ellicott's robbery, nor never had a halfpenny of the money: they went on without me; I was not able to go about any other business: I beg your Lordship would ask Miller, whether I was in the house.</p>
               <p>Miller. I believe he was on the stair-case: I cannot say, whether he was or no; to swear punctually.</p>
               <p>Question. Was he at the house?</p>
               <p>Miller. Yes.</p>

               <p>Answer. Yes.</p>
               <p>Question. Did you meet together that night afterwards.</p>

               <p>Miller. Yes we met in two minutes afterwards.</p>
               <p>Question. All of you.</p>
               <p>Answer. All but him, I did not know which way he went, he ran away or something, I don't know how he went.</p>
               <p>Question. Was he at the house at the time you went down the area.</p>
               <p>Answer. He was at the door.</p>
               <p>Question. As you went out last did you see how many went out before you.</p>
               <p>Answer. There were four or five of us in I know.</p>
               <p>Question. Dou you recollect whether you saw him upon the stair-case or no.</p>
               <p>Answer. I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Question. Did not he help to bring some of the things away.</p>
               <p>Answer. It was I and Hatchman took the property down stairs, Yapper brought them into the field, it was all in a bag, when we came into the field, we took the clock and came out and threw them away, the other things we put in our pocket.</p>
               <p>Question. Did the prisoner put nothing in his pocket.</p>

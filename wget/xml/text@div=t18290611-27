            . I am a constable. I went to the stable a little after four o'clock; I found this bag concealed in a cart belonging to Franks - when I took White, he said he knew nothing about it; I then took Goodman, who said, "Don't be a fool, it is the first time, and look over it;" he afterwards said it was only the sweepings of the manger; he said his lower ground horses were unwell, and had a running at the nose - the top of this corn was mostly bran, the lower part is very good mixed corn.</p>

               <p>Edward Walker. Last Thursday Night, a little after 6, a Fellow came into my Shop, and asked for Thread; while y Girl was turned about to serve him, he snatch'd these Things off the Counter, and made off, I pursued, and took him directly.</p>

            . Last Thursday Night, I saw a Man run by me in a White cap'd-coat, and a Black Wig; I was going to follow him, he ran about 2 Doors, and then hustled out a Coat and a Hat, and I took it up: There was a Dray standing on the same Side of the Way, which hinder'd him from running much further before he was stopped. I did not see him taken, therefore can't be positive that the Prisoner is the Man that ran past me; but he is the Person who was taken.</p>

            . I was coming along St Ann's Lane, and hearing a cry of Stop Thief, I seiz'd the Prisoner: When I took hold of him, he said, G - d d - n me, nothing vexes me so much, as being taken by such a little Animal as you. I did not see him drop any Thing; but he had a a White-cap'd Coat on, and there was a Dray in the Way when I took him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Ask her if I took the Coat and Hat?</p>
               <p>Robottom. No; but I have seen the Prisoner in company with the Man that took them. The Man who took them had a Grey coat and a Leather Apron on.</p>

            . Last Thursday Evening the Prisoner was at my House between 5 and 6 o'clock, and in half an Hour after he was gone, he sent me word that he was taken up. I went to the Prosecutor's to enquire about it, and his Wife said, that he did not take it; but it was taken by a Man in a Grey coat, and a Leather Apron. The Prisoner is a very honest, just, upright Man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coach-master, and live in New-court, Holborn. On Monday, the 13th of July, I was in Lucas-place, St. Pancras, about two o'clock—as I passed a house, a woman, in the ground-floor room, beckoned me, and called me in—I went into the room to her, and, as soon as I got in, they demanded something to drink—I was there about five minutes—I refused to give her any thing, and wanted to come out of the house, but the door was closed—they would not let me come out of the room—there was another female in the room with her—they said I was not going out in that sort of manner, without I was going to <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> something to drink, and told me to send for it there—the other girl said, "I will go and get half-a-pint, if you will send for it," but I would not—I went to pull open the door, but it was closed—I cannot tell whether it was flour or lime that was first thrown at me—a woman who was in the room then threw something in my face—it was not that woman who invited me in, but an old woman—the other woman had not said any thing to her before that—I had said I would send for nothing, but if they would come up to the corner I would not mind paying for something, but she said, "Send for it here"—I was in the act of pulling the door open when something was thrown into my face—the prisoner was the woman who did it—it burnt my face all over, and I have lost the sight of my right eye, and the other is so affected I can scarcely see at a distance—it burnt my linen and clothes—I had nothing to do with the woman in the room—it blinded me directly.</p>

Between two and three o'clock on this Monday I was going by the house, and heard a noise inside—I heard a little bit of a <hi rend="italic">bother,</hi> but not much—I heard a girl ask the man for his money—I did not hear his answer—I heard her say, "Don't let him go, he wants to <hi rend="italic">bilk</hi> her"—the street door was a little way open—I saw the prosecutor coming towards the door, and the prisoner got a handful of flour, and <hi rend="italic">hove</hi> at him at first—she <hi rend="italic">hove</hi> it behind him as he was coming out—he turned round to see what she was heaving at him, and then she <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> something right in his face—he hallooed out, "Oh murder, murder, I am blinded; they have been heaving lime in my face, I am blinded."</p>

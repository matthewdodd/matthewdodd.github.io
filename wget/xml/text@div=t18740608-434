I am married, and live at 3, Union Street, with my mother, the last witness—the Pollain's had a parlour there—I recollect the child being brought there, but I did not see it till Christmas Day—it looked very thin and ill then—they came about a fortnight or three weeks before Christmas—the prisoner treated the child what I consider very badly—she used to beat it occasionally—I have heard her beat it very hard for a child so young, and have spoken to her about it—I knocked at the door and said "You wretch for treating the baby," she said "What for"—I said "for slapping the baby in that manner you are slapping it"—she had the baby in her lap, and it had nothing on but its little chemise—she went out that afternoon—sometimes she went out in the morning, and left it for twelve and fourteen hours together—she used to lock the door, but once I heard the child crying in the morning, and I thought it was like going into a fit, and I found the door open and the baby was lying outside on the bed, and the cat was lying on its chest—I saw nothing for it to eat at all—at that tune the prisoner went out soon after dinner, and came back about five or six in the evening—it was on a Saturday—it was a usual thing for her to go out all day, and leave the child locked up.</p>

I am a medical officer to the Bethnal Green Workhouse Infirmary—I was shown the child on Saturday, 16th May—it weighed 12 1/2 lbs. without clothes—I formed an opinion that it was about fourteen months old—I have heard since it is twenty-one months—if it was fourteen months it ought to have weighed two or three pounds more—I found the child had some bruises on the right cheek, and on the left ear, and it was very much bruised behind the left ear—it appeared to have been pinched with the finger and thumb—the child could not have done that itself—the nose was flattened, and apparently broken, and the hair was worn off the back of the head, that was from the friction of the head against the back of the chair—there were little ulcers about the size of split peas on the child's seat—that would be from sitting in one posture too long, and with the wet—I came to the conclusion that it had not been properly nourished—there was no disease—the right knee was stiffened, and the left knee was" less so—it is very much better now—the ulcers are nearly cured, and it has gained half a pound in weight, and but for being vaccinated would have gained more—when the child was admitted its <hi rend="italic">life</hi> was in danger, and therefore its health was—I am of opinion that the danger was occasioned by want of proper nourishment—I could detect no disease; and from its rapid improvement I think it was badly nourished.</p>

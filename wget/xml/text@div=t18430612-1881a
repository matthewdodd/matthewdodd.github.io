                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Newman, a fruiterer, in Lamb-street, Spitalfields. On Wednesday, the 2nd of May, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I dressed my children, Sarah and Mary Ann—Sarah, who is seven years old, had on a pair of new shoes—they went</p>

               <p>out together to play in Spital-square, two doors off—I heard something two hours afterwards—in consequence of which I went to Spital-square, and found my children in the lobby of a house there, without their shoes—I took them home—on the Friday following, about five o'clock in the afternoon, my children were at my window—they both called out—the prisoner was going by at the time—I went to the window, and saw her—in consequence of what the children said, I went after her, brought her back to the house, and asked Sarah, in the prisoner's presence, if she was the girl—she was to terr<lb></lb>fied she could not speak, and I let her go—the child said something afterwards, and I went after the prisoner again—she ran away—I did not catch her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am seven years old—some time ago I and my sister went to play in the square where we live—the prisoner came up to us, and said, "Will you let me take off your shoes?"—she took me into a lobby, and said I must take off my shoes—she wanted me to go up into her room—she took them off, and said, "Will you go up into my room, it is a pretty place"—there was nobody there when she took them off—she went away with the shoes, and left me and my sister in the lobby—after she was gone I knocked at the door—a gentleman came out—I told him the girl had run away with my shoes and my sister's—my mother came soon after to the lobby—a few days after I was looking out at the window, with my sister, I saw the prisoner passing, and called out—I am sure she is the person—I did not know her before she took my shoes off.</p>

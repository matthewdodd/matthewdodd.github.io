                  </hi>. I am a tailor, living in Carnaby-street, Golden-square On the 29th of May, at four o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner's St. Giles's—I went with her to No. 3, Salutation-court—I went to bed with her, and took all my clothes off-when I awoke she was gone, and my con also—she came back—I asked her where the coat was—she said she had pledged it for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told her to go and get it—I had given her a half.-crown and a shilling to get something to drink—she went, but did not come back, and I waited till four o'clock the next morning—I had to write to a friend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. When I met him he had but a half-crown, and that was spent in liquor with his friend—he said, if I would let him have the bed, he would pawn his coat, and stop all day with me, and give me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and as soon as the shops were open I took it—he breakfasted with me, and stopped all day on Monday and Tuesday. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not breakfast with her—I was forced to stay at the house till the Tuesday morning—I never authorised her to pawn it—I did not get up and light the fire—it was her own apartment—I do not think 1 was sober when I went there.</p>

On the 29th of December I was returning home about four o'clock in the morning; I heard a waggon going out of my yard. It was not to go out so early as that; I had ordered it out between five and six. I suspected something was wrong; I went out, and waited outside of the gate. The prisoner and

            , who has absconded, were to drive the waggon. I desired them to stop in George-street; there were two trusses of clover hay upon the top of the waggon, besides a truss of meadow hay for their horses. They did not know I was there until I told them to stop. I got upon the wheel; I observed the two trusses of clover hay, besides that a truss of meadow hay for their horses, and a nose-bag full of corn for their horses. When we send out horses we send meadow hay with them. When Pearce saw me upon the wheel he desired the prisoner to hold the whip; he absconded immediately. They were both equally entrusted with the waggon. The prisoner staid with the waggon until I called my clerk up.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had this man lived with you - A. A month or five weeks. The prisoner said he knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this clover hay in the same place or near it, in the waggon - A. No, the meadow hay was on the shafts, and the clover hay was upon the top of the waggon on the dung. I directly called my clerk up, and sent the prisoner to the watchhouse. When I returned, after calling the clerk up, I observed one of the trusses of clover hay off the waggon; my clerk found it throwed into a neighbour's yard. I left the prisoner with the waggon while I went and called my clerk up.</p>

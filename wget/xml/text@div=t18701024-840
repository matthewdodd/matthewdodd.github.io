I am a French polisher, in the prosecutor's service—he called to me, on the afternoon of 6th October, to bring down a case—the two prisoners were in the shop at the time—I brought two cases, and the prosecutor came to the back of the shop to take them from me—he took them to the prisoners—I was sent after them when they left the shop, and I saw them in Baker Street, running slowly—I followed to Iron-monger Row, and pointed them oat to the constable, and they were taken into custody—I am sure these are the men.</p>

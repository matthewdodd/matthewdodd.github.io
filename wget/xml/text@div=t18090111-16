            . I live in Hampstead road, I am a labouring man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you deal in horses - A. No; I go about with fish.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say about any bay gelding - A. I was in Camden Town crying my fish on the Thursday before Christmas day, about twelve o'clock, I bought the horse; I met the prisoner leading the horse along.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a horse was it - A. A bay horse, it had one eye. I asked him if he was going to sell the horse, I thought he was coming out of the country, and was going to sell the horse; he said yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other horse at that time - A. No. He said he was going to sell it; I asked him what he asked for it; he said a guinea and a half; I told him that was too much, I put my basket on my head and was going away; I told him I would give him sixteen shillings for it; he stood a bit, I went on, and when I returned again he said I should have it; I asked him then where he lived; he told me he lived in the Kilburn Road, two doors from the Black Lion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him what his name was - A. No. He said that he had this horse, and that he worked him in the Brick carts at Kilburn, the weather was so bad he could not draw bricks, he turned the horse up the lane, he thought he had better sell it than let it lie starving about the hedges; I told him I would trouble him to go home with me; I gave him twelve shillings in Camdem Town; he led the horse to my door, I gave him a seven shilling piece, he gave me three shillings and delivered the horse to me; then he left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all that time you did not ask him his name - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Was this before this horse had been claimed - A. Afterwards. I spoke to him; he said, good morning, and asked me where I was going; I told him I was going to Paddington to pay five pounds for some rags I had bought of my brother; I then asked him where he got that old horse he was leading of; he told me he bought it of one

               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him respecting the horse you had bought of him - A. Not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know at that time that the horse had been claimed - A. Yes. He said I gave him a bad shilling; I told him if I did I did not wish to do it, I would change it for him; he gave it me; I told him we must go to the public house and have something to drink, and then I would change it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you a shilling - A. He gave me a large sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that what you gave him for a shilling - A. He said it was, I did not know it; we went into the King's Head public house, Tottenham court road; I asked for some purl, and shut the door, and told him that he had stole the horse that I bought, and that it had been stopped; he said he had not; I told him I was sure he had; he then sat down and said he did, he had done it for distress, he had a family, and his children wanted bread. I then sent for Mr. Crocker the officer - he took the man in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell us after you had bought the horse of the prisoner what you did with him - A. When I bought the horse and brought him home, I found he would not suit me; I went to sell him again.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you find out he would not suit - A. He was lame.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you seen that when you bought him - A. Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go to sell him again - A. The same afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you intended to sell him again when you bought it - A. I did not know; if he had suited me I should have kept him. On the same afternoon I sold him to one Mr. Cross, going down towards Battle bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with Mr. Cross - A. In the road going along.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here - A. No. He lives in Maiden lane, Battle bridge, he is a knacker; I agreed to sell him for twenty shillings and sixpence; he wanted me to trust him; I would not; he then gave me three shillings earnest; he said he would fetch the horse at seven o'clock at night, if I would keep him for him; I then took him home and told him I would; this was on the Thursday; he never came for the horse; I tied the horse up and gave him some hay. I called upon him the next morning to know whether he meaned to fetch him or no; he said he would come for it about ten o'clock. I went out with my goods, when I came home the horse was there; this was about two o'clock on the Friday; I said to my wife I would take him to Smithfield to sell him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him to Smithfield to sell him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been yourself in Smithfield market - A. The young man that I took with me held the horse while I was talking to a man that I had bargained with to sell the horse; I saw him in Smithfield just as I was going in. The young man's name is Wood that held the horse for me in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I understand you to say you saw this Cross in the market - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sell the horse then to him, or did he pay for it - A. No; I went to him, we had a few words; he said if I would bring the horse up to him he would pay me; accordingly I went to fetch the horse to him; the horse was standing in the market; I halloaed for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110016"></xptr>the young man; I saw a great mob about the horse and that it was stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body there that owned the horse - A. Yes, Berryman claimed the horse; I went to Berryman, I told him that young man knew nothing about the horse, that I had brought it from Camden town; I told Berryman I bought the horse; he said the horse belonged to Cockbill his neighbour.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you at the time that he took the horse - A. They wanted to put me in the counter; they knew me, and I begged of them not to put me in; he took the horse down, and I was to go to him the next day; I was told to come to him at Walham green, Fulham.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning you told us you met the prisoner as you described - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Walham green before you saw him - A. No; I went afterwards to Walham green, and informed them after he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was you yourself that had him taken in custody - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you swear that horse that Berryman took away was the same horse that you had bought of the prisoner the day before - A. On the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. Well this was on the Friday that the horse was taken away - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And on the Thursday you had bought it of the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>

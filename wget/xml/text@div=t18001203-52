             sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Rigden: On the evening of the 5th of November, about six o'clock, the prisoner at the bar came to our shop, and brought home a waistcoat that her father had made; I gave her another for her father to make; she tied it in a handkerchief; while I was entering it in the book, and was going out of the door, I stepped into the cutting-room adjoining the shop, to speak to the foreman; in coming back, I saw the child at the end of the shop, where she had no business; she then went out at the door, and I perceived, as she stooped to open the door, that she had something under her cloak; I sent for my master, and he ordered me to fetch her back, which I did; I told her we had something else to make, and brought her back with me; I gave her another waistcoat, which she tied up in her bundle; Mr. Regden then went round the counter, and lifted up her cloak, and took from under her arm a blue cloth jacket; he then took her to the Police-office.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Strand-on-the-Green. I had an ass on the 18th of September, and turned it out in the ground of the Water-works Company, at Brentford—I had bred it—it had a particular mark on the bearing—I lost it on the 18th of September—it is three years old next May—I next saw it on the 5th of December, in Brentford, with the prisoner—I had seen him before—I went up to him and asked how long he had had the donkey—he said, Four years"—I said, Not four months"—he said, "What, have you lost a donkey?"—I said yes, I had lost it, but I could not have lost it as it was before my eyes—then he said, Will you pay me for the keep of it, all the time you have lost it?"—I refused, and went to the station-house, and stated that I had lost my donkey on the 18th of September, and had seen it come up the town with some sprats—I said he had some marks done, with the cow's horns—if it was not mine, I would not swear to it—I swear it is mine, and not my mother's.</p>

I know this donkey—I saw it in the pro secutor's possession when he went to the station-house—I knew it ever since it was foaled—some people said it was his mother's donkey, and some said it was Walter's, and I could not tell whose it was—Young had a donkey, and I believe that to be his—it is the one he used to drive—I did not see it in the prisoner's possession at the time he was taken—I believe it to be the one that was in Young's possession, whether his or his mother's—I did not hear any thing said about paying for the keep of it—I was not there then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Rebecca Blake, who keeps an eating-house in Whitecross-street. The prisoner used to frequent the house, in company with a man who went by the name of Big Bill—they used to annoy my mistress a good deal—they used to eat the soup sometimes, and not pay for it—on the day in question they came and asked for two basins of soup—my mistress refused to serve them—she told me not to serve them, as she knew they would not pay for it—I took one basin to them—they would not pay for it, and I brought it back again—they both came to the counter—mistress put the steel on the counter—the prisoner took it up and gave it to the other one—mistress asked him to give it up—he said he had not got it—she asked him several times for it—she sent me for the policeman, and when I came back Bill was gone—we have never got the steel back.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the cook-shop. The prisoner and Big Bill were troublesome sometimes, when they were tipsy—I was in the bar at this time—I did not see the prisoner take the steel, because my back was to him—Bill is a very bad character, and this young man has kept his company a long time; but I do not believe the prisoner is a thief at all, but he has got into bad company—the thief got out of the door before we could get him—he ran away, and this man was taken—the wrong man was taken, and the thief ran away.</p>

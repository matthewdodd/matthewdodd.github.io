                  </hi>. I live in Blackfriars-road. On 13th Feb., I was awoke by my servant about a quarter-past six in the morning. I went down and found the back staircase-window open, which I had left shut down quite close the night before when I went to bed at twelve o'clock—I was the last person up—I went into the drawing-room and found a secretary open, and papers and things lying about, also two cupboards on each side the fire-place—I missed a mahogany case with a microscope, and a scent-bottle from the mantel-piece, which were safe the night before—the places were not locked, but all the locks had been opened—a tea-caddy and envelope case were removed from the drawing-room down into the passage—I missed six sixpences from the till in the shop and some halfpence—this microscope, case, and scent-bottle are mine (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mrs. Noel; the prisoner lodges in the house. On Tuesday, 13th Feb., between twelve and one o'clock in the day, I was called into the front parlour', and saw the prisoner and a strange young man there—this microscope was lying on the table—the strange young man asked me to take and pawn it, and get as much on it as I could—I pawned it for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., came back with the money, and placed it on the table—I don't know what was done with it, I left the room.</p>

Q.</hi> Did the other young man hand the microscope to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he pointed to it, and I took it up—I had never seen him before—I was in the kitchen when the young man called me into the parlour—he said,"Will you come this way?"</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 63). In consequence of information I went to the pawnbroker's, and got this microscope; while there, Chick came in consequence of what she said I went to 12, James-street, Union-street, Borough-road—I there found the prisoner sitting on a bed, dressing himself—I said, I had a charge of felony against him—he said he should not go with me; he had seen many a better man than I was—I searched his room, and found this scent-bottle in a table-drawer—he afterwards dressed, and accompanied me to the station—Chick stated, on her first examination, that the two sent her with the microscope. <hi rend="smallCaps">

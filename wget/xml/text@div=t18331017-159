            . I was with Bannister on the night in question - we were going home on the pavement; the prisoner and several companions came by at the same time, and they said, "Look at the b-y lumpers;" before they said that, the prosecutor had not said a word to them - I immediately asked them what they had to do with the lumpers - the prisoner said, any thing what I liked, or the rest of the party; Bannister said, if they did not go off about their business he would send them to the station-house - the prisoner immediately struck him a violent blow on the face - Bannister had done nothing to him; Bannister was not able to return the blow; when he received the first blow from the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170094"></xptr>prisoner, it cut him very much; the prisoner repeated the blows very fast, very quick - Bannister was quite insensible while he was repeating the blows - he bled very much indeed; he lost a great deal of blood - I saw a man named Grimble there; he is here to-day, he was in the Green Dragon when the blow was first struck; I afterwards saw an oyster-shell in Grimble's hand, about four or five minutes after the blows were struck; the prisoner was gone away then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What became of Bannister after the first blow was given, what did he say? A. He was beat up against the side of the house; he was quite insensible when he was struck, and could not speak; he said nothing - the blow cut him across the nose, and disfigured him; he did not stand up; he leaned against the side of the house, and then the prisoner beat him very violently - I was close to Bannister.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not prevent the prisoner from striking him? A. It was done so suddenly, and the alarm given so quick - Grimble was out almost immediately after the first blow.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason why you did not interfere to prevent it? A. There was only the prisoner striking; there was only man for man - Bannister was insensible after the first blow; but there was such a parcel of people got round, it was impossible to get to him; I was close to him when the first blow was struck, but the crowd assembled very fast; I saw nobody strike him but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. As you have used the expression "Man for man," will you swear there was not a fight? A. Fight, why no.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take your oath there was not a fight between the prisoner and Bannister? A. I call it nothing else but a fight; Bannister did not strike any blows at all - I did not hear the prosecutor say, he would fight any coal-heaver on the coast; nor that he was ready to fight any; I heard no such thing - the prisoner might have staid four or five minutes in my presence; his brother was there at the time - I know

            . I am a lumper and coal-heaver; I was in the Green Dragon public-house, on the 27th of August, and in consequence of a noise I went out - I saw the prisoner kicking and beating Bannister who works with me - I am foreman to Mr. Burkitt - I ran out of the house and the prosecutor was then lying under the next house from the Green Dragon, where I saw the prisoner and others beating him - I saw the prisoner beating him at first, and I saw others making up towards him - I did not see them inflict any blow - Bannister was profusely covered with blood - he was insensible - the prisoner made his escape directly - I took Bannister into the Green Dragon - I believe a surgeon was got for him - you would not know the man, he was beat so on his head, and covered with blood - the moment I was apprised of what was going forward, I rushed forwards and a gentleman there gave the oyster shell into my hands - I have it here - the prisoner was absent at the time - I never showed the oyster shell to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you mean by the expression that you saw the prisoner and others beating Bannister? A. The prisoner I have known for three or four years; he was the first man I saw beating the prosecutor - I saw three or four others who are now in attendance, stripping their clothes off, to beat the b-y lumpers - I saw the prisoner kicking him.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you mean by saying you saw him and others beating Bannister? A. I may possibly have gone too far; but I have sworn to the prisoner at the bar, seeing him beating him and others attempting to do the same - I saw them rushing forwards - I did not see the spectators strike him - I have been with Burkitt about seven months - previous to that, I belonged to the police-force, to the K division - I did not leave it with any disgrace at all - I left at my own option, that I swear - no charge was made against me to the commissioners - I was recommended to the commissioners from Norwich - I came and served here three years, and left without disgrace to my character - my recommendation was from Colonel Harvey - I swear I was not discharged, for I took off my clothes and delivered them up - I left it because I thought I had got something better to attend to - I shall not answer you another question - I will only answer any questions the Court think proper.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you, now do you mean to say you quitted the police-force of you own accord, and was not discharged? A. I do - I did not see him kick more than once, for the moment he clapped his eye on me, he made his exit - I had time to see one kick - I cannot exactly say where he kicked him; I should suppose it was in the body; he was down at the time - I suppose it might be from the head, betwen two feet of that and the head - I do not think he kicked him on the head.</p>

            . I am a servant at the Green Dragon. I remember going out into the street on hearing a noise - I saw the prisoner there - I saw him give Bannister a most woeful blow; a hard blow - Bannister was standing up at the time - a little time after, I saw a shell in the prisoner's hand - I did not see it in Grimble's hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long after the blow did you see the shell in the prisoner's hand? A. About ten minutes as near as can be after the prisoner struck Bannister the blow - Bannister was helped into the yard - the mates helped him in that were in the tap-room - they did not help him in directly after the blow - it was a very few minutes after the prisoner struck the blow; he stood there; he did not do anything after the first blow that I saw - I went closer to him after he struck the blow, and I found Bannister standing up, he was staggering a little, when I got up to him; the prisoner was standing up when I got closer - and the men took Bannister into the yard, a very few minutes after the blow was given - I did not hear the prisoner say anything when he struck the blow - he did nothing but stand there that I saw - Bannister was standing with his face towards the prisoner; I did not see his hands up; I only saw the prisoner give him one blow - the prosecutor was standing up when the blow was given - and I did not see the prisoner strike him at all afterwards - I am quite sure Bannister was standing up when he received the blow - I did not see anything the matter with his face before he got the blow - Bannister had a quantity of blood on his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170095"></xptr>face - he was covered with blood - I saw the first blow, his face was covered with blood after the blow - I did not see the prisoner go away - he remained behind after Bannister was taken in - I saw Grimble, he was not there when the blow was given; he was fetched when the blow was given - one of the mates called him, and he came out- the prisoner staid a few minutes after the blow was given - he did not go away directly, Grimble came out - we were both the same distance from him - I could see as well as Grimble.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see Bannister strike the prisoner in any way? A. No, not at all; after I saw him bleeding he was leaning against the wall, staggering against the house.</p>

            . I am a surgeon of the parish of St. Luke's. I was called in on the Friday subsequent to Tuesday, the 30th of August - I saw the prosecutor bleeding at the nose profusely then; there was a lacerated wound on the right side of his nose; the cartilage was separated from the bone of the nose; there was a considerable contraction about the right eye; it was closed - it was not a very serious case; I considered the haemorrhage which took place was an effort of nature, and that he would recover from it.</p>

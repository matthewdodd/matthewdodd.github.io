                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Withey, we live on Great Saffron-hill, in the back-garret. The prisoner came to live in the front garret, the next room to me—he and the woman who was with him had a child, which was two years and five months old—they had been there a fortnight before this happened—after they had been there two nights, I heard screams from the woman two or three times in the night, and a little shrieking noise from the child, about the time I heard the woman</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184201030146"></xptr>
               <p>scream—on Thursday afternoon, the 30th of December, about four o'clock I heard some quarrelling with the prisoner and the woman—he came home and quarrelled with her about nursing the child—he said, "You have been nursing that b—y b—r"—I heard that, as my room door was open, and I put my head outside my door—the prisoner appeared to be sober—the woman said she had not been nursing the child—he said he knew she had, by her arm, and she should not nurse that thing while she was with him—they became quiet after that—I did not hear the child put to bed—the woman is in the family way—the prisoner and her locked their door and went out together between four and five o'clock—they did not take the child with them—I thought it was in bed—the woman returned about six—I saw her pass my room door—she was sober—I never saw her drunk—I heard the prisoner come home in an hour or two, and from his mode of speech I formed an opinion directly that he was very much intoxicated—he seemed as if he fell down—there was a noise as if some<lb></lb>body fell—he then began to call the woman to account about some half pence, and sent her out to get a rasher of bacon—I ran out to hear that—he said the child should not eat his victuals—the woman went for the bacon—it was about eight o'clock—I went to the door di<lb></lb>rectly she passed by to go out—I heard the prisoner get up directly, and poke the fire—he came up directly towards the door where the bedstead was—I knew that by his steps—there was a crack at the door, and I could see his shadow pass—he went to the bedside—I heard the bedstead-stick rattle—it has got a bit of tin to it—it rattled as if he had beat it on the bed—I heard it three times, and about three blows, and the child shriek in a kind of stifling manner, three times—after that the prisoner went back to the fire-place, and poked it about, he sat down, and then walked about quite collected—he did not seem intoxicated at all—he began to whistle—soon after the woman came in, she went into the room, and I heard her ask him if he had been ill-using her baby—be said, "No"—sbe said, "I think you have, as it is awake now, and it seems to me to have been crying"—he said, "Well then, I have; have it so, if you will"—they began talking about how long she stayed—I called out, "He has been beating the baby, the villain; he has been beating the baby, take a candle and look, I will go for the policeman!"—the woman took the candle, and. went to the bed, and said, "O my God, he has' been beating it, there are three lumps on its forehead!"—they began to quarrel, and I thought he struck her—I said to my husband, "Speak to that man, he will murder the woman"—he called out, "What are you at there?"—the prisoner said, "What is that to you? if you interfere I will get a knife, and rip your b—guts out."</p>

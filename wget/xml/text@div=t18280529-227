The prisoner came to me last Saturday, and asked for a job; I said I did not know of one - he stood at the bench, and asked for something to drink - I said I did not want anything, and desired him to walk away; he stood muttering something; I went to the end of the bench. and saw him go out; he was shuffling at the side of his thigh - I went after him, and said, "You have my rule;" "I have" says he, and he gave it me.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

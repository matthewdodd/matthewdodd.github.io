                  </hi>. I live in Kent Street—on Saturday night, 9th Decem<lb></lb>ber I was in the Mint Gate Tavern, near St. George's church, drinking with the prisoner—we came out and were talking together—the prisoner inter<lb></lb>fered, I asked him what business he bad to interfere, and put my hand against him, and he struck me in the face—I returned the blow—he asked his cousin for a knife, and after he got it he plunged it into my side—I fell to the ground senseless.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—on the evening of 9th December, Timothy Regan was brought in with a punctured wound in the middle of his left cheek, half an inch long, and going down into the lining membrane of the mouth—there was a wound 2 1/2 in on his left side by the hip bone, deeper behind than in front, which appeared as if inflicted from behind, or from left to right, and there was a slight second wound on the inner part of his left arm—they could be inflicted by a knife—the wound in the side was of a serious character.</p>

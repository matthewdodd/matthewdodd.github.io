                  </hi>. I am in the service of John Bennett Lawes, a manufacturer of manure, at Deptford. The prisoner Gill was in his service for a short time in last Oct.—on Monday, 29th March, a little before 6 o'clock in the morning, I went to the factory, and missed about three and a half cwt. of bones, which were safe when I shut up the factory, about twenty minutes past four, on the Saturday—I sent for a constable; White came—we went in search of the bones, and found a bag of bones at Dandridge's, who is a marine store dealer—I identify them as the same we lost—they had been through a process, and there were none others like them in Deptford—they came from America and other foreign parts—they are worth 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we looked over the premises and found three bags more, which make about the quantity we lost—these bags are like my master's—they have marks, but no particular ones on them.</p>

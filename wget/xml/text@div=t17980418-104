               <p>Q. How does the cellar communicate with the house? - A. From the front of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you get into the house by means of the cellar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How was it forced open? - A.There ws a large bar, and the padlock forced from the bar, and then by pushing the bar on the one side, any person could go down into the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you put the proprty that you lost over night? - A. All within-side of my desk in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180101"></xptr>shop; part of the guineas were in a bowl, part of them in a paper, and part of them in a bag; the shillings were part in a bag, and part in a bowl; the notes were part in a bowl, and part in a bag; those of them that were in the bowl were inclosed in a paper; there was wrote upon one paper the name of Reynolds; there were Bank-notes and cash in that paper, and there was a draft for 311l. 17s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner the next morning? - A. Yes; and saw him at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the desk broke open? - A. Yes, I had the key; the first time I saw the prisoner, was about half past four, in custody of Metcalf, at the watch-house, and there I saw my property upon the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same property that you had secured the night before in your desk? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner? - A. No; I never saw him, that I recollect, till the 5th of April. I am not sure, in the hurry, whether the accompting-house door was broke open or not, but the accompting-house window was thrown up, and I suppose he made his escape that way.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he make his escape to? - A. He was pursued by the watchman and patrol, and was taken as he was going up Holborn hill.</p>

             sworn. - I am a patrol of St. Sepulchre's: On the 5th of April, in the morning, about a quarter after five, going past the prosecutor's house, I saw the prisoner at the bar stooping at the cellar window of Mr. Clarke's house, I heard the cellar window shut to, I crossed the way and put my hand against the shutter, and found it was open; I kept my eye upon him, and called to a watchman to spring his rattle, which he did. At the end of the King's-arms gateway, he threw down a coarse apron, containing papers of halfpence and penny pieces, one paper contained five guineas worth, I believe; I pursued, and was stopped by the watchman, and when I was stopped, he crossed over directly from Field-lane towards Shoe-lane, and there he was stopped by the St. Andrew's inspector, Howard, and there I lost sight of him in turning the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - A. Yes. Then I went to let Mr. Clarke know, and he went with me to the watch-house.</p>

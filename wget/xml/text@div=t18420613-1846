On the morn<lb></lb>ing of the 27th of May I was at Ratcliff-cross Dock—the prisoners and another lad came along the shore at Mr. Wright's wharf—Gilbert went to a barge of coals lying alongside Mr. Wright's wharf—he climbed up the gunwale of the barge, and threw four large lumps of coals down on the shore, then went away, and in two or three-minutes Craven climbed on the same barge, laid with his belly athwart the gunwale, and threw several lumps of coals off the barge—the other boy picked them up, and broke them up under the barge; then Craven held the bag open while the little boy who made his escape put them into the bag—Gilbert was gone away with the coals he had got first—I called to the little boy with them on his back—he walked away between the craft towards the shore—Craven went towards the craft—I ran down and apprehended him coming on shore—he had no coals then—I asked what he had done with the coals I saw him take from the barge—he said he had taken none—I took Craven up to the office, and had not had him there many minutes before Gilbert came to see how Craven got on—I apprehended him, and asked what he had done with the coals he had taken from the barge at Mr. Wright's—he said he had not been on the shore—the other boy has not been found—I pointed out the barge the coals were taken from to Mr. Wright.</p>

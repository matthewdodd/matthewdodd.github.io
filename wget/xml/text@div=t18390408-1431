                  </hi>. I am a shipwright, and live at Deptford. On Sun<lb></lb>day morning, the 17th of March, I was at the Crown and Mason's Arms, Woolwich, having a glass of rum and milk—the prisoner was there—he was a stranger to me—I asked him to drink with me—he said he did not like rum and milk, he would sooner have beer—I called for a pot of beer, and he drank with me—we then went to the Crown and Cushion—I got some steaks, as he said he was hungry, and he partook of them—there was another man with him—we walked up the town, and came back to the house we had first been to, I think and had a pot of beer or half-and-half there—the other man did not go there with us-every thing was had at my expense—I had come over to Woolwich to see a friend-while at the public-house I had occasion to go backwards, and while in the act of looking at my money in the privy, the prisoner came in and snatched my purse out of money in the privy, the prisoner came in and snatched my ling, and three pence in copper—I said, "You are not going to rob me don't take my money"—he laughed at me, put his hand into the purse, took what he chose, returned me the purse with half-a-crown and one shilling, and went away—he had seen me with the money before I left the room—a woman came in, saying the constable was after him about some robbery, and to get out of the way—he turned out of the house-the constable came, and I gave him in charge—I we not at all tipsy—I did not give him the money to take care of—he asked me to lend him a shilling before I went into the yard, and I said I thought he had had quite sufficient without my lending him any money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Woolwich. On Sunday morn<lb></lb>ing, the 17th of March, the prosecutor came to me—I went with him to the Duke on Horseback, but the prisoner was not there—we went to the Marquis of Gran by, and there found him—I said, "Fowler, you are my prisoner"—he said, "Your prisoner, for what?"—I said, "I will tell you when we get to the door"—when we got to the door, I told him it was for robbing a man of some money—he denied it, and said, "Let go of me, Butterfill, don't <hi rend="italic">lug</hi> me through the streets in this sort of way"—I said, "Well, <hi rend="italic">Dick,</hi> if you will go quietly I will let you"—I let go of him, and he walked by my side twenty or thirty yards towards the cage—be then buttoned up hi coat, stepped back, and put himself into an attitude to fight—I had great difficulty in keeping his blows off—the prosecutor who was with me, came to my assistance, and the prisoner began sparring with him—we took him to the cage, searched him, and in his jacket pocket found two half-crowns, two penny-pieces, two halfpence, a knife, and a tobacco-box—be told me that Davidson had given him the purse and money to take care of, but seeing him so free in spending the money, he (Davidson) wished it back again—Davidson appeared to have been drinking, but knew what he was about.</p>

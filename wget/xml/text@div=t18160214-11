I lost some of my property on Friday the 12th of January. I first discovered that something was missing at about twenty minutes before eight in the evening. The first was, that I heard the door-bell ring; I then ran immediately to the door, and when I came I found the street door ready open; the shop door was also open; they are different doors. The private door opens into the passage, and the shop door is in the passage; the street door is always open, and I saw two persons cross the road, I observed that I had lost my property; the shop door was shut until they opened it. The shop door was a little open; I went to the street door and found it a little open, I had been in the shop a very few minutes before; it shuts by a lock, the same as the parlour. At that time I observed that the print was gone, and the gingham, and a piece of queen's stuff; they were missing from the shop. I took them down out of the window that evening, and put them on the end of the counter. When I came to the street door, I repeatedly hallooed stop thief, and in a few minutes after, I saw a young man run, but I did not know who he was. I stood on the steps a considerable time; a man brought back the piece of stuff. I saw neither of the prisoners that I know of.</p>

            . I am not an officer, I live at No. 12, West-street, Sommer's-town. I recollect this Friday-night, being near Mrs. Marshall's house, when I heard the cry of "stop thief!" as soon as I turned my head round, I saw two men run from the step of the door; I saw them on the step of the door coming out of the passage; that was after she cried "stop thief." They were in the house when she cried "stop thief." I am sure of that, for I saw them step out of the passage; they run down the chappel path. As soon as I gave the alarm, they threw the things away in the road; I gave an alarm; they were ten or twelve yards from me when I first saw them, not more, I only saw one throw something away; I did not stop to pick it up; I pursued them; I did not overtake either of them; I did not catch them. Mr. Teesdale stopped one; I was within ten or twelve yards from him when he stopped him. The one who was stopped, was the prisoner at the bar, because I knew him before, and he was the man who threw the things away, I am sure of that; I was near enough to see. I came up to Teesdale as soon as he had taken him. Teesdale<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181602140016"></xptr>carried him to the watch-house; I don't know who took the things up; but whilst I was gone they were taken up and taken away. The stuff was picked up in the road by me. I went back to the place and picked up the piece of stuff; I saw more pieces than one thrown away; I carried the piece of stuff to Mrs. Marshall; it was moon-light, about half past seven, or within a quarter of eight.</p>

               <p>- TEESDALE. I was in the neighbourhood of Mrs. Marshall's; I was in my own house. No.88, Ossulston-street, Sommer's-town. It was a little before eight o'clock; long after candles were lighted. I was called out of my house, hearing an alarm of"stop thief;" I ran to Chapel-Path, and I met three persons, the prisoner at the bar and two more; I stopped the prisoner at the bar, and the other two ran up Ossulston-street; I took him to the watchhouse. Some person came up and said he was the man; I don't know whether it was the last witness or not; I took him to the watch-house; I did not see any thing thrown away.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the bell of the door of the house, or of the shop - A. That is the shop-bell.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it fixed to the door of the shop - A. yes; and if the door be opened, the bell rings; when I came out of the house door, I came through the shop. I saw nobody in the shop; I came out of the shop door into the passage of the house; I first got sight of them when they were passing off my steps.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get sight of them on the steps - A. I don't hardly know, whether it was on the steps, or on the pavement; I immediately cried" stop thief;" I don't know that any body had come from the shop into the street for a quarter of an hour previous. I saw the last person who had been in the shop go out; I fastened the door after they went out; I am sure it was fastened; it fastened by a lock, the same as the parlour I look at this piece of stuff; it is about four yards; it is queen's stuff; it is worth about five or six shillings; the other two things which I lost, were gingham and print; there were twenty-five yards of print and eleven yards of gingham.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any particular mark on that queen's stuff - A. I have no mark, but I cut all off that is gone. I cut some off a day or two before; I am certain it is the piece which was in our shop. It is my husband's property.</p>

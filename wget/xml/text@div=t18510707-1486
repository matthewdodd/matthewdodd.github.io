                  </hi>. I am a wadding-maker, and live in New Norfolk-street, Shoreditch. The prisoner lives about twenty yards from where I live—on Whit Monday I was outside the door of his house about 8 o'clock in the evening—I kicked at the door, and his wife and three more females came to the door—I went away, and returned again in about ten minutes—I kicked at the door—the prisoner came out, and struck me on the head with some weapon, which I believe was about two feet long; it was very bright—he struck me first a blow on the forehead, which went through the skin; he then struck me on the head—after I received the second blow, I made a rush at him, and we had a struggle it appears—I was dragged into the house, and he and his wife, and a tall man, were using me shamefully inside—I would not say in the dark who stabbed me, but somebody stabbed me; a point of some<lb></lb>thing went through my skin, on the right-side—it was quite red, and the skin cut through—I could not see any blood flow, because it was 5 the next morning before I came to my recollection—I believe my shirt was cut through—when I was taken out I do not remember any more—I do not know how I got out—I was drunk that night—I was taken to the hospital—I cannot say how long I was there—I kept my bed two days—I was an out-patient for a week.</p>

               <p>Whit-Monday I was in my house in the evening, and looking out of my window I saw Harding at the prisoner's door—the prisoner came out and lifted a sword, and struck him on the front of the forehead, and I saw blood flow—the sword fell out of the prisoner's hand, and he lifted up his hand, and made a second blow at his head; he put his head on one side; it escaped the head, and came on the shoulder; I then saw him lift the sword; I cannot tell where it fell, but I saw blood flow from the back of his head—the prisoner went to his door, Harding went to make a rush at him, and the prisoner seized him by the breast, and pulled him into the house—Harding was drunk.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was Harding doing anything at the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He gave the door a kick, and it went in, and the prisoner was standing in the passage—I heard Harding say, "I want to know why my wife was called a w—, and why my servant was struck with the baby in her arms?"—I did not hear anything about kicking the b—guts out, and giving the b—to the dogs—after Harding was taken into the house, four or five persons went in.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 166.) Harding came to me on that Monday night, about 8 o'clock—he was in a gore of blood—I went to the prisoner's house, and took him into custody—I told him he was charged with stabbing him, from what I could get from the bystanders, I could get no direct answer from the prosecutor—the answer the prisoner made was, "Then a man must not defend himself?"—I saw Harding next morning—he was com<lb></lb>plaining much of the stab near the heart, which he said he did not find out the night before—this is his shirt—I found a hole in it corresponding with the place that he described.</p>

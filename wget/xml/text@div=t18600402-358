On 8th March I was on at the Mansion-house—on the previous day I had apprehended the prisoner for picking a gentleman's pocket in Threadneedle-street—on 8th March he was standing in the dock, and after the sentence of three months had been passed on him by Sir Robert Carden, I was taking him down the staircase—he went down first, and as I was in a stooping position he turned round and struck me on the right temple with one of his fists—I became insensibly for a moment or two, and then I halloed out, and he raised his foot and kicked me in the lower part of my body—I called for assistance, and I was conveyed to St. Bartholomew's Hospital in a cab—I was discharged on my own request on Sunday, 11th March—I now keep my bed, only I am attending here today—I was in perfect health up to the time of my receiving that injury—I went on the Tuesday following to the Mansion-house, but was unabfo to remain there—I had a fit, and was taken to the hospital, and remained there fourteen days—I suffer great pain—my body appears to be doubling up at times, and my head is wandering—I had not given the prisoner the slightest provocation.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—on 8th March the prosecutor was brought there—I attended to him—he was in a very weak state, and pointed to his right temple, and to his abdomen there were no marks on the temple, but on the abdomen were one or two marks and bruises which might have been produced by kicks; decidedly—the symptoms which were afterwards developed in the head were such, no doubt, as would have been produced by a blow—he was in the hospital from* the 8th till the 11th—he was then discharged at his own request, and on the 13th he was brought back in a state of insensibility, and remained till the 27th—the sufferings he complained of were the results of this violence—he is still in a very weak state.</p>

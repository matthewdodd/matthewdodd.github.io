                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife; we were married about sixteen months ago. I have one child—the prisoner is a carpenter—we lived at No. 6 1/2, Twigg-folly, Bethnal-green—he left me about a fortnight previous to Jan. 4, and I did not know where he was—on Thursday nighty 4th Jan., I went to the Standard Theatre, with Matilda Curnell; and on our way home we called at the King John public house, in Holywell-lane—I saw the prisoner there, standing at the bar—I did not speak to him, or he to me—after taking some ale, I left with my friend; and when I had got about twenty yards, I heard steps behind me—I was suckling my child—I turned round, and saw my husband running after me—I tried to get away from him—he overtook me, and said, "You b—cow! I will do for you now"—I felt my left arm very hot, put my hand to my arm, and found my hand full of blood—I saw the blade of a knife in the prisoner's right hand—he ran away across the road—I became very faint, and my baby fell down on the ground—I screamed out, and a policeman came—I never saw a knife like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in my husband's possession before.</p>

               <p>nor were we dancing at the Neat's Tongue public house—I was going towards the Curtain-road to turn round into Shoreditch to go home—there was not a man with me—you have stabbed me twice before—I can prove one time by the London Hospital, the other time I took no notice of—I have been living with my father and mother, No. 61/2, Sidney-street, but not for long—I have sold some of the things from your house—I did it to support myself and my baby—the reason I have been knocked about is because I would not go prostituting or thieving for you—you were at costermongering for a little while just before you left me; it was through my persuasion—you did not tell me you would go away from me if I persisted in shoplifting—it was because I would not go to prostitution for you with my baby, and because I would not go out thieving for you.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at No. 5, Spencer-street, Shoreditch. I was with the last witness at the Standard theatre—we afterwards went to the King John public house, and saw the prisoner there—we left, and had got about twenty yards, when Mrs. Martin turned round, and then ran on the other side of the way to get out of the way of the prisoner, who was running after her—he said, "You b——y cow!"and made a strike at her with his right hand, but I did not see anything in it—she screamed out "Murder!" and "Police!"—I screamed out also, and the prisoner ran across the road, and was afterwards brought back by a policeman—the child fell, and I picked it up—the prisoner said, "<hi rend="italic">Carry</hi>, did I do it?"—she said, "Yes; you are my husband; you did it."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

I was on duty in Chapel-street, about a quarter to 1 o'clock, and heard a cry of "Murder!"—I went to the corner of Holywell-lane, and saw Mrs. Martin supported by the last witness, and bleeding from the left arm—in consequence of what she said I ran across the road after the prisoner—I saw him move his left hand as though he threw something away—I took him to where the females were—he said to his wife, "Was it me, <hi rend="italic">Carry</hi>, that did it?"—she said, "Yes"—I sprang my rattle for assistance, and took him to the station—I afterwards went to the spot where I had seen him move his hand, and found this knife, closed as it is now—here is a stain of blood on the small blade—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a piece of the prosecutrix's frock—here is a cut through it, and it is all over blood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of No. 63, Bunhill<lb></lb>row. The prosecutrix was brought to my surgery on the morning of the 5th, her wound having been dressed at the station house—I took the dressings off, and found a punctured wound in the back part of the upper arm, two inches deep—the arm was highly inflamed—the large blade of this knife might have produced the wound; it was a dangerous wound—all punctured wounds are of a most serious description—she has been very bad, and has been since under my care.</p>

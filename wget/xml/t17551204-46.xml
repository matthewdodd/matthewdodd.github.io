               <p>Edwards. We missed a dark cotton gown, a petticoat, 4 silk handkerchiefs, a silk capuchin, a cardinal made of scarlet cloth, one loose gown, two white aprons, and a pair of silver tea tongs; they were the property of Mr. Hammond, and left in my care.

            . Mrs. Hammond lodged at my house. The prisoner was my servant. Mrs. Hammond missed the goods mention'd, and the prisoner absconded from her service. I went up and down to see if I could find her. She was found on the Tuesday, and had the gown on at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it on her?</p>
               <p>Nugent. I did. We have got most of the goods again. She came up to town to look for her husband, and was in great distress. She heard he was in town, and I believe she took the things through vanity, with intent to appear before him, and to return them again.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether she had seen her husband ?</p>
               <p>Nugent. I don't know that she had.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods have you got again?</p>
               <p>Nugent. All but the capuchin and tea tongs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say what she had done with them?</p>
               <p>Nugent. She said she had pledg'd them somewhere in Tyburn-road, but could not tell the place; there were two of the handkerchiefs missing, but she said she did not take but two. She cry'd bitterly when she saw me, and beg'd my pardon. She behaved herself very well with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I did intend to bring these things, back again. I had not seen my husband till last Friday, which was the first time I saw him since I came to London. I met him accidentally in the street, the day I went away; and I went to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am agent to the St. Pancras and Highgate branch of the Charity Organisation Society, 120, Highgate Road—Staines applied to them for assistance in April, and it was decided to grant him a loan of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the security of Adams, a shoemaker, of 152, Alcroft Road—the terms were 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for 20 weeks, and the other 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be given him—Staines came on 6th May, between 11 and 12 o'clock, and said that Mr. Adams was coming—he waited, and went away and returned—in the mean-time the real Mr. Adams came with a Mr. Emmett, and made a communi<lb></lb>cation to me, in consequence of which I communicated with the police—Staines came again about 6 o'clock with Mallard, and said, "This is Mr. Adams"—I asked Mallard if his name was Adams—he said, "Yes"—I asked him where he lived and he gave me this card, "A. Adams, practical boot and shoe maker,. 152, Alcroft Road"—I asked him if he was a householder—he said that he had held the house for two years, and paid 35/. a year for it—I asked his Christian name—he said, "John"—I asked him to sign this paper and he did so.

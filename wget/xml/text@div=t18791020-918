                  </hi>. I am manager to James Cope, who trades as Hopkinson and Cope, Camberwell—the prisoner has been their traveller for about two years—up to 9th August he was ordinarily paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and when on his journeys 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week as an extra allowance as his travelling expenses—his duties were to travel, obtain orders, send an account on Fridays, and remit all moneys collected during the week—on 5th April this year we had a conversation with him respecting the business done, and he agreed to accept a salary of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week covering everything—that arrangement was embodied in this letter of his, 9th May, and he started again on his journeys and continued in the service till 9th August, on which day, from matters which came to my notice, I gave him notice to discontinue collecting or representing the firm in any way—I received this account from him on 26th June—it purports to be a statement of cash received by him during that week—4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Sum field does not appear in it, nor 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by Mr. Gibbs—it was his duty to forward those sums to me, especially cheques—I remember telling him on 5th July that it was time that Gibbs's account should be paid, and saying that I would write to Mr. Gibbs—he said "Well, you can write if you like, but I shall be there in a few days, and I will see him about it"—those two sums have never been paid to me.</p>

I have asked at least six times about it," but we considered then that you were discharged, and there was no necessity then to reply—there has not been a difficulty on each occasion that you have started, in getting money to start with—the cheque sent to you at Sitting<lb></lb>bourne carried it up to 9th August, when you were discharged—this is not</p>

That cheque could not have been at Sittmgbourne, for they searched twice, and the answer was "No letter here for you" I was kept short of 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for three weeks, and I wrote "I have only received one cheque from you for four weeks." The proof of this you will find in the cash-book.—I have been frequently left 150 miles from home without money to get on with. The agreement has never been signed or stamped, and therefore I am only bound by the original agreement With respect to my owing 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I utterly deny it.

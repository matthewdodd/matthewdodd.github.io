            . I am servant to Mr. Jones, a coal merchant, of Princes-street, Westminster. On Wednesday the 22d of January, about eight o'clock in the morning, my master sent me to Turner's yard - I saw two sawyers at work; the prisoner was not one of them. I told them I wanted ten deals; they directed me to the Ship, public-house, where I found the prisoner - I asked if he worked at Mr. Turner's, he said, Yes; I said I wanted ten deals - he came out, and fetched them off the pile in the yard. I put them into the cart, and gave him a sovereign, and drove them home.</p>

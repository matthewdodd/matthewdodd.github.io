On Friday evening, the 9th of February, I was on duty in the Lower-road, Deptford, between seven and eight o'clock—I saw the prisoner come along with another person—I heard the prisoner say he had been at work on the rail-road that day; and they had given him that for his day's work—that was a large piece of lead which he was carrying—I followed him nearly half a mile (he was in Rotherhithe when I began to follow him)—he then threw down this piece of lead and ran away—I followed him, and took him without losing sight of him—this is the lead—it weights 64lbs.</p>

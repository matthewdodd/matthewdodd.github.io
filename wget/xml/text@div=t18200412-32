            . I live at Purden; in Essex; I was in company with Mr. Coates. A boy came behind, and said his pocket had been picked, and the thieves had crossed the street. I joined in pursuit, and saw a man, who said two of them were gone one way, and one another. I saw the prisoner and a boy running up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120015"></xptr>Swan-yard, and Mr. Coates called out Stop thief! I found the prisoner in custody of Webb, and saw my handkerchief picked up in the direction he had run.</p>

I was at tea in my house in Clare-court, heard the cry of Stop thief! ran to the door, and saw Mr. Smith following the prisoner, who was coming from Drury-lane towards Blackmore-street; just as he turned into Blackmore-street I saw him throw the handkerchief down, and secured him about fifteen yards off. A woman picked it up and gave it to me.</p>

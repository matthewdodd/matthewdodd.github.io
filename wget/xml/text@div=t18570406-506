                  </hi>. I am a currier, and live at No. 9, Queen's Terrace, Brompton. On Tuesday night, 3rd March, I left Ryder's Hotel, Salisbury Square, about twenty minutes before 12 o'clock, and was waiting for an omnibus in Fleet Street—the prisoners accosted me, and pressed closely against me; I kept on walking leisurely, and crossed the road to the Temple Bar Hotel; they pressed in with me, and stood in front of the bar; I called for a glass of brandy, and they said, "Will you stand treat?"—I threw down 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the bar, and they had brandy for it—while drinking my brandy they pressed very closely to me, and soon afterwards I missed some money; I could tell from the weight of my pocket—I put my hand in my pocket and said, "I have been robbed"—Mitchell said, "Oh, no; you must be mistaken"—she <hi rend="italic">sidled</hi> out of the bar, and ran down the steps—I followed her, caught her, took hold of her, and said that she or her companion had picked my pocket, but if she gave the money back I would not prosecute; she gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, "This is not half what I have lost, and I shall detain you until I get back my money"—she then pretended to faint, and I said, "I shall not let you go"—she said, "If you give me in custody you will be <hi rend="italic">dropped upon</hi> for it"—Burn came out at that time, called her a fool for giving me the money back, and ran down the passage—a policeman came, and I gave Mitchell in custody—going to the station she said, "I have not got your money"—when I went into the house I had over 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in half crowns, shillings, and sixpences; I had 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. left, including the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. she gave me back—my money was loose in my trowsers pocket.</p>

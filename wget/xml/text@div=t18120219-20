On Wednesday evening Mr. Keafe brought a paint pot and brush with priming in it to my shop and wished to leave it in my shed till the next morning; the next morning, Thursday, I went and saw the boat again; the name was painted out with the lead colour; I saw afterwards three people working upon her.</p>

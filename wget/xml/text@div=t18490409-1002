                  </hi>. I have been for several years in New Zealand, and came home as a seaman on board the ship <hi rend="italic">Indian</hi>, of which the prisoner was chief mate—I joined her at Auckland; we sailed from there on 15th Oct—there was a Jew lad named Solomon Abrams employed on board the vessel in feeding the stock, which consisted of sheep, cows, goats, turkeys, fowls, and pigs—he continued to perform his duty till about 24th Nov., when he was not capable of doing so by weakness and illness—the vessel was then to the west of Cape Horn—I saw Abrams flogged the first time about a fortnight after we left Auckland—it was by the prisoner's orders, because he was dirty in the coalhole—he was flogged on the bare breach with a cat-o'-nine tails made of nine pieces of marline—he was lashed by his hands to the windlass, and had a dozen lashes—the first flogging did lot fetch the blood—he was flogged again about two days afterwards by the prisoner's order—that flogging drew the blood—he was about fifteen years old—he was in very good health when we left Auckland—I knew him on shore—I believe he was flogged the second time for the same reason as at first—the prisoner always flogged him himself—he had a dozen lashes on the second occasion—I do not know how often he was flogged afterwards—it night have been nearly every morning while we were on deck—I was in the chief mate's watch—I never knew him get more than two dozen—that continued until he took to his bed, about eight days before he died—he had no bed except what he brought on board—he slept in the galley, where the live stock were—I should not think he could keep himself clean there—the live stock caused more dirt than he could attend to—in the whole he wat flogged from eighteen to twenty times—I think he died between 1st and 5th Dec.—I never saw any one flog him but the prisoner—I saw the second mate strike him once—I have seen the prisoner strike him with the rope's-end—sometimes he was flogged at the windlass, sometimes over a bundle of hay, sometimes over the spars or over the guns; any place that was handy—his trowsers were always off, and he was stripped to his bare body when he was flogged—his hair was cut, by the chief mate's orders, close to his head—they said he had vermin in his hair, but I did not see any—I should think the vermin of the stock would have crawled to him where he slept—I saw him placed in a tub of cold water—we were then about 55 south latitude, and the weather was very cold—I should think there was about two feet six inches or three feet of water in the tub—the prisoner ordered him into the tub—he did not like to get in at first, and then the prisoner gave him a shove, and he ultimately went in—he had nothing but his shirt on then—as far as I can judge he was in the tub about an hour and a half—he was placed there to wash himself—he was not to say very filthy—he was dirty by knocking about the stock without shoes or stockings on—there was the manure of the animals on him—the prisoner used to come forward while he was in the tub and see if he was washing—he was washing his clothes—he was in a very weak state of health at that time—I did not see that his skin was broken—there was a very heavy fall of snow in the night, and in some parts of the poop it might have been six inches deep, and in some four—the boy shi<lb></lb>vered all the time he was in the water—after he had been flogged several</p>

               <p>times he got full of sores, the same as any person flogged would—the sores never got well before he was flogged again, and that drew his bottom into a scab—I have often seen the blood come—the last flogging I saw him have was about eight days before he died—he got quite thin and weak—I first ob<lb></lb>served that about a fortnight before he died—I saw him flogged about three times after that—he slept on one side of the galley, the turkeys were on the other, right opposite him, and the sheep were under him—he could not help being dirty—there were no pigs in the galley; some were in the long-boat and some in the sty, which was between the long-boat and the galley, about two yards from where he slept—he had to clean the galley out every now and then to get the dung out—he had to tread in it when he got out of bed—the cook's galley was on deck exposed to the weather; if a heavy sea came over it must come into the galley—I never did see the sea come over—he slept in a place with a wooden covering and a partition from where the turkeys were—he slept on two boards put on the side, till he got a piece of plank put to keep him from falling out of bed—it was hard weather and cold while he slept there—that in my judgment was not a fit place for him or anybody to sleep in; I should not like to have slept there myself—I remember seeing him taken out one night, four or five days before he died, and placed on the fore-hatch—he was all over sores then, and was not sensible—I did not see any flogging after that—I went to see him after he took to his bed; I was not able to make him understand me—he often complained to me of his treatment before he took to his bed—he complained that he did not get his rations—the pri<lb></lb>soner always behaved well to me—there was no surgeon or medical person on board—about three weeks before he died his bowels began to get loose, and they continued so till he died—he was often flogged for his bowels being loose—he slept in different places—he was a very good-looking, smart boy when he came on board; tall and thin for his age—after he was dead I observed a lump in his neck, about the size of an egg; I never saw it before—I never saw the captain present when he was flogged—there were about sixteen men on board the vessel.</p>

               <p>was a passenger on board the <hi rend="italic">Sir John Franklin</hi> named Beattie—I have been in the navy, and left thirteen or fourteen years ago, because I thought I could do better—I did not get into any scrape there—I was never flogged—I have never been tried for anything—the last flogging Abrams received was eight or ten days before he died, and between that and the first flogging he had been flogged eighteen or twenty times—that might have been during a period of five weeks—that was before we rounded the Cape—he did not die till after we had passed the Falkland Islands—I swear I never saw the captain present when he was flogged, or heard him give any order for him to be flogged—the captain was very seldom on deck so early as four or six o'clock in the morning—it was generally then that the boy was flogged—they used to say that the boy was dirty, but I never saw it—I never heard the crew complain of it—the crew did not go up to the captain in a body and complain of his dirt, or I should have heard of it—when I saw his body I saw a few sores on his feet—they were scrubbed with sand, at the chief mate's orders, by the boy Herbert Taylor, an apprentice on board—they were small dry sores, just by the ankle, as if the skin had been knocked off, and they were healing—there were four or five of them, and I believe they were on both legs—I did not bear that he had got the venereal disease in the country—I have heard it talked about since the trial came on—I never heard of it on board—he never said anything about it, or said he was ill—if he had had the disease I think he would have come to me, knowing I had been so long in the country, and could judge of it—he never did come to me—there is a disease of that kind out there—Herbert Taylor had to rub his feet with a piece of canvass and sand, because his feet looked rather dirty—the first flogging was about a fort<lb></lb>night after we left Auckland, the next might be two days afterwards, and after that there was a flogging pretty nearly every other day—it generally took place between four and six, which was the chief mate's watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 2, Queen's-court, Albert-street, Deptford. I was a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Indian</hi>, and recollect Abrams coming on board at Auckland to feed the stock; he was then in a good slate of health to all appearance—there was a seaman, named Williams, on board, he com<lb></lb>plained to the prisoner that Abrams had vermin about his neck, and the prisoner ordered his hair to be cut—he made a mess on a sail, and the pri<lb></lb>soner said he should not sleep in the lower forecastle any more, and he went down again and made a mess in the coalhole, and the prisoner flogged him for it; that was about three weeks after he came on board, and I believe it was the first time he was flogged—after that he was kept on the forecastle, and we were forbidden to go near him, because he had got vermin—his dress consisted of a cotton shirt and a pair of duck-trowsers—it was not very cold weather then, but we were getting into cold weather—he was kept there when his hair was cut, from about eleven o'clock in the morning till three or four in the afternoon—he was not subject to that treatment every day, only on that particular day—we went below about twelve the next morning and saw a mess on a sail, and he said he could not get the hatch off; the hatch was put over, but it was easy enough for any one to lift it off if he had placed his head against it; I have done it myself easily—he was in the habit of sleep<lb></lb>ing in the forecastle till the day his hair was cut; he was then put down in the lower forecastle—he used to sleep in the top-gallant forecastle; there were not enough berths for the hands on board; he never had a berth assigned him with the rest of the seamen—he used to sleep on the chest, and every time the door was opened, he was exposed to the wind and weather—we had some very severe weather when we got off Cape Horn, and it was very cold</p>

               <p>there; we had very heavy seas—he then slept in the galley—the coppers had been taken out of the galley, and put-under the top-gallant forecastle—the galley was worse than the forecastle to sleep in; it was more exposed to the weather—he was placed there by the captain's orders—there was a top to it and sides; one door was nailed up, and the other left open—he could not get out away from the dirt—it was not nearly so comfortable as the fore<lb></lb>castle—he had no hammock; he had a bed place, and two or three blankets—I know he had blankets, because I threw them overboard after he died, with his clothes—the mate gave me orders to do so, as they were in such a dirty state—I was in the mate's watch between four and six o'clock in the morning, that was when I saw Abrams flogged—I cannot say how often he was flogged; it might be more than a dozen times, or it might be less—I should not like to say he had not been flogged twenty times—I recollect his first flogging, that was for making a mess in the coalhole, about three weeks after he came on board—I do not recollect how many lashes he got then—I cannot tell how many days after that it was that he was flogged again; I think it was the next day; sometimes he used to get flogged every morning regularly—I suppose he was flogged eight, nine, or twelve times—his trowsers were pulled down, and he was flogged on the bottom, with a marline similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he was flogged for being dirty—it is my belief that he was frightened to come out on deck in the night-time—I never knew him dirty himself in the day-time; he said he could not help it—there was stock on board, which was placed where he slept—I remember his being told to go and scrub his clothes in a tub—I was not there at the time—I cannot say whether he was put into the tub or not—he came to me to lend him my brush; I lent it him, and he was left there to scrub his clothes—I saw him scrubbing his clothes, but I did not see him in the tub—he was all wet at the time; it was cold weather—after he died, I saw two large black or blue lumps on each side of his throat—I remember his being flogged for stealing two bullocks' or calves' tongues, from the galley—he had his rations served out like the rest of the crew, by Mr. Senior, the steward—he got them regularly if he was there; if not, people that were hungry eat them themselves—his share was always cut, and if he left it, anybody ate it who could get hold of it—the crew are not all on deck when the rations are served out; one man is generally sent aft to see them weighed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184904090156"></xptr>
               <p>was never flogged—there might hare been five or six pieces of marline to the thing he was flogged with, and he was struck ten or twelve times—I saw the blood come—I cannot say when that was, but it was after two or three times—the tub was what we called the wash-tub, we all washed our clothes in it, and our faces and hands when we got up—we did not all get into it.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am a surgeon at 3, Mount-place, London Hospital—I was surgeon on board Her Majesty's ship <hi rend="italic">Diligence</hi>—I have seen the effects of flogging on the human system; diarrhoea and looseness of the bowels is one of the symptoms following upon it; if flogging is repeated from day to day fever is produced, and delirium gene<lb></lb>rally attends fever—I have heard the evidence, and am of opinion that the treatment the boy was said to have received and the flogging were sufficient to undermine his health, and cause death—I see no other cause; the repetition of these floggings would weaken the stomach, and produce a shock to the system.</p>

                  </hi>. I was an apprentice on board the <hi rend="italic">Indian</hi>—I remember Abrams coming on board at Auckland, and the first night when he came on board I noticed that he had sore ancles—he was turned out of the forecastle by the men because he was <hi rend="italic">lousy</hi>, and he went to the cook's galley, where the carpenter put up a bunk for him; he only slept there one night. About ten days or a fortnight after he came on board, I noticed that he used to dirty himself—his clothes were dirty—he looked healthy when he came on board—I have seen him dirty many times, and Mr. Leith has ordered him to put clean clothes on; he would take them off again as soon as Mr. Leith was gone—I only saw him whipped once, that was about eight o'clock in the morning, with a piece of marline, across the bottom—if he had been whipped twenty times I should have seen it—I was in the mate's watch—I have been whipped with a rope's-end, but not in the same way—he was whipped with some marline—I was always in Mr. Leith's watch, but was not always on deck—I have heard the men say, when I have come on deck, "Abrams has been whipped again"—I heard of his being flogged three times—I saw him in the tub once, washing: Mr. Leith told him to get in, and he went in—that was when his hair was cut—his head was one mass of vermin, and Mr. Leith put some ointment to it—he was in the tub about a quarter of an hour, and then came out and washed his clothes—it was then comparatively</p>

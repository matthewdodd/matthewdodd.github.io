On Sunday, the 11th of December, I saw the prisoner with two other women in Poland-street; I went into Oxford-street, and returned again - I then saw the prisoner leaving the door of the shop where Tant is servant; the other women were not there then - I spoke to Tant and Dent, and saw the shilling; I then followed the prisoner as far as Edward-street, where, by a signal, she was joined by the other two women - I am sure they were the same persons whom she was with before; some conversation took place, and I heard the words, "Is it all right," addressed by one of them to the prisoner - the prisoner answered, but I did not know what she said - I followed them down Compton-street, where I met a person, and requested his assistance to follow them; they then went on to the corner of Monmouth-street, where they stood for nearly a quarter of an hour - I then withdrew out of sight for a minute or two, and saw them turn down Monmouth-street, and from what was communicated to me by the person I had sent forward, I watched the door of Mr. Pinder; I saw the prisoner come out, and went over and took her into custody - I met Mr. Pinder coming out of his shop, to look after her; I took her into his shop, and received this shilling, which Mr. Pinder marked first - I found on the prisoner two penny-pieces, one halfpenny, and some tobacco in her hand; I took her to St. Anne's watch-house - she unpinned her things, and put the pins into her mouth; I could find nothing on her, but she gave me three counterfeit shillings and a good sixpence from her month - Pinder saw the sixpence, and said it was the one he gave her in change; I said to the prisoner, "I thought you had swallowed them" - she said, "You have got two cases against me already, and I thought I might as well give you the rest;" I then returned to Tant, and got the shilling.</p>

               unlawfully having in their custody and possession, 1 counterfeit half-crown and 11 counterfeit shillings, with intent to utter the same
            </rs>, against the Statute.</p>
               <p>MESSRS. SCARLETT and ELLIS conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM REYNOLDS. I am a constable - I know the prisoners - on the 11th of December I was in company with Fryer, Ashton, Lloyd, and Hall - a little after ten o'clock in the morning we proceeded to a house in <placeName id="t18340102-94-crimeloc527">Grove-court, Moor-lane, City</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18340102-94-crimeloc527" type="placeName" value="Grove-court, Moor-lane, City"></interp>

                  <join result="offencePlace" targOrder="Y" targets="t18340102-94-off526 t18340102-94-crimeloc527"></join> - the outer door was fast - Fryer laid hold of it; I put my fingers to the bottom and forced it open - I ran up stairs and found the room-door fast on the first floor - I forced that open, and on the left hand side of the fireplace I saw the prisoners standing - the male prisoner was in his shirt-sleeves - they were in the act of moving their feet, breaking something under them, which turned out to be plaster-of-paris - I seized the male prisoner and held his arm, and Fryer entered the room - I shoved the female prisoner away; he took her and gave her to Lloyd, and I delivered the male prisoner to Fryer - they were then handcuffed and taken into custody - Hall came up; the male prisoner said, "Mr. Hall, do you know where we are now?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183401020050"></xptr>we are in the City" - [we had taken them about four months before out of the City, and Hall is not a City officer] - we searched, and on the mantel-piece of the fire-place found eleven counterfeit shillings - I brought them to the table to let the prisoners see them - they made no remark - Fryer found three half-crowns on the same mantel-piece, and on a little shelf, by the side of the fire-place, I found a band - there was nobody in the room but the two prisoners - I found a plaster-of-paris band on the mantel-piece; it is a paper band to hold plaster-of-paris - Warren said if he got over this, he would rather break stones for the parish than do it again.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH FRYER. - I accompanied William Reynolds - I have heard his evidence, and confirm it - on the mantel-piece I found three counterfeit half-crowns and a broken shilling - I saw Lloyd take up some pieces of a broken mould; on one piece there was the distinct mark of a letter S - the half-crowns and shillings laid open on the mantel-piece - I saw Ashton take a finished half-crown from the mantel-piece.</p>
               <p>ANDREW LLOYD - I am a police officer of Hatton Garden - I was with the other officers, and agree with their statement - I found in front of the fire-place some plaster-of-paris on the ground - I put my hand on it; it was quite hot and caked - I found a file on the hob with white metal in the teeth of it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BAKER ASHTON. I was with the officers on this occasion, and found a counterfeit half-crown at the corner of the mantel-shelf, and a piece of metal; and on the hob on the left hand side I found another little file which had white metal in the teeth of it - I looked into a cupboard and found a quantity of plaster-of-paris broken up, and more in a bag in lumps - I saw Lloyd pick up some pieces of mould - it was hot - the plaster-of-paris is in the state I found it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HALL. I was with the others, and followed Lloyd up - I went to the prisoners - the male prisoner said, "Do you know you are in the City?" - as we went along he said, if he got over this, he would break stones.</p>
               <p>JAMES WELLS. I am the landlord of the house - Chapman took the rooms of me on the 29th of October; they occupied them till they were taken up - Chapman paid the rent, and sometimes another person brought it.</p>
               <p>JOHN FIELD. I am an inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint - I have examined the plaster-of-paris in lumps; three of the pieces are what appear to me to have been a mould, for the purpose of casting half-crowns, made of plaster-of-paris - the first piece has one of the letters, and the impression of the obverse side, it is the letter"S" in the word "Georgius," and that letter has a peculiarity about it which induces me to believe the counterfeit half-crowns have been made by that - there is an indented mark in the lower part of it, and in the impression there is a dot corresponding - the other part is part of the impression of the obverse side - the shillings are all counterfeit, and all cast in white metal - the half-crowns also are counterfeit, and cast in the same mould - three of the half-crowns are in an unfinished state, as they came out of the mould, with the spray of the metal - this bag of plaster-of-paris is the same material as the mould - part of the plaster-of-paris has been set with water - when it is set it would be warm - these two files have both white metal in the teeth; they are used to remove the refuse of the metal - the white metal appears to be the same description of metal as the counterfeit coin - this band appears to have been used to confine the plaster while it was setting.</p>

               <p>Warren's Defence. I had just come from my father's - I had not been in the place for nearly two days - I went to this female's for my shirt - I asked her if it was washed - she said "Yes" - I had been at variance with her ever since I was last taken into custody, and never lived with her since, but had left her company altogether, further than she used to wash my things; and I had that moment come up - I did not see anything about - I know these men are wicked enough to act wrong towards people - Hall and Reynolds said in the coach, "We have got you now, and will have you, if it lies in our power."</p>
               <p>Chapman's Defence. I know nothing about the mould - I leave it to the mercy of the judge and jury.</p>

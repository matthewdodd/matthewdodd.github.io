                  </hi>. I live at No. 30, Eaton-place, in the parish of St. George's, Hanover-square. Charnell was my butler—on the night of the 4th April I went to bed about half past 12 o'clock—I went by accident into my study, got hold of a book, and sat there for half or three quarters of an hour—the house was perfectly quiet when I went to bed—I supposed that every body was in bed—my dressing room is in a situation that I can hear the least talking or noise (I do not make a practice of going to bed after the servants, I generally go at about 11 o'clock)—about 7 clock in the morning in consequence of something a female servant said to me, I went down and saw Charnell—I should have been up soon after 8 o'clock, in the ordinary course—Charnell met me on the stairs, and began in rather an extravagant way to ask that I would forgive him—there were two maid servants stand<lb></lb>ing there, and I told him to go into the drawing room and say what he had to say—he said, "I hope you will forgive me, I am sure you never will forgive me"—I said, "Just go into the room, and I will oome and speak to you"—I went in and shut the door, and he said that he had been called out at night soon after he got into bed, a relation came or had sent for him, that a cousin of his was dangerously ill, that he got up, went away at 12 o'clock, was absent two hours, and when he came back he found that the plate was taken—I said, "Why, I was up myself at 12"—he said that it might been twenty minutes or half past 12, that the husband of his cousin had come and called him up—I went and dressed, saw him afterwards, and asked if he had gone for the police—he said that he had not—he told me after<lb></lb>wards that his bed was put down, he sleeps in the pantry, and he told me that his watch was lying on the bed—the plate was kept in a very strong plate closet, built on purpose, fire proof, and opening out Of his pantry, and there are two strong chests to keep what is not used in, and which I believe are in Court (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is a fire proof door which opens out of this butler's pantry, where he sleeps, and the two chests are in the closet; in which to send the plate backwards and forwards—they are fitted up for each parti<lb></lb>cular article—the keys of the chests, as well as of the closet, were in the possession of the butler—I gave him the keys and the entire control of all the plate—I have no reason to believe that there were marks on the cheats before—the last time I saw them was when I sent them up from the country</p>

               <p>to the silversmith's, and they came from him to the prisoner, Charnell, in December—it was his duty to sleep in the room where the plate closet was—I dressed on the ground floor, and came out immediately, went to the police station, brought a policeman, and examined the place down stairs with him, and examined the locks—I think Charnell was present—he told me that he had locked the door of his pantry when he went out, and took the key with him—he spoke to me so often that I cannot exactly recollect the time—he said that he had locked up the key of the plate closet, a large key, and deposited it in a side press, a wooden fixture in the room, with a very weak lock, which had been <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> open, and the key taken out, and he found it in the plate closet—he also said that he had locked up the plate chests, and had taken those keys with him, that he found the door of the pantry broken open when he came home—I asked him if there was any appearance of anybody having been in the house—he said that there was not, and that he went out by the area door, and took the key of that door and the key of the area in his pocket—I said, "Then who can have taken the plate?"—he said, "That is what puzzles me, Sir"—I said, "Of course it was taken either by you or some of your friends"—that was before I knew that he had had any friends—he said, "None of my friends would do it"—afterwards, in my room, before the policeman, he told me the address of his cousin who had sent for him, and I told the policeman to take it down—I then said, "A cousin may be a near or a distant relation, and it is very strange to send for you"—I cross-examined him about the nature of the cousin's illness—he said, "She is the only relation I have," either "in the world," or "in Lon<lb></lb>don," I do not know which—I said, "How is she related?"—after a good deal of hesitation, he said, "She is the daughter of my mother by a former marriage"—I said, "Why, that is your sister"—he said no more, that seemed to embarrass him—he seemed surprised to hear that she proved to be his sister and not his cousin—Thurstell afterwards went away, and about two or three hours after he went away I was reading the paper in my study (it was about 11 o'clock), and Charnell came in and said, "Sir, I will not conceal the truth any longer; what I have told you is false; I went out last night with some friends"—I took down this note of what he said at the time (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he told me that he went out with some friends, and mentioned the names of Peshell and Martin, who lived at No. 7, Princes-street: that Martin had called in the morning about 11 o'clock, and told him that there was a ball that night at Willis's rooms, that he did not like to ask me to go out, but after a good deal of persuasion he consented to go after I had gone to bed; that Martin told him he would let Tillett know, and that he wrote to Tillett himself to meet them at the ball, and Martin put the letter into the post (I think he must have mentioned that Peshell was to go to the ball, as I have his name on the top of my paper)—he said that Tillett came unexpectedly to him about 10 o'clock, and Martin also; that they waited in the pantry together till I had gone to bed—he then locked up all his things, took the keys in his pocket, went out with Martin and Tillett, and met Peshell in the street, just outside; that they three took a cab at the end of the street and went to Willis's-rooms, but they were not open; they then went to Evans's, and heard a song or two, waited till it was getting late, then came home, and arrived about half-past 4 o'clock—I do not think he told me where he parted with the others, but he said that they all four were together at Evans's-rooms—he made no mention of the prisoner Sale to me—he said that they went out by the area door, and locked both the house door and the area door—I asked him how the hall door was found—he said that it was</p>

               <p>unbolted but the latch lode and the other lock were both sprung, as they would be if anybody had gone out—that was the state of things when he came back—he had not a latch key, I have one.</p>

On Saturday, 5th April, about half-past 7 o'clock, I was fetched to Mr. Fisher's—I examined the premises, but found no trace of any entry being effected at any part of the house—I examined the area gate, the door leading from the area into the house, and the front door, but there was not a single mark on either of them—I had the lock of the door leading from the area into the passage, taken off by a smith, but could discover nothing to show that it had been tried—in the butler's pantry I found a small plate chest which bore marks of having been forced—I have examined the larger chest carefully, but there are only very slight marks on it—I am of opinion that those marks were not made then, but that the chest was actually open—there are two locks on it, and both were in perfect order—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the keys; they were given to me by Charnell among other keys on a ring—the door of the plate closet was perfectly sound—it is a large iron door, about the size of one of the doors of this Court—it could not have been broken open without a sledge hammer—the proper key was in the door, and it locked it.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>). There were several marks on the pantry door, out not sufficient, in my opinion, to make an entry—the box of the lock had not been broken, and when I locked the door, I could not push it open—the box of the lock would make considerable noise in breaking it—few days after the robbery, I am not sure of the date, I called at No. 7, Princes-road, Pimlico, and saw Peshell, Martin, and Sale—I do not think I was in uniform, but they knew I was an officer—constable Fells, who had been there before introduced me as his inspector—Martin said that a friend of Peshell's, a person named Fisher, but whose real name turns out to be Holt, called on him on the Friday, and stated that there was to be a ball at William's-rooms, Brewer-street, Golden-square, that he, Martin, went to 30, Baton-place, and asked Charnell if he would go, and returned in the evening, saying to Peshell that Charnell would go, and had written to invite a friend to accompany him—that friend was not Sale, it was Tillett, a servant at Westbourne-terrace, Hyde-park—he said that later in the evening Sale called on them, and they asked him to accompany them to the ball, and they all went together to 30, Baton-place, at half past 10 o'clock, that Martin went into the house, and Sale and Peshell remained outside, but Gharnell came to the area gate and called then in; that they were very reluctant to go in, thinking it improper, but were overruled by Charnell who pressed them—they stated that before they got to the house they found that Tillett was there; that they waited a considerable time, that Charnell left the pantry frequently to see if Mr. Fisher had retired to bed; that they became very impatient, add at length Charnell said that it was all right, that Mr. Fisher had gone to bed, and they then left the house together by the area door and steps—Sale and Peshell added, that on leaving the house, they fancied that they heard a rustling of a dress, apparently on the stairs leading to the upper part or the house, and told Charnell that they thought it was not all right, and wished him not to leave home, but he replied, that there was nothing to fear, and he had frequently gone out without Mr. Fisher knowing anything about it; that they got into a cab at the comer of Eaton-place and Belgrave-street, and were driven to Brewer-street, Sale stating that he left them there, he having previously stated to the others that he could not go to the ball, as he was not properly dressed, and that his ball days were over, and he had no desire to go, but was driven there, it being part of his way home; that when they found the room closed they went to the other Willis's-rooms at St. James's, thinking that the ball might be there, found those rooms closed also, and then called at several public houses and coffee shops about the Haymarket—(Charnell mentioned Evans's, but I do not know whether the others did or not, that is in Covent-garden)—that Peshell left them in the Haymarket, they had some little dispute about taking some more refresh<lb></lb>ment, and Martin, Charnell, and Tillett walked together to we end of St. Jaraes's-street, where Tillett left, and Martin and Charnell came on their way home to the corner of Arabella-row, Pimlico) Martin going home, and</p>

PAREY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you saw these parties, did they give the elaborate account you have described in an unembrrassed manner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought so—the Monday after the robbery was, I believe, the first time I saw Sale—Fells saw them before me—I did not go by appointment, they did not expect me—Sale did not live there—the inter<lb></lb>view lasted half or three quarters of an hour—I saw them three or four times, still pursuing my inquiries to detect the perpetrators or the robbery—I took Sale on the evening of the 24th by the direction of Mr. Fisher, he insisted on it—I did not suggest to him that any of them should be taken, I merely stated the facts—it is my duty to take persons in custody, against whom there is a case—it is my duty to take a party who I consider criminal—I took Sale a fortnight afterwards, on the 24th, at his own lodging—I knew the address of all of them, and they knew that I was pursuing these inquiries—Sale is a butler out of place—Martin is a butler—Peshell is a foreigner; he told me that he expected a situation at the Lord Warden hotel at Dover, and gave me that address—I saw him again, and he told me that he had got it—I took Sale on the morning of the 25th April, about half past 12 o'clock—I also took Martin on the 25th at his lodging, about midnight—I waited for him to come home—Peshell was apprehended at the Lord Warden hotel—all that was done; by Mr. Fisher's instructions, he was determined that they should be taken in custody—I told Sale that I was sorry I was obliged to apprehend him—I searched their lodgings—I made certain inquiries of William Ault, a butler out of place, and mentioned the result to Mr. Fisher—these inquiries were made in consequence of the very minute information that Martin and these three parties gave me as to their movements on that evening—I know Brewer-street, Golden-square—I know a place called Willis's-rooms there, they are sometimes taken by one individual, who arranges for a ball to take place at intervals of several weeks—I know Evans's in Covent-garden.</p>

               <p>do you know bow he came to do that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe there was a commu<lb></lb>nication with Mr. Paynter, the Magistrate—I know that Mr. Paynter and Mr. Fisher had interviews, and the result was, that I took the parties into custody—I have seen Ault here to-day, he is not subpœnaed on the part of the prosecution—the keys of both these boxes were given to me by Charnell—he showed me the cupboard where the key of the closet was deposited—that was within the pantry—there were marks on the pantry door as if it had been attempted to be broken open, but had not been—I think it was opened with a key, the lock was in good condition.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

On the morning of 5th April, in consequence of information I received, I went to No. 39, Somens-street, Portman-square, about 9 o'clock, and found a person named Gilbert—he did not at that time give me any letter—on the same morning I took Charnell, and on the way from the station to the police court, between 11 and 12 o'clock, after the charge had been taken, he said, "What can we do?"—I said, "I really do not know, unless you can give us any assistance"—he said, "I left my master's house about half past 12 o'clock last night, in company with four other men; we took a cab and drove to Brewer-street, Golden-square; one of the men, who was a perfect stranger to me, left us there; we went to Willies-rooms and found them closed" (that is in Brewer-street, it is called Little Willis's;) "we then went to Willis's-rooms in King-street, St. James's, and finding them closed we went back to the Haymarket, when Peshell, who felt <hi rend="italic">tiffed</hi> at some little circumstance which happened, left us; we afterwards went to the corner of St. James's-street, when Tillett left us, and myself and Martin returned as far as Arabella-row, where Martin left me"—after he had been remanded that day, Saturday, 5th, I went again to Gilbert's, on the Monday morning, about 9 o'clock, and received from him this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on 2nd May I took Tillett in custody, and he stated the same as nearly as possible as Martin and Peshell had to the inspector—I asked him for the letter which Charnell had sent him to invite him to the ball, and he gave it to me—he said that he received it about tea time on Friday, 4th April.</p>

               <p>place, and told him that, during the night they were out the whole of Mr. Fisher's plate was stolen—he said that he was not aware of it, and was very sorry it had occurred—after he made the statement I left him, and went to him again a few days afterwards—I have not seen his master—on the second occasion I asked him for the letter which he had received from Charaell, and he at once produced it, enclosed in an envelope—I took it away—he did not show me a letter on the first occasion—three or four days after this second occasion I went to him again, and asked him how it was that the letter did not bear the proper date (I had found out that it appeared to be an envelope of an improper date)—he said that he supposed it was the envelope of another letter which he had received, and went and hunted for it, he answered all my questions fairly—I did not go with him to hunt for it—I might have done so—I have heard from his fellow servant that he has lived three years with his master, and bears the highest character for honesty, and has the entire care of the plate—he was taken into custody, I think, a fortnight after that—it was two or three weeks after the robbery—I found him at his master's house every time I went, except once, when he had gone out with his master.</p>

Pray let me rely on you to say you sent for me, and do you pass as my cousin; I will say you <hi rend="italic">was</hi> taken very dangerous ill, and sent for me about 11 or 12 o'clock, or between that and 12.

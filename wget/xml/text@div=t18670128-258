                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Gardner, of 7, Great Wild Street, Drury Lane—last month I was sitting with William Thomas Moore, my son-in-law, who keeps the Flying Dutchman, Wells Street, Camberwell—on the 17th of December the prisoners White and Green (<hi rend="italic">see next case</hi>) came in; Green called for a pot of half-and-half and gave me a bad sixpence, and then called for a second pot and paid with a good six<lb></lb>pence—the prisoner then called for a pot and gave me a shilling—I put it in the till, which I had previously emptied—there was nothing there but the two sixpences that Green had given me—Green's wife then came in for a pot of half-and-half to take home in a can—she was not going to pay for it—I said, "You must pay if you please"—she said, "I am well known to Mr. and Mrs. Moore"—I said, "That has nothing to do with me"—I asked Green if he had got any money—he said. "No," and the prisoner said, "Here, I will pay for it," giving me a bad florin, which I took to my daughter—I gave the prisoner the change, and he and Green left together—the woman may have left a minute before—I then went to the till, exa<lb></lb>mined the shilling, and found it was bad, and the other also—I afterwards gave them to a policeman—I knew where Green lived, and sent to hit house.</p>

I am servant at the Flying Dutchman—on 17th December the last witness gave me a message to go to Green's house, which is just opposite, up a little turning—I went there—he was at home—I asked him where Jones was—he said he had gone to see his sister, and would be back in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I went away, listened at the shutters—I heard Jones there, went in, and said, "My mistress wants you, for passing bad money"—he ran away, and I ran after him and brought him back—he knocked my master down, who gave him in charge—it was a little before five in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>—I saw Green and White come in together, about half-past five o'clock, on 17th December—White gave me a shilling for some ale—I showed it to my son, who found it was bad—I kept it in my hand, and told White he had tendered me a bad shilling—she said she had a good half-crown, which she would give me in the place of it—she did so, and I gave her the change—she tried to escape, but I sent my son after her, who brought her back—she said there was no cause to detain her, as she was a respectable servant—I detained Green in the bar—after the money was given to me I saw six shillings and a florin picked up—the shillings were close to where they had stood, and the florin behind the door—I saw the prisoner who picked them up, and gave them to my son—I gave White back the shilling—she afterwards handed it to me, and I pointed out to the policeman the marks which I had made on it—it was the same—my son gave it to the policeman.</p>

On Wednesday the 9th of June, about half-past eleven o'clock, I was in the back of my shop, and noticed the prisoner take a bundle of cigars from a box—I did not exactly see what he did with them—my impression was that he passed them to a person outside—I am sure I saw him take them—I charged him with it—he denied it, and said I might search him—I missed a bundle of cigars—I had six bundles in a box in my window—they had passed through my hands half-an-hour before—I afterwards saw three cigars, which appeared to be the same as mine.</p>

On the 9th of June, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, I met a young man in a fustian jacket, running down Paradise-row with a bundle of cigars under his arm—he dropped them—that was two or three hundred yards from the prosecutor's shop—he was not dressed like the prisoner.</p>

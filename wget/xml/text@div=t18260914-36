On the 23d of June, about half-past twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner go up the area steps, with a basket in his hand. I followed, and before he got to the corner he dropped it - he looked round, and I had a good view of him, so as to know him again, but could not overtake him; I returned, and found the basket moved about five yards from where he dropped it; it contained the articles stated in the indictment. On the 17th of July I saw the prisoner crossing from Bridge-street, Westminster to Great George-street, with another man; I watched, and in King-street he began to go down the area steps - I fetched a constable, and had him taken - he denied the charge, but I am positive to him. The basket was not master's - it was about three minutes out of my sight while I pursued him. I had not seen him come down the area. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140028"></xptr>had been up stairs about five minutes. The plate was kept in the pantry closet - he had to go through the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Were you acquainted with him before? A. No. I did not see his face till he looked round - he might be ten yards before me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you saw him in George-street was he dressed the same? A. He had the same coat, but not the same trousers on.</p>

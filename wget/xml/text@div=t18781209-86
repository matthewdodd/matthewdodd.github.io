On 22nd November, about 9 p.m., I law the prisoner with two other men and a woman in Holborn—they went into a dining-room—when they came out I followed them; they went to the Coach and Horses in Holborn, almost opposite the other place—they came out from there, and one man then left them—they then went to the York Arms, the prisoner, the prosecutor, and the woman, and afterwards to the Bull and Mouth close by; then into Dean Street and Lee Street, and into the Crown—the woman then left, and the prisoner and prosecutor went to the White Horse in Holborn—the prisoner ran from there across to the Royal Music Hall and called to some one, and then returned with another man, and shortly after all three left and went to the Globe; the prisoner and prosecutor went in, the other manstood outside—they then went up Southampton Street into the Yorkshire Grey, and then went down Duke Street near the British Museum—when they got to the top of Duke Street they stopped, and after a few seconds I saw a scuffle between them; the prosecutor called out "Police!" at the same time he caught hold of a lamp-post, apparently to save himself—the prisoner caught him on one side and the other man on the other and threw him violently on the ground—while he was on the ground I saw the prisoner's left hhnd inside his clothes; on going up the street the prosecutor's coat and vest were fastened, and when he was on the ground they were torn open—I ran up to his assistance; the prisoner ran away in the direction of Museum Street; I ran after him, shouting "Stop thief," and I caught him in Museum Street—the other man turned to the left, and I lost sight of him—I told the prisoner I should take him into custody for assaulting the man and attempting to rob him—he said, "I have not done anything"—I brought him back to the prosecutor, who was picked up by some people passing—his clothes were all torn open, the whole of the buttons were torn off his vest, and his pocket turned out—he at once seized the prisoner by the collar and said, "This is the man that robbed me"—he was drunk—the</p>

                  </hi>. I am an articled law clerk, living at 61, Martin Road, Brixton—on the 22nd November I had lunched at the Hol<lb></lb>born Restaurant—in the afternoon I played billiards at the Horse Shoe, and in the evening I went to a great number of public-houses—I think I first met the prisoner at the Royal Music Hall about 7—I had not known him before—I went to a great number of public-houses with him and a woman who afterwards joined us—I don't know the names of the places we went to—the woman left us—they made me drunk and the prisoner knocked me down and robbed me of about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was one other man who tried to get my chain—the prisoner ran away and two detectives started after him, Badger brought him back to me, and I said "This is the man who robbed me," and I clutched hold of his coat—I had pawned my watch that afternoon for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I had that and change for a sovereign before I met the prisoner—I paid for some of the drink, for most of it I think—I drank beer.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I am 21 years of age—I have been articled four years—I am employed in an office—I had left work before half-past 1—I generally lunch before that—my business is near the Holborn Restaurant—I was in there about an hour and I believe I then went to the Horse Shoe—I was not drunk at that time—I think I played billiards there till about 5 o'clock—I drank some beer during that time, but I had not too much by any means—I can't say whether I took a glass of something besides beer; I did not drink spirits—I told the Magistrate I sometimes took to drinking very much—I did not say "I am accustomed to hard drinking"—it was about 7 or half-past that I was at the Royal Music Hall—I was standing alongside of the prisoner at the bar there, I knocked his glass over and I called for another, and paid for it, and by that means we got into conversation and drank together—when we went outside there were some ladies on the pave<lb></lb>ment and I entered into conversation with them—I did not ask one of them to join me, we went to a cafe and they refused to serve me, and then we went to another public-house—I dropped some silver on the floor there—the woman did not pick up some and give to me—I swear that—she may have picked up a sixpence or a shilling—I have no salary, I have private means of my own.</p>

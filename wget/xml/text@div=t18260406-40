               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. Chick is not the person who snatched your watch? A. No; he pinioned me behind. I am sure he is the man; I saw him in custody, and followed him to the watch-house at Cripplegate; he was a stranger to me before. There was a strong gaslamp near the post.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not taken up one Rossman on this charge? A. I said he was very like the man, and I thought he was the man till I saw him in the watch-house - I described the man - I said he was like a man who went about the streets fiddling - the officer fetched the fidler to the watch-house, and I said immediately he was not the man - he was like him, but too stout - he was immediately discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not detained till it was proved he was in bed at the time? A. Certainly not; his wife came to the watch-house and said he was in bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Your watch was snapped in an instant? A. Yes; I said Rossman, the fidler, was very like Burke, but not that he was the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was your watch? A. Gold, and had a gold key and ring. The first thing that happened was Burke pushing by me very quick - the pinioning of my arms was at the same time as it was snatched, not before; I saw Chick on the road to the watch-house a very few minutes after I lost my watch, and said, in his hearing, "That is the man who pinioned me;" he made no reply. I did not see Burke in custody that night; I described him to Horton, the constable, and, in consequence of that description Brown took me next day to the Salmon and Ball public-house, Bunhill-row - it is a very low house - there were fourteen or fifteen men down in a cellar, playing at skittles; I saw a man there with his coat off - the officer told him to put it on; I looked round and said "It is of no use his putting his coat on, this is the man," (pointing to Burke,) "who took my watch;" he heard me say so. I am quite certain he is the man; he was taken to the watch-house directly; I had described him as being like the fidler - when I saw the fidler at the watch-house I said he was very much like the man in the face but rather stouter.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How soon after the robbery did you see Burke? A. Next morning, before twelve o'clock- this cellar is used as a skittle-ground; Burke is not the man who had his coat off. The man who robbed me had a cap on, I think, but am not certain; I looked him strait in the face, perfectly, to recognize his features. I told the officer he was very much like a man who used to go about the streets fidling - I had known the fidler about ten years; there was a great likeness in the two. When the fidler was brought I said he was very much like him in the face, but stouter.</p>
               <p>Mr. CRESWELL. Q. You told the officer he was like the fidler as a clue for him to know the man? A. Yes; I did not mean to say the fidler was the man.</p>

            . I live in Bell-yard, Doctors' Commons, and am a conveyancer. On Tuesday, the 7th of March, I was going up Grub-street, about ten o'clock, and heard a cry of Stop thief! or Stop him! and observed a man running towards me with very great speed; I sprung forward to seize him, but he turned up a court; I followed up the court, and lost sight of him just before he was taken by a gentleman's servant - I had followed him through several courts, into Ropemaker-street, and into Moor-lane; it was Chick - I believe he had a hat on when I pursued, but when I came up he had none. I saw the prosecutor in Grub-street after Chick was in custody: I am satisfied he is the man I pursued, though I had him not always in view - no other person was pursued.</p>

            . I am constable of Cripplegate. On the 7th of March I was at the watch-house - M'Donald brought Chick in without a hat; the prosecutor came to the watch-house, and said, in his presence, that he and another man had robbed him of a gold watch; Chick denied it. I asked if he knew the other man - he said he thought he should know him - he was a man who played a fiddle about, and who he knew very well; I asked where the offence was committed, and was told it was in the County; I asked if he should know the other man if I was to bring him - he said Yes; I went to the fidler's house, and found a man answering the description; he was in bed. I brought him to the watch-house, and asked if he was the man; he said Yes, he was - I told him to look at him and be certain, for I had searched the apartments, and examined his shoes, and found no soil on them; he looked at him for a moment - I asked if he had any doubt of him; he said he had - I said, "Then give him the doubt;" he said,"I will," and I discharged him. I do not recollect any thing being said about his being stouter. Chick declared his innocence as he was going to St. Luke's watch-house; I asked what he ran for - he said because he saw other people run.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. He stated so positively, that he was the man, that if you had not observed his shoes you would have taken him to prison? A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The moment he described the fidler you knew who he meant, and went for him? A. Yes - he is much stouter than Burke, and is the father of two or three children; he said he should know the man very well - it was a man who played the fiddle about the street - that is all the description he gave.</p>

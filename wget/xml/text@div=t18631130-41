                  </hi>. I live at 116, Westbourne-park-crescent—the prisoner lodged at my house—she occupied a parlour and bed-room adjoining, on the ground-floor, an old lady, an invalid, lodged above—on 28th October, between 9 and 10 at night, I was at home—I was alarmed by some persons coming in, and saying my house was on fire—I first went to get out the old lady—I then went down to the prisoner's sitting-room—the fire was then extinguished—I saw portions of the curtain lying on the floor, partly burned—it was a damask window-curtain—the prisoner was not at home—I had heard her go out a few minutes before—she came in in about half an hour—I told her the place had been on fire, and we were quite unable to account for it, she must, in some way or the other, have done it—she said she knew nothing of it, she could not tell how it had occurred—she did not sleep there that night; I requested her to go to her mother's—she came next day with her mother—I don't remember anything passing in the morning, but in the evening I spoke to her about it, and she said, "You don't suppose I did it"—I told her she must leave, and just before she was leaving I said, "You will give me the plate I left in your charge"—it was a table-spoon, dessert-spoon, mustard-spoon, tea-spoons, and sugar-tongs which I had given for her use as a lodger—she said she would go and fetch the key, she had left it at her mother's—she went, but did not come back, and a gentleman in the house, in the presence of her mother and myself, broke open the chiffonnier, and I saw inside a quantity of charred paper, and</p>

               <p>a box of lucifer-matches, half consumed, and everything in it very much dis<lb></lb>coloured—the wood of the chiffonnier was very much charred, not burnt through—it is rather a common mahogany chiffonnier—it is not of the best workmanship; the doors may not close very well—when the prisoner was taken in charge she at once said, "I have pawned the plate; I was obliged to do it"—she was in indigent circumstances—after she was committed I visited her in the House of Detention, and had some conversation with her—I told her I had called to ascertain what she thought of the serious crime she had committed now she had had time to reflect upon it—she said, "I did it, Miss Coleman, and I hope you will forgive me"—she confessed before I said anything about forgiveness—I believe she said, "I am guilty"—I said, "I know you are guilty of the plate; you confess it, but with regard to the fire?"—she said, "I did that; will you forgive me?"—I said, "I will, but it is a serious crime, and as you have confessed it, now tell me your motive"—that was after I had said I would forgive her—she said "At first I thought I would deny it for the first few days, but then I thought I could not stand up again in the police-court at Hammersmith, and deny it".</p>

I told her she must have done it—I did not accuse her of doing it wilfully—I said at least it was an act of carelessness, and I thought so at the time; I could not think it was design—I went to see her of the House of Detention as a friend I may say—I did not so describe myself to the officer—I said I was the prosecutrix—I went merely to satisfy myself that she had really confessed, that I might name it to the Magistrate the next time I appeared before him—I wanted to see if she was really sorry for the deed—she is about twenty-two years of age—she had occasionally been very ill, and subject to fits—she had only been in the house three weeks—she was very reserved—I knew very little of her—when I saw her in the House of Detention she was confined in a cell—she appeared in great distress of mind—I did not go into the cell—I spoke to her through a piece of perforated zinc—my object in going was to know whether the confession she had made to her father included the setting fire to the place—I might have said at the end that I would intercede for her—the prisoner had never seen the invalid lady while she was in the house—she knew that she was there.</p>

I am in the service of Miss Coleman—on Wednesday, 28th October, I heard the prisoner go out—I don't know the time—two or three minutes afterwards some persons came into the house to say it was on fire—I went into the prisoner's room, and saw the curtains on fire—they were then hanging up against the window—some men came in, and put them out—an old lady, an invalid, lived upstairs.</p>

On 29th October I went to the prosecutrix's house, to the lower room, occupied by the prisoner—I saw the chiffonnier opened—I saw some charred matches in the corner, some of which I produce, and some remains like burnt paper on the floor—there was what appeared to be a portion of the burnt curtain and some paper—there was a blind; that did not appear to be injured—I went from the house, and after getting two or three minutes' walk from it I met the prisoner in the Harrow-road—I stopped her, and asked her if she had stopped for any time at 11, Westbourne-park-terrace—she said, "Yes"—I said, "Come with me"—I took her to the house, and in Miss Coleman's presence charged her with setting fire to the house, and also with stealing the plate—she denied setting fire to the house or knowing anything whatever of it, but acknowledged to the pawning of the plate—she said, "I have been this morning to get the money to get the plate—I have pawned the sugar-tongs, the tablespoon, and the dessert-spoon"—she also said she had been very much distressed—the curtain that was burnt was the one next the chiffonnier; there was a crevice in the chiffonnier through which the flame might get.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there more than one window in the room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only one—there is a fire-place; there was no fire in it when I went—the window is about 9 1/2 feet from the fire-place; the chiffonnier was between the fire-place and the window—the edge of the chiffonnier came close to the curtain—the place where the flame might have got through was about a foot from where the curtain hung, but if it had been loosely folded it might have come in contact with the blaze coming through the chiffonnier—I went a second time in consequence of what the Magistrate said, and made a more close examina<lb></lb>tion, and found another place very much charred, that would actually come in contact with the curtain.</p>

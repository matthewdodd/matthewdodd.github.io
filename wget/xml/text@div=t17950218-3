He came in at the time the Norwich waggoner was cording my box the second time, he see me get change for the guinea, I delivered the box to him with six guineas of gold in it, he carried it to the corner of Bishopsgate-street where his cart stood. His horse met with a misfortune and fell down and he left the box at the corner of a street, and I stood by it till he came the second time and took the box, I said, Mr. Green, will you let me ride in the cart? - No, he said, you cannot, nor you shall not; accordingly I told him to leave the box at Mrs. Anderson's, the Royal Hospital, at Chelsea, and if I was not there she would pay him for the box; and I and Mrs. Barrett went home to Chelsea; about six o'clock in the evening I went to see if my box was at Mrs. Anderson's, and I see the cart turn from the corner as I got near to Mrs. Anderson's house, I went and asked if a box was left for me? says I, Mrs. Anderson, is there a box left here for me? she said, yes, here is a box left here for you, and you are to pay me eighteen-pence; I went in and saw the box, and it was open, I had locked it when I gave it him; I said, good God! my box is broke open; Mr. Anderson said, that is the way that the man left the box, accordingly I got two men to carry the box to Mrs. Barrett's (there is two handles to my box, one at each end) where I lodge, and instantly I got in I examined my box, the first thing of course I looked to was this box where my money was lodged, and I opened the box and there was but one guinea out of six, I said, Mrs. Barrett, I am robbed of five guineas; I unsolded every thing that I had, and shaked them out, and I examined every thing very carefully and very strictly, and not a single farthing but one guinea left out of the six guineas<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180008"></xptr>in this box where my husband's shirt buckles and knee buckles were.</p>

            Because I observe you represent yourself as calling him by his name at first? - I see his name on the cart, Thomas Green, I can read and write; he keeps an errand cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell me how your box was sastened? - When I gave it to him at the Pea Hen, it was safe locked and corded.</p>
               <p>Q. When you get to Chelsea what part was broke open? - Did the cord remain on it? - The cord was loose on it, and an old mattress on it that I brought from the West Indies with me; I am an old traveller.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again? - In his own house, on Christmas morning; I went to him, and first of all the door was opened, and he was sitting on a chair by the fire side, I said, Mr. Green, how came my box to be broke open? says he, how do I know? says I, Mr. Green, you must know, for it was delivered safe locked and corded to you; says he, how do you know that it could not be broke open at Mrs. Anderson's; I then said to him, mind, I tell you that I come to acquaint you of what has happened with my box, I have lost five guineas out of it, and if you do not make me a restitution for my money, I certainly will go to Bow-street to-morrow morning; he said, you may go where you please, I will stand my trial for it. This happened to me on the 24th, and the 25th was Christmas Day; on the 25th I went to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. In the first place, this man is the common carrier that drives the cart between the Pea Hen and Chelsea? - He is.</p>
               <p>Q. And he carried many other parcels in his cart besides your's? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave him direction when he carried your box, to leave it at the Royal Hospital? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. There you found it? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your husband? - He is an invalid, at Jersey.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he? - A soldier.</p>
               <p>Q. What may you be? - I came with an intent to get my husband from garrison if I could, as there is a gentleman belonging to the regiment that is here, that would wish to get my husband from garrison in order to be a recruiting serjeant for the sencibles that are now raising.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you to stay at Chelsea? - Till such time as I wrote a letter to my husband, and if my husband could not come from garrison I meant to go back to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What situation of life are you in? - I am nothing but a poor woman, and since this affair of the money being lost, I am living on the clothes I have.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you been doing with yourself since? - I landed from the West Indies July last; a gentleman heard of the ill situation of the Jerseys, and as such I was billetted at a very respectable house, the Magpie, at Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you become possessed (in the situation in which you are in) of seven guineas when you set out from Norwich? - I was worth ten guineas when I set out from Norwich.</p>
               <p>Q. When you set out from Norwich, I am surprised you did not take your little stock in your pocket? - If I had thought of any casualty happening of that kind I certainly should.</p>
               <p>Q. In fact, all your stock was in that box, and you took one guinea out of it in town? - I did, I took one guinea out of seven.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was in town and had only to go to Chelsea, why did not you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180009"></xptr>put it in your pocket? - I did not think of any casualty.</p>
               <p>Q. You had an opportunity of taking out your box and putting it in your pocket? - I had.</p>

               <p>Q. And what time of the day was it you found your box? - About six o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was it he left Bishopsgate-street? - I cannot tell that, because as soon as he took the box from me and put it in the cart, I left the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in town, before you set off yourself for Chelsea? - I set off immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. At what part of the house was it you saw the box at Mrs. Anderson's? - In the tap room.</p>
               <p>Q. Not in the bar belonging to the house? - No, in the tap room, on the first table.</p>

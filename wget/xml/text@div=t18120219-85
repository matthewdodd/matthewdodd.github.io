            . I purchased this cannon of a man of the name of Longrove, I have kept it ever since. I exposed it publicly in my shop for some months.</p>
               <p>- LONGROVE. Q. Where did you get this cannon - A. I was at the sign of the White Hart, Old Brompton, the prisoner was in there, he said I bought a cannon last night, it was to have been raffled for; it was put up for twelve shillings, and the person that put it up offered to sell it for nine shillings, not getting members enough he sold it to the prisoner for six shillings and a pint of beer, he said it was of no use to him, and that if any person in the tap-room would give him a shilling profit he would sell it for seven shillings and a pot of beer, they should have it. There were nine or ten people in the tap-room; it was handed about to me; I bought it, I gave seven shillings, and a pot of beer for it; I took it home that night and cleaned it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this - A. About a twelvemonth ago. I sold it to Mr. Wilson; my son let it off in my absence, I sold it because he should do no hurt with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say when he bought it - A. He said he bought it at the Bell and Crown in Holborn a day or two before I bought it; I never heard any thing about it till the 7th of October last; I went into Mr. Wilson's shop to buy powder and shot. I told him exactly what I have told you, I told Mr. 
               <persName id="t18120219-85-person766">Wilson</persName>
             I would produce the prisoner; I went to the prisoner, he said he was very willing to come forward, and he and I went the next morning to Mr. Wilson, he advised the prisoner to go down to Captain Lawson; the prisoner did; Captain Lawson was at Woolwich; I went to the Bell and Crown the people that occupied the house at the time it was to be raffled for, they were gone and left the house. I went into the country, Mr. Wilson wrote to me that I must return the one pound fifteen shillings. I have known the prisoner sixteen years, he is a very hard working man.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The cannon is mine, it is the cannon that I lost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This cannon was put up at the Bell and Crown Holborn to be raffled for, he offered it for nine shillings, I bought it for six shillings and a pot of beer. I brought it down to Old Brompton, I kept it in my possession four days; I offered it at the White Hart Tavern for sale; I told them there if any person would give a shilling advance they should have it, it was of no use to me; Longrove purchased it of me. He took it home that night. I heard nothing more of the cannon until it was owned by captain Lawson. I went to Mr. Wilson and asked him for captain Lawson's address; he gave it me. I went to captain Lawson. I have taken a great deal of pains to find out the man I bought it off. Captain Lawson came three times to me at Old Brompton, he said if I did not come forward and pay five pounds he would seek a recompence; he said the last time if I would come forward and pay the five pounds he would do away with the business.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. This assertion is as false as God is true.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

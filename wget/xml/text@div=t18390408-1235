                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, and live in High Holborn. The prisoner was my shopman—on the 4th of March he took out six mousseline de laine dresses to show to a customer for inspection—I did not give them to him, but they were entered by the clerk in the book, by the prisoner's dictation—on the Thursday morning he solicited permission to stop away, as his wife had fallen down, and her life was in danger—I agreed to it, and when I discovered that he had taken these dresses out, I went to him, and asked about them—he said he had sold them all—I said he had better come and enter them—he said he would—he came, and stated that three of them he had sold <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi>—one he entered to a person of the name of Salter, the other two he entered to himself—the cotton he did not ac<lb></lb>count for at all, nor did I know he had taken it till I saw it at the pawn-broker's—these are the three dresses, two of which he entered in his own name, and one in the name of John Salter, a wine-merchant, in Batty-street, Commercial-road.</p>

I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's house in Suffolk-street—I asked the prisoner about the dresses, and the piece of cloth—he said they were all right, and he could account for them by producing his book, which he could not get at that time—I took him into custody, and on the way to the office, he said, he felt quite indifferent respecting the charge, as he could produce his book, where every thing would be found correct—I was desired by the Magis<lb></lb>trate to search his house—the prisoner said he should not give much trouble, I should find the property at Messrs. Latter's, in the Commercial-road, and I was to apply to his wife for the ticket.</p>

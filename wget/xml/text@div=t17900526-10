               <p>On the 16th of April, the prisoner was coming by my stall with some leather: I said, you may as well leave it with me, I can use it; my stall is in Tooley-street; he did not seem to take any notice; he went away; and he returned, and I said, what do you want? he asked me to buy a dozen of soles? I said if I liked them, I would buy them; I went out in the evening, and told my wife I expected him; and he came; and a person came for me; and I got a constable; he said eleven shillings was the price; I said, I suspect you have stolen them? he said he bought them of a man, and gave half a guinea for them: I delivered him to the constable.</p>

               <p>Harvey. Here is one remarkable one, I can swear to; I thought it would not do for a sole, and I was going to cut it, to make it a fore piece: they are Mess. Newman's property.</p>
               <p>Court. Might not they have been disposed of? I cannot say; I had not missed them; it is impossible to miss them.</p>
               <p>Court. The evidence is so slight, that it is not necessary to put the prisoner on his defence: for Harvey cannot tell whether they had been sold or not.</p>

This woman came last Saturday, about one o'clock, and asked me if I would take the money for the shoes she had looked at some time before; she offered me ten shillings for two pair; I told her I could not take it; I offered her them for eleven shillings; then she asked me what I would take for three pair; I told her fifteen shillings and sixpence; she had kept me a great while in the shop, I went down stairs and told my mistress there was a person in the shop, and to mind her.</p>

            . About half after twelve I was in Mr. Ashfield's shop binding of a man's shoe at the counter; Mr. Ashfield went down stairs to work, Mrs. Ashfield was in the adjoining parlour; the prisoner was sitting in the chair by the window, I saw her take a pair of shoes off the brass hook she folded them up in a bundle and put them in a handkerchief; she then went out of the shop; I ran after her and brought her back, with the property on her; she came to the door, she pretended to stoop down to pull up her shoe; she threw them behind the street door; Mrs. Ashfield picked them up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Do not you know that your mistress had seen something so extraordinary in that poor creature, that she was willing to send her son to see her home least any accident should happen to her. A. Mrs. Ashfield said, if you are in liquor, my son shall see you home.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that this poor girl is the daughter of a respectable man and woman. - A. I know it now; they have been to Mr. Ashfield's house.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutrix. How came you to send her home with your boy. - A. She had no money to purchase the shoes; she said she was tipsy; she had been at our house four times; she repeatedly said she was tipsy.</p>

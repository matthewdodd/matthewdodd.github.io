I am the wife of William Coventry, a linen-draper, and live in Old-street. on the 6th of June, in consequence of in<lb></lb>formation from a little girl, I observed parrt of a pane of glass taken out of the shop window, and missed a bundle of silk handkerchiefs, a shawl, and some ribbon—I had put the things into the window half an hour before—I lost a bundle of black handkerchiefs, and twnty—one yards of silk, and other things, worth from 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., together—I am sure it was above 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the window was all safe at half-past eleven o'clock.</p>

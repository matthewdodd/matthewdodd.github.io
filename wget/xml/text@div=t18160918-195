            . I have known the prisoner for some time; he was a school-fellow of mine. I met him in September, in the last year. I asked him a question about his having left his employment so early; and he said, he was in the employ of the Excise, in Fenchurch-street, and that his business was done for the day. I expressed myself that it would be a good thing for a young man to get into such an employment. He asked me if I knew any person who was acquainted with the Commissioners of Excise; I told him no. He said he knew a person of the name of Longmore who had a considerable interest with the commissioners of Excise, but he was a very mercenary man. I inquired what that person would require as a renumeration for exerting<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180086"></xptr>his interest to obtain a similar situation; he said he did not know; but he would make inquiries, and we pacted for that time. Next time I saw him he shewed me a note; I think that note was signed "B.R.L." and the substance of that note was "he would get the situation for two guineas. I expressed my surprize, that only so small a sum should be required, and Thompson explained it that he was personally intimate with this "B.R.L." and that be had induced him to take that small sum, as a favour to him, the prisoner. I wrote to the Commissioners, and this business was discovered.</p>

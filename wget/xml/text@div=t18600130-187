                  </hi>. I am a waiter at the Clarence hotel, Aldersgate-street—I remember Mr. Allman, a commercial traveller, being there on Friday evening, 1st November—he came into the coffee-room to dinner—he changed his boots for slip-shoes—I saw his boots afterwards in the coffee-room, under the table—Mr. Allman left the coffee-room for the smoking-room—after that two men came into the coffee-room—they were Wood and the prisoner—they ordered a glass of ale and a glass of stout—the prisoner paid for it—they appeared to know each other and be intimate—after serving them with the ale I left the room—Mr. Jackson, who was staying in the house, went into the room whilst those two men were there—no other person went to serve them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 229). I took the prisoner in custody on 16th January; previously to this I searched his lodgings in Mexican-place, Caledonian-road—they were occupied by the prisoner and Wood, who pleaded guilty in November last—in a travelling<lb></lb>bag in those lodgings, I found a duplicate for a pair of boots—on finding that duplicate, I went to the last witness's shop—they were pawned in the name of James Smith—I brought the prisoner straight to the station—on the way, he said there was a bag at his lodging in Mexican-terrace, which he wished me to take care of—he described the bag—he said it was his own private property—I found this duplicate with six others in that bag.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not I tell you that the duplicate in the bag belonged to Wood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't think you did—you said there were some papers in the bag that were of very great service to you; in fact, that the contents of the bag altogether were of great service to you—I think you said there was a duplicate of some shirts and other things that were quite right, but they were all your own property—Wood lodged in the same room—there were some papers, and two or three collars also in the bag—I don't think they belonged to Wood—some belonged to Russell, a man who was tried with Wood—there was no portfolio of Wood's in the bag, or any letters—the only things I could find in the bag with reference to Wood, were some cards printed in commemoration of a death which occurred in Hague's family—Wood's name is Hague.</p>

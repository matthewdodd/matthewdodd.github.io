On Saturday the 16th of November, between the hours of six and seven in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop with another woman; the prisoner asked to see some flannels at a shilling a yard; I shewed her a whole piece; another customer came in; I left her looking at it; my back was then turned from her, and while I was serving the other customer, I turned round, and the prisoner and the other woman that came in with her was gone; by their going out in that manner, I suspected they had taken something from off the counter; I left the person I was then serving; I saw the prisoner and the other that was with her just crossing over the way; they had just got upon the curb; I went after them, and took them at the corner of the street opposite; I laid hold of the prisoner, and asked her if she had not got something that did not belong to her; she immediately dropped the parcel upon an iron railing of an area; I held the window fast while I tapped at the window for a light; they gave a light under the area; I picked up the gloves there; I took the prisoner, and gave her to the officer at Marlborough-street; the other woman escaped; I could not hold them both.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons serving in the shop besides you? - A. There was a boy in the shop who was then serving a lady with a pair of gloves.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that boy here? - A. No. She was searched at Marlborough-street; she had no money in her pockets to purchase any thing.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer of Marlborough-street; I produce the gloves I had of Mr. Burford.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Prosecutor). Look at these gloves? - A. There were 27 pair of gloves and three pair of mits, and my private mark is on the paper; I saw the gloves just before the prisoner came in; the prisoner is the person that threw them on the railing of the area; and the prisoner is the woman that wanted the flannel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had half a crown and a few halfpence in my hand, which I got from my husband; he pulled me about and chucked the half crown out of my hand when he came after me. I went into this man's shop to buy a piece of flannel; I saw two ladies there and a little boy; as Christ Lord may hear me, I am with child with the thirteenth child; I wish I may drop down dead if it is not the truth that I had a hole in my pocket; I had half a crown in my hand; I told him I would give him that money for the flannel that I wanted; he said to me, you shall have it, with that this woman ran out, and he ran after her; he says I am robbed. I being foolish and innocent, I ran out; he got hold of the other woman, but she being very strong, got away from him. O says he, damn you, and then he laid hold of me, saying, you are my prisoner; I said I will go along with you, only be easy; he dragged me down to this office; I said do not use me ill; I told him where I lived; I am sure that he gave me punishment enough.</p>

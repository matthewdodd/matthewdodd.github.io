On the 4th of June, I saw the prisoner come into the yard, about six o'clock in the evening - he was a stranger; he took a mahogany board, and carried it out of the yard two or three doors - this is the board; I took him, and told him he must take it back - he said he would not; then I said,"I must, and you along with it."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was he so drunk as to be unable to stand? A. He was drunk - there is no window there; I took him to be in a very advanced state of intoxication - he stood, and walked, but rather crooked; I heard my master say he knew the prisoner, and should like to recommend him to mercy - I have heard that he is a looking-glass frame maker.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Drunk or sober, he could carry this board? A. It appeared like it; he had carried it three doors off the premises, and it had been fifteen yards on the premises.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not you swear the man was sober? A. No - I said he was not drunk, but rather intoxicated; Mr. Sykes charged me with him - I do not recollect hearing him say he did not believe the man intended to steal it; I will not swear he did not - he said he had known him a good while, and had dealt with him for wood.</p>

I saw the young man (the prisoner) soon after six in the morning, I heard a noise in the street, between the watchman and the prisoner about four.</p>

               <p>On the 1st of August about four in the morning I was going to work on a ship in Gun dock belonging to the prosecutors; I am servant to them, I had not the key of the gate; and I went to get over and the gate flew open with me, and I got down again and saw the prisoner walking towards me, coming from the kettle, and I asked the prisoner what he did there? he said he came on shore from the tier of ships, I said you could not without being all over mud, and his hands were all over rosin, as if he had been knocking the rosin out of the kettle, to make it lighter; going along he strove to get from me, and fell down in the struggle, and the watchman came and took him; I am sure the kettle had not been out two or three days before, when there is any rosin left, it remains in the kettle till the next time we use it; I did not see him with the kettle, I only saw him come from the place where it was, it is too heavy for one man;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090024"></xptr>but in about in a quarter after I traversed the foot-marks of people in the mud, who had got off.</p>
               <p>Then if people chuse to come thro' the mud, they may get into your master's dockyard? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it difficult? - Not very difficult: the kettle may be very near two hundred and a half.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not I coming out of the gate? - He was coming to the gate; the kettle was eight or nine yards from the gate.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had been with a ship-mate, on board the Boston Indiaman, laying off there, all night; and I came on shore with intent to go on board my own vessel; and just coming out of the gate, the witness stopped me; I asked him, what for? he said I knew what.</p>
               <p>Court to Andrews. Might not the footsteps you observed in the mud, be those of a person coming from the mud, instead of going to it? - No, they could not, because the person must have come through a quantity of mud, and have jumped up upon a plank, and the first foot mark in the mud was so far from the plank that he must have jumped from the plank to the mud, by taking a run first, and he could not have jumped such a distance from the mud, up upon the plank.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner six months; I am Mr. Wardel's servant, and took care of his house; on Friday evening, the 16th of August, I met the prisoner the corner of Earl-street, he asked me how I did, and I answered him in a friendly manner; he went in doors with me, and the mug was on the dresser; he asked for some small beer, I bid him go and draw it; he drew it, and we sat down; he said he was dry, and he

             some more; I asked him to have some bread and cheese; he said, then he would have a pot of beer; he gave me 6 d. and I went for it; I took the key, and when I came back he was gone: I missed the mug, which I left on the table; he was taken the next day.</p>

               <p>I am a serjeant in the militia; the 17th of August I met the prisoner near Fleet-market; he run up Ludgate-hill when he saw me; I followed him; he is a deserter; he said, do not hurt me, I have more about me that will satisfy you than what you can get for me; immediately he shewed the mug, which he had under his coat; he said he was going to sell it, and would give me part of the money; I told him he should go with me; he said, take the mug; he run away, I followed him; he was taken, and the constable took the mug out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>(The Constable confirmed the finding of the mug.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Wardel proved the mug to be his property by a mark, J. J. W. but should know it without, as it was a mug given to him and his brother when they first went to housekeeping.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The maid gave me the mug, as I told her I wanted a little money; she bid me take it to pawn, and she would fetch it out; I was going with it, and met the serjeant; I could have taken any thing out of the house I chose: the woman wanted to live along with me, though she has a husband; I have been in the house by myself many times, I never was confined in my life.</p>

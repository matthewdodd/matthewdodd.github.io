                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Cromarty. We live in the Commercial-road—the prisoner was in my service—on Thursday, the 19th of May, she was absent without leave—I then wished to see the con<lb></lb>tents of her box—she left that day—she would not have her box opened—it was opened by the policeman on the following Saturday—the stockings and other articles mentioned were found in it—they are my husband's property, and are marked with my name in full—she had locked her box and corded it previous to her leaving—I could not have put these things in it.</p>

I was called to prose<lb></lb>cutor's house, and examined the box, which was locked and roped—the prisoner had the key—I found these things in it—it was three-quarters of an hour before I could get the prisoner to open the box—she was very abusive, and said she did not care for my cloth—I said I would break it open.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a contractor, and five in Gibraltar-walk. I hired Mr. Pratt's carts to carry some gravel for me from Fetter-lane to Bethnal-green—it was to be supplied from the sewer making in Fetter-lane—I contracted with Mr. Munday—he is not here—it was my property—the first two loads were not delivered to me—they were worth 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I met the prisoners with the second load, and they were delivered—I afterwards found two loads of gravel at the Fever Hospital, of the same quality and appearance as the rest I was supplied with from the sewer.</p>

I was in attendance there for him, as he was out, when the prisoners came with two of Mr. Pratt's carts containing a kind of gravelly stuff—I got some beer from the kitchen, and received 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Goodfellow to pay the car<lb></lb>men—I gave it to Barnard—they both drank of the beer—Barnard said the gravel was better than what was brought the day before—Kennett was stand<lb></lb>ing close by, near enough to hear—they shot the gravel down on the path—they had brought four loads of gravel or mixture the day before—it was brought there as rubbish—I cannot say whether it was gravel—I saw it after. it was shot out, and it appeared to me the same as had been shot before, but I am no judge of it—gravel, clay, and mud had been shot before.</p>

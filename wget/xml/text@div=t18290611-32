On the 26th of September I got three notes from the Bank of England - my husband sent me for them, but I do not know what they were, as I cannot read nor write; I gave them to my husband. On the 9th of April I was in the shop, about half-past eleven o'clock in the day, and two men came in - I cannot say that the prisoner was one - they were both alike in features; I did not know one from the other - I bought some sweatmeats of them; one of the men, but I cannot say which, had been at my shop the week before - on the 9th they came together, when I bought the box of goods of them, one came first, and then went and fetched the other: the box of sweat-meats was brought from a cart by one of them - I was to pay 5l. 7s. 6d. for it; 3d. was taken off by the gentleman who took the money - I cannot say whether the men were dressed alike; I had never seen them before - one of them called the week before; I sent to my husband for the key of his box - it was brought; I unlocked the box, and took out two notes, but I do not know what they were - I do not know any difference between a 1l. note and a 50l. note; I gave one of the notes to the men, who said it was right - that was all I gave him, except the 7s. 6d.; he put the note into his pocket: I swear I do not recollect any thing particular in his manner of doing it - they went away together, and I saw no more of them; the box of sweatmeats was left, and the box was to be called for on the following Saturday, but they did not come.</p>

I had a 50l. note, which my wife brought from the Bank of England last September; I had seen it about the middle of April, two or three days before the sweetmeats were brought - it had not always been locked up: it was in a box, of which I sometimes had the key, and sometimes not; when I am out I give my wife the key - I do not know that she had had it that week, I think not - I have got no part of the money since; I was before the Magistrate: I did tell him that it was in a box, of which I kept the key. When I came back on the day the sweetmeats were brought, the note was gone; I think the key had not been out of my possession after I saw the note safe - I have some lodgers in the house, who go into that room the same as myself.</p>

             deposed he went to No. 14, in a court on Snowhill, and he took Colborn as he was coming up to the house, that Colborn said he had a right to cut out blanks, and that an Alderman told them they had a right to do it so long as there were no heads and tails on them.</p>
               <p>COLBORN's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Between four and five months ago I was taken up for the very same affair, and put into Wood-street Compter by Alderman Kitchen, and the sitting justice, and the Solicitor of the Mint, and Mr. Clarke, and they acquitted me, and gave me my things back, I applied to the court to know whether I might work or no, they said I might go to work, but to put neither heads or tails on, this same man chased buttons for me then.</p>
               <p>ATKINS's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Colburn They had a pocket book of mine with some cards and orders for the country.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoners.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dame. I keep a public house opposite Colborn's, never saw any thing but honest and just by him, have received several pounds of him for beer, have known him near three quarters of a year, I never saw any secrets, I have carried in beer when the door was wide open, I have seen copper there thicker and larger than a halfpenny, I have never received above 6 d halfpenny at a time in halfpence, I have seen him cutting blanks with a fly, I have seen people come in and pay forfeits for having a cut, a great quantity of copper used to come in, and I have seen him carry out the shavings, as they call them.</p>
               <p>Mr. King. I am turnkey to Mr. Kirby, Wood-street Compter, Colburn was taken up on suspicion of coining, in September, and discharged by alderman Kitchen.</p>

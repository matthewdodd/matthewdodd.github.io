                  </hi>. I live in Well-street, Hackney. On Tuesday morning, the 25th of July, between five and six o'clock, I met a woman in Rosemary-lane—she was intoxicated—I inquired of Ford where the woman could lie down—she said she could take her to her mother's—I said if she would, I would reward her, and she took her—I gave her a few halfpence to get some drink, and sat down and fell asleep—I saw Welch in the house when I went in—they were both there when I went to sleep, and when I awoke, I missed my watch and ribbon.</p>

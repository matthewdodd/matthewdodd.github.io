                  </hi>. I am a hosier and clothier, and live at 67, Blackman-street, Borough. On the night of the 8th of Jan. my house was closed, and all safe—I went to bed at eleven o'clock—I was awoke about two by the policeman—I went with him into the shop, and found one of the fan-lights over the street-door broken—it was safe when I went to bed—I missed three coats, and one waistcoat, which I have not recovered—I found a stick and two waistcoats behind the door—they bad been removed from the place they occupied over-night.</p>

               <p>On the 30th of August we went to the prisoner's house in <placeName id="t17790915-58-crimeloc293">Crown-ally, Moorfields</placeName>

I went up the stone steps at the door of the house. I heard a sound at the window, crunch, crunch, and repeated knocks, one after another. I went up the steps and knocked at the door, when a woman put her head out of the window. I thought it was the best method to get in at the window. I threw my body right through the window into the cellar; there I saw a press and a fly. I went up-stairs, and let in Yardly and Hobbs. We secured the door, and then went up stairs into the chamber. I saw the prisoner standing upon the stairs, but whether the first or second pair I am not certain; his coat was off, and he was in his shirt sleeves. I presented a pistol to him; he desired me to put it up, and said he would come quietly; upon which I secured him and his sister; then Yardly and I went into the cellar, there we found these farthings (producing a great quantity in a bag) some on the ground, and some by the press. This farthing (pointing it out) was between two dies. We put the farthings into a bag, and took them and the prisoner to Justice Wilmot's office. There was no one in the house besides the prisoner, except two women, one of them the prisoner's wife, and the other his sister.</p>
               <p>Jury. You did not see any body in the cellar? - No; I heard a kind of rumbling on the stairs, as if somebody was going up; that was just as I broke in, before I saw the prisoner. The women were dressed in their morning dress. One of the women called for a gold ring which was in the cellar.</p>

               <p>I went with the last witness at the time he has mentioned. I can say no more than he has related. He broke in, and let us in; Wade took them to the office. After we were let in I went into the one-pair-of-stairs room, there I found a quantity of farthings all black; they were in a brown paper, blacked over as if they were old farthings. We went up stairs to find the prisoner; he knew me very well; he was on the stairs, in a waistcoat without sleeves, and without a coat on, and, as I believe, but am not certain, with his shirt-sleeves tucked up. There was no one in the house, besides the prisoner, his wife and sister, and two small children. I found some copper blanks, and a piece of copper they call cecil. We found three instruments for cutting blanks, two for farthings, and one for halfpence.</p>
               <p>Mr. FLETCHER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the moniers of the mint (looks at the farthings). These farthings are every one of them counterfeits.</p>
               <p>(The press and fly are produced.)</p>
               <p>Is that engi ne fit for this kind of work? - It will answer the purpose of coining.</p>

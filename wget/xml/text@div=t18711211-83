On 22nd November, about 1 o'clock, a.m., I was near Berner's Mews, and heard a cry of "Police!"—the prisoner ran out of the mews—I ran after him about sixty yards, overtook him, and asked him why he was running away—he said that he was running home—I asked what he was doing up the mews—he said that he went up for his own purposes—I said that he must come back with me, and took hold of his left arm—he took my number, and then put his hand to his coat pocket, threw this lantern (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—backwards, and tripped me up—we had a scuffle, and I picked the lantern up, and Jarman came and detained him while I went round to the front door, and Mr. Kent said "That is one of the men I saw get over the wall"—I took him to the station, came back with Jarman and Inspector Arrett, and examined the place—the area win<lb></lb>dow, which is a fixture, was forced open seven inches, and there were marks corresponding with this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>—the lantern was quite warm.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw another man fall from the wall, but the lantern was forty yards from him—the prisoner's overcoat was flying open when he ran out of the mews—he put his right hand behind him beyond the hip, while I had hold of his left arm—it was my notion that he put his hand in the pocket behind his coat—I can identify the coat (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner handed his coat to the witness</hi>)—this coat has side pockets, and none behind; but it was flying open and the side pocket was behind—I had been on duty three hours that night—I had not been in the mews before—I picked up the lamp not quite a minute after it was thrown away—it was two yards from the wall.</p>

                  </hi>. I fastened up my premises, 49, Newman Street, on 21st November, about 11 o'clock—my son called me shortly before 1 o'clock, and I listened and heard a grating noise, and a sound as if the window had given way—I raised the sash, called "Police!' and saw two men go away, and distinctly saw the prisoner by the gas-light on his face—I had a good view of his features—the other man dropped his light in the yard, which was found by the police—I found marks on the window below.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dealer in timber, living at Enfield. On the 22nd of January there were oats in my granary—I received information—I saw the prisoner and my servant come out of my stable at a quarter-past one o'clock—I have examined some oats—the sample that I saw before the Magistrate were mine, I believe, but I will not swear to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 22nd of January I saw the prisoner coming from Mr. Parson's premises—I asked what he had got in his pocket—he said, "Shop things"—I said, "I must see"—he put his hand into his pocket and pulled out a few oats, which he said he had bought for his rabbits—I asked where—he said that was his busi<lb></lb>ness, not mine—he would not tell me—I took the oats from him, and compared them with the oats at Mr. Parson's, and they corresponded ex<lb></lb>actly—there was 20 1/4 lbs of them.</p>

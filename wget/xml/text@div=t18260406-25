On the 25th of February, about seven o'clock in the morning, I was called up by the servant girl - it was day-light - I found the back parlour cupboard broken open, and missed ten or twelve bottles of Port and Madeira wine; I also lost a blue great coat, a pair of trousers, a waistcoat, a table-cover, four table-cloths, two pairs of shoes, a pair of boots, four silver tea-spoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, a silver pepper-castor, two table-spoons, and other things - they were worth full 10l.; the boots were worn by my son - I provide him with clothes. I found the hasp of the back kitchen window (which looks to the river side) was broken, and the window open - it was highwater, and the tide then comes nearly up to my house.</p>

I got up first in the morning, about half-past six o'clock - it was just the dawn of morning; on going into the front parlour, which I occupy, I found the cupboard door open. I lost a silver sugar-basin, and a writing-desk, containing eight sovereigns and papers, a pelisse, and two pairs of boots. I saw the boots and the pelisse at the Thames Police Office the same morning.</p>

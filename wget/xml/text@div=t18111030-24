Last Sunday morning the 26th of October, I got up and came down stairs, I opened the staircase door and there I saw Carter lying close to the door by the side of the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before. - A. No. I saw a bundle tied up laying over him on the counter, I reached over my hand and felt that they were halfpence in the bundle. Then I examined the doors, I found the door was unbolted and upon the single lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he asleep all the time. - A. Apparently so to me; he did not move any. I then opened the door he got up and ran out, he frightened me at first, but I saw a paper of halfpence drop out of his pocket, which knew to be my master's, I had tied them up in a paper the over night and knew the paper, I went and stopped him, he struggled and tried to beat me, I brought him back to my masters door, I rang masters bell, he came down stairs, I gave him in charge to my master. Afterwards I saw four silver spoons taken out of his pocket, and four five shilling papers of halfpence, I then saw nineteen shillings and sixpence in copper taken out of a hat and eight and sixpence in silver, two knives and a pair of scissars.</p>
               <p>RICE PRICE. I am a pork butcher, 78, Snow hill, in the parish of St. Sepulchre. On the night of the 26th of October, or rather half past six in the morning, I lay awake in my bed, all of a sudden I heard the cry of stop thief, I thought I knew the voice, I instantly got out of bed, I opened my back window to ascertain whether I knew it or not, I dressed myself and ran down stairs, and found the prisoner in the custody of my young man, I took him by the collar and looked at him, then I requested my young man to lay hold of him, I then went for an officer, the officer came with me an I searched him There was sound in his waistcoat pocket eight shillings and sixpence in silver, and loose copper two shillings and eightpence. In his coat pocket was found one pound in halfpence, four silver tea spoons, a pair of sugar tongs, a small knife and a pair of scissars.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had all these things been the over night. - A. The tea spoons and sugar tongs were in the parlour, he took an apron into the shop, broke open a small desk, the contents of the desk were eight pound ten shillings in copper done up in papers, and eight shillings and sixpence in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the man. - A. I have seen him before up and down Snowhill. My house is situated at the corner of Cock court, on examining the premises we went up the court, and found the wall was marked with chalk, the wall is about twelve feet high, on the top of the wall glass bottles were placed in mortar, it appeared as if he had got up that wall, and by the marks on the parapet wall, he had walked backwards and forwards once each way, inside there is a shed, he got down the wall on to the shed, he could get down by the tiling into a small yard that adjoins my house, In the yard there are two sash windows that goes into the parlour, he pushed up the sash, got into the house, and opened the bolt of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that window was down when you went to bed. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing how he came there. - A. He never uttered a word. There were a knife and a nail found upon him, the marks we found on the two tea caddies and the desk, he could not well break the lock of the till, he cut a hole in the counter and pushed the bolt of the lock back.</p>

I received information from Ann Burcher about the prisoner—she showed me a counterfeit shilling—she made some charge against the prisoner, but I could not understand it at the time—my officer took the prisoner's number, and told him to proceed—I took him as he came back—I found a good deal of good money on him—when he was first charged he made some reply, but I could not understand it; it was about these persons being about to utter it to him—I received this counterfeit shilling from Ann Burcher, and this other from Caroline Burcher.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 38, Blair Street, Bromley, and am clerk to George James Watts, sawmill proprietor, the prisoner's brother—I have known the prisoner for these fifteen years, he was employed by Mr. Watts up to about three months since—on Monday afternoon, 15th November, as I was leaving the premises, I saw the prisoner at the entrance gates coming into the office—the moment he saw me be drew a revolver from his coat pocket, and presented it at me, within about two yards—I immediately closed with him, and held him, and shouted for assistance, and a friend and Mr. Watts, the prisoner's brother came to my assistance—I held him till I was told he was safe—I had my arms round him—he struggled very hard with me, and said, "D—you, I will do for you," and struck me three or four times, and he picked up an iron bar, and attempted to strike me with that—it was taken from him—I did not strike him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the pistol—it is a six-chamber revolver.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 454). This pistol was handed to me at the station by Mr. Watts, the prisoner's brother—I examined it, the six barrels were loaded—I took it to a gunsmith, and saw him unload it—I produce the cartridges it was loaded with—the prisoner said he had no intention of shooting the man or doing him any harm, he meant to shoot himself, but the pistol would not go off—he said he would allow me to shoot at him to try it, if I wished; he was confident it would not go off—the pistol does not require a cap, the cap is inside the cartridge—there are all the three materials; cap, powder, and ball—there is a little thing that goes up outside the barrel, and serves the place of a cap, that goes down into the cap and explodes.</p>

               <p>say how—Aldridge had him with his arms pinioned—I did not see how he held the pistol before his arms were pinioned—I did not see him present it at Aldridge—I separated them—directly the pistol was taken away from the prisoner, Aldridge released him—the pistol was thrown on the ground, and was afterwards picked up and given to me by one of our men, named Brooks—it was loaded—a boy picked it up and gave it to Brooks, and he gave it to me within two or three minutes—I have heard the prisoner threaten to shoot persons before this—I would rather not be asked any questions about it.</p>

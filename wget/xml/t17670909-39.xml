On the 13th of August the prisoner brought part of a crown-piece ladle to sell; he said he had found it by Jewin-street; I said, if you will go near the Half-moon, you will find the person that lost it; I did this, expecting I should discover whether the things were stolen from thence; he, as I expected, ran<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176709090036"></xptr> away; we pursued him, he was brought back; and when we charged him, he owned he had taken a quarter guinea out of the bottom of the ladle, and paid it away; when he found he was to be searched, he owned they were Mr. Thomas's property.</p>

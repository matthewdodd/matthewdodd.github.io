             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Compton, a sugar-baker, in Brewers-lane; there were six of us in company; going home to Mr. Compton's, the deceased, Schultz, was running before me; we were all upon the foot pavement. I saw a woman with a lantern in her hand, crossing the way, and a girl about eight years old with her. Hardwicke lifted up her petticoats behind with his hand.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. My Lord, we shall prove that woman and child, are the wife and daughter of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Hageman. After the woman had crossed over, she walked an hundred yards, and then the prisoner overtook us. She pointed to Hardwick, and said this is the young man that laid hold of my gown. The prisoner crossed over to Hardwicke, and asked him what business he had to meddle with the woman's gown. Hardwicke made no answer. Kello came up and said to this Lieutenant, Sir, I am your prisoner; I will go with you where you like. I went home, and saw nothing more of the matter.</p>
               <p>When he challenged Hardwicke for meddling with the woman's gown, did Hardwicke make no answer? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see Hardwicke do any thing to the Lieutenant? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see the Lieutenant do any thing to Hardwicke? - The Lieutenant took him by the neck, and pulled his hat off.</p>
               <p>Do you know where Hardwicke, Kello, and Schultz had been that night? - I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Were they sober? - Hardwicke was drunk.</p>
               <p>How was Schultz? - I can't tell. I had not been in company with him before that night.</p>

               <p>Do you know whether Hardwicke was sober? - I can't tell whether he was not a little in liquor.</p>
               <p>Did you see Hardwicke meddle with a woman's petticoat? - I did not see it; the prisoner walked along side us, between Bell-dock and Wapping church. I saw nothing of the prisoner till he came and put the hanger upon my breast; he did not speak at all to me. I said to him I am your prisoner, and will go where you please. He thrust the hanger through my clothes, and just wounded me in the breast.</p>

Schultz laid hold of the point of the sword; the prisoner had hold of the handle; they struggled a little, and then I laid hold of the hanger.</p>
               <p>Had Schultz any stick in his hand? - No. Then I took the hanger from the Lieutenant.</p>
               <p>Had the deceased been wounded at the time you took the hanger from the Lieutenant? - I did not see whether he was wounded or not.</p>
               <p>Do you know what became of the hanger after you took it from the Lieutenant? - No; I do not. The Lieutenant went to a publick house afterwards; I don't know the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090068"></xptr> sign; I followed him. I heard soon after that Schultz was wounded.</p>
               <p>Was the Lieutenant wounded too? - He was cut in his hand.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Whether you or any of your company had sticks in their hands? - I had a stick, and another had a stick.</p>
               <p>Did you beat the Lieutenant with the sticks? - Nobody used the sticks before Schultz and the Lieutenant were together, then somebody beat the Lieutenant.</p>
               <p>Did you see a woman and a girl with a candle and lantern? - No.</p>
               <p>Was not the Lieutenant on the opposite side of the way you was walking on? - The Lieutenant was on the side of the way; we were walking in the middle of the street.</p>
               <p>Was the deceased with you in the middle of the street? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Jury. How do you imagine the Lieutenant got wounded? - I can't tell which way he was wounded.</p>

               <p>Can you tell from whom you received the blow? - No. While I was looking for my hat the rest of the company walked on. When I got up to them Schultz was wounded .</p>

            ; he said, if you don't go along with me I will draw my sword and stab you, or run you through. They struggled then from the Bell alehouse door, till they got between a brazier's and tin shop; which I believe may be about nine or ten yards. One of the three men, but which I can't say, had a stick, he hit the Lieutenant on his back, while Frederick and he were struggling.</p>
               <p>Where was the Lieutenant's wife all the time? - She was hanging round his neck in the highway when the blow was given him.</p>

               <p>Was the sword drawn before the Lieutenant was struck? - Not as I know of. I did not see it.</p>
               <p>How long was it after they had beat the Lieutenant with the stick, that you heard somebody cry out, stop him, stop him? - I believe in about five or six minutes; they cried stop him, stop him, the young man is dead<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090069"></xptr> in the tin shop. The Lieutenant went into the ale-house.</p>
               <p>Had he a sword in his hand then? - I could not see. There was a great mob, and I had my oysters on my head. I sell oysters.</p>
               <p>Court to the Counsel for the Prisoner. Do you mean to make this less than manslaughter?</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. No, my Lord, we cannot make it less than manslaughter. The Lieutenant was used very ill while his wife was hanging round his neck to prevent any further fighting. She was cut across her neck, and the Lieutenant had his hand and his coat cut in two places, and was beat all over his arms and shoulders.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 11th of June did you expect a box in town? - I did; I went to the White Bear, Basinghall-street, in going up Snow-hill I discovered a man with a couple of mackerel on a string, in his right hand; l asked him to be so kind as to direct me the road to Basinghall-street; he told me he lived very near it, and desired me to go along with him; I did not tell him I was going to the White Bear; when I got to a Church-yard, I desired him to direct me, I did not want him to go with me any further, but he went with me; he then asked me what part of Basinghall street I was going to? I told him to the White Bear; he then told me he was not got to the place where he lived, and he went with me to the inn-yard, I thanked him, and told him I was sorry I had been so troublesome, he told me he would go up the yard with me; I asked for my box of William Baker, the book-keeper.</p>

He told me that was the stand for coaches, and there was no coach there; he says, I will leave my mackerel at the corner here; then he said, be so good as to go in and take a glass; I told him it was what I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in? - No, he did, and left the mackerel there; he came out to me, and took me up a passage close by the door, and I see the kitchen, and he took me through a great many more alleys, till he took me into Smithfield; as we were going along I told him I was very sorry there were no coaches nearer; he said there were no coaches allowed to stand in the City, they stopped up the gateways; I went along, he told me that the goods were conveyed in coaches to the lower part of the City, and then took into carts; he asked me if I was not a Yorkshire woman? I told him I was brought up in the city of York. I then went into Smithfield, and he said, look here is a coach. There was one coach and only one that was on the stand at that time; he went along till we came to a narrow passage, and then he went against the wall, as though he was going to make water, and told me to go to the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the coach? - I did, and I waited ten minutes for him, and he did not come, and I told the man to drive me to the White Bear, Basinghall-street; I thought he did not want any more trouble with me.</p>

Between eight and nine in the evening. on Thursday, the 11th of June, I locked Mr. Brookes's stables, I was going into this yard, and I met that man, the prisoner at the bar, with the box under his arms, and I asked him if he wanted a porter? he was within two yards of the street, he had pitched the box on the end facing the tap room door; I told him the box was heavy and would give him a sweat if he intended to carry it without a knot; with that he takes the box up, I told him I would thank any person to give me a lift, and that I was a porter; I did lift it on his shoulder; he said he was going no further than Aldersgate-street; he went through Church-alley, and there I lost fight of him. About a quarter of an hour after, I cannot say to a few minutes, the woman came and asked for the box, and then Mr. Jackson said the man had been there and had got the box.

Do you know the person that left it? - The prisoner at the bar is the man; he put the box on the table and called for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010163"></xptr>a pint of beer; he said he wanted to leave it there for half an hour; I told him if he would fetch it away in about half an hour he might leave it. Presently I heard a noise, and I called to them below, I thought it was like knocking. The prisoner had broke the box open, and that was the noise that I heard. I presently went into the tap room, and I see the box open, and some things laying on the table, white hose, whether they were womens or mens I cannot say. I told the prisoner I thought it was a pity that he could not get the box open without splitting the lid. He said it was split by coming up in the waggon out of the country. He then wanted to leave it with me open as it was; I told him I could not be answerable for people coming into my house.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever see the man before? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is very odd to let a man leave a box there? - It is what we are very liable to in a public house. Three watchmen came in and corded it up with a cord, just on the hour of nine, and one of them left it in the parlour.</p>

            Who did you deliver the box to? - To nobody at all; it has been in my custody ever since, by order of the alderman; and I am certain this is the box, and this the box that I asked him if he could not open without breaking.</p>

            And you was at Mrs. Woodland's this night? - Yes. This is the box, and that is the man, I believe. I had been there some time, the prisoner had an handkerchief open at the side of the seat, there was something in it, but what I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the box? - Open. Whether he took any thing out of the box I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him put any thing into the handkerchief? - No, he asked me to cord the box, and I did, and afterwards he asked me what it would cost for a coach to go to John-street, Oxford-road; and then he called for a pint of beer, drank it, and he tied up the handkerchief, and went away, and I see nothing of him any more till I see him in Bridge-street, as I was on my beat, I see him go along; he asked the landlady to let the box stay there half an hour, and she consented, and she locked the door, and he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. You went away to your beat? - Yes, the corner of Tudor-street.</p>
               <p>Q. He knew you was a watchman? - Certainly he did by my coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other watchman there? - I am not certain whether they were or not. Before I carried it up I was untying the cords, and he said cut the knots off; and I said, if you out all the knots off it will be too short.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not this create a suspicion in your mind seeing a man uncord the box? - I did not see it broke, it was broke before I was in.</p>
               <p>Court. Next time you see a man with a box open, ask him how he came by it.</p>

            How many mackerel? - Two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing? - He called for a glass of porter, and he turned round and asked me for the mackerel that he left there the evening before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him? - No. I told him I did not know of any mackerel, but I would enquire of my wife; he said he would call again in half an hour; I then told him the circumstance, and he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. That is my box.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the contents? - No. I lived in Yorkshire, and there is the direction of Hulme on it; I have an uncle there. Here is a letter in it that I have never seen before, from a cousin, in Yorkshire. Here is besides, a key in the letter that opens the box. My gown is gone.</p>

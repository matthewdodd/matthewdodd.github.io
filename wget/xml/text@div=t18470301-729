                  </hi>. I am barman at the Fox and Peacock, Gray's Inn-lane. On the 15th of Feb., about half-past twelve o'clock at night, the prisoner came into the house—he was drunk and disorderly—he called for a pot of beer—I refused to serve him—he said he would be served—I told him he should not—my master told me to go round and put him out—I did so—when he got outside he struck at me, and attempted to come in again—I put out my hand to guard off a blow, which caused him to fall—I never touched him—I went into the house and shut the door, leaving him outside—about five minutes afterwards my master told me to go out and put up the shutters—I went out for that purpose—I had a stick with me with a ring to it to raise up the shutters out of a slide—it is an instrument which I usually had for that purpose—when I got out the prisoner was on the opposite side of the road—I was going to put up the shutters—he came across towards me—I put down the stick—he struck at me—I guarded the blow off with the stick—I never touched him—I put the stick away inside the front door, then went to him and told him—to go away—he said he would not, took me by the collar, and threw me down—we both fell together—I was undermost—after I was down I received a kick on the elbow from the prisoner—he had boots or shoes on, I cannot say which—I felt at once as if my arm was broken—I am sure that was caused by the kick—I felt it directly—I was taken to a surgeon, and the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

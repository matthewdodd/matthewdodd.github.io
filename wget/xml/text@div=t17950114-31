               <p>Q. With you? - Yes, as a person employed about the yard.</p>
               <p>Q.What happened on the 3d of December? - Between five and six o'clock in the evening, I observed the prisoner to come out of the store cellar with a pail nearly full of beer; I asked him what he meant to do with it? and when he saw me he attempted to run away, however, I took him, and asked him what he meant to do with that beer? he said it was for himself and the rest of the servants to drink; he made me no other answer; I told him he had no right to go there for beer, there was good beer allowed, small beer and porter mixed; he said it was wrong; says I, come along with me to the counting house, and hear what the manager will say to you; and he followed me down with the pail in his hand, and the manager sent for a constable.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179501140052"></xptr>Q. Was the cellar out of which he took this small matter of beer open? - It was open at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What is contained in it? - Porter after being brewed.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it porter fresh brewed or fit for sale? - It was fresh, it was but young mild porter; we were doing some repairs to the shop of the cellar and consequently did not lock it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the beer that was allowed? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a character does this man bear? - I had nothing against this man before.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you give him a good scolding, or dismiss him? It is hardly worth while to ruin a man by bringing of him here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. He liked a little porter better than small beer, and it was for himself and the men to drink.</p>

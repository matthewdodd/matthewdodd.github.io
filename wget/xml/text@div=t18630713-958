                  </hi>. I am a furniture-dealer in the Waterloo-road—on Saturday night, 13th June, about 11 o'clock, I went into my house and closed the door—I went over the premises to see that all was fast, and went down stairs—after I had been there a short time I heard some noise, and came up and saw the prisoner with an easy chair in his hands—he had removed it—there was a light in the shop—the shop door had been opened—when the prisoner saw me he immediately turned his back and ran out of the shop—I think he was sober.</p>

I saw the prisoner running at the top of his speed, and last witness crying "Stop thief!"—I pursued the prisoner—he stumbled and fell, and I caught him—when I told him the charge he pretended to be drunk, but he was not—he gave his address 15, Phoenix-court, Whitechapel—I went to inquire, but there was no such place.</p>

I passed in and was in the act of taking a light when the witness came up the stairs and accused me of being there for an unlawful purpose; and not wishing to be taken, I ran away.</p>

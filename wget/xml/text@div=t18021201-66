             sworn. - On Thursday the 4th of November, between eight and nine o'clock, I was in Wentworth street, with Mason and Vickery, and saw the prisoner pass us with a basket over his shoulder; I followed him; he went into a huckester's shop, and put it down by the side of the counter, and went into a room adjoining the shop; a little girl was serving, and I said, loud enough for the man to hear, what is in that basket the man has got? the prisoner said directly, it was tobacco; I said I should take him and his tobacco too; I asked him who he had it of; he said a man gave it him, but did not know his name, or where he lived, or where he was to be found: I asked him what he was going to do with it there; he said to fell it, and he was to be allowed something for selling it; he was taken to the Office, and committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. He answered you very readily? - A. Very.</p>
               <p> - VICKERY sworn. - I heard the prisoner say, on being asked how many times he had been to the house before with tobacco, that it did not signify, for that justice had overtaken him at last; I asked him how much a pound he was to have for it; he said two shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You have a good deal of business? - A. Yes; I have several cases to attend, but the words struck me, and I have them steady in my mind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am innocent, and leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18021201-66-verdict362" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, P</hi> 5). About a quarter to 1, on the morning of 20th January, I saw at the back of the house No. 3, St. John's-road, Brixton, which is occupied by Mr. John Feltoe, a light at the back-kitchen window, outside; it flickered, then it disappeared, and then re<lb></lb>appeared—I heard something like the breaking of glass, and then the light disappeared—I looked, and saw Hanson come on to the lawn at the back of the house, and I placed two constables, Rose and Phillips, at the back of the premises, and went for further assistance—on my return Rose and I dropped a fifteen-foot wall together—he took hold of Hanson, and I took up these two life-preservers at his feet—I did not hear Hanson say anything; he was on his knees—he had no shoes, stockings, coat, handkerchief, or cap on—I found two pairs of boots close behind where he was kneeling—I saw Manley about three minutes after that—he was taken from the back-kitchen window—the prisoners were taken to the station—I came back for the boots, took them to the station, and the prisoners owned them, and put them on—I examined the house—the kitchen window had been pushed up, and this iron bar (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) forcibly pulled out.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, P</hi> 110). I was with Smith; I saw and took Hanson—I caught hold of him by the hair of his head—he said, "Don't hurt me; let me put my boots on"—I caught him by the hair of his head, because he had no hat on, and it was the best place to hold him by—he had no jacket or coat on—immediately afterwards I heard Manley call out, "Here is another one, sir," and he was apprehended by Phillips—I took Hanson to the station, and found on him these gloves, this knife, and some lucifer matches—he made no remark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was Smith with you at the time you took Hanson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he was close by me; we dropped off the wall together—Hanson was kneeling down under a porch which comes out from the drawing-room window—Hanson asked me for his boots—I do not think Smith heard that,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186402010119"></xptr>
               <p>because the alarm was given for the men to look out in front—I think he was hallooing out to those in front—it would not have been impossible to have taken Hanson by the waistcoat, but I was anxious that he should not get away.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, P</hi> 228). I took Manley—he was lying behind a shrub, under the verandah, with no shoes or boots on—I searched him at the station, and found in his possession this chisel, a gimlet, a screw<lb></lb>driver, a knife, a centre-bit, a pair of gloves, a handkerchief, and some lucifers—these are instruments which are used in housebreaking—the knife had been recently used—the window-catch was examined by the inspector.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is that centre-bit complete? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but you can use it without the other part—it would go into a nine-inch wall, pretty well—I did not hear the prisoners ask leave to put their boots on.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Although that is not a complete instrument as it is used by carpenters, is it complete enough for the purpose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it is complete for practical purposes.</p>

I reside at No. 3, St. John's-road, Brixton—on the morn<lb></lb>ing of 20th January, about 1 o'clock, I was disturbed by hearing a noise—I came down stairs, and found the prisoners in custody—I found the back-kitchen window open, and this bar broken away—the window was closed when I went to bed, and the bar was there—this is one of the two bars which were outside the window—the ends were fixed in the wall by screws, and it was forced out without being unscrewed—there was a common hasp to the kitchen window—this knife is sufficiently thin to pass through the Bashes, and force back the hasp.</p>

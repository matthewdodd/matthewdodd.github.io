On the last night about six o'clock, one of my apprentices came and informed me, and said there was a coat hanging up across the place, with a bit of something of brass in it; I said, say nothing about it, till he leaves work, and see if he takes it away with him; I sent for a constable to be ready if he should take it away with him, to stop him when he went out, he was brought back again by the constable to my counting house; the prisoner was my journeyman.</p>
               <p>Q. At what o'clock was this? - After seven when they have done work, and he was going away in the evening, he brought him back to my counting house, there was this bit of copper found on him, it was in his pocket, wrapped up in a handkerchief, it was a piece of copper bolt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take it from him? - No, he pulled it out himself, the constable took it into his possession, I asked him his reason why he should go to rob me of it? he said he only took it for a friend, to make a soldering iron of, he did not think any harm of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed any other property of late? - I cannot say that I have, there is such quantities of copper laying about, it is impossible.</p>

I saw the constable bring him back, and he pulled it out of his pocket himself, it was wrapped in a hit of rag, or handkerchief, and the constable took it, he has it in his possession now, and he took him to the Poultry Compter.</p>

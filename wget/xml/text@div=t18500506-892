                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Finsbury-terrace. On 5th April I found the prisoner in the room where I see patients—he said he wished to bring a young friend to consult me in the evening, and wished to know what time I should be at home, and what my charge was—I said I should be at home all the evening, and he appointed to come about eight o'clock—as he was leaving, I said I wished to speak to him, as a person had called on a friend of mine, a medical man, Mr. James, a short time before, and had gone away and taken some books with him—he was rather indignant, and I offered to go with him to Mr. James—he said he would be most happy to go—as I was putting on my coat, he said, "For God's sake don't take me there? I am the person who took the books"—I sent for a policeman.</p>

On 7th March the prisoner came, and was shown into my consulting-room, he said he wished to bring a young friend in the evening, and wished to make an appoint<lb></lb>ment—he asked the charge, and said he wished it kept secret as it was a private complaint—he made an appointment for the evening—he was in the room ten minutes before I went in—after he was gone, I missed some books from the cheffonier—I looked out, but could not see him—I informed Mr. Courtney.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>, 256 T). I am stationed at Uxbridge—on 24th June I saw the prisoner early in the morning—the first time I saw him was about ten minutes past one; he was then about fifty yards from Mr. Durrant's gate—I passed him on the footpath with two other men—I met them again at quarter past two on the canal bridge—when I came upon the bridge I saw them standing at the foot of the bridge near a wall, with a copper on the wall—as soon as they saw me, one of them pushed the copper over into the gardens down below—there were three men there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186007090042"></xptr>
               <p>then—as soon as the copper was pushed over, the prisoner came up to me—I said, "Good morning;" he said, "Good morning"—he leant over the bridge close by me—the other two persons then came up—the prisoner stopped there about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—he then went down and washed his face and hands in the water—the other persons went towards a public-house—as soon as the prisoner had washed himself he went down to a passage that leads from the road to the footpath by the canal, there the other two came to him and spoke to him—as soon as I saw that I went into the gas-house—there was a man named King there, and I asked him to come out on the bridge to me—he came out, and I told him to mind the copper while I took the prisoner into custody—I went down to the canal, and as soon as he saw me he walked away; when he got near the bridge I walked up to him and took him in custody—as soon as the other men saw me they tried to get away through a doorway—I said, "It is no use trying to get away, I know you all three"—the prisoner said to me, "What are you going to take me in custody for?"—I said, "For stealing that copper you threw over the wall"—he said, "Then I am b—if you shall take me"—I drew my staff as the others were coming up, and he then said he would go quietly with me—I fetched the copper after<lb></lb>wards—I saw it safe at a quarter past one at Mr. Durrant's premises—I afterwards went into the garden and found three different impressions of foot-marks—they came over a wall down a low greenhouse into the garden—I went back to the station, got the prisoner's boot, compared it with the foot-marks and found it to correspond exactly—that was about a quarter past three; about two hours from the time I first saw him—I did not know that he worked for Mr. Durrant—Mr. Durrant is here.</p>

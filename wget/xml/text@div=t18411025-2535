                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Street—we live at Enfield-Wash. My son was brought here, on the 17th of May, on a charge of assaulting a girl—I came to town about it several times—on the 22nd of May I was at the George public-house, Old Bailey, and was inquiring there for Mr. Phillips—I saw the defendant there—he heard me inquiring for Mr. Phillips, and asked me what I was inquiring for—I told him I had a son in trouble, and wished to know if I could see Mr. Phillips, to see him righted, to get him out as soon as I could, to get him through when the trial should come on—he told me he was clerk to Mr. Phillips, and that he would visit my son, that every thing would be right—I said I was nothing but a poor woman, and asked what he would charge me for seeing my son righted—he said Mr. Phillips could not do it under three guineas—those were the words he said to me—we were talking some time together in the room about one thing or another—I said I had not got all the money, I could give him but 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I gave him—he gave me a paper for it—I said I would be up again as soon as I could, and make the money up—here is the receipt he gave me—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"The Queen against Wil<lb></lb>liam Street. 1841. 22nd May. Received of Mrs. Street 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account of this defence. <hi rend="smallCaps">W. S. HENSON</hi>."—I saw him again about the 12th of June, at the George, a few days before the Sessions—he shook hands with me as soon as he saw me, and said, "Good morning, how do you do, Mrs. Smith?"—he said, "I have seen your son, I have been and visited him"—I said, "Have you?"—he said, "Oh yes, it is all right, and Mr. Phillips is going to plead for him"—he said he should go and visit my son that day, and tell him he had seen his mother—nothing was done that day—I was obliged to wait till Friday, to send a donkey to Smithfield, to sell to get the money—I got this second paper from him—I saw him write it on the day it is dated—I paid him all the money—I cannot read very well—the next sum I paid the defendant was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was paid by instalments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did any thing else pass about your son, when you paid him the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said he was quite convinced Mr. Phillips would see my son righted, and I should have my son home with me, I might depend on it—I was present when my son was tried—he had no counsel—he was tried on Sa<lb></lb>turday afternoon (he was brought up on the Monday morning again) I was here looking for Mr. Henson—he was not to be found—I never saw him after I paid him the last money till this morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you were in great grief and vexation that your son had nobody to defend him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I thought it very hard, after sacrificing all our things to raise the money—it has been a great expense to us—I saw a short person, (Samuel Wiggins,) on the sub<lb></lb>ject—I saw him first, and he told me, after the money was paid, that he was afraid Mr. Henson was not doing right by me, and I should be out of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who first sent you into the George public-house to inquire for Mr. Phillips? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were a parcel of people standing about—I was a countrywoman not acquainted with town—I wished to know where Mr. Phillips lived, and was told in Chancery-lane—I was told that at the George—it was not the landlord that I asked where Mr. Phillips lived—Mr. Wiggins told me where he lived, and we went to Chancery-lane, and he was not at home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe afterwards Wiggins introduced you to Henson as the person who would do your business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not exactly—he did not say Henson was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184110250007"></xptr>
               <p>an attorney, who could defend prisoners—Mr. Henson told me himself he was an attorney who could conduct the defence, and said he should want some money to get a copy of the depositions from Mr. Sawyer, of Enfield—he wanted the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for them—he delivered me a letter as the at<lb></lb>torney for the prisoner, to Mr. Sawyer, which I saw him write—I took it to Mr. Sawyer myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The remainder of the money was to prepare a brief, and deliver it to my learned friend? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he told me with his own mouth Mr. Phillips was going to plead for my son—he did get a copy of the depositions—I cannot say whether he prepared a brief—I saw a brief—before the brief was prepared, Mr. Henson read over the depositions to me at the George—he went to see my son two or three times at Newgate, I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not Mr. Henson who said, when he was brought to you by Wiggins, that he was an attorney, that he would defend your son, and after<lb></lb>wards tell you he had given a brief to Mr. Phillips? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and that he had employed Mr. Phillips—I am sure he said he had employed Mr. Phillips, and that Mr. Phillips would certainly see my son righted—I have never been before any Magistrate about this—Mr. Henson had no opportunity of knowing what I should say to-day—my sister has seen Mr. Henson—I authorized her to say if he would return my money again, I would not proceed in it—I never said I would settle it if Mr. Henson would give me back 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—nor authorize my sister to say so—Mr. Henson told her he was going into the country for a little money, and if she would wait till he came back, he would come to Enfield to return the counsel's fee to me—he said he knew very well he had done a thing that was very wrong, and he was very sorry for it—he said so to my sister, who is here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RYLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it correct that he said he was Mr. Phillips's clerk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he certainly said that, I am quite sure of it—he said so the first time I saw him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had anybody spoken to you about counsel on the outside? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it was not Wiggins who spoke about being clerk to Mr. Phillips—Wiggins said he did not know any thing about Henson being clerk to Mr. Phillips—he did not tell me Henson was an attorney, he told me so himself, as soon as I saw him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RYLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did Henson tell you he was clerk to Mr. Phillips? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Up at the George public-house, the first time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did he say he was an attorney? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first time, at least he said he was clerk to Mr. Phillips—not that he was an attorney—he did not use the expression, "I am an attorney," at all—he told me he should give Mr. Phillips the money, and he would see my son righted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did he say he was an attorney? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said it the day I was at the George—he said he was clerk to Mr. Phillips—he said once at the George that he was an attorney—he said he was an attorney, and that he was clerk to Mr. C. Phillips—I am sure he used the word clerk—he did not say he should act as clerk—I should not have parted with my money, on his saying he was an attorney, without his adding that he was clerk to Mr. Phillips—it gave me great comfort his saying he was clerk to Mr. Phillips, because I thought it was quite right.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Give us his words as near as you can? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I asked him what the expense would be, and he told me—I said I had come to see who she paid the money to, as I had been duped by a party before, and wished to see if she was paying it to any body who would defend the boy—he said if he took it by false pretences he should be taken off the rolls—he said he worked, or done business for Mr. Phillips, as well as Mr. Clarkson—he did not say in my presence that he was clerk to Mr. Phil<lb></lb>lips —he said the expense would be three guineas.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">HORRY, ESQ</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in any way retained as counsel in the case of William Street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had a brief brought to me on the Friday morning before the man was tried, which was on the Saturday, the following day—there was no fee paid with the brief—I cannot recollect whether I had been spoken to before about defending the prisoner—I have a memorandum that I had the brief delivered to me on the Friday morning—I did not put my initials to the paper on the first day of the Session—I put them on the Saturday morning—I did not pro<lb></lb>mise the person who delivered me the brief that I would attend to the case—when the brief was delivered to me by a person who I never saw before, he said that Mr. Henson would call on me in a short time—I waited for his seeing me, and on Saturday morning, as I did not see him, I sent a mes<lb></lb>sage, and came down here at nine o'clock—then being particularly required to go away I put my initials to the paper in case anything should be said about the case, but between nine and ten something occurred which led me to return and strike my initials out—on previous occasions I have had briefs from Mr. Henson, and have had the fee paid afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any professional objection to your saying why you struck your initial out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will state it—between nine and ten o'clock I un<lb></lb>derstood that the prisoner had been brought to the bar the night before, or some time before, and had stated that Mr. Phillips was his counsel, and I said under those circumstances I could not hold a brief of a case in which another gentleman's name was mentioned, I should therefore decline hold<lb></lb>ing it, and I sent a message by a person to that effect—I have never seen Mr. Henson on the subject—I received an answer from him through two parties I saw in this Court—Wiggins was not one of them—I have no<lb></lb>thing to do with Wiggins at all—the answer I received was that Mr. Henson was very ill in bed, but would endeavour to attend—the message I sent was that I must see him, and that was the answer I received on two occasions—I received no fee—the fee marked was one guinea.</p>

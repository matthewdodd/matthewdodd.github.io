               <p>the 11th of April, I was at the Union Coffee-house in Bow-street—I got there between eleven and twelve o'clock at night—I went up stairs into the coffee-room, or supper-room or wine-room—I had a pint of wine—I might stop an hour and a half—while I was drinking my first pint of wine, two young women came in—one I had never seen before; the other I had a kind of passing acquaintance with—she asked me for a glass of wine, which I gave her—she then said, "Will you give my companion or friend a glass?"—I said there was not enough left and I called for another pint—I laid doen a sovereign to a man who I supposed to be master of the ceemonies in the house, from his large pockets—I gave him the sovereign—he was called Ralph Phillips—I waited nearly an hour and a half in the room and he did not bring the change—at last he came back, and said there was no change in the house—I said, "You have brought no change back to me"—I never got the change—I went down to the bar and the two young women accompanied me—I remonstrated with the landlord of the two young as I supposed—I cannot be positive whether the prisoner was present.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you take any thing to drink at the bar in consequence of what the landlord said to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I took some of his nasty drug—I went down there much soberer than I am now—I had taken nothing but the sovereign from my pocket, before I went to the bar—I afterwards pro<lb></lb>duced a £5 note and two sovereigns—they would not let me out because I would not pay for the former pint of wine as the vagabond waiter had run away with the sovereign—I told the landlord what had passed about the soverign and produced from my job a £5 note and two sovereigns—I then drank a glass of negus and in that was laudanum or some kind of drug—I know the corner the vagabond produced it from—I wanted to pay and all that and he could drive me to Richmond—he said, "Mr. Brown, I will not deceive you I am not going to sacrifice the honour of my house," and all that, and he gave me a glass of negus, and that completely stupi<lb></lb>fied me—I had a five-pound note when I went into the house; I have my memorandum-book to show it—it was, "No.13078, dated the 23rd of February"—I do not know how I got home—the glass of negus the fellow mixed up, made me stupid I was in a state of stupor all the next day and had a medical man to attend me—I went to the Bank of England, and stopped the note on the Monday—I went to the Union again about a forthnight afterwards, and did not remark the prisoner there—I had no<lb></lb>thing to do with him—the note, through inattention or some bungling business of the Bank clerks, was not paid in for two or three months.</p>

I have been an undortunate girl, but am not so now—on Saturday, the 11th of April, I went to the Union coffee-house, Bow-strect—I knew nothing of the prosecutor—that was the first time I saw him—I was in company with Martha Stanley—I partook of some wine with the prosecutor—it was about one o'clock in the morning—the first pint of wine was paid for in silver—he called for a second, and gave a sovereign for it—I should know the person to whom he gave it; it was a person who acted as waiter there—he did not get his change in my presence; he called for it, and the waiter came, but he did not get his change; there was wrangling and quarrelling about it—I went down to the bar with Mr. Brown and my companion—I saw two or three persons there—the prisoner was one of them, but he is not the person who had the sovereign—he was in the bar below when we went down—I should not have thought that Brown had been drinking any thing when he went down to the bar—he ap<lb></lb>peared sober—he complained of the loss of his change—it was said that they could not give him change, and the sovereign had been returned to him, but I am sure it had not—he said he was determined not to go till he had got it—the person I was with and myself went to have some refresh<lb></lb>ment in the adjoining room—before I went there Brown produced some<lb></lb>thing, which I believe to be a bank-note and two sovereigns—he produced it on account of the dispute, as they thought he had had the sovereign—the landlord disputed that the waiter had not returned the sovereign, or that Mr. Brown had given the sovereign—he said he had settled a bill, and changed a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and had three sovereigns, and a £5 note when he came in, and produced his money, to show what he had then—I did not see him take any drink at the bar up to that time—he was afterwards coming out, and he was refused to be allowed to go out—I cannot say by whom—the pri<lb></lb>soner was there at the time, and the waiter to whom he had given the so<lb></lb>vereign—I heard him called Ralph—after the prosecutor produced the note and sovereigns, he put them back into some private pocket—I should say it was his fob—he had no drink at the bar at that time, to my knowledge—they would not let him go without paying for the pint of wine for which he had given the sovereign; they detained him—I do not know how, for I did not look—I went out—they were wrangling in the bar for not less than two or three hours I should think—it was during the time we were taking the refreshment—I left the house at day-break—Brown was there then—he was stopped at the door.</p>

I will not swear—I thought him a gentleman, and did not think it was a forged note—I remember Ballard coming over to search the prisoner's premises—he told me what the prisoner was charged with—I never said that I knew nothing about it, or any thing of the sort—I do not know that I said any thing to him—I asked him what it was about—that I said any thing to him—I him—I did not say the man was innocent, and that I received the note, and wrote the man's name on it, and gave the change—I do not remember having any conversation with him further than He told me Lewis was charged with stealing a £5 note—I said I knew nothing about it, and asked him when it was, and he proceeded to search his boxes—I did not know it was Brown's £5 note he charged him with robbing—I was very much surprised—he said, "I do not want to search your house, Mr. Harris, I want to search Phillips's boxes"—he said, "I have got his key"—he went up-stairs with me—I know Mr. Noes, the attorney—he has not been concerned in this case, to my knowledge—I have not seen him upon it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the corn trade. In April last I had an account with Mr. Haris—I remember calling on him for payment—the date of the receipt will tell when—this is the receipt—to the best of my recollection it was on Monday I called—this is my writing—somebody announced to Harris that I was there—I was ordered to walk in—he said, "I cannot pay you, unless you give me change for a £5 note," which he produced—I said, "I will go and get change"—a person in company said, "Oh, I can give you change if you will take three pounds in silver"—I believe the prisoner is that person—I am convinced he is—Harris asked me if I would take the silver—I said Ihad no objection, and the prisoner pulled out a purse or bag, and produced the money—Harris paid me, and I went away—I think the silver was nearly all half-crowns—the prisoner took the £5 note, and he said, to the best of my reecollection, "I am going to the Savings' Bank; a £5 note is just the same to me."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at No. 21, Rathbone-place, Oxford-street. I remember on Monday evening, the 13th of April, taking a coat home to the Union, in Bow-street—I saw Goodenough there at the time; he called on Mr. Harris for the payment of a small account—I believe between 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Harris asked him if he had change for a £5 note—he said, "No"—the prisoner said he had got change, that he was going to pay money into the Savings' Bank; if he did not mind taking silver he would give him change—he gave him change, and received the note—Good-enough gave a receipt for the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, carrying on business at 65, Queen-street, Cheapside—on 20th November, about half-past 6, I was on Blackfriars-bridge, looking at the fire, which was then burning—I had this overcoat on, buttoned as it is now—I happened to look down, and found the lower button unbuttoned—I felt to see if my watch was safe, and then saw it in the hand of the prisoner—I immediately seized him, and called, "Stop thief"—the watch was withdrawn, and I saw the prisoner distinctly drop it down, exactly where he was when I seized him—a boy afterwards handed it to me—the watch was worth about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a detective came up, and I gave the prisoner into custody—I only called "Stop thief," in order that he might not get away—I never left go of him—the little ring of the watch is broken—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was broken at the top.</p>

            ; I was awake first, and I missed the prisoner out of the room, upon which then I alarmed my husband, and I found all my property gone; mentioned in the indictment; I was ill in bed, and before I had gone to sleep, I ordered her to go down and fasten the street door, and then she came up and locked my door, and then she says to me, do you go to sleep; I don't like you to be disturbed so; I awaked some time after, and found all the property gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she get out of the room? - I cannot tell, she must have unlocked the door to be sure, but I did not hear her, I am sure I heard her fasten them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it she locked the door? - About Twelve, near that way.</p>
               <p>Q. Who awaked first, you or your Husband. - I waked first, and waked my Husband; he was tired with his work, and I alarmed him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As to the street door there is no lock; and they say I was with her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150004"></xptr>but five weeks. I continued with her for seven weeks; and I ask'd her the liberty to let me wash me a few things; and as I had neither shawl nor cap, nor any thing to wear whilst I washed my own things, she lent me those things which I had on the while; and Mr. Palmer wanted me to comply with him, because, says he, I know you are a clean woman, and I will not let my wife know it; I would not consent to his compliance; so they have got this spite against me, and besides that, there was no bolt at all to the street door, and she says, she heard me bolt it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Palmer, there is a bolt, a latch and a lock.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Palmer. How was your room door fastened. - The door of my room was locked I am sure.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was no lock on the door, and Mr. Palmer came home nigh Twelve, and then I had got his supper to get, and more particularly I had the table cloth to wash, with my own things, as he was to have some company to come to dinner the next day; and Mrs. Palmer gave me an old shift, an old gauze cap, a pair of shoes, and other things, because she had not money to pay me. Now I have spoke nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Palmer. Is it true that being poor, and not having money to pay her, you gave her these things. - When she came to me she was distressed for her living. She never ask'd me one farthing, tho' I meant to pay her for her trouble; with respect to giving her my shift, or my shoes, then I must have gone without myself, for I had none other myself; I never gave the things to her; I had no other shoes but those the Prisoner took; and I was obliged to walk about my room two or three hours without a shoe, till a neighbour brought me a pair to put on.</p>

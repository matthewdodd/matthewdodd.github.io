                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, of 15, Addle-street—on the afternoon of 18th October, I was passing through Friday-street, within three or four yards of Mr. Lax ton's doorway, and saw the prisoner come out with this linsey (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—knowing the porter there for many years I went in, and in consequence of what was told roe I followed the prisoner—I overtook him at the corner of Gutter-lane, Cheapside, and told him him he most come back with me to the warehouse where he bad brought the goods from—he seemed quite astonished that I should stop him, and made some statement which I cannot now recollect—when I got him back to the warehouse he said a gentleman had given to him to carry—he did not say where—I saw him actually come out with it on his back.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How long have you been in your present employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Five years—I know the customs of the City very well—it is a common practice for men to obtain a living by carrying parcels from different warehouses if they are employed there, whether they are employed as porters or not—I did not see any person give you the linsey—I did not see you inside the warehouse; I saw you come out of the doorway—a person might have given you the linsey without my seeing it—when I stopped you you made no objection to returning to the warehouse—you went back willingly—I have seen lots of persons come out of warehouses with goods, but goods sent out are mostly tied up in paper; this was not—I have before this stopped a person with goods, and he had three months—that may be five or six years ago—my previous employment was with Mr. Garsyth—I left to better myself.</p>

I am manager to Richard Laxton and another—I was at the warehouse on 18th October, about a quarter to 5—the prisoner was brought in by the last witness, carrying this piece of linsey—we had two pieces of that colour, we have hut one now—I had seen the two pieces safe about 2 o'clock that day standing opposite the door, about four feet from it—I had not noticed them since—this is worth about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not know the prisoner—he had no authority to carry this—we never send out goods except in paper or canvas wrappers.</p>

            . I am a paper-hanger; I live at No. 8, Beech-street, Barbican. On the <rs id="t18140525-95-cd554" type="crimeDate">28th of April</rs>

I went with him from thence to the <placeName id="t18140525-95-crimeloc555">Black Horse, Petticoat-lane</placeName>

I bought a dozen of three-shilling tokens of him for a pound bank note. I put them in my pocket, and I kept them separate by themselves. I marked them before I parted with them. I delivered them to Mr. Westwood. These are the tokens; I am confident of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again - A. On the 30th, in the evening, I met him again at the Black Horse (the same house) by appointment. He asked me whether I wanted any more tokens; I said I did, I wanted another dozen. He said he would go and fetch them. He then left the public-house, and returned with them with one dozen. I gave him a pound note for them. Before I parted with them I marked them also. This was on Saturday evening. On Monday morning, nine o'clock, I waited on Mr. Westwood; I marked them, and delivered them into his possession.</p>
               <p>Q.Now look at these, and tell me whether these are the second parcel that you marked - A. These are the same.</p>

               <p>Q.Do you know Edmonds, the last witness - A. I do. On the 30th of April, I saw him in company of the prisoner; he was with him and three more. I brought the prisoner out of Petticoat-lane. I apprehended him in Whitechapel. The prisoner asked me if my name was not Dickons; I told him it was. I saw the prisoner and Edmonds twice together that day. I had been sitting there three hours, seeing them together, and I saw them together at eleven o'clock at night. I have no doubt of the person of the prisoner. I am sure he was in the company of Edmonds. He said, Dickons, you knew me when I was in Clerkenwell. I said, I knew you well. I left him in the watchhouse. I searched him, and only found on him a few good shillings.</p>

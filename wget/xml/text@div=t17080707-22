That the Deceas'd Swore by his Maker he would be reveng'd of him, and step'd up to the Prisoner and punch'd him with his Elbows; that the Prisoner retreated back, and the Deceas'd came after him; That the Prisoner bid the Deceas'd desist, or he would cut him with the Howel (he had in his Hand;) that the Deceas'd still persisting,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="17080707003"></xptr>the Prisoner did strike him on the Shoulder with the aforesaid Weapon, which occasion'd a large Wound, of which, according to the Opinion of Surgeons, and others, he Died.

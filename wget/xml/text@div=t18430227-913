                  </hi>. I live in Worm wood-street—Burke was my errand-boy—he was generally left in charge of my shop from one to two o'clock in the day, while the others went to dinner—on the 21st of Feb. I received infor<lb></lb>mation, and missed a bag and some hessian—this is the bag and the hessian—the mark is on it—it comes to us in this state—this is a foreign bag, and this is mine also—I found the bag and hessian about four o'clock the same afternoon, in the officer's hands—if it had been taken from my place between one and two o'clock, it could not have been taken without Burke's know<lb></lb>ledge, if he had done his duty—they were in the same part of my shop, but were separate.</p>

About two o'clock, on the 21st of Feb., I was at the top of Fore-street—a person pointed out Pitt to me, and said he thought what Pitt had on his head was not right—Pitt had this package on his head—I followed him nearly to the top of Redcross-street—I then saw an officer, and pointed to him to stand in front of Pitt, which, he did—I came up and asked Pitt what he had got—he said he brought it from a packer's, at No. 7, Wood-street—I said there was no packer at No. 7, Wood-street—I took him to the station, and in the afternoon I found the prosecutor—just as Pitt was pointed out to me, I saw Holloway a few yards in advance of him—I did not see him speak to Pitt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Cripplegate. I saw Pitt in Cripplegate-buildings, which is nearer to the prosecutor's than Fore-street—I saw him before the policeman—I pointed him out to the policeman—when I first saw Pitt, Holloway was alongside of him—directly Holloway saw me (he knew me) he crossed over to the other side, and went on—I knew both the prisoners by being together, and the company they keep.</p>

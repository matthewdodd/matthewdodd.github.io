When I stopped her I asked her what she had, says I, My dear, I believe you have pots here. No, Says she, sir I have not; she repeated that two or three times; then I turned her cloak on one side and I said, Now my dear you see that I see they are pots. She had six pints and two quarts; then I took her into custody and took her home to my own house; the pots she carried in her apron all the way back, and I led her by the arm. I have kept the pots since. Then I sent for one of my neighbours, a publican, his name is Mr. Blackburn, and he sent for a constable. (The pots produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my pot, it has the name on of the man that I succeeded in the house, (Green.) and I bought all his things.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that an old pot? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any at all? - We miss them almost every morning; I cannot say that I missed this in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether at the time you missed any pint pots? - I really cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask whether that day, or about that time any pint pots were missing? - It is evident they were missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any pint pots missing about the time that that was brought to you? - I did not discover any missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you discover any missing any time previous to this? - Yes, a day or two before.</p>

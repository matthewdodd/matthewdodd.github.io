On the 26th of July, about ten o'clock at night, the prisoner came in to purchase a waistcoat - I was measuring another person at the time, to alter a pair of trousers for him, they then lay on the counter; I sold the prisoner the waistcoat at a low price - and when he was gone, my wife told me he had something in his hat; I jumped over the counter, took hold of him, and asked what was in his hat; he said an old waistcoat; I took his hat off, and under an old waistcoat was my trousers; he dropped on his knees, and offered me five shillings to let him go.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lose the saddle - A. On the 28th of January I hung the saddle upon the stall in the stable, I missed it before ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the stable been broken open - A. No, there was no lock nor bolt to it. Upon the 28th I went to the Swan Inn, I was there some time before Michael M'Carty came in, he had been after some horses or colts for some other man; he wanted some refreshment upon the man's account that he went after the horses for, and the lady would not let him have any; I told them to let him have some refreshment, and I would pay them for it: I mentioned the loss of a saddle, and he never told them that he had got a saddle by him; he said it was a shame to rob such a man as he was; upon the 29th the saddle was found under M'Carty's mattrass that he slept on, under the roof belonging to Mr. Stinton.</p>

            . I am a blacksmith. Upon the 29th of January I heard the prisoner had got a saddle to sell; I had heard that Mr. Burgess had lost a saddle; I wondered how he could come by a saddle. He slept in a hay-loft of mine; I went up into the hay-loft, there was a mattrass there, he laid upon it, and it was under this mattrass. I sent for a constable and went to Mr. Burgess, and fetched one of his servants to look at the saddle, and he said he could swear to it. The prisoner said he found the saddle near Mr. Burgess's house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Ask the gentlemen whether I did not tell two gentlemen in the public-house that I had found a saddle, and that if any body owned it, there it was; I did not know who owned the saddle; I found it fairly upon one side of the road.</p>

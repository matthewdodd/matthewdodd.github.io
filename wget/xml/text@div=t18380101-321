                  </hi>, jun. I am a baker, and live with my father, in Comp<lb></lb>ton-street, Brunswick-square. The prisoner was our journeyman, and had been so about five weeks—he slept in a room opposite mine—I have no get up in the night to attend to business—I had missed money from my pockets from time to time, which induced me to mark a half-crown on Sun<lb></lb>day evening the 17th of December—I put it into my waistcoat pocket—my bed-room door is left open—at eleven o'clock, on the night of the 17th I got up to go to work, and the prisoner got up with me—the half-crown was then in my waistcoat pocket, which I left in my bed-room, and my trowsers were covered over it—the prisoner could go up to my room—I missed the half-crown a little before ten o'clock on Monday morning the</p>

               <p>18th—it was then gone, and I charged the prisoner with the robbery—he denied it—my father said, "Let us search him," which we did partly, but he resisted, and kicked very much—we desisted, and got a policeman—I saw him search him in the bake-house; but before the policeman came I saw the prisoner take something from his boot and throw under the trough—my brother went for a policeman—the half-crown was not found till I came back from the station-house—I saw my father pick it up under the dough-trough—that was where I had seen him throw something—I saw him unlace his boots—we took off one—he unlaced the other himself—it was that one we supposed the half-crown came from—when we were searching the prisoner he said he knew what he had taken, and he would pay me back if I would let him alone—this if not my half-crown—(<hi rend="italic">look<lb></lb>ing at it.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>, Sen. I have heard my son's testimony, it is correct—I picked up the half-crown—I did not mark it—I took it up and asked my son if it was his—he said it was—I looked at the mark when I picked it up—this one seems to me to be marked in the same manner.</p>

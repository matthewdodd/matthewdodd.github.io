               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came to London about Christmas, and got very good success sometimes, and poor at other times. I was in a lunatic asylum at Liverpool for about four weeks - it is called St. John's college; not being well encouraged here I was obliged to pledge my pipes for 12s., and to pay 4s. or 5s. out of it which I owed- I was a week without them, and being subject to fits of madness I threw myself into the river, which the turnkey of the Compter can certify, for I was there three days: what happened about this I cannot say; if any thing happens to me I wish to know what has happened to the Union pipes, which are the cause of my getting my bread.</p>

               <p>Do you happen to know whether all was fast that night? - Yes, it was fast; in the morning only one shutter was wrenched away from the other; all was safe the night before; I know that of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>When were you first alarmed in the morning? - Between four and five in the morning I heard a noise; I got up; and I saw the shutter half way down, and the glass broke, and the wire that the watches hung on broke also, and a brass wire upon which watches hung was broke off.</p>
               <p>Was any watches or trinkets gone? - I could not tell then, for before I came down, they got the prisoner to the watch-house; I did not look then; the prisoner was in custody.</p>
               <p>Were any of the things found? - Yes, a watch.</p>

               <p>How long has he lived with you? - Upwards of two years.</p>
               <p>What part of your house did he sleep in? - In the back parlour; exactly joining to the shop.</p>
               <p>At what distance from the front windows? - At about the distance between me and my Lord.</p>
               <p>In what manner were your shutters fastened? - There is only one iron bar with a pin, and key'd on the inside.</p>
               <p>When you got up, did you observe the manner in which the shutters had been opened? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you observe from the inside in what manner your shutters had been opened? - The one had been shoved past the other; the iron bar, the pin, and the key were in their usual state.</p>
               <p>Had it occurred to you ever to observe your shutters before that, that one could be shoved past the other? - I never did observe that.</p>
               <p>How was the glass disposed of? - It was broke inwards, and the wire was broke that the watches were on.</p>
               <p>Did you inspect it so accurately as to know whether the wire was bent inwards or not? - I cannot say that I did; I had no other idea but it was broke from without.</p>
               <p>But you are not able to state to my Lord and the Jury whether the wire was bent inwards, or whether it had received it's bruises from outwards? - It might snap from force internal or external.</p>
               <p>In what state did you find your outer door? - The outer door had been opened; the door was then shut.</p>
               <p>Was Lucas dressed at that time? - No; he was so anxious that he had not dressed himself.</p>
               <p>Had he gone out without any clothes on him? - He did.</p>
               <p>Without shoes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In short without any thing but his shirt? - Not even his shirt, as I am told; I was not there.</p>
               <p>How far did Lucas go without any thing upon him? - He went a good way up Suffolk-street.</p>
               <p>Into Hedge-lane? - Not that I heard.</p>
               <p>In what manner were your shutters fastened, was there a hook at one end of the bar and a pin at the other, or was every particular shutter pinned? - No, Sir, there are no screws to the shutters, and no pin except one at the end to fasten the bar.</p>
               <p>Have you got the iron here that was found on the outside? - My man has.</p>
               <p>Were the things that you lost left in the window the preceding night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were they usually left? - They had been for some time; we very often neglect them and sometimes take them in; the best course is to take them in, and put them in a place of safety; I was at home that evening myself; I believe Lucas was at home that whole evening.</p>
               <p>Had any thing remarkable happened that evening? - Nothing that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Was it a part of Lucas's business to remove these things? - No, it was not; I always removed them myself; I have not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210016"></xptr>discovered any thing but the things mentioned in the indictment; I do not know what I have lost; there might be some trifling things that have not been discovered, but they must be trifling things; as for the things mentioned in the indictment, them I am sure I lost, and lost them in the course of that day; I cannot say to the evening.</p>
               <p>What sort of articles may you have lost at the same time? - I suppose some tle trinket or the other.</p>
               <p>Will you enumerate the several articles that are in the indictment? - The principal thing is the toothpick case.</p>
               <p>I do not like that answer, the principal thing; what things did you lose? - Two toothpick cases; there are watches which are forth coming; two metal watches, one French gold one, and a silver one, which are all mine.</p>
               <p>Of these articles which of them have you seen since? - All of them.</p>
               <p>Did you lose no other articles that you knew of, except these that are mentioned in the indictment? - I told you before that I did not know of any, except some trifles, there was a gold patent watch hook, it was found at that time, but we took no notice of it at that time.</p>
               <p>How near to the door was the pane of glass that was broke? - It was the second to the door.</p>
               <p>Were there articles hung up at every pane? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Not equally valuable? - No.</p>
               <p>This was a pretty good pane? - It was.</p>
               <p>I will venture to ask you, before you saw the prisoner at the watch-house had you ever seen him in your life? - Never.</p>
               <p>Had he, as far as you know, any communication with your family? - None in the world; the maid had a light, and stood at the door while Lucas was gone.</p>
               <p>Had the maid been called before he went away? - She got up naked.</p>
               <p>So the naked maid stood at the door with a candle, while the naked man was gone after the thief? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was she as compleatly in puris naturalibus as the man was? - Not quite.</p>
               <p>Where did she sleep? - Near the shop; not directly under the man's room; there was no candle that I knew of burnt either by the man or the maid; I came in consequence of an alarm from the maid.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the candle that the maid had? - No.</p>
               <p>Was it a candle stuck into a tinder box or in one of your family candlesticks? - I cannot say I took notice of that.</p>
               <p>Recollect now - I cannot; but I know that in the parlour we had a candle in a brass candlestick.</p>
               <p>Are you correct in the day on which this happened, you have stated it was on the 7th between four and five in the morning? - Yes, I am pretty sure of that, it was on Wednesday morning.</p>
               <p>Did you go to the watch-house immediately? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were any of the things produced to you immediately when you first went? - Yes, the two toothpick cases.</p>
               <p>I believe the watches were brought afterwards to your house however, and the watchman left them? - I cannot recollect them; I did not see him searched; the two toothpick cases were shewn to me; one of the metal watches was found in the area of Mr. Thompson's house, in Cockspur-street; my man brought the silver one in.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the examining whether there was any blood about your shop window? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner's hands examined? - Yes, there was a little blood and a scratch, but nothing material; he appeared to have cleaned that with a handkerchief; there was a handkerchief produced that was bloody.</p>
               <p>You understood that the man had been knocked down and beat about a good deal? - No, I did not; I understood that he had made a blow at my man, and that they both fell down together.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Grant; I shut<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210017"></xptr>up the shop on the night of the 6th of February, about six; I shut it up of nights.</p>
               <p>Do you shut up shop so early as that? - Generally at this time of the year.</p>
               <p>What entirely? - No, not entirely, the window shutters.</p>
               <p>When do you fasten the door? - At eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>What time did you go to bed? - I do not know exactly the hour.</p>
               <p>As near as you can? - Perhaps it might be eleven; it might be after, I cannot say; I sleep in the parlour adjoining the shop.</p>
               <p>Had you any alarm that night at all? - Yes, between four and five I was alarmed by the shop window being broke.</p>
               <p>Did you get up immediately? - I saw the man's head against the shop window.</p>
               <p>In what manner? - He was in the street; I saw him taking the things out of the window; he was standing opposite the second pane of glass on the right hand side going out.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - In brown coloured clothes.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity to observe him? - Not at that period of time to take particular notice of his person.</p>
               <p>You was then at the glass door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was in the street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What light did you see him by? - I do not know whether there was the moon, or whether it was the lightness of the morning or the lamps.</p>
               <p>Jury. Have you any lamp on the spot? - There is a lamp at the street door, not exactly at the spot.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any light in the inside of the shop? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the door or the window of the shop open? - One of the shop shutters was slided down; shifted off the hinge where it twists.</p>
               <p>How far was it moved? - About half the width of it over the other shutter that was up.</p>
               <p>How high is the shop window from the ground? - It might be about two feet or two feet and a half from the ground.</p>
               <p>What may be the heighth of the window? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>As near as you can judge? - I cannot pretend to say; there were only three large panes in the heighth of the shop window.</p>
               <p>What the whole from top to bottom? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived there? - Going on three years.</p>
               <p>Is not the shutters higher than you are? - Yes, the shutter was the end to the ground, and shoved a little over the other.</p>
               <p>How much of the window was open by that means? - I suppose about three parts of the pane of glass, or a little more.</p>
               <p>How wide was the pane of glass? - It might be twelve or fourteen inches wide.</p>
               <p>When you looked at it was the glass door between the parlour and the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could you see through that, a man standing in the street, so as to discern how he was dressed? - Yes, so as to discern the colour of his clothes, but not his person; as soon as I saw the man I went to the parlour door that leads to the passage, and then to the house door; I unlocked the house door and took down the chain that goes across it; then I went out and I saw the prisoner taking this metal watch out of the window; I opened the door as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>How is the street door fastened? - With a lock and chain; there is a bolt to it; but I do not think it was bolted.</p>
               <p>Was it double or single locked? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Was the chain up or down? - It was up; I unlocked the door, and took the chain down as fast as I could.</p>

               <p>How far is the door from the shop window? - I suppose four or five yards.</p>
               <p>Then this man was not alarmed with the noise of your opening the door at all? - No; I suppose he could not hear me unlock the door, or take the chain off, because the dog was in the shop at the same time barking at him, which I suppose turned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210018"></xptr>the noise; he let the watch fall directly, and ran off.</p>
               <p>How came he to let it fall directly? - Upon my word I do not know; it was as soon as he saw me; I immediately pursued him; he ran up Suffolk-street; I laid hold of him, and turned him three or four times backwards and forwards; what I mean by turning him, is, he ran backwards and forwards, up and down the street; he was down there in Suffolk-street; whether I struck or pushed him down I am not sure; and in the scuffle we were both down together; I found he got the advantage of me; he got up again; I immediately pursued him again; he ran down the street, and crossed Cockspur-street opposite Jefferies and Jones's; I saw him in Suffolk-street, while I was running after him, throw away these articles, an ivory toothpick case, a silver watch, and a red Morrocco bracelet, as he was crossing over; I ran after him, and by Thompson's the haberdasher's I caught him again; he struck at me; I saw a blow coming, and I put my head on one side, and prevented him striking me; then I struck him down and collared him, and kept him till the watchman came up to me; I gave charge of him to the watchman; so I went home to put on some of my clothes; I had no clothes on at this time not of any kind; the watchman that was at the corner of Jefferies and Jones's brought him, and searched his breeches pocket, and found this gold patent hook in his pocket; I saw it found.</p>
               <p>When did your master come down? - He was not down stairs till he was gone to the watch-house; the articles that are here, the ivory toothpick case, the silver watch, I picked up; I know them to be my master's property; and when I got my clothes on, I picked up some bracelets and some small trinkets that were thrown opposite the window.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You slept in the back parlour if I understand you right? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That is close adjoining to the shop? - Yes, there is a glass door and a glass partition.</p>
               <p>Was the door open when you went to bed, or did you shut it? - It was fast.</p>
               <p>You did not burn a light? - No.</p>
               <p>You went to bed about eleven? - Thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Was you the last person up in the family? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is there any maid servant in the family? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where does she sleep usually? - In the kitchen.</p>
               <p>How long might it be from the first alarm that you had of the shutter, to the time you got compleatly out of the house? - It might be two or three minutes; I never heard the dog bark till the pane of glass was breaking, that was before I got out of bed; he continued barking till I went out.</p>
               <p>Did he go out with you? - No.</p>
               <p>You stood looking on at the man taking the articles out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You could distinctly observe that his clothes were brown? - Yes, Sir, I could distinctly.</p>
               <p>Could you observe what colour his waistcoat was? - No, as well as I recollect his close bodied coat was buttoned, and his great coat was the same colour.</p>
               <p>Was the great coat buttoned? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether he had a glove on when he was pulling out the articles? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What coloured glove? - White leather.</p>
               <p>What they call Woodstock? - I fancy it is what you call wash-leather.</p>
               <p>Had you any fire arms? - No.</p>
               <p>Any watchman's rattle? - No.</p>
               <p>Any bell in the shop? - No, there is a bell in the shop, but I did not go into the shop; there is a bell that goes out of the shop into the kitchen, and another that goes out of the parlour into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>So you observed the man through the glass partition; then through the glass inside of the shop, and so then through the window, and so then you saw his brown great coat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ring either of the bells? - No;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210019"></xptr>the stairs of the kitchen go out of the passage; there is no door at the head of the kitchen stairs.</p>
               <p>Is it a large chain that goes all across the street door? - It goes only half-way.</p>
               <p>Is it a large rattling noisey chain? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The noise of that, the man could not hear, by the dog's barking? - No; he slipped down the shutter, and then sideways one over the other.</p>
               <p>How long might you be gone from the shop before you came back again? - It might be five minutes or more.</p>
               <p>Did you pull the street door after you? - No, I did not, I found it open when I came back; the maid was at the street door, she had got on some of her things, but not dressed herself; her petticoat and cloak, or some such matter.</p>
               <p>I dare say if she had been without as much covering as that, it would have struck you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She was standing with a candle? - I do not believe she had any light at all.</p>
               <p>Then when you came home, she asked you if it was an alarm of fire, and where the fire was? - No, she asked me what was the matter, and I told her there was a rascal had broke into the house.</p>
               <p>Do you ever throw your clothes on your bed of a night? - Sometimes I do.</p>
               <p>You put nothing on that night? - No.</p>
               <p>If I understand you, you went out as naked as the nurse first received you from your mother? - I was naked.</p>
               <p>Had not you a shirt on? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. How happened you to be without a shirt? - Sometimes I lay without a shirt, and sometimes not.</p>
               <p>Had you your hat on? - No.</p>
               <p>No night cap? - No, nothing at all on.</p>
               <p>How far did you pursue this man? - Up Suffolk-street.</p>
               <p>On which side of the pane of glass was it that your street door is? is it further from Charing-cross, or nearer to it? - It is from Charing-cross; I live in Cockspur-street.</p>
               <p>Did the man run past your street door from the pane of glass, or from it? - He ran from it.</p>
               <p>When you came out, you saw him drop the metal watch? - Yes, I was about a couple of yards from him; I pursued him; I past by no watchman; I ran the first time about fifty yards; I called out for assistance, and nobody came.</p>
               <p>How near is the watchman's stand from your house? - The corner of Jefferys and Jones's; I found this silver watch in its present state, in an area in Suffolk-street; and this box was found with the glass broke, which was found when it was taken, it was found in the area, and a red morocco bracelet with it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an extraordinary watchman; yesterday morning, about half past four o'clock, was a fortnight, I saw the prisoner running away from the prosecutor's shop window.</p>
               <p>Where was you? - I was about thirty yards from the shop, and I saw Mr. Lucas naked, pursuing him, crying stop thief, and I went to his assistance immediately; the prisoner fell down, and Mr. Lucas fell upon him; he could not stop himself all in a hurry; we picked him up, and I held him while my comrade watchman searched him; he was stopped in Cockspur-street; he ran up Suffolk-street; he fell and we picked him up, and he run back again down Suffolk-street, and across Cockspur-street.</p>
               <p>How came you not to give your assistance at first? - I gave immediate assistance as soon as ever I heard stop thief, I run after him with Mr. Lucas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lucas has swore that he pursued him up Suffolk-street, and he turned him two or three times, and had a struggle on the ground, and all that time nobody came to his assistance? - Mr. Lucas cannot say so to me; the very moment I heard the cry of stop thief, I went to his assistance, and he cannot say to the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210020"></xptr>Did you search this man? - Yes, there was an ivory box, mounted with gold I believe, and a silver pick-case I think it is; my comrade watchman has got it; I held him while he searched his pockets.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. extraordinary Short, how near was you to Mr. Grant's window at the time it was broke? - I dare say I was thirty or forty yards, and I heard the glass fall, and I saw the gentleman crying stop thief on the instant.</p>
               <p>How long before you heard the glass fall, was it that you had passed Mr. Grant's window? - It was not in my beat to pass the window.</p>
               <p>Had you a rattle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you spring it? - I had no rattle about me, but my comrade watchman had.</p>
               <p>Do you ever go out without one? - Seldom, but that night I did, I will swear that.</p>
               <p>Do you swear it? what upon your oath, was you that night without a rattle? - I was.</p>
               <p>Who is your superintendant now? - The gentlemen subscribers belonging to Cockspur-street; I will swear I was without my rattle that night.</p>
               <p>You say you had some difficulty to stand and keep yourself up? was you so sober as you are now? - I was neither more nor less, and I am sure I am not drunk now; I am as sober now as ever I was in my life.</p>
               <p>This was good fun for you to stand by and see all this? - I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Had you any stick? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you make outcry, or knock at any doors, or ring any bell? - What occasion was there?</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman; my stand is at Jefferies and Jones's, goldsmith and jewellers to his majesty; at half past four I called the hour; I came back to Mr. Jefferies and Jones's front door of the shop, in Cockspur-street: I heard some glasses fall, I did not know whereabouts it was, but I saw a naked man run after another man; I ran to his assistance; he ran up Suffolk-street, as near as I can guess about fifty yards; he slipped down there; he got up, and ran down Suffolk-street again, and at Mr. Thompson's, he slipped down, or was down by some means; the man that was naked laid hold of him, and delivered him to my charge; I immediately searched his pockets, and will produce what I found; there are the two articles I found in his pockets; I met the other watchman, and said there is some glass fell somewhere; then we went together to this naked man's assistance up into Suffolk-street.</p>
               <p>You considered a good while about it, I find, both of you? - We went immediately as soon as ever we heard the word cried stop-thief.</p>
               <p>How came it neither of you were up with him? - The naked man could run faster than I could with my clothes, and my staff, and my rattle, and my great coat on; I found both these in the prisoner's right hand coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. In his great coat pocket? - He had no great coat on.</p>
               <p>What coloured bodied coat had he on? - He had a kind of an ash coloured coat, a little darker than such a dirty one as this of mine.</p>
               <p>Was it like this gentleman's? (N. B. That was a lightish brown.) - Not quite so dark.</p>
               <p>Was his coat buttoned? - Not buttoned at all.</p>
               <p>A light coloured waistcoat? - His waistcoat was the same as the coat.</p>
               <p>When you searched his coat pocket, that was after he and the naked man had been down together? - Yes.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>You ran as hard as you could? - I had no opportunity for running; I was more anxious after the business.</p>
               <p>Did your partner spring his rattle? - No.</p>
               <p>Why not? - I cannot tell why.</p>
               <p>Did he lend his rattle that night? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you each of you had your rattles? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why did not you spring them? - We were more anxious after running; he had his rattle, but he does not not make use of a rattle; I am sure he had his rattle; I imagine it was in a sling by his left side, I believe it is in general; his lanthorn he does not carry, but I am sure of his rattle.</p>
               <p>Do you remember who he gave his rattle to when he came to the watch-house? - He does not belong to the watch-house, he did not go there; he always takes his rattle with him.</p>
               <p>Which of you was it that picked up the naked man's hat when he was down? - I know nothing of the naked man's hat; I did not see him with a hat, nor he had no night cap on.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to say that you saw Short have his rattle that night in particular, or that he generally carries it so? - He generally carries it in a sling; I do not remember seeing it that night, but he generally makes use of it.</p>
               <p>(The things shewn to the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>(Here the learned Judge repeated to the interpreter the particulars of the evidence as before recited.)</p>
               <p>Court. Now ask the prisoner if he wishes to say any thing in his own defence.</p>

               <p>It was so dark I could not see to unhook the watches; as for the rest I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell him that his counsel is not permitted to make a speech for him, but can only call his witnesses? - I had not been from home for eight days, only to go to Doctor

               <p>The prisoner called eight witnesses, who gave him a very good character; some of whom said he was a perfumer at No. 4, in Silver-street, and sold snuff and tobacco, and then kept a billiard table, and that his wife made rouge; and two of the witnesses said they had been at the club with him, and they broke up about one o'clock.</p>

On 9th April, the prisoner came to my depôt I saw him take some coal—I gave him directions to load, and he did soon his return without coals and without money, I said nothing to him—I was going on other business—he said that some persons had not paid him, and he would collect it on Monday—he did not state any particular person—his duty was to deliver the coals in hundred weights, and small quantities to any person who called for them in the street—if any one paid him, he was accountable to me for the money—to the best of my recollection he said he would collect the money, and bring the whole on Monday—he did not make his appearance again—I did not see him again till Monday.</p>

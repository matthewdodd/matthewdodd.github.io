                  </hi> I am in the employment of George Winter and another, ironmongers, of 1, Bank-end, Southwark. I had a customer of the name of Clark, of Newington. Anout three o'clock in the afternoon of 1st April, a person, who I thought was the witness Blackford, came to the ware<lb></lb>house and presented me this order, (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), in consequence of which I delivered him three dozen 16th-inch bastard files, and three dozen 4 1/2 inch hand saw-files—they are worth 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—the order purports to come from a Mr. Turner—I asked the person who brought it if he came from Mr. Turner—he said, "Yes"—I gave the person the goods, and in consequence of something that had happened at our house before, I followed the person to Southwark Bridge-road, from there to Lombard-street, and into Mint-street, Borough—he there went into a beer-shop, and I lost sight of him—about nine the same evening I went with three policeman into Mint-street, saw Blackford, and gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Mint-street, Borough, and know Malme.

               <p>you can settle it with him"—he said, "If you can tell how, I will"—I said, "Go and tell him you will come up on the day of trial," or something of that—he said he did not settle it in that way—I said, "If you wrote the orders, you are not obliged to tell them so"—he said, "I did not write the orders, but I fetched the files myself"—I went out, fetched a policeman, and gave him into custody—when he was taken he said, "You have done a b----fine thing for me"—one of Mr. Winter's clerks charged him, and he was locked up.</p>

                  </hi> In March last I was in the service of Mr. Wild, a whitesmith, in Mint-street.

                  </hi> I live in College-street, Tooley-street. On 3rd May I met Harrington, who I did not know before, at the Marquis of Granby public-house, in the Borough—I was at that time admitted to bail by the Magistrate, having been spoken to by Gardiner as being the person that came for the files—I was reading a bill outside the public-house, and Harrington came up to me, and asked how I thought I should get on—I asked, "For what?"—he said, "For the job at Mr. Winter's"—I said, "I hardly know"—he said, "I am very sorry, as I know you are innocent of it; it was me and Malme that got the goods on the Thursday and Friday; I went to Malme, and told him if he would write out another order, we could get some more on the Saturday; and Malme went in and presented the bill, and I was on the opposite side of the way"—he was in my company about three hours and a half—on these facts being stated, the Magistrate discharged me.</p>

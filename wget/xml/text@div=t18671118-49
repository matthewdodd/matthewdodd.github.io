                  </hi>. I am a baker at Woolwich—the prisoner has been a commercial traveller—about six months ago he entrusted a mare to me to keep for him—I had the privilege of using it for the keep—I afterwards saw the prisoner in company with Mr. Swift and Sayer—I had three or four meetings with them about accepting a bill of exchange—I think it was at the latter end of July—the prisoner owed Swift some money, and they drew a bill and asked me to accept it—I refused three or four times, because the mare was put up to a raffle—it was in my possession at the time—at last I accepted the bill—they asked me if I would take an "I O U" for the amount of the bill when I refused to accept it—I said no, an I O U was of no use, and the prisoner then said that I should have the mare until the bill was due, if I accepted it for Swift—that was agreed to, that the mare was to be my property until the bill was due, and with that I accepted the bill—that was agreed to in the prisoner's presence—the three of them were present—the words Wadsworth used were, "You won't lose much, you have got the mare"—that was to be my security—I would not have done it upon anything else—we went to the place where the raffle was to be, and stopped it—I and Swift went, not the prisoner—he said he would have the raffle stopped, because he had taken money of persons who had tickets—I afterwards had to meet the bill on the 2nd of this month—I have not got it with me now—I had it yes<lb></lb>terday—I have sent down to Woolwich for it.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner come along with a child on the 29th of March; I thought the child did not belong to her. I followed them to the Long-field, Southampton-Row. She went to <placeName id="t17570420-16-crimeloc80">Tottenham Court</placeName>

I was within about twenty or thirty yards of her at the time. I had observed that the child had buckles on, but after that, the flaps of her shoes hung about, and the buckles were gone. I said to her, has the child no buckles? She said, no; then I followed them to Gray's-Inn-Lane, near where the child lived. When they came to Liquorpond-Street she said to the child, '' Stay here a little time and I'll bring you '' your buckles again presently.'' There was Mr. Page. I said to him, this person has stole the child's buckles, and desired he'd fetch her back again.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did the child live?</p>

               <p>Perkins. It liv'd in Gray's-Inn-Lane. Mr. Page brought her back again. She was charged with taking the buckles, but she denied it at first. Then she desired to go into a private room with Mr. Page, and I saw him come out, and he had the buckles in his hand.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was this ?</p>

               <p>Perkins. It was between ten and eleven in the forenoon.</p>

            . On the 29th of March, about 11 o'clock, I saw the last evidence and the prisoner with a little child in her hand. I heard her say to the child, if you'll stay here a little I'll come to you again presently. Perkins told me the woman that was gone away had rob'd the child of her buckles. I ask'd the child if she knew that woman, she said no. I ask'd her if she had got her buckles, she said yes. I went and brought the prisoner back, when the mother of the child was there, we took the prisoner into a house, she desired to speak with me alone. I went into a room with her, then she turn'd down her stockings, and took a silver buckle from out of each stocking, (produced in court.)</p>

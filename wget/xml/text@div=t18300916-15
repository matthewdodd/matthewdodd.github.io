            . I am a bricklayer, and live at No. 9, Portpool-lane, Gray's Inn-lane. On Monday, the 16th of August, I had been to Cromer-street, and was returning home a few minutes before twelve o'clock at night - I passed the corner of Well-street, leading into Gray's Inn-road; there are houses on one side of that street, and the brick wall of St. Andrew's burial-ground on the other - the wall turns again down at Gray's Inn-road, towards Battle-bridge, and in the centre of the wall is the gate leading into the burial-ground; at the opposite corner of Well-street is the Calthorpe Arms public-house - on arriving at the angle of the wall in Gray's Inn-road, I just pulled out my watch to see the time, and saw three men come up Well-street into <placeName id="t18300916-15-crimeloc92">Gray's Inn-road</placeName>

               <p>Q. Then when you say you saw him strike his left arm, it must be a mistake? A. I cannot positively say which arm it was, but I saw his arm go very plain to the Policeman's left side - it was a very sharp blow, very quick; the Policeman instantly fell down on his right knee, and said, "Good God! I am a dead man;" I heard that very plain - the two men on his left ran down Gray's Inn-lane, towards Battle-bridge; the prisoner was one of those two- the other man turned short, and went down Well-street, the same way as they had come up: I am certain of the prisoner, for I followed him down, and never lost sight of him till he was stopped by Mr. Cubit's private watchman, Prindwill - I found him in his custody about one hundred yards from where the blow was given, or it might be more but I followed him; it was near Cubit's premises - I never lost sight of him: while I was following him I saw him throw something to the right and something to the left - I pointed out the spot to

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The spot where the Policeman met his death was not so well lighted as some other places? A. There is a light right opposite the spot, so that I could see very plain, and there is a lamp on that side - the light was so strong I could see any thing - my watch wanted about twenty minutes to twelve o'clock- I could see that; I never saw the prisoner before - people very soon came up to pursne, but I saw the prisoner very distinctly all the way till he was taken, as plain as I do you; I should think twenty or thirty yards the greatest distance he was from me - he crossed the road - I do not know that I should know the features of any of them, but I followed Smith; I should think not half a minute elapsed from the time the Policeman spoke to them till he fell - they were very quick about it; a young man named Dennis was running with me, and there were two or three running behind me - nobody was between me and the prisoner- he was the only person before me, I am quite sure; I lost the man who ran with the prisoner in a dark corner, when he had run about forty yards, before I saw the prisoner throw something to the right and left - I came up directly the watchman had caught hold of him; I saw no mark of blood on any part of him - I went with him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160017"></xptr>the station, and was examined at the Police-office; I never saw the deceased before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Of the two men you saw on the Policeman's left hand side, was the prisoner nearest to him or not? A. He was nearest - I cannot say whether it was him that struck; I saw the arm go very plain, and it certainly was the arm of the man who was nearest to him - the two stood very close together; I am sure the prisoner is the person who stood nearest to him.</p>

            . I am an unfortunate girl. On the 16th of August I lived in Pheasant-buildings, Gray's Inn-lane - I knew Long the Policeman by sight; I never spoke to him but three times - I saw him, and spoke to him on the night in question, about a quarter to eleven o'clock, in Gray's Inn-road; he was coming with his face towards Battle-bridge, and he gave me 1d. - I wished him good night, and went towards Victoria-street, Battle-bridge; I came back from there about twenty minutes or a quarter to twelve o'clock, and came down Gray's Inn-road, with my face towards Holborn - I there met a gentleman, and went with him to the Calthorpe Arms, but did not set down there - I had a glass of rum, and he a glass of ale; we left immediately - he came out of the house with me, and had hold of my right hand; he was next to the wall - we came on as far as the burial-ground gate, and stopped - he held my hand, and I was looking towards Well-street - I saw three men, and a man rather behind them; they were coming towards me - two of the three immediately surrounded the man; I cannot say whether the other surrounded him - they were more towards my left side, near the kennel; they surrounded the man who was coming behind; I did not see what became of the third man - I saw one of the two men run away; he had one a blue coat with very large capes, and was rather broad in the shoulders - his coat was buttoned straight down with gilt buttons; he seemed to me rather in a state of intoxication - he came first towards where I stood, then reeled across the road, and the instant he ran away (the one in brown had his great coat open, and his close coat appeared to me more of a brown than the great coat; I was so close under the lamp I could see the inner coat was more brown than the top coat - there was sufficient light to distinguish colours) the one in the brown coat struck the Policeman in this way(backhanded) - I did not see that man's face till I saw him turn towards me, which he did immediately after he had struck - I then observed his features; he ran across the road, in a direction towards Battle-bridge - I was still standing under the lamp when he passed me, and saw his face - the instant he ran away the Policeman placed his hand out and said, "Stop him! I am a dead man;" there are two gas-lamps at the gate of the burial-ground - I attended to the deceased, and did not pursue the man: I did not lose sight of him from the time I saw him strike the blow till he passed me near the lamp - he passed within five yards of me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see that person again? A. I saw him about five or six minutes after - I was then at the surgeon's door; the prisoner is that man, but he had a brown coat on when I saw him - he was between two men; I do not know whether they were Policemen - I did not know he was in custody; he was quite close to me, and I said, "Good God! that is the man that struck the blow;" I did not observe whether he made any answer - he must have heard me; it was him I applied the observation to - I had not the least doubt of his being the man who struck the blow, nor have I now;

             has pointed out to me a spot in Gray's Inn-lane - I saw the prisoner at that spot; it is the very spot where I lost him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had been drinking with a gentleman just before this transaction? A. Yes; I had a glass of rum - I had not drank with any body else that day, and was perfectly sober; I had drank nothing else- three persons went up to the Policeman; they first had their faces towards Battle-bridge; they instantly surrounded him - the two that were on my left side, nearest the road, surrounded him first; I do not know what the other did - the prisoner was nearer to the Policeman than the man in blue, but they were all three close; the prisoner and the man in blue were the closest; the other seemed more distant from him - the one in blue started first, and the prisoner next; it was all done in an instant- I saw the man in blue as far as the riding-school, about the length of this Court; as I went to assist the deceased my back was towards the persons running - there was another man examined at the office, but I was not examined about any body but the prisoner; there were a great many taken up whom I could not speak to - I was asked about them, but knew nothing about them whether they were the men or not; I never saw the prisoner before - I saw Millican there; he seemed coming in the same direction as the Policeman, and was nearer to him than me; Dennis came to my assistance - the prisoner ran as fast as he could.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the blow actually given, or only the hand lifted up? A. I saw the hand lifted up towards some part of the Policeman's bosom - I saw him in the act of striking against his bosom; the man in blue had run away before the man in brown struck.</p>

            . My father is a milkman, and lives in James-street, Wellington-square, near Gray's Inn-road. On the 16th of August, about ten minutes or a quarter to twelve o'clock, I was in Gray's Inn-road, going towards Battle-bridge, and just as I passed the corner of the burial-ground, I saw four persons before me: as I came nearer I saw the one rather behind the other three was a Policeman - he appeared to be driving these men on before him; two of them were on his left hand, and one on his right - I was ten or twelve yards from them; there are three gas-lights, one nearly opposite the burial-ground, which gave a strong light, and one on each side the burial-ground - I am positively sure the prisoner was one of the three; he was the nearest one to the Policeman on the left side - I saw his hand go towards the Policeman backhanded; it seemed to go very sharp - the Policeman instantly fell on his right knee, with his left leg out; the man on the right hand then turned short round to the right, and passed me - he went into Well-street, for I looked round almost immediately, and missed him - the prisoner and the other man went off at first towards a wall, and as soon as they got a little distance into the dark I observed them set off at full run; I went and took hold of the Policeman, who was on his right knee, with his left<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160018"></xptr>leg out - I took him round the waist; he said, "I am stabbed, I am stabbed!" Code was then close behind me, and came to my assistance - I found a rattle in the Policeman's right hand; I left him in Code's hands, and directly followed the two men, springing the rattle all the way: they were never out of my sight till I pursued; I cried Stop thief! and Murder! - just at the moment I began to halloo I observed them set off running - they were lurking along the wall till I began to spring the rattle; one of them kept straight down, and the other, I suppose, turned to the left, as I missed him; the prisoner is the man that kept straight down - I followed him till I saw him in the hands of Cubit's watchman; he had his left arm close to his chest; I only saw him swinging his right arm along, but did not see him throw any thing away - I did not hear any thing strike against the farrier's gate by the barracks; I went up when I saw him in the watchman's hands, and was sure he was the man I saw strike the Policeman - I returned, and assisted in taking the Policeman to Mr. Holmes'; he was dead before he got there - I saw him undressed there, and a knife without a handle sticking in his left side; Clements and Martin have since pointed out two spots to me - the prisoner ran over that ground I am certain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You was coming from Well-street? A. No, down from Holborn way - I passed the end of Well-street, and saw Millican; I can positively undertake to say the prisoner was one of them - he was the nearest to him; the wound was on the left side, towards the front, between the fourth and fifth rib.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were behind, and the blow struck on that part, could you see which of four arms struck that blow? A. Yes, because his back was towards me, and at the time the prisoner struck he turned his side face towards me; the Policeman was very close to the prisoner, but the other man on the left stood farther off - there was a small space between the two on the left; I could see between them - I am certain it was the prisoner, and not the other man who struck the blow; I pursued, and Millican stopped behind, I believe - I did not see him; he might be behind me: I noticed a man standing just as I got up to the Welsh school, but saw nobody standing or moving between me and the prisoner - I had a better opportunity of seeing what any body did than any body else who was pursuing; I did not see any action of the prisoner throwing any thing away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The Policeman did not strike either of the men, did he? A. I did not see him - he appeared to be driving them along - I did not hear him say or do any thing; I ran as fast as I could - Millican was not before me; he might be behind or nearly by my side, but I did not see any thing of him.</p>

            . I am watchman to Mr. Cubit, of Gray's Inn-road, between St. Andrew's burial-ground and Battle-bridge. On the night of the 16th of August I was on the premises, and heard a cry of Stop thief! Murder! and a rattle spring - I immediately went out of the gate on the pavement, and saw a man running towards me, in a direction from the burial-ground; he was on one side of the road, which is a dark side, and the opposite side to where I was; I crossed over to stop him - he ran across to the other side, to avoid my taking him; I secured him: several people were running after him, giving the alarm - I did not notice Dennis; a Policeman came and took him out of my hands, and one person told me to stop that man at the time he was running - I should not know that man again; I hardly know what passed when the Policeman came up, for as soon as he took him from me I went over to master's premises - when I took hold of him I asked the man who told me to stop him what he had done; he said he had stabbed a man down the road, or lower down, I am not certain which - the prisoner said he knew nothing about it; he was the first man I saw when I came into the road - there was nobody between me and him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You came out of Cubit's premises on hearing a cry, and at that time the first man you saw was the prisoner? A. Yes - I stood a few moments till I heard the cry, and a man told me to stop him before I did so; I did not notice whether his hands were bloody.</p>

             about thirteen minutes before twelve o'clock that night, and a few minutes before twelve I heard an alarm, but saw nothing of the transaction; I first saw the prisoner about ten yards from Prindwill, and saw him stop him - I went up, and found him in custody; as I ran after the prisoner I kicked a coat, but did not pick it up - it was afterwards picked up by Fuller; I was about five yards from him, but did not see him pick it up: I kicked against it in the direction the prisoner had run.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What age was the deceased? A. About thirty-five; he was in good health when I left him- I saw no marks of blood on the prisoner.</p>

            . I am in the employ of the Police, and was on duty, but did not see the prisoner till he was in custody; Johnson was there, and said, in his hearing, "I am sure I saw him throw something like a coat up in youder corner," pointing to it; the prisoner said nothing to that - he was near enough to hear it; Johnson also said, "I am sure that is the man:" the prisoner made no reply at all - I searched the spot pointed out by Johnson, and picked up a brown great coat, which I produce; I have had it ever since: on the other side of the way I found a crow-bar - this was about ten minutes to twelve o'clock, almost immediately after the man had been stabbed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was you present when the prisoner was taken? A. Yes, he had no great coat on then; I cannot exactly say what colour his close coat was.</p>

            . I was coming on duty as a Policeman on the 16th of August - the prisoner was in custody before I came up; I went to the surgeon's, and saw the deceased's body - I did not know him; he had on the Police uniform, with

            43 on the collar - the blade of a knife was in the possession of Mr. Holmes' young man - it had been just taken out - several persons were there; I received the knife from Clements at Hatton-garden office; Griffiths was at that time gone to the station - I saw her about twenty minutes to one o'clock - she went with the inspector and me to Gray's Inn-road, and about thirty or forty yards from the burial-ground gate, in a direction to Battle-bridge, I found the handle of a knife with a spot of blood on it, which got rubbed off in my pocket - the blood seemed fresh, but I thought it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160019"></xptr>dry, and put it into my pocket; I fitted the handle to the blade and found it fit - I pointed out to Griffiths yesterday the spot where I found the handle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw the prisoner as soon as he was taken? A. No, not till he was at the office; I saw no blood on any part of him.</p>

            . I am a Policeman of the division E. 102 - I did not know the deceased. On the 17th of August, in consequence of information, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, I went and examined about Gray's Inn-road, and found three files and a brad-awl nearly close together under the dead wall behind Mecklenburgh-square - I have shown the spot to Millican, Dennis, and Johnson; I delivered the blade of the knife to Wilson - I received it from Mr. Holmes, the surgeon.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Guildford-street. The deceased was brought to my house about twelve o'clock on the night of the 16th - he was dead then; I saw the body immediately - it had a Police dress on; Dennis and a number of people brought it in; on examining the body, I discovered a knife which had penetrated between the fourth and fifth ribs on the left side; I tried to draw it out, but could not, and while I went to get an instrument, it was drawn out by Mr. Shipman, a surgeon; when I returned, I found the wound without the knife in it - the knife produced was given to me as the same; I gave it to Wilson; I cannot say who handed it to me - it was handed about; I afterwards opened the body, and found the knife had penetrated the heart, and there cannot be a doubt that caused his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was a young man in apparent health? A. Yes; a great deal of blood had not effused from the wound externally, it was more internal; I suppose that arose from the knife remaining in the wound; I think it probable such a wound might be inflicted without blood coming on the person who did it, the knife remaining in the wound and the clothes on the body.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would not the flowing of the blood be obstructed in some degree by the knife remaining in? A. Yes; and the clothes would prevent it flowing on the person's hand - the clothes were saturated with blood - the knife had penetrated about four inches; considerable force had been used to send it that depth.</p>

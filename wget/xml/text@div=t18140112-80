               <p>MARGARET VAUGHN. On the 3rd of December, I came out of the workhouse; I asked the prisoner, (he was a watchman,) if he could help me to a lodging. I went into his box; he went away, and when he came to the box, I asked him what he wanted; he said, nothing. When he was gone I looked to see if my bundle was there, it was gone; my bundle contained all the things in the indictment. The ten shil- shillings in halfpence the gentlemen gave me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in the box but this man - A. He locked me up from eleven at night until five in the morning. I wanted to go to Shrewsbury; the ten shillings in halfpence I did not intend to spend until I got to Highgate, and met a coach to take me to Shrewsbury.</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. I am sure that is my shift, the matron of the workhouse gave it me; I cut out the name of the workhouse on the body because nobody should know that I had been in the workhouse at Shrewsbury.</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. I know them; I had untied them and tied them up again, it is one of the papers of halfpence I had of the gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When the old lady came to me I saw no bundle that she had; the halfpence I received of Mr. Swift at his lottery office, and the shift is my wife's shift.</p>

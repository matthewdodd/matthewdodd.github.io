The prisoner worked for me on the Monday, the 15th or 16th of Dec., the day before Firth came—I saw the prisoner on a the Tuesday morning, the 17th, in the chaff-loft adjoining the loft where Firth kept his clothes—he must have gone through Firth's room to get to the chaff-loft—I had not paid the prisoner his wages when he left the day before—I cannot say whether he had a coat on when I saw him in the chaff-room—I told him to come down—then paid him his wages, and he went away—I saw him again about half-past three in the afternoon; that was before Firth had come back from London—Firth had left for London about two o'clock in the morning of the 17th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant to a pawnbroker at Edmonton. On the 17th of Dec, a person came to the shop with a velveteen coat wrapped in a yellow silk handkerchief, with white spots and white stripes round the border—he asked 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the coat—I lent 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he gave the name of John Clark, of Bull's-cross—I asked if he would leave the handkerchief to wrap it up in—he said, no, he could not do that—he had on a round hat which fitted close to the head, a velveteen coat, and a dirty. smock frock—I have no recollection of his person—he leaned on the counter—I did not notice his features, we have so many persons coming perhaps 100 in a day—I took no more notice of him than of others—the coat was afterwards claimed by Firth—it was pawned as near half-past four as possible—we were shutting up shop at the time.</p>

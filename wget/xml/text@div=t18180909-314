On the 24th of July I slaughtered twelve oxen, and hung them up in the slaughter-house. The prisoner had formerly been employed to work there. Next morning, about ten o'clock, I was going along Broad-street, opposite my slaughter-house gate, and saw him. He crossed over the way from me. He had a cloth on his shoulder. I saw some fat in it through a hole. It was in a butcher's round frock; the arms were tied up, to make it serve for a bag. I followed him up Poland-street; he went into Dring's melting-house, in Wardour-street. I then went into Mr. Dring's shop, in Oxford-street, and told his servant my suspicions. He took me to the melting-house, and showed me the fat which they said the prisoner had brought; from its appearance I knew it was stolen. It consisted of what we call toungs and shoulders of tripe, which is never cut away with the fat, it being always sold with the tripe. There was also about 21lbs. which had been taken in a hot state from the internal part of the bullock. Some pieces had the entrails on them. It was not cleaned in the usual way for sale. I got an officer, took him to Dring's shop, and found the prisoner there, with a note to receive his money for the fat. I gave him in charge to Plank, who asked him how he came by the fat. He said it was his own property; that he bought it and paid for it. He said he would not go without his money. Plank took him into custody. As we were going along, he said he would tell me where he got the fat; that he had it of two men, who were sitting at the Maidenhead public-house, New-street, close by. Plank and I went there, and found two men who worked for me. They denied it, and the magistrate discharged them; they promised to appear at the next examination, which one did, and the other absconded.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner at Dring's; he said he bought the fat. I asked him where, he refused to tell me. As I was taking him to the office, he said he received it of two men, who were at the Maidenhead, and that the prosecutor knew them. I found two of the prosecutor's men there and took them to the prisoner, who said they were the men. They were all three examined before the magistrate. The prisoner then denied that they were the men, or that he had said so.</p>

            . I am a servant at Dring's melting-house, in Wardour-street. On the 25th of July, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner brought two parcels of fat at two different times, which weighed six stone. I gave him an order to receive the money for it at the shop. I showed the fat to Jackson in the same state as he had brought it.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's servant. I get up at two o'clock to work. I went to breakfast with Bailey at the public-house; the prisoner came in; Bailey said, "There is a parcel left for you, up in the corner." The prisoner took it up; he did not say who left it. I do not know what it was, or who brought it in. Bailey helped him up with it. He has since run away. I do not know what colour it was, or any thing about it.</p>

I leaned over, and she hove up her elbow, and I saw the card of lace slide from under her arm; I did not see it under her arm, I only saw it slide down; this is the card; she was a great deal more composed than I was; we sent for a constable, and she was committed.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that card was one of those that were in the shop before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Mrs. Pudner, how far from the door was this woman standing, at the time she was cheapening the lace? - It may be a yard.</p>
               <p>Your's is a narrow shop; is not it? - Not very broad.</p>
               <p>She was looking towards the door to look at the lace? - She turned to the door.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120015"></xptr>That is the best situation of examining any commodity that is in your shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After that she returned three pieces into the box, and you thought she had four? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She was then talking about the price of one? - Yes, when I looked at her, I saw the lace slip down.</p>
               <p>I believe you found afterwards that she had been buying some other commodity at Mr. Lee's, your neighbour? - Yes, she said she had been at the next door to enquire for lace; that I found to be true of Mr. Lee; I never saw her before in my life to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>At the time you was serving her, Mr. Pudner was there, and your niece? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You said she had a long sattin cloak on with arm holes in it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you talked of some motion that was natural enough? - Yes, it might.</p>
               <p>You have recently before lost a good deal of property? - Yes.</p>

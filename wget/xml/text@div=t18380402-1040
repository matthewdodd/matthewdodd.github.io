                  </hi>. I live in Stephen-street, Lisson-grove, and am a tinman. I have known the prisoner four years—on the evening of the 12th of March he called on me, and staid about four hours—I had a musical box—I put it on the table, and after that put it on the top of a cheffonier, six feet from the ground—after he had gone some time I missed it—I got a police-sergeant, and followed him to a barge on the Paddington canal—I found him on board, and asked him for my musical box—he said he had not got it—I said, "I know you have"—he said he had not got any such thing—the policeman asked him for it several times—he denied it—the policeman then went to search the bed he was lying on—he still denied it, and then he searched his waistcoat, but did not find it—the officer said "Don't break the box, it is a tender thing;" and the prisoner then turned round, and put the box through a hole, at the back of the cabin, in among the packages—I saw him turn himself round, but did not see it put there—I found it there—he said if we would wait a minute he would dress himself, and give it us—he undid the cords of the tarpaulin, and moved some of the packages—the box fell to the bottom, and the policeman and another man there got it up—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

I accompanied the prosecutor on board the barge, and found the prisoner in bed—I told him to give the box up—he denied having it—I then saw him shuffling about, and saw him put his hand into a hole, between the bed-place and the back-place of the barge—he then acknowledged that he had it, and would give it up—he got up, and partly dressed himself, moved some of the packages, and I saw the box at the bottom—I took it up—the prosecutor owned it—I found 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a knife upon the prisoner.</p>

I was going along the street, and met the prosecutor's wife with some gin—she asked me to drink, and I did—she asked me to go home, and I passed the evening with them—I got intoxicated, and returned to my bed—I did not know I had it till I got on board. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. He was not intoxicated at all.</p>

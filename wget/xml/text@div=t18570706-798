                  </hi>. I live at No. 48, Booth Street, and work for Mr. Freeman, a bootmaker, of No. 14, Westmoreland Street, as a boot stitcher. On 26th June, about 6 o'clock in the evening, I was down stairs; I was sent for to see the prisoner—Mr. Freeman came for me, and I went up stairs with him—I saw the prisoner, he wished to shake hands with me as he was going away—I shook hands with him, and after I had shaken hands with him he took a knife out of his pocket—I saw just the point of the knife—he put his left arm round my neck, and stuck the knife in my face—I screamed, "Murder!"—my master came to my assistance—I disengaged myself from the prisoner, and ran into the landlord's room—on the night before this the prisoner had asked me to leave my place and live with him—I told him I would not; and he said if I did not he would take my life and his own afterwards—I went to the police station and had my wound dressed by a surgeon.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Westmoreland Street; the prose<lb></lb>cutrix worked for me as a shoe sewer. I know the prisoner, he has been keeping company with the prosecutrix—he came to my house on the evening of 26th June, between 6 and 7 o'clock—he came up stairs, and asked to shake hands with the little boy, as he was going away; I said, "No"—he then asked if he could see the prosecutrix, to wish her good bye—I went down to persuade her to come up—she did not want to come, but she did eventually come up stairs—I waited on the stairs, and I heard a scream and a scuffle—I went into the room, and the prisoner had the knife in his hand, the moment I entered the room—he had his left hand round the prosecu<lb></lb>trix's neck—she disengaged herself, and ran away—I threw the prisoner down, and took the knife from him, and threw it on the floor—I sent for a policeman, and gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in North Road, Hoxton. On 26th June, I was sent for to the police station—I there saw the prose<lb></lb>cutrix—I examined her, and found she had a graze down the left cheek, and a wound on the throat, under the left jaw, about three quarters of an inch in extent—it was directly over the carotid artery—the point of the knife was broken off—if it had gone the least bit further she must have been killed-—if the point had been sharp it must have killed her.</p>

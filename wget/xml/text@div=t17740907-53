               <p>Q. Had they taken any thing?</p>
               <p>Smith. I believe they had drank some ale; Lequint seemed much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you examined whether your doors and windows, and every thing were fast?</p>
               <p>Smith. I fastened the windows the night before myself, and the cellar door was double locked; I was the last up in the house, and saw that all my doors and windows were fast; one of the watchmen has a crow and a chissel, with which they wrenched off the catch of the cellar lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there an area before the house?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, the cellar is even with the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say for themselves when you found them in the cellar?</p>
               <p>Smith. Nothing; I found there a dark lanthorn, a tinder box, and steel (producing them.)</p>

I was not in the cellar when the man said there were thieves; I went down to his assistance; I stood on the flap of the cellar window, and there I saw this chissel lie upon the pavement in the street at the edge of the window; the chissel and the crow were hanging in the cellar; I found these before the prisoners were taken.</p>

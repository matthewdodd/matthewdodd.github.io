On the 4th of January, I saw my coat safe at seven o'clock on the evening; it was on the first-floor room. I have known the prisoner a long while. He was at my house at seven o'clock that evening; he had seen the coat two or three times that day; he went out with me at a quarter past seven o'clock. I told my wife to go out; he heard me tell her. I parted with the prisoner at Aldgate pump. I went home about nine o'clock, and found my coat gone. I was very intimate with the prisoner. I saw my coat the 17th of January, at Fothergill's. I met the prisoner on the 12th of January, and charged him with the robbery; he denied it.</p>

            . I am the daughter of Joshua Allen, who keeps the house. About twenty minutes past seven o'clock, the prisoner came to the house, alone; I let him in, and told him, that Mrs. Holland was not at home; he said, he knew that, but she was only next door, and that he would go up stairs and wait until she came in; he waited about ten minutes, and then went out, before Mrs. Holland came in. He shut the door after him. Nobody but the prisoner went up stairs during the time that Mrs. Holland was out; she returned about eight o'clock; I told her Jones had been; she went up, and missed the coat directly.</p>

I have done business with the prisoner before.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at Holland's house the whole of that day before tea. I wanted some paper to write a letter - He had no paper. I was there till after tea. I went out with Holland after tea. I was going to Mile-end. I went back to write the letter; when I got to the side-door, there was a man pushed by me. I found the room-door locked, and came out, and found the coat lying in the court, and I pledged it.</p>

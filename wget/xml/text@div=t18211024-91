I went to help the tub off her head, she said No; but told me to take the bundle from under her arm and pawn it, or leave it for a shilling till to-morrow. I took it to Turner's - they would not take it in - I took it to Short's-gardens and got 1 s. 3 d. on it, and as I returned I met her husband, who gave me in charge. I once saved her from being run over when she was drunk.</p>

            . I sell fruit and other things in the street. I came out on Saturday, five weeks before the prisoner was taken, and saw this woman give her the shirt from under her arm, and bid her pawn it, and if she could not pawn it, to get a drop of gin for it, to drink before her husband came down. I afterwards saw her with money in her hand looking for the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you applied to about this - A. She sent for me when she was in prison. I went to her last Monday; she said as I saw the woman give her the shirt, I should come down.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you - A. In Clare-street. The prisoner asked the prosecutrix if she should help her down with her pail of oysters. She told her to take the shirt, she was to bring her the money. She generally stood in Clare-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appoint any place for her to bring the money to - A. I did not stop to hear. There is a wine-vaults just by, and I went in to see the time - it was ten o'clock. I wished to know the time as I was going for oysters, and Billingsgate is generally shut at twelve. I live in Little Wild-street. I could not go to Billingsgate as I wanted to bring out my stand, and it was too late.</p>
               <p>Q. What ten o'clock too late to go - A. I had not money enough, I went to Drury-lane, and met the prisoner; she said I have got the money for Mrs. so and so. I said "You ought to be ashamed of yourself to be seen in such company;" for I had often seen her tipsy in the street, and the prisoner was quite tipsy. The prisoner lived servant with me when I was in the milk business, and bore a good character.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath has she not been in custody - A. I never heard it.</p>

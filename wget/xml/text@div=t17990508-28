               <p>Q. Did you on that day sign any draft for the payment of 1981. with several others, about the same day, or a day or two after? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other, besides that, of that sum? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it drawn upon? - A. Masterman's house.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 16th of March where did you place it? - A. In an open drawer in the accompting-house.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did you put it there? - A. For the purpose of answering a bill of that sum, which I expected to be called for, which I had accepted; it was entrusted to the care of all my clerks, or either of them, if I should not be in the way.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, when did you expect this bill to come in? - A. On the 17th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it come in? - A. Not on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the draft again? - A. I saw it so far as the 3d of April; on the 4th of April I did not look into the drawer; but on the 5th, I found several drafts in the drawer, but this for a hundred and ninety-eight pounds was missing; I sent Garnham, one of the clerks, to the bankers, and he learned that it was paid; Garnham produced me a draft.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same draft you had drawn upon Masterman, and put into the drawer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your inspection of the draft, was there any thing particular that you took notice of upon the draft? - A. I did not observe any thing particular, it was the same draft, only there was a one altered to a two.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Altered, where, in the sum? - A. No, in the date.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. However, you have no doubt it was the same draft? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Upon looking at the draft, can you venture to say it is the same? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How many years had this young man lived with you as clerk? - A. About four years.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of that time, I believe, you had entrusted him to the amount of many thousands? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to suspect, that in any one instance, except the one now in question, he has ever injured you in the smallest degree? - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you found, upon examination into your books, that this bill became due at a later time than you expected it would? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You, I believe, recovered all your property excepting a small sum? - A. I have not recovered any yet, it is in the hands of the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not firmly believe, in your own conscience, that at the time that bill would have been presented for payment, all the money would have been ready to discharge it? - A. From what I have heard since, I think it would.</p>
               <p>Q. You had, I take it for granted, an extremely good opinion of this young man, and his principles? - A. I always had.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing he was to remain in this country, have you that opinion of his good principles that you would trust him again in you service? - A. I would; he has got into some companies, and if he would relinquish them, I should have no objection.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing at any time, hereafter, he were to be proposed to you as a clerk, and to be trusted as before, would you again receive him? - A. I would.</p>
               <p>Garnham. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are clerk to Messrs. Benhacock, and Co.? - A. Yes; this draft was put into the drawer, and was under my care.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see it last? - A. On the 4th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave it you? - A. The bankers, Messrs. Masterman, and Company.</p>
               <p>Q. It had been paid? - A. It had, about an hour before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. It lay in the drawer with other drafts, which might have been made use of likewise? - A. Yes, which were not made use of.</p>
               <p>Q. And it lay there three weeks after it was drawn? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You had the rest? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose? - A. Burkett would, I believe, in the courseof a week or nine days, have made up the full remainder of the money, and then I should have thought myself indebted to Burkett for the money that I had.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose were you to have that money? - A. For my trouble in getting it discounted.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How much did you receive for your trouble? - A. Five or six pounds, I believe, I cannot say exactly to a pound.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any conversation took place relative to the draft between him and you? - A. Nothing more than he was very sorry for what he had done, that he was determined to negociate no more of the notes, but return it as soon as he possibly could.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a Police-officer belonging to Whitechapel; I apprehended the prisoner on Saturday, the 13th of April, at a house in White's-alley, Coleman-street; he was in bed with a young woman; I took up his clothes, in the presence of his cousin, and found a guinea, six half-guineas, and one seven-shilling-piece; in his inside coat-pocket, I took out a little red morocco pocket-book, and found a Bank of England note for the payment of one hundred pounds; it is a hundred pound Banknote No. 5384; a fifty pound note, No. 9588, a twenty pound note, No. 9134, I believe, but it is almost defaced. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him before he said any thing, to induce him to say any thing? - A. I had been with his father, and with his cousin, all the morning, to try to find him out before he had spent the money; when I found him, I put him and the girl into a coach; I asked him if this was the whole of the money; he said, there was a twenty-five pound note which was changed; I asked him how he came possessed of it, was it money that he had collected for his master; he said, no, it was part of a banker's check for a hundred and ninety-eight pounds, he said he had taken it from the accompting-house, from out of the drawer; I asked him if the drawer was locked; and he said, no, it was not, it was in a drawer with some other checks; I asked him if he received the money for the check; he said, no; a Mr. Smart, who was a sadler at the corner of Short-street, Moorfields, an acquaintance of his; that Smart had got a twenty-five pound note changed somewhere in Cheapside, but he did not know where, and had purchased some cloth to get it changed; I asked him if Smart knew that the note was a stolen one; he said, yes, he did; and was to have half of it for getting it changed, and that he had only received twelve pounds back as his share out of the note; I took him to the office, and Smart, by his information, was apprehended. (The draft read.)</p>

               <p>No. 142, White-hart-court, Lombard-street, 26th March, 1799. Messrs. Masterman, Walker, Peters, Mildred and Co. pay to Lightfoot and Tabrum, or bearer, one hundred and ninety-eight pounds.

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I applied to Smart, begging him to return me the money, that it might be appropriated to the purpose for which it was intended; he told me had given it to this woman to get it changed; I went with him to find this woman, and we could not; we went to several linen-draper's shops to stop her from changing the note, that I might have it to return; when she came back, I said, I must have all that you have got; I did not abscond from my business in any part of the time, expecting to make the money up.</p>

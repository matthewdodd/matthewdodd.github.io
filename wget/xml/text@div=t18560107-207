                  </hi>. I am a surveyor, and live at Brunswick-terrace, Wai<lb></lb>worth. On Monday afternoon, 10th Dec., I was passing along the Wal<lb></lb>worth-road between 3 and 4 o'clock, and somebody came and begged of me—it was broad daylight—I just turned my head round and observed that it was a man of colour, I am certain of that—I unbuttoned my coat, and felt in my pocket, but had no halfpence, I felt in another pocket and gave him a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—I fancied that black men are persons who cannot get employ<lb></lb>ment, he was shabbily dressed, and I thought he was out of work—I had then about one eighth of a mile to go to my gateway, and nothing attracted my attention till I was stooping to pull the lock of my gate, when I was struck on the back of the neck from behind, and knocked down insensible—I did not see any person—it must have been with something more than the fist, as the back of my head was swelled up with two large lumps—I recol<lb></lb>lect nothing from that time till I came to myself on the sofa in my parlour, and missed my watch and chain, which were safe when I opened my coat and gave him the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the chain went through a button hole of my waist<lb></lb>coat, and of my trowers also—I was quite sober, and had been looking over some old houses in West Smithfield—I saw the prisoner at the station a day or two afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am errand boy to Mr. Box, a grocer, of No. 6, Milk-street, South wark. On this day, about 4 o'clock, I was coming down Brunswick-terrace, Walworth-road, and saw Mr. Towell, who I knew by sight, because I work directly opposite—four young <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> were following him towards his own house—when I first saw them, I was not quite a quarter of a mile from them, but I got close to Mr. Towell, and the lads were standing talking to him—one of them was a black lad, and that is him (<hi rend="italic">pointing to the prisoner</hi>)—he was standing with one foot on the kerb, and the other in the road—another lad, genteelly dressed, said, "It is all right, governor; if you do not interfere with me, I shall not interfere with you"—the prosecutor walked on, and there was a short, stout young <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> further on, and on my right hand side, on the opposite side of the road, stood the prisoner and another one, while the one who was a yard from him was talking to him—a butter boy came by, and one of them said some<lb></lb>thing to him—(I have known the prisoner for four years—he lived two doors from me four years ago, and his father used to cut our hair)—I went on my journey with a wine basket on my arm, and had got nearly to the bottom of Brunswick-terrace when I heard running, and looked and saw all four of them running towards the Walworth-road—they ran part me directly I turned round—as the prisoner ran by me, he held his hand to the side of his face, so that if I had not seen him before, I should not have seen the colour of his face—I know that he is the same man, because I could see his back and the back of his head, and I knew him perfectly well—he ran along the kerb, up as far as French's, a quarter of a mile—he leaped off the kerb, and went over to the other side—I lost sight of them by the Red Lion public house—I then went into my master's, which is almost opposite Brunswick-terrace, and that is all I saw—Mr. Towell seemed a little the worse for liquor—he did not seem to walk as a sober man would—the prisoner had a hat on, and was dressed apparently like a young gentleman—I saw his face, and have no doubt that he is the man—while he was speaking to the gentleman, I saw Samuel Perry, a butter boy, going up towards Grosvenor-park.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butter boy, in the employ of Mr. William Carter, and live at No. 17 A, Trafalgar-street, Walworth. On that after<lb></lb>noon I was going along Brunswick-terrace, towards Groavenor-park, and saw the prisoner and four others in Brunswick-terrace—I was on the left side, and saw one young man go up to Mr. Towell, of No. 18, Brunswick<lb></lb>terrace, and try to trip him up—they were all following the gentleman—one of them wanted to shake hands with Mr. Towell, but he would not—he had one ring on his finger—I saw it distinctly—neither of them was the prisoner—Mr. Towell would not shake hands, and he said that it was all right, and turned back—Mr. Towell was proceeding on his journey home, and the next thing I saw was the prisoner on the left hand side of the road, making a urinal of the wall—the other lads left Mr. Towell, and when he had got about ten yards I heard a violent fall—(I had passed Mr. Towell on the opposite side of the way, facing him on his left)—I turned round, and saw a young man rifling the prosecutor, who was on the ground, of his watch—it was just opposite his own door: I have repeatedly seen him go in—one young man took a watch away from him, but this is not the man—I distinctly saw the watch in his hand—the other four were hanging about</p>

               <p>on the other side of the way, about twenty yards from the one who took the watch, and on the same side of the way as I was—the lad who took the watch ran up between the others, and they all decamped as hard as they could, hustling the watch between them from one to the other—I distinctly saw the man who took it, pass it to the prisoner, but did not see him pass it to anybody else—I have known the prisoner by sight seven or eight years, and am quite sure of him—I went across the road, and a milkman was passing, and we helped Mr. Towell up—I then left my basket at the gate, and ran after the lads, but could not see anything of them.</p>

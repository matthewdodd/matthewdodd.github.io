                  </hi>. I live in Drury-lane. At the time they say this robbery was committed, the prisoner was lying on his mother's bed in my room—they say this robbery was committed at half-past eight o'clock in the morning—I cannot say what day—I think it was on a Thursday—he was lying in his mother's bed in my room at ten minutes to nine—his mother and him, and four children, were all in one bed—they have lodged with me twelve months—the eldest of the children is about nineteen—that is the prisoner—the next is a daughter, about'sixteen—her name is Bridget Shay—I am no relation—the reason the prisoner was so long in bed, was, he had been run over by a gentleman's carriage in Long-acre, and he was lying in bed with a lump on his shoulder—I think it was on Saturday he was run over—I heard of his being taken on the night following—he did not come home on the Thursday evening—his mother told me, about eight o'clock on the Friday morning, that he had been taken about half-past nine at night—I was not called before the Magistrate—his mother told me to come here to-day—I cannot tell whether she went to Bow-street to state that he was ill in bed—it was on Thursday morning, to the best of my recollection, that I saw him in bed—I cannot tell what day of the month it was—I got up about eight that morning, and his mother got up shortly after I got up—we were at breakfast when they came in, about a quarter of an hour or ten minutes to nine—the prisoner was able to be up and out in ten minutes—his mother was waiting for him to have breakfast—he had breakfast before he went out—he had left the house when the officer came.</p>

I did not miss that; I immediately dressed myself, and went into Drury-lane, and called the watch, and Thomas Adams came up; I told him I had been robbed of my watch, at No. 5, Orange-court; I asked him to go with me; he went and searched the place, but could find nothing; I found the prisoner about a quarter of a mile off, at her father and mother's; the watchman said he knew her; she was in bed with a child; as soon as I saw her I knew her, and said, that is the woman; the watchman searched for the watch, and found it locked up in the cupboard, in the room; the watchman made her dress herself, and took her to the watch-house; I gave full charge of her; the watchman has the watch.</p>

               <p>I was a watchman in the same street where this man was robbed; he called watch; I went to his assistance; he gave a description of the girl, and we got an information where her father and mother lived; accordingly we went about a quarter of a mile off, to Craven's-yard, St. Clement's parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be perfectly sober at the time? - A. He appeared to be quite sober; we went to her father's apartment; we called her mother by name; she refused to let us in; the door was not locked, and we went in and found the prisoner in bed with a little girl; as soon as the prosecutor saw her face, he said, that was the same woman that was in company with him; we asked her if she knew any thing of the watch, and she said no; there were three boxes one over the other; and a key lay on the box; she said that was a key that belonged to a box she had in the house; I asked for the keys of the other boxes, and her mother delivered them to me; I searched the boxes, but could not find the watch; there was a cupboard of which she would not let me have the key; one of the watchmen took a pair of pincers that lay in the room, and wrenched open the lock, and I found the watch in the cupboard.

Yes; we went and searched, but no watch was to be found; we had information of her father's house, and went and found her in bed with a child; there was a cupboard in the room, we demanded the key, she would not give it, and my partner took up a pair of pinchers and forced open the lock, and found the watch.</p>

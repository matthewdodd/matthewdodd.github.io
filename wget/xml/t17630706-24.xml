            . I am a Goldsmith, I live at the bottom of the Minories. On the 31st of March, about 4 or 5 in the afternoon, the prisoner at the bar, and another man, who called himself Brown, came into my shop, and said they wanted some plate, I shewed them some, they were both in deep mourning; Brown said, he was going to settle at Gravesend; they bought to the amount of 27 l. 4 s. 10 d. Brown offered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176307060011"></xptr> me a Bank note for 200 l. payable to Castles and Wheatley. I told them there very few tradesmen kept so much cash by them, and said have you no smaller notes? then the prisoner said to the other, you have smaller notes, you may as well give them a smaller, upon that Brown delivered to me this 25 l. note here produced, and the prisoner paid me the remainder in money; they both seemed equally concerned in buying the plate and in chusing it out. The prisoner looked out a pair of gold sleeve mocha buttons, I asked him 25 s. for them, he bid me a guinea; one looked out a silver milk pot, then the other looked out another, they had also two pair of salts; the prisoner looked the things out equally as much as the other. Brown said he belonged to the Hector, Williams, that he had belonged to the India trade 21 years; he look'd very brown, more like a Jew; he was considerably shorter than the prisoner; I observed the prisoner was always putting his left hand up to his neck below his ear. My young man made observation on that afterwards, that he had a fear there, which I observed when I saw him before Sir

            . I was 15 years of age last Michaelmas. On the last day of March, betwixt the hours of 4 and 5, the man at the bar, and another man, both in black, came to Mr. Reynold's house, they wanted some plate; they asked for a tea-pot, they bought a silver tankard, salt-sellers, 2 milk-pots, a pair of stone shoe-buckles, and in all laid out 27 l. 4 s. I think this man looked the plate out as well as the other. The short one said his name was Brown, he offered my master a note, he said he was going to live at Gravesend; he offered master a large note, master asked him if he had not smaller; then the prisoner said to the other, you have a smaller; then Brown gave master a note of 25 l. the prisoner paid the rest in money, which was 2 guineas and 2 s. I am quite sure the prisoner was one of them, I took particular notice of his face, and minded a scar on the left side of his neck, which he kept rubbing with his hand; I mentioned that to my master the same day after they were gone.</p>

            , goldsmith and jeweller, in Aldgate High Street. On the 31st of March last, about 9 at night, somebody rang at the door, I opened it, there were two men came in, they said they wanted half a dozen table spoons, and half a dozen of tea spoons; my master was not at home, mistress came into the shop and served them. After they had agreed for the price, one of them pulled out a pocket book, he said he had not money enough, and mistress must change a 20 l. bank note, there were several notes in it; he delivered a 20 l. note to mistress, and she bid me carry it to my master at the Blue Boar Inn, and desire him to come home and change it; the goods came to about 5 l. Mr. Barlow came home and paid the money. As I was going out at the door for my master, I saw two men dressed in mourning, I passed by them, and looked hard at them, and they at me, I having the note in my hand was a little dubious of them; when I returned I saw one of them standing in the same place, the other was gone, to the best of my knowledge the prisoner was one of them, there was a lamp just by, they had bundles under their arms, I believe the prisoner was the man I saw alone, the other was a shorter thick man. I saw the prisoner since at Justice Fielding's on the 7th of June, and I now believe he was one of them; the people that came in, one was a talk thin man pitted with the small pox, dressed in brown, they went away towards White-chapel-bars, I shut the door, and did not observe whether they joyned the two in mourning.</p>

The book was soon missed, and the gentleman seemed to have a suspicion of Brinklow and me, and followed us, and kept near us till we came to the water side by London-Bridge; he said nothing to us; we called a boat to go over, he called another; the boats came pretty close together; we paid the waterman and got away, he did not follow us any farther; soon after that, Brinklow and I lost each other, being in a hurry I went below London-Bridge, and took water, and then went to one Lumbley's in Golden-Lane, the sign of the Raven and Crown, where I expected they all would have came, (we all frequented that house) I found they were gone to James Hall's, a house in Gray's Inn Lane; I went to the Sun where I used to feed my horses, and was told that Cole had been to enquire for me, and that he was gone to James Hall's; there I found Brinklow, Parsons, Hayes, and Watson, all together. They told me they were glad to see me, they thought I was taken up; there Parsons produced a Bank post-bill for 20 l. they said that was all the notes contained in the pocket-book, it was made payable to

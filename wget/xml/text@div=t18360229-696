                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Grundy-street, in the parish of All Saints, Poplar. I had purchased a pig at Leadenhall-market on the 13th of February—I paid a man to take it to my house, and put in on the table in the front room on the ground floor—I stopped at home for two hours, and had occassion to go to town to meet my daughter between nine and ten o'clock at night—my two sons went with me—I have no wife living—I shut the door—it has a spring lock—that is the way we generally leave it—it has no key—it may be opened by pushing hard against it with the knee—the window and outside shutter was shut—I re<lb></lb>turned about ten o'clock—I found the door as had I left it—we missed the pig off the table, and my jacket—we could not tell how they got in—we found the house as we left it—next evening about seven o'clock I went out from my house across the way, and about two hundred yards up the street I met the policeman—while we were talking the prisoner's brother Ferguson came up—he had some pork wrapped up in a towel—I think three or four joints—the pork that was on my table was entire, not separated at all—I could not swear to it when it was cut up—there was no one with Ferguson—I gave him in charge—I then went to the house, and met the prisoner and another woman coming after the man we had seized—they were about two hundred yards from him—I saw the jacket again before the Magistrate—the prisoner has been in the habit of coming to my house—my daughter had employed her to come and assist in cutting out shirts and making gar<lb></lb>ments for about five or six months; in fact, two or three years when my wife was alive—when I saw the prisoner coming with the pork, I told her I thought they had had plenty of trouble with the pork, she had better drop it—the women had each of them got some pork—she began to beg my pardon, and a great deal of it—I told here we had taken one, who was gone to the watch-house, and the thing was gone into the hands of the police, and must go forward—she then began to exclaim about her children—she said she had left her two children at home, and she wished to go there—the policeman said there was no objection, and we went to the</p>

After I took the man to the station-house, I went to the prisoner's house, and saw her—I heard her begging Mr. Johnson to forgive her—I took her to the station-house—Daniel Ferguson is her brother—he said he bought the pork from her—she made some remark, I believe it was, "I know you did"—I asked her what she had done with the jacket—she said, it was at her house, up-stairs in the bedroom—I went there and found it—this is it—I found the flare of the pig in the kitchen, in the same house.</p>

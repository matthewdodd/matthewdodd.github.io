               <p>Court. I think the Court ought not to interpose in this business, but leave you to take the usual remedy; and my reason is this, that the ground before the Court for the acquittal of the prisoner, is not the falsity but the incompetency of the witnesses; now we can never presume, that what a witness would say who is rejected for total incompetency, would not have put the prisoner upon his defence; if Boyce had been examined as a competent witness, and you could then have found a want of evidence, I should not have hesitated: but however, the Court is not limited as to the time when they may grant a copy of an indictment.</p>

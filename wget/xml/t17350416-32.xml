I felt her Hand at my Breeches, and missing my Money, I seiz'd her directly, and charged her with picking my Pocket. She asked me what I had lost? I told her a Guinea, three half Guineas, and a half Crown. She gave me this White Half-penny, and said, There's your Guinea, and then shifted her Hands behind her. Several People coming up, I dragged her along. She gave me then a counterfeit Half Crown, two Irish Half-pence, and a Scotch Half-penny, and said, There is all your Money again. I took her to the Watch House, where she was searched, but nothing of mine being found upon her, I went back to where I lost my Money, and I found it all again except the Half Crown.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This Man meeting me on Sunday Night by the Quarters in Moor Fields, Ye Bitch, says he, You have robbed me, and afterwards put this bad Money into my Pocket. Look in my Face, says I, Do I look like a Whore. No, says he, But you are a thieving Bitch; and so he carried me to the Watch House, where the Men stript me naked, but could not find that I had got any thing.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When she picked my Pocket there was no other Person near me, and I seiz'd her that instant, and did not let her go.</p>

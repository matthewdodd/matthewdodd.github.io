                  </hi> I am the wife of John Ford, a cabinet-maker, of Brook-street, Lambeth. On the evening of the 1st Nov., I was in Kenningtes-lane, about ten minutes before eight o'clock—the prisoner spoke to me—I had seen him in the street before, and knew him well by sight—he got into talk with me about the weather—I went and had a glase of ale with him is Mansion-house-street, at a little beer-shop—while there I took out my watch to look what time it was—it wanted ten minutes to eight o'clock—the prisoner was present and the gentleman behind the bar—I came out of the door—the prisoner followed me—I bid him good night, and said, "Thank you"—I went straight down Mansion-house-street—when I got half-way down, I looked behind, and saw him following me—I kept on till I got to the end of the street—I turned, and saw him again—I turned to the left, to go down Kennington-row—I still saw him following me—I saw a turning with a pawnbroker's at the corner—I knew it brought me out opposite the school, and turned down there—the commencement of it is rather dark—I did not see the prisoner there, but as soon as I got round the corner he flew on me, and caught hold of me—I have not any doubt it was the prisoner—he threw me down, and he got my cloak open, and pulled the watch out of my bosom by the guard, and my purse with 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it, and kicked me in the side—he did not break the guard, but wrenched the watch from it—when I was on the ground I saw him with my watch in his hand—he was gone almost in<lb></lb>stantly—while he was getting it, I was scrambling to get from him, but I was so confused that I could neither halloo nor speak.</p>

               <p>was not the least expression of it on his part or mine—I did not say anything about paying a shilling for the room—I did not say I knew a place that would do instead of a room—nothing of the kind was mentioned—on my oath, I had not been with the prisoner that night—I did not go into a court with him—if he said that he had connexion with me it was not true—I had no wrangle with him about money—I was robbed once before. when the house was robbed, a year and eight months ago—I was not intoxicated that evening—I had been to tea at Vauxhall, and was going home to 70, Brook-street—I was not going the nearest way—I wanted to take something home with me—I left the prisoner at the door of the house, and had no more con<lb></lb>versation with him—a young man came into the public-house—he asked him for two farthings for a halfpenny, and he gave them to him—there were no persons passing where the prisoner robbed me—it was by the side of the pawnbroker's just against the wall—I wanted to avoid him, and I took a turning that would have taken me to kennington-lane—I saw him by the shop as far from me as the width of this Court—I did not notice whether I passed many persons in going from the public-house—I was knocked down in the mud on my left side—a woman was going into the pawnbroker's or standing by the front door, and I was by the side door, a little further down than the door—I was so frightened, I could not halloo—I screamed out after I got up when my fright was over—I do not know whether the woman was by the door then—I did not see her afterwards; I did go that way when I got up, I went to Kennington-lane, and turned to my right—I should think it is about a quarter of a mile from the station—I went to the station instantly—I did not abuse the prisoner because he did not give me money—I never spoke to him after I bid him good night.</p>

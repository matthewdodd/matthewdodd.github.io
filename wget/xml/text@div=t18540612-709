On 3rd June., about 9 o'clock at night, the prisoner came and asked for two pounds of bacon; I cut it—my mistress who was on the other side of the shop, said aloud in the pri<lb></lb>soner's hearing, that she did not like the lady's proceedings; she went round, felt down the prisoner's left side and said, "She has got a ham"—the prisoner said, "Oh, you wicked woman" or "bad woman"—I then stepped to the prisoner's side, and saw a ham fall from under her clothes on the left side—I went for a policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a cheesemonger's shop, at No. 124, Bishops-gate-street. On 3rd June, a little after 9 o'clock in the evening, the pri<lb></lb>soner came and asked for a piece of bacon—I saw her reaching across and taking a ham out of the window, I went nearly to the bottom of the shop and told my young man that I did not like that woman at the ham—I spoke rather loudly, but I think it is impossible that the prisoner could hear—I went round the counter, and felt a ham on the prisoner's left side—I said, "She has a ham"—she was dressed in black, with a large cloak on—I threw it open, and went to take the ham; she said, "You wicked</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were behind the counter when you said that you did not like her proceedings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; she was near the door when the ham dropped from her; it was about three or four feet from where she took it—there might be a dozen people or more in the shop; it was very full indeed—this is the ham (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was not wrapped in a cloth, as it is now—it has been at the station house ever since.</p>

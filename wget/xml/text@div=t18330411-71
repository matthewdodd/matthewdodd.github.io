               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a young man in Goswell-street; he gave me these articles, and told me to go and sell them - he told me where to go, but said he did not like to go there himself, as he had borrowed a bridle there; they offered me 4s. 6d., which he would not take - I brought it out, and he told me to carry it, which I did.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM FAULKENER. I do not think the prisoner knew my premises, but there was another man who did.</p>

            . I am one of the City day patrol. On the 23d of May, about a quarter before eleven o'clock in the morning, I was on Holborn-bridge, and saw the three prisoners following two gentlemen up Skinner-street, till they came to Snow-hill; the gentlemen then both crossed over, and went on towards Newgate-street; the prisoners turned about in another direction, and in a few minutes I saw them following a gentleman who had a small part of his handkerchief hanging out of his coat pocket - they continued to follow him, and when they got within a few yards of <placeName id="t18270531-18-crimeloc83">Hatton-garden</placeName>

I was on the opposite side. I ran across, and secured Croson - Lovell, who was with me, took another of them; I put Croson into the watch-house, which is close by, and then ran to assist Lovell, who had hold of one of the prisoners; Cox had the other - I am sure they were all three in company, and close together at the time the handkerchief was taken. I found two handkerchiefs in Croson's hat. I do not know the gentleman - I had no opportunity of informing him.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was coming down Hatton-garden, and heard a cry of Stop thief! Saunders was running, pursued by several - he ran the fastest, but I stopped him; Lovell came up, and charged him with picking a gentleman's pocket. I took him to the watch-house. Wiltshire produced a red and yellow handkerchief from Croson, and I have another yellow one found in his hat.</p>

            . I was on Holborn-bridge, and saw the three prisoners following two gentlemen; they left them by Snow-hill, and turned back - a gentleman passed them, whom they immediately followed; he had a parcel in each hand, and his handkerchief hung a little out of his pocket. Between Ely-place and Hatton-garden I saw Saunders take the handkerchief, and give it to Croson; the three prisoners were then together; I and Wiltshire directly crossed - they were then turning up Hatton-garden; Wiltshire took Croson, and I took Vicary - Cox took Saunders; I saw two handkerchiefs found on Croson - one of which was red, with a border to it, and that was the one he took from the gentleman's pocket - it has not been claimed.</p>

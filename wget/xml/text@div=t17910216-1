               <p>Was it smooth on each side? - Remarkably smooth on the plain side, where the heads were not; my husband gave it to me on the Sunday morning; I did not take any notice of it till Mr. Ree refused it: (looks at it): to the best of my knowledge I think this is the half-crown; it is hard to swear; but I could almost take upon me to swear it.</p>

            . By this halfpenny being in the till; I had seen it several times in the till; I might have seen it in that day; I should know it again by being a Welch harp, and a piece cut off; I do not recollect any other particular mark; this is the halfpenny; I will swear to it; I never offered it to any body because it had been refused so often.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The very afternoon of this robbery I was coming from Deptford with a shipmate; we stopped to have something to eat and drink; we paid our reckoning; I wanted change for half a guinea; some people, that were travellers or riders, gave me the change provided I took them halfpence; they gave us a half crown and some halfpence; we came into Bishopsgate-street; my shipmate picked up a young woman; we went and had something to drink in the course of ten minutes, and he went away with the young woman; she said she lived at Hoxton; they stood at the door and talked about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; says I, if you go up stairs I want to go some where; I said I wanted to ease myself; says the young woman, if you go over some pales I will let you out, and you may come to us again; I went and heard the alarm of stop thieves; I was in the necessary; a woman came and took me; I told her I would give a good account of myself; I followed this good woman into her house, and as soon as I got into her door the man laid hold of me: they did; they took me to the watch-house; they asked me what money I had about me? I said I had change for half a guinea; says they, have you any half crowns? I said, yes; one: a man in the watch-house said, I believe this is my half crown; says I, swear to it if you think proper; I said, I had a small quantity of silver besides; I was locked up in a cage in this watch-house; I was there three quarters of an hour; then this Armstrong came and said, I believe I know you, says he; says I, I am just come from sea; I have not been in London: I took part of my money out of my pocket, and he took part, and the prosecutor was there, and Armstrong said, now tell me what you have lost? says he, to the best of my opinion I think three or four shillings-worth of halfpence; have not you lost nothing else? says Armstrong; yes, says he, half a crown: he went home to see; and Armstrong said, cannot you swear to this piece of a halfpenny? I said, says I, Mr. Armstrong, I took you to be a gentleman; I see plainly now what you are; you belong to the justice; you want to swear my life away: the next morning I was taken before the justice; he asked me what I had to say? I told him that was not a place for justice; says Harper, who was there, you villain, do you know what you are saying? says he, you villain, I will knock you down; says I, it is no service to say any thing at all. I have not a friend in the world; I have not been at home for six years; my chief witness when I got change at this publick house, he was a rider, a traveller; I sent a letter to this place, and they said, it was unknown when he would be at home; I subpoened him. When the man gave me the half crown, he said, this is a very pretty half crown, it will serve<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160007"></xptr>some of your girls; they like such half crowns.</p>

B. on it; it cost me 27s. two months before - I left the articles stated in the indictment in it, which were worth 5l. I went about six weeks ago to fetch it, and it was gone; I had not been there in the interval. I went about a week afterwards to the prisoner, whom I knew before by sight - I said I heard he had taken my trunk; he said he had not, but he knew who had it; I said I should see further into it - he said Forsyth and Clarke had taken it, and sold it for 16s. - I knew them by sight; he spoke about the trunk, but did not mention its contents; I have not seen it or its contents since; I did not leave it in any one's care, and told no one that I had left it there; I was frequently going there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You knew the prisoner before? A. Yes, and I knew the other men by sight; they lodged in the same house. No application was made to the Magistrate for a warrant to apprehend Clarke and Forsyth, in my hearing. Forsyth is gone to Scotland. I met Clarke in Drury-lane since, but did not speak to him; I lost sight of him all at once - I do not know that he ran - he merely passed me; he was walking, bot when he saw me he got out of my sight; I did not follow him - I saw him afterwards come out of the Temple, but did not speak to him, as he ran off; I pursued, but did not cry Stop thief! he was not taken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was your box covered with nails? A. There were brass nails round the lid.</p>
               <p>SARAH SEYMOUR. I keep the Black Boy and Apple Tree public-house, in the parish of St. Martin's in the Fields, and am a widow. I saw Beattie at my house six months ago. A dark trunk, covered with leather and brass nails, with the initials J. B. on it, stood on my third floor landing-place, for five or six months. I never knew who it belonged to; I have several lodgers; I do not know how it went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is yours a house of call for journeymen bakers? A. Yes. The trunk was not left in my care - I have four or five lodgers at a time, sometimes six - it is an open landing-place; Clarke and Forsyth lodged with me five or six months, and left about seven weeks ago; they went away within a day or two of each other; there was no alarm about the trunk then; I have not seen them since. I think other boxes stood there.</p>

            . I am son of the last witness. I have known the prisoner about six months, by his club being held at our house. I was taking something up to a gentleman in the parlour some time ago, and saw the prisoner taking<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070031"></xptr>the box in question out of my mother's house - it was a dark leather box - I think black; it had brass nails round the top, and the initials J. B. or I. B., about the middle of the lid, in brass nails. I went to my mother, and told her Serringour was taking away his box, not knowing but it belonged to him - I took no further notice, and do not know what became of him; I at first saw him on the landing, and when I came down from the parlour he was gone. I had seen it on the third-floor landing-place once or twice, but never took particular notice of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many lodgers were there? A. I cannot say - there were several bakers, who were out of place. I thought the box might belong to the prisoner, though it had those initials; Clarke left the house about a week or a fortnight afterwards - Forsyth left a little before. I do not know of their being wanted on this charge.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. I apprehended the prisoner on the 29th of November, at a baker's shop at Westminster - I had received information of this robbery two days before - I said I took him on suspicion of stealing Beattie's trunk, and asked if he knew any thing about it - he said he did, that a man, whose name he mentioned, (and which I think was Forsyth,) and another man, had told him they had taken the box away from the Black Boy and Apple Tree - he said he had taken a box from there and could produce it, and the person it belonged to - I took him to the office - the man did not appear there, nor produce the box - since that I have had a warrant against Clarke.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prisoner deny the robbery? A. Yes - he was servant at the shop where I took him.</p>

            . I am a journeyman baker, and lodge at Mrs. Seymour's. I left, on the 3d of September, leaving my box there for two days, and desired the prisoner to move it for me, which he did, and delivered it safely to me - I did not pay him any thing for doing it - it is covered with black leather and has brass nails - here it is (producing it).</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why did you not take it yourself? A. It was Sunday, I could not find time to fetch it - I lived at Mr. Horton's, Clifton-street, Finsbury, at the time, and the prisoner was living at Mrs. Seymour's - I have had the box three months - I bought it of Forsyth - it was open when I bought it - I gave 6s. and another box for it - all my clothes were in it when the prisoner fetched it - I was not before the Magistrate, and did not hear of this till last Saturday week.</p>
               <p>JOHN BEATTIE. This box is not mine.</p>

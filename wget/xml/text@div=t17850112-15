               <p>On Friday night last about ten minutes after four in the afternoon, I was robbed at a place called <placeName id="t17850112-15-crimeloc86">Crouch-end</placeName>

               <p>Did you know him immediately? - I did, my watch was never found again, there was a watch found at Islington the next day, but it did not prove to be mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Mr. Cook, you did not know this young man before the time you was stopped, I take it for granted? - No.</p>
               <p>Did I understand you right, that he followed the chaise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he come up the near side? - No, the off side, Mrs. Cook's side.</p>
               <p>He was not a minute? - No.</p>
               <p>He used expressions that very much alarmed you, for Mrs. Cook if not for yourself? - I was not alarmed, it is not the first time I have been robbed in this manner.</p>
               <p>Describe how the handkerchief was put on his face? - In this manner under the nose.</p>
               <p>You spoke as differently before you put on the handkerchief, as you do from me, so that it would seem, having heard a man's voice once through the handkerchief, you would not venture to swear to it? - I heard him speak the second time, without the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Did you know him when you saw him in Clerkenwell? - I was sensible he was the person, but when he robbed me his coat was buttoned up to the top, I asked for a Mr. Brown, he very politely got up, and said his name was Brown; he said, he had no other handkerchief but this, but he had another on when he robbed me, which was afterwards smothered, and was not to be found.</p>
               <p>Was you sure of him the first time, when you saw him at Clerkenwell? - I was more sure of him the second time, when I saw him as he robbed me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120028"></xptr>When you saw him the second time, had you any doubt about him? - I might have some little doubt.</p>
               <p>Had you, Sir? - I had.</p>
               <p>Was that doubt removed when you came before the Magistrate? - It was.</p>
               <p>Am I to understand you that when you was first before the Magistrate, you was as positive that Brown was the person that robbed you, as you are now? - I was, but Mrs. Cook, after this, said to me, my dear Jem, I shall never be happy if you swear to the man.</p>
               <p>My question to you is, whether before the Magistrate you swore with positiveness and certainty, that he was the man the first time? - I did not swear at all concerning it, I was affraid to swear at that time, I said he was the man.</p>
               <p>How do you mean you did not swear, you was sworn to your examination? - Then I swore he was the man.</p>
               <p>Did you before the Magistrate, immediately say he was the man that robbed you? - I did, I knew him to be the man then.</p>
               <p>Did you say it then? - I did say then, that he was the man, I knew he was the man all the way through.</p>
               <p>I must be very particular, and you will excuse me if I am so, I wish to treat you as I would every other gentleman in the situation of a witness, did you before the Magistrate, when you first saw this man, positively swear he was the man that robbed you? - I acquainted the Justice that I verily believed he was the man, I was sure when I saw the handkerchief, and saw him buttoned up, I said, I had every reason to believe he was the man.</p>
               <p>Was not he dressed on purpose that you might believe he was the man? - I know his dress well.</p>
               <p>I ask you a plain question, and I shall begin to alter my opinion of you, if you answer me in this manner; was not this man dressed for the purpose of your being able to identify him? - He was.</p>
               <p>Was not that in consequence of your doubts about him? - He appeared very differently, I had a desire to see him as he robbed me.</p>
               <p>Then before you saw him in that dress, you had not positively sworn to him? - I said before the Justice, that I verily believed he was the man.</p>


               <p>Upon your oath, before he was dressed with his great coat buttoned up, and his handkerchief before his face, did you positively swear he was the man? - I still say, that I acquainted the Justice that I verily believed he was the man.</p>
               <p>Court. But before he was dressed, did you tell the Justice whether he was the man or not? - I did.</p>
               <p>What did you say? - I told him he was the man that robbed me, and afterwards I knew him well, exceedingly well; I am sorry to say it, he is the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You say,</p>
               <p>"and afterwards you was sure of it," was not he dressed because you had some doubt about swearing to him? - I begged it as a favour that his coat might be buttoned.</p>
               <p>Did you beg that on account of some hesitation? - No.</p>
               <p>For what reason then? - I had no doubt about it, I only wanted to see him in the situation he was in when he robbed me, that was my whole reason.</p>
               <p>I ask you, Sir, whether previous to your having desired that he might be so clothed, you had positively charged him to the Magistrate to be the man? - I had in my own mind.</p>
               <p>Had you to the Magistrate? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>How long had the man been out of sight who had robbed you? - There was not four minutes between the robbery and their setting off, it was an hour and a quarter before I heard any thing more, I am not positive as to the time.</p>
               <p>What sort of an evening was it? - A very fine one.</p>
               <p>Court. If you had met the prisoner in a different dress in any part of the town, and in different coloured clothes, should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120029"></xptr> you have known him? - Upon my word, I do not think I should.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the post-boy that drove Mr. Cook; I pursued after the person that committed the robbery, about three or four minutes I drove down the hill, and a man came out of one of the houses and joined me, I took one of the chaise horses.</p>
               <p>How soon did you get sight of the man you was in pursuit of? - I cannot say, I did not get sight of him till I came near Holloway turnpike, that is between three and four miles from the place where the robbery was committed, after we got sight of the person, the gentleman that was with me rode up close to him at Holloway turnpike.</p>
               <p>How long was it after you first got sight of him, that you came up with him? - Four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>I suppose you rode pretty hard from Crouch-end? - Yes, we galloped all the way.</p>
               <p>Was the man on a gallop? - Yes, I did not speak to him till he was taken, I saw the gentleman ride up close to him, but I did not hear what passed.</p>
               <p>How far might you be behind? - Two hundred yards, when I came up he was dismounted, and in the sign of the Fox through Holloway, at Islington, then the gentleman asked me if that was the man, I said yes, I knew him immediately when I went into the house.</p>
               <p>How long did he stay with your chaise? - No longer than he had the money and the watch, he followed the chaise, he was dressed in a Bath great-coat buttoned, and a white handkerchief over his face, as high as his nose.</p>
               <p>You sitting on your horse, and he at the chaise with his face half covered, could you know him again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>By what did you know him? - I knew him by his coat, and hat, and horse, it was a brown bay horse, with a swish tail.</p>
               <p>Had you seen him in a different dress and without his horse, should you have known him? - Yes, I should have known him by his voice.</p>
               <p>When a man's mouth is covered, is his voice the same as if it is not? - Yes, it appeared so to me.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole are you quite sure he is the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were you sure of him when you first saw him at the Fox? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you always said so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The person that robbed your master came up suddenly? - Yes, on the off side.</p>
               <p>There was a part of the carriage between you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he turn his horse round, or come up? - He came up, his horse's head was the same way as mine, as soon as he robbed my master, I stood up in my stirrups and looked over, and he was off his horse.</p>
               <p>Court. What was he doing? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You did not take much notice, you pursued him in less than three minutes, when did you see the swish tail? - Whilst he was robbing the chaise.</p>
               <p>That is pretty well sworn I think, how many turnings are there between Crouch-end and Holloway-turnpike? - I cannot tell you.</p>
               <p>There are a great many, I think I can enumerate seven or eight, was there any watch found upon him, when he was taken? - No.</p>
               <p>No property of Mr. Cook's or Mrs. Cook's? - None that I know of.</p>
               <p>Was his hat a round hat? - It was flapped before.</p>
               <p>Put on that handkerchief before your mouth, now do not you find your voice a little altered Mr. Post-boy? - No not much.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I went in pursuit of of this man between two and three miles, I was twenty yards from Holloway-turnpike.</p>
               <p>When you got sight of that man how<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120030"></xptr> came you to take particular notice of him? - I was at Crouch-end, at one Mr. Wright's, Mr. Cook and his Lady came down there in a post-chaise, and he stopped the chaise and said, he was robbed of his watch and seven guineas; he said, he might be easily taken, I said, I had my horse in the stable.</p>
               <p>Court. But how came you to take notice of that man when you had never seen him before? - Mr. Cook said he had a light coloured great coat on, and a swished tailed horses.</p>
               <p>What pace was he riding when you first saw him? - He was a gentle pace just going through the turnpike, I came on smart, and came up to him about twenty yards this side the turnpike.</p>
               <p>Did he quicken his pace at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you rode pretty hard from Crouch-end? - Yes, as hard as I could.</p>
               <p>Was you pretty well mounted? - Yes; when I came up to him, I said it is very cold Sir, yes says he it is, he then mended his pace, and rode on a very gentle canter, I then asked him why he rode so hard, and he made answer and said, it was very cold, he then mended his pace faster and faster, till he rode as fast as he could, I wished for that Post-boy to come on, and the prisoner mended his pace as fast as he could and I as fast as I could, going up the rise of the hill, I cried out this is a highwayman, stop him, he went on, and I cried out stop him as loud as I could, he rode over a man and knocked him down on the long side of a waggon, he then came a little on this side of Islington Church, and then whether his horse slipt, or whether he fell, I cannot tell which, I was about nine or ten yards from him, I desired the people to hold him a minute while I fetched the post-boy, that he might be right in the person, the post-boy came up directly, and said that is the man; the prisoner was then on foot, the horse run away a little way, the horse was stopped, and put up at the Pyed Bull in Islington, it is now in the yard.</p>
               <p>What time in the evening was this when you came up with him at Holloway turnpike? - I take it, when Mr. Cook came to Mr. Wright's, it was twenty minutes past four, it was not five; when I came up to him it could not be above forty minutes after four, nor that; it was beginning to grow dusk, but it was lightish.</p>

               <p>Did you observe any thing particular when you came up along side of him? - I said to myself as I went along, how am I to know this man, and I recollected Mr. Cook said what was the colour of his coat, and about his horse's tail.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing particular about him or his horse? - He had a great coat, and a horse with a swish tail, it appeared to me to be a slender horse, a kind of blood horse in poorish condition.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether he was or was not dirty? - I cannot say that I took notice of it.</p>
               <p>Did the horse appear very hot? - No, he did not appear to be very hot, he did not seem to sweat when I first came up to him; he was hot when he was stopped.</p>
               <p>What condition was your horse in? - In good riding order.</p>
               <p>Was your horse hot? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The post-horse was blown so he could not keep up with you? - He was pretty hot.</p>

               <p>What account did he give of himself? - Mr. Blackborough asked him how he came on that road at that time; he said he had been out as he usually did, for his own diversion and pleasure, and that he took the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120031"></xptr> pistol with him as a defence, having several times been attacked by footpads; when I took the pistol out of the prisoner's pocket, I asked him if it was loaded, and he said it was, but I found it was not.</p>
               <p>Court to Hurgood. After the conversation about the weather being cold, and his quickening his pace, did any thing more pass between you? - No.</p>

On Monday, the 10th of January, the prisoner came to my house, with my wife's sister; she being a poor creature, my wife took her in, out of charity: on the Wednesday following, in the morning, she went away privately, and the things mentioned in the indictment, were missing at the time. I took the prisoner up, and she owned to the taking the things, and I have the greatest part of them here, which she had pawned to three pawnbrokers; and went with me and the constable for them. She says, she is but 19 years of age.</p>

On the 29th of October, between twelve and one o'clock, Baker came into the shop with another boy, whom I believe to be Scroggins, but cannot swear to him - one of them asked for a halfpenny ball of cotton; I said I had none but three-farthing balls - he said he would go and ask his mother if that would do, and left the shop - the same two boys returned in about ten minutes, with the witness Bowman; that was the first time I saw him - we were very busy; I was at the further end of the shop, and was called to attend them - they asked for a ball of cotton, which I gave them, and they left; they were not there three minutes, and were altogether; this was on Thursday, and on the Saturday an officer came, and asked if we had lost a piece of silk - my young man looked, and missed a piece of gros de Naples, which I had seen on the counter with several others at the very time the boys came in; it has not been found - it was a blue black, and worth 5l.</p>

I have known the prisoners six<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030065"></xptr>months: I was going up Whitechapel one day last month, between one and two o'clock, and saw them - they said,"Dick, here is a nick for a roll of squeeze;" that means, a chance for a roll of silk - they went into the prosecutor's shop, and asked for a halfpenny ball of cotton, then came out and I went in with them; they made me take the silk off the counter and put it under my coat - they kept touching my toe for me to take it; I carried it a little way -Scroggins then took it, and carried it into James' house; he went in first, Baker and I next - Scroggins said, "Mrs. James, I have got a roll of silk;" she said, "Oh, you young rascal, where did you get it?" he said, "Out of Whitechapel;" Baker said, "A shilling a yard" - Scroggins said,"No, we will take nothing less than 18d.;" she said she would give us that - she pulled it off the roll and measured it; there were forty yards and three quarters; she asked us to give her that bit for a bonnet, and we said Yes - she gave us a half sovereign, and told us to come at six o'clock and she would give us the rest; it came to 3l. - my share was 13s. 6d. - they gave me 3s. 6d. out of the half-sovereign: I went with them at six o'clock - they got 1l. 19s. 6d., and gave me a half-sovereign, and told me I must be contented with that; it was a blue black silk - John James, her husband, was looking over the shopboard with a drover; Scroggins said to me, "Ayn't you going to stand any gin, stand half a pint;" I gave them 6l. - Mr. James gave the drover a bottle, and he went and fetched the gin, and poured out a glass for a baker who was there, sitting by the fire.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was all the talk about the silk before the drover? A. Yes; I am sure of that - I always heard the prisoners call silk a roll of squeeze; I know I am not very honest - I am nearly fourteen years old: I was accused of robbing my master, Mr. Plumber, of Eastcheap, of silver spoons - my mother paid for them.</p>

I keep the Falcon in Church-street, Newington—on 19th November, about 6 o'clock, the prisoner came in for a glass of ale, which came to three halfpence—he put down what should have been a shilling—I rubbed it with my fingers, and said, "Young fellow, have you got any more of these?"—he said, "What is the matter?"—I said, "This is a very bad one; not worth a button"—he gave me sixpence, and I gave him the change—he said, "I did not think it was bad; I was going to ask you to give me some large silver for this small"—I told him to take his money away—I broke the shilling in two and gave him half of it—the constable has the other.</p>

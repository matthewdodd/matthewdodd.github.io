            . I am a surgeon, and live in Crawford-street. I did not know the prisoner before this happened - I was sent for, and found her in bed, and have no doubt she had very recently been delivered of a child - the child was found in a gutter, within ten yards of her bed; there was a bruise on the right side of its head, which might be occasioned by a fall, and I think it was so, from its peculiar situation; it was not moved till I fetched it away; she might have been taken in labour suddenly, and the child fall from her in the street, and that would account for the bruise; I examined the body afterwards, and cannot be certain it was born alive - I cannot say the vital spark was not extinct when it was born - children are often born in a state that requires a medical man; it appeared an eight months' child.</p>

            . I live in Dorset-square. The prisoner lived in the same house; she told me she was single; I was not present when she was delivered - the child was found on Wednesday morning; I saw her every day - I had seen her about two hours before the child was found; she appeared to be pregnant, and had complained all the evening of being ill, and in the morning I told her I would fetch a medical man; she did not desire that, but said she thought she should get better, and did not want one - she was delivered on Monday - I did not see the child till Wednesday - she was not out on Monday, that I am aware of; she was out on Sunday afternoon, and in the kitchen on Tuesday - I never saw her with any baby linen, but I did not examine her boxes.</p>

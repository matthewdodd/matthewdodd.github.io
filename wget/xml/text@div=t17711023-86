            . We took in mahogany at Cape Gracious Sadcou on the Musketo shore; we had on board two hundred and twenty thousand feet; we began in December, and were three months loading; we arrived here in May.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner on board the ship?</p>
               <p>Hill. Yes; he was <rs id="t17711023-86-deflabel420" type="occupation">chief mate</rs>

               <p>Q. Who superintended the delivery?</p>
               <p>Hill. The chief mate; the cargo is delivered by lumpers, who are hired by the chief mate, and under his direction.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you visit the ship while the cargo was delivering?</p>

               <p>Hill. Yes; a few days before we arrived the prisoner and I were talking about the cargo; he said, captain, you have got nine pieces of mahogany on board, which is not good.</p>
               <p>Council. Describe the pieces of mahogany that the cargo consisted of?</p>
               <p>Hill. Pieces of logs and planks; we call them all logs that are fourteen feet long; they are sawn off trees, one tree perhaps is sawn into three pieces, ends, planks, and spurs. A spur is a piece out of the root of a tree: it is like a table. They are from fourteen feet down to two, and from two or three inches thick to 25 inches. He said you have nine pieces of mahogany not good, if you please I will chop off or change the marks, and give you nine pieces of the best in the ship, which makes little or no difference in the cargo. I answered, No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any mahogany on board on your account?</p>
               <p>Hill. Yes; the nine logs, it was all shipped as cargo; I bought it after it was shipped, I said no, I never chused to put myself in the hand of any man; as my logs were received, so they should be landed; we had no more on that subject.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the mark on your logs?</p>

            , M, were taken out of the one hundred and ninety-five; then we came up and reported the goods at the Custom house. We generally in wood report less than there are in case of a mistake; I entered them something under the number, then the mate had an order from the Custom house to discharge the ship; he continued discharging till the ship was out. Mr. Bowler, the measurer, came to me, and said, Sir, I believe some of your cargo is landed at Sir Peter Thompson's wharf in Surry. My cargo was to be landed at the Jamaica wharf, near Black friars bridge, in Surry, agreeable to the owner's orders.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is Sir Peter Thompson's wharf?</p>
               <p>Hill. Below bridge, at Dock head. I told Mr. Bowler, I had an opinion of my mate that he would not do such an action as smuggle wood contrary to my orders; I begg'd him to make enquiry, and I would speak to my mate about it. I went on board, and asked the prisoner if he had been guilty of landing wood out of my ship, for I had been informed that he had landed wood out of the ship at Sir Peter Thompson's wharf. He declared that he had not landed any wood out of the ship, nor had he any there but two small pieces which I had knowledge of: I told him if he had done so to confess it, and I would use my interest with Capt. Massom, before it went too far; he utterly denied it, and said he hoped I had a better opinion of him; this was about the end of June, or in July. Nothing passed for about six weeks, when Mr. Bowler spoke to me about it again, and brought in an account of his measurement; I had so good an opinion of the prisoner, that I never went to Sir Peter Thompson's wharf to enquire about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bowler's account of the measurement differed vastly from mine, he is a sworn measurer and broker; he differed twelve or thirteen thousand feet from the measurement I took in the country; some I measured myself; neither he nor I could account for it, unless they were my goods that were landed at Sir Peter Thompson's wharf. This passed on about ten days; he gave me some slight hint that he thought it was my wood; Mr. Massom came to me in September, and said the clerk of the wharf, where our wood had been landed, had told him that he believed the wood that was sold at Sir Peter Thompson's wharf was his; I was so persuaded of the prisoner's honesty, that I could not believe him guilty: the wood was advertized as the property of a gentleman from Honduras. I saw some of this wood afterwards, in Mr. Slater's yard, in the beginning of Sept. that is at Rotherhithe; there were two pieces there; I only challenged one to be mine; I measured four hundred and twenty nine for sale; I saw my mark, G. M. on it: it was in some measure bruised out, but yet visible; the number is visible 164, it is not quite plain, the 4 is not touched.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the particular dimensions of every piece?</p>
               <p>Hill. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the dimensions of your piece, 164.</p>
               <p>Hill. I made a mistake, it is 264; it is thirteen feet long, and twenty-three inches both ways, square; the piece at Slater's wharf agreed with the invoice exactly: my measurement in the country was 573 feet.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say 429 feet.</p>
               <p>Hill. That is for sale; there is a difference between that and for sale; the exact measurement of the outside is five hundred and seventy three feet: when they measure for sale, they make a difference of any that is not square;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230059"></xptr> when I measured it at Slater's wharf, it was five hundred and seventy three feet, according to my measurement; the length of the piece was thirteen feet in the country, it was twenty three inches square. I found another piece at Mr. Hodder's, in Tooley street, the same day; the mark is visible, It is L. C. G. I could not see the number; I did not take the dimensions of it; I believe it is about nineteen inches, it was sawed in four logs; I put them together and it made the measurement.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that to be one of the pieces shipped at the Musketo shore?</p>
               <p>Hill. Yes, I have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these four pieces were originally all one?</p>
               <p>Hill. Yes; by having them laid on one another, and they fitted exactly. I have brought that piece here with the mark. (the piece produced) I found this piece in Hodder's yard in September; I found the other piece in Maiden lane, in the hands of one Ash, the day after; I believe the mark of that is hackled out; there is no describing it; there is a mark No. 201 on it, visible enough to see it had been so marked; I found another piece at Mr. Clifford's in Queen-street, Holborn; the marks of that are chopped out; I found one piece he had sold privately-in Ratcliff highway, to one Mr. Burkit, the marks of that are chopped out.</p>
               <p>Q. When the cargo was landed, I believe it answered in point of number of pieces of wood; how happened that?</p>
               <p>Hill. Pieces that had been shaken and tossed about in the ship, some were split in two, there were two pieces of cedar, there were seven hundred pieces on board; the cargo delivered had more pieces; some whole pieces were split in two, and other pieces were shook by the carriage, on the sea; and there were some pieces which the measurers call white wood, that are not in the invoice: they were delivered with my mark and numbers upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you cut any of the pieces in two?</p>
               <p>Hill. To make stowage.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual to cut your pieces of mahogany in two; for to make stowage?</p>
               <p>Hill. No: but we gave leave for six or seven to be cut, to stow in the hatchway. I don't know how many were cut; these were cut at the Musquetto shore.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible to cut these on board the ship?</p>
               <p>Hill. They could not cut them till the port was opened.</p>
               <p>Q. How must that be cut?</p>
               <p>Hill. With a cross cut saw, two people must do it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave orders you say in the country for six or seven pieces to be cut?</p>
               <p>Hill. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know in fact how many pieces were cut?</p>
               <p>Hill. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say when you came home, you entered them under the mark?</p>
               <p>Hill. That is customary; we are allowed what is called in the Custom-house, a post. entry; we are permitted to make a second entry.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did this ship lie in the river?</p>
               <p>Hill. Close by Shadwell dock.</p>

               <p>Q. Who directed that?</p>
               <p>Hill. Mr. Gorden, one of the merchants of the country; he marked most of them himself; they had their negroes there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the cargo put on board?</p>
               <p>Hill. I saw every piece measured and marked, the log-book will account for the cargo took on board.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe this Mr. Richmond had a private trade of his own.</p>
               <p>Hill. No, I agreed that no wood should be on board that ship but the merchants; I bought none of my own, but after it was freighted.</p>
               <p>Q. Had this man any wood of his own?</p>
               <p>Hill. When I first agreed with this gentleman, I admitted no wood to go on board the ship but for the gentlemen. My mate smuggled a piece of wood, and I discovered it; I wrote him a letter, he begg'd my pardon, and said he would do so no more. After that he asked me to give him leave to put a small piece on board a man gave him, which I did; they were not small logs, they were pieces ten or twelve feet long, and ten or twelve inches square; about two or three hundred feet together I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. How much wages did you give?</p>
               <p>Hill. Three pound per month.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any dispute about his having three pound or three pound ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Hill. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you never mentioned to him, that if he drove any private trade you must not know of it?</p>
               <p>Hill. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of his papers?</p>
               <p>Hill. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The cabin was broke open, I believe.</p>
               <p>Hill. I do not know.</p>

            . I marked the greatest part of the logs, there was hardly one but what I marked.</p>
               <p>Council. Look at that piece, and see if you can tell what marks are there?</p>
               <p>Gordon. This to the best of my knowledge, is what I marked.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say positively?</p>
               <p>Gordon. I think I could, I am almost positive.</p>
               <p>Court. What mark is it?</p>
               <p>Gordon. G, M.</p>
               <p>Q. What else?</p>
               <p>Gordon. Here is something like a figure of 6; here is something like the top of a figure of 25 it is like a 264.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of it; you are sure there is a figure of 4?</p>
               <p>Gordon. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be positive the other figure was a 6; I suppose the marks are not now so fresh as when you first made them?</p>
               <p>Gordon. No.</p>
               <p>Q. They cannot be seen so well after they have stood together?</p>
               <p>Gordon. That would not deface them in that manner.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you suppose that was done?</p>
               <p>Gordon. It appears knocked out with a tool.</p>
               <p>Q. Some part of the marks remain?</p>
               <p>Gordon. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do these marks that now remain, appear to you to be the marks that you put on?</p>
               <p>Gordon. They look to me to be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that they are the marks.</p>
               <p>Gordon. I dare not say either the one or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any other pieces that you can swear to the marks of?</p>
               <p>Gordon. There are some; I can swear more to the pieces than by the marks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was such wood as this generally brought from there?</p>
               <p>Gordon. Yes, it is the same sort of wood that generally comes from that place.</p>

            . I was the owner of the ship,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230063"></xptr> the cargo is consigned to me; the prisoner was chief mate.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any conversation with him in consequence of any suspicion of him?</p>
               <p>Massom. I was informed that he had landed wood contrary to my, and I believe contrary to the Captain's orders; I called him down into the cabbin, and asked him about it; that was in June I believe; he told me then that he had none, and had landed none, but two little bits. I was informed of it by Mr. Fossack, and Mr. Bowler; Mr. Fossack is the wharfinger, at the Jamaica-wharf. Mr. Bowler measured the whole cargo: I only allowed the Captain a tun; and I gave the prisoner no authority to land any.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, though you gave him no authority to land wood, yet it is pretty well known that the officers have sometimes private property contrary to the will of the owner?</p>
               <p>Massom. We don't let any person interfere with our trade.</p>
               <p>Council. You don't allow it, but yet it will often happen?</p>
               <p>Massom. But it is not right that an officer should take any thing without the consent of of the Captain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you break open the prisoner's cabbin?</p>
               <p>Massom. I went on board for the books, the boy said he could take the Smith's, the butcher's books, and another penny book out.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these the books? (shewing the witnesses some memoramdum books.)</p>
               <p>Massom. Yes, these are them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are what you took out, books that relate to the ships account, or did you take out any book of any private dealings of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Massom. No; besides these, I only saw a single piece of paper, which the boy handed me, mentioning something about a book that had been sent on shore by mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the mate is not concerned in making the entry?</p>
               <p>Massom. No; it is made by the Captain, and I generally go along with the Captain to see it.</p>
               <p>Q. So the mate could not tell what entry was made; I believe you went to Sir Peter Thompson's wharf.</p>
               <p>Massom. Not for some time; I had such great faith in that lad that I could trust the whole property with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the prisoner entered the wood at Sir

            . I am a broker and measurer. I was employed to measure the cargo of mahogany that came home in the Chance; I measured some part at the Jamaica wharf, the other part at Hitchcock and Millan's wharf, a little higher up; there were 805 logs, ends and pieces. I began to measure the cargo on the 29th of May; I continued on it, I believe, near five weeks before I had done. The difference in the measurement between Mr. Hill's account and mine was 12000 feet; I don't look upon him to be a measurer: I made it 212,000 feet, Mr. Hill made it 200,000.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you find some wood among the cargo that was not mahogany, that was of a peculiar quality?</p>
               <p>Bowler. Yes; I called them white wood.</p>
               <p>Q. There were marks and numbers on those pieces I believe?</p>
               <p>Bowler. I have not been very accurate about these marks; one of them is G. M.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of that white wood?</p>
               <p>Bowler. We never had any of it; I don't look upon it to be worth even the freight.</p>
               <p>Q. So there is 12000 feet difference between Mr. Hill's measurement and yours?</p>
               <p>Bowler. There is 12,300 feet difference between his manner of measuring for freight and my measuring in the port of London; I measure for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell how many superficial feet freight measure there were?</p>
               <p>Bowler. Two hundred and seven thousand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177110230064"></xptr> and forty feet, eight inches, superficial freight measure.</p>
               <p>Q. from the jury. Did you measure all the pieces as you found them, and make no allowance for freight?</p>
               <p>Bowler. By no means for freight. As I was passing by Sir Peter Thompson's wharf, about the 11th or 12th of June, I saw ten, twelve, or fourteen pieces of mahogany; I thought they were very much like the cargo that was going through my hands at that time; I examined them, but I could not discover any marks or numbers upon them. When they came to a public sale, I went down to the wharf, and the measurement was offered to me; they were sold by auction about ten or a dozen days after I saw them. When I saw Mr. Hill some time after, I asked him if he knew of any wood coming from that shore besides his cargo; he said, no. I told him they were advertised as Honduras logs.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Captain Hill is not a very accurate measurer?</p>
               <p>Bowler. I don't apprehend that he is; it is not his profession.</p>
               <p>Q. But supposing you had measured all the wood that came out of the ship, there might have been a great difference in Captain Hill's measurement and yours?</p>
               <p>Bowler. Probably if any other measurer had done it, there might be.</p>

               <p>Q. Then there might be, you say, a great difference between Captain Hill's measurement and yours?</p>
               <p>Bowler. No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. And between measurement for freight, unless he knew how, there might be a large difference?</p>
               <p>Bowler. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Might there be this 12000 feet difference in that quantity, if there had been no embezzlement at all?</p>
               <p>Bowler. Yes, very probably.</p>
               <p>Q. I find these logs were publickly exposed for ten or twelve days.</p>
               <p>Bowler. They laid on the public wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. You measured the timber on the wharf without knowing whether it was the whole cargo or not?</p>
               <p>Bowler. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of a barge being sunk?</p>
               <p>Bowler. A boat was sunk at Sir

            . I was in the ship at the Musqueto shore; the prisoner cut three pieces of white wood on the shore; it was put on board the ship on his account; I believe without the captain's knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner desire you to keep it secret?</p>
               <p>Stotenburgh. No.</p>

               <p>Stotenburgh. Captain Hill knew nothing of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did not you tell Captain Hill of this?</p>
               <p>Stotenburgh. It was nothing to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it cut in the day time or the night?</p>

            . I am a waterman; I was employed by Capt. Massom in landing wood from his ship; I put out several pieces for the prisoner, several times; he ordered me to put some into the water, and some into the ferry.</p>
               <p>Q. How many?</p>
               <p>Coates. Five or six pieces, and I did so, he said it was his.</p>

I am a waterman; the prisoner was mate of the ship Chance; I was employed by him to receive some wood for him; he bid me call when I passed that way, and if any of his wood was at hand, I should take it up to the wharf; I called sundry times; I went away with a piece, and sometimes without a piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet the Captain there?</p>

I bought some timber on board the ship Chance, of Mr. Richmond, it was mahogany; I bought some short heads; some nine inches, some a foot, some twenty inches; this piece I bought singly by itself a fortnight afterwards; that is a log; there was nothing in the ship but itself; I bought it of Mr. Richmond.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of all the ends you bought?</p>
               <p>Tate. Three pounds three; there was nothing in the ship but them, when I was there; there was nothing of the cargo on board at that time.</p>

               <p>Gorden. No; it is just the same wood that is shipped; and this piece, there is not such another piece on the shore; this is what they call a crutch; and nobody gets them but myself; I know it must be mine by the shape of the log; nobody in the country cuts such but me.</p>
               <p>Clifford. He has swore as positive to my piece, which appears not to be his mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you refuse to have it brought to court?</p>
               <p>Clifford. Because it would damage the piece; it has lain up six days for any body to look at.</p>
               <p>Gorden. I have seen the wood at Hodders; there is an L on it; but I swore more from the nature of the wood than the mark; I bought it of the people in the country; I consign'd it to Mr. Massom; my people sell'd it; nobody in the country has got negroes to cut wood but me.</p>

            . I was a foremast man on board this ship. When I was on shore I observed a piece of mahogany buried in the sand; I was at the taking of it up, the prisoner took it; it is a frequent thing to find mahogany buried in the sand. I was at the cutting it; and this particular piece that has been produced here as one of the pieces belonging to the cargo is part of the piece that I found buried in the sand. I know the prisoner had four or five more pieces on board; there was among the cargo shipped on board this ship a piece of carbuncle wood, that is a piece of mahogany, which I suppose had been cast away in some ship that had been there before; it had shell fish sticking about it, and was worm-eaten. This I reckon to be the white wood they talk of, that was hoisted into the ship as part of the cargo for the benefit of the owners. It is a frequent thing on board these ships, when pieces don't go in cleverly, so as to stow well, they hawl them out again, and chip off part of them; and if an officer does not stand by, the sailors are as apt to cut where the marks are as any where else. They screw the logs in; and if a mark should happen to be put upon a place where it is splintered, they may by thrusting them in, break off the marks.</p>

The prisoner had one log of me, and I know he traded with one Armstrong, a cutter of logwood at the Musqueto shore; I carried three guns to Armstrong from the prisoner, which I suppose Armstrong paid him for in mahogany; he could not pay him in any thing else.</p>

            . I was in this trade about the time this voyage was undertaken. The common wages of a chief mate at that time on board such ships was not less than four pounds, sometimes four pounds five shillings.</p>

               <p>Mr. Massom. I agreed with the prisoner for three pound per month; there was no allowance for any private trade.</p>

I am an inmate of the workhouse of St. Leonard, Shoreditch, and am a nurse in the nursery there—I remember the little child Hannah Barnard being brought into the workhouse on 4th May; it Was given into my hands in a very dirty and neglected state—the lower parts of its body was completely raw, the Bones appeared to be coming through the skin, and bleeding—the matron ordered every nourishment and every care to be taken of it, from the state it was in; whatever was requisite for it was to be given—it took its food ravenously for two or three days, and then it Became more satisfied—it was five months old, I believe—it appeared to be that age—it seemed to do for two or three days—it Became more Satisfied—it seemed to do pretty well at first—the wounds healed up; it got very much stouter, improved in weight and its looks—within twenty-four hours of its death it refused all nourishment—it died in convulsions on the eighth day, Saturday, 11th May—the surgeon saw it once or twice a day.</p>

               <p>it constantly daily, and the first few days it seemed to improve—I did not see it take its food, but I had the report of the nurse that it took its food—it seemed to do pretty well for the first few days, and increased in weight; but on the succeeding Thursday, when the child was taken before the magistrate, I Observed a change in it, and it died on Saturday, succeeding that—I made a post mortem examination; there was a slight degree of con<lb></lb>gestion of the vessels on the surface of the Brain—the Brain itself was pale and softer than usual; there was very minute effusion at the Base of the Brain—the lungs were in a healthy state, but pale and thin—the stomach was healthy but pale, and contained some partly digested food—the intes<lb></lb>tines were examined throughout their whole length, and there was no trace whatever of any disease in or about the Bowels or glands—the death was caused from want of proper and sufficient nourishment; the different parts being pale would be evidence of want of food—it had not for some time it ought proper maternal care or the substitute for that maternal food which had the to have had—Dr. Barnes assisted me in my examination.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 12, Finsbury-square—I am a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, assistant to Obstetric physician to the London Hospital, and physician to the London Maternity charity—I was called in by Mr. Clark to assist in the post-mortem examination of this child on 13th May—I found what Mr. Clark has described, a state of extreme emaciation, no fat on the body, a want of nutrition; the organs internally were in an entirely Bloodless state, which accounts for the paleness observed—it was a want of formation of Blood—there was hardly any in the body—the skin was exces<lb></lb>sively pale—the parts were excoriated where the Bones project Behind—there being no cushion of fat to protect it from pressure—the skin had given way or was about to give way in one place over the spine—there was also exco<lb></lb>riation about the cartilage; I consider from dirt and neglect—the Brain was very soft, Bloodless, which I consider to be the result of want of nutrition—it might Be attributable to that, but I could not draw anything considerble from that—the organs in the chest were perfectly healthy—the only thing I observed was that the lungs were exceedingly Bloodless; just a little had coagulated at the lower part of the lungs as it lay on its back—the heart and stomach were healthy—there was no disease of any kind in the Body—I attribute death to want of nourishment—it was a child of five months old—it ought to have weighed at least ten pounds—a small child would weigh that, at least, if well nourished—it is a little remarkable that it seemed to increase in weight—that goes to prove that there was some amount of nourishment going on at that time, but it did not come soon enough to rescue the</p>

               <p>child from the state of depression into which it had sunk from long<lb></lb>continued neglect—it has often been observed that a supply of food at the last rather seems to hurry the death than not, if not given carefully—that fact does not stall modify my opinion as to the cause of death, it rather tends to strengthen it—it shows that there was no organic impediment to the proper assimilation of food being converted into Blood—it sunk from real exhaustion, the food not coming soon enough to save it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was very fond of my Baby; it has always been a sickly child; it was Born before the midwife came, and was a very small Baby; it did not seem to have strength to take the Breast, and the midwife said I should have a great deal of trouble with it. I suckled it, and attended to it night and day, and gave it all the nourishment I could. It was very sore and inflamed about the lower parts of its body, and I took it to the doctor; there are two certificates from him in Court. He told me it had diseased glands of the inside, or consumption of the bowels, and ordered beef tea and milk, but if I had not sufficient milk myself I need not buy it any. I fed it, and continued to suckle it; it ate very ravenously, but never seemed satisfied. The doctor said it was of a very weak digestion, that I must not give it so much bread, accordingly I did not It had places like ulcers come out upon its body; I attended to it, and washed it, and put fuller's-earth upon it; the doctor said I could not do better. It was ordered cod liver oil twice a day, and sometimes a bark mixture with wine in it three times a day, and that it had constantly up to the time of its death. On the morning that it was taken away I had been ill, and I went to the hospital, and when I returned I found the child had been taken to the workhouse. My little girl could get whatever she wanted, and I had left enough in the place for breakfast. I had been, to look for my husband, who belongs to the volunteers, but he was gone into the country that day, and I did not return home till rather late, as I had been looking for him. I have four children living; they all went into this same emaciated state, and have all been under medical treatment from four years of age. My husband is consumptive, and has brought up a good deal of blood for years, every now and then.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. BARNES</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I have heard what the prisoner has stated—there is such a complaint as consumption of the bowels—there were no indications whatever of it in this child—I particularly looked to see, in consequence of what Mr. Clark said to me—the appearances after death in this disease are very distinct, and not to be mistaken, and there was no evidence of anything of the kind—it would certainly have been evident by the usual appearances if it had existed—before making the post-mortem examination there was a possibility that the child might have died from natural disease; I therefore looked particularly to see if there were any symptoms, and could find none.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). The prisoner never said anything to me about the child being sickly, and not having strength enough to take the breast, nor did the midwife to my knowledge—I have known the other children to be much neglected, and they are very much improved since the mother has been away—you would hardly credit the different there is in the children since she has been away.</p>

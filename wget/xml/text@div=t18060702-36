            , I rented the second floor of Mrs. Gibbs; in my room I had a chest of drawers, and at the corner of one of the drawers I had a box where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020027"></xptr>my wife kept her trinkets, and I had bank notes to the amount of twenty pounds. On the 4th of May, when my wife was put to bed I missed nine pounds out of the box; previous to the 28th I moved the remainder of my money to a writing desk in order to secure it; on the 28th, when I was at breakfast, my wife communicated to me that she had lost a great deal of wearing apparel, both of my own and hers, I immediately went to my writing desk to see if any of my bank notes were gone, I perceived there was eight or ten; I went to Marlborough-street, and took a search warrant out,

             the officer executed the search warrant, he, myself, and the prisoner, went down stairs to search a box in the kitchen, the prisoner told us it was her box, and she gave us the key; in this box

             the officer found two or three shawls, a petticoat, and there were some gloves and gaiters found among her clothes; there were three false keys found in her pocket, the officer tried these keys to my drawers, writing desk, and my cupboard, these three keys corresponded with those three locks; in consequence of her being found out in the theft she took a quantity of laudanum, which she said was six shillingsworth, and she said she had destroyed herself; in consequence of that I took the bottle to Mr. Lomax, he said it was laudanum, he brought another gentleman, and they gave her every assistance, he brought three drafts, she had not taken any, I told her if she would take a draft I would do every thing to save her from justice I could; they took her to Mary-le-bone infirmary, and the next day she was taken before a magistrate.</p>

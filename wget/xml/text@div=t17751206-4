             the prosecutor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What do you know of your house being broke open? - I left the house about six in the evening, and left no body in the house: my husband was not at home; I returned between eight and nine o'clock, and found the outer door, and another door, part of which is glass, both laid open: when I went out they were both shut and fastened: I was much surprised when I saw them open, and would not go in till I had called all my neighbours. I found when I went in that the chest, full of my wearing apparel, was gone; which contained a black negligee, blue paduasoy nightgown, pompadour silk gown, white lutestring gown and coat, a white muslin night gown, two sets of car-rings, one of paste, the other garnets; a cotton counterpane; these were all in the chest: I saw it that night before I went out, and every thing in it.</p>
               <p>Did you find any of your goods again? - On Sunday the 4th of November one Mr. Jones told me I must go to a justice Durden: I went, where I saw the prisoners and some of the goods. The justice ordered me to come next day at ten o'clock: some of my goods were brought in a bag when I was at the justice's. (The goods produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix deposed they were part of the goods taken out of her house the night the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>What do you know against the prisoners? - They broke my house open.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - I am very sure, for they threatened to do it before.</p>
               <p>Are you acquainted with the prisoners? - No: they broke my window, and before that threatened to break open the house.</p>

            . About eight o'clock, on a Saturday night, about a month ago, the prisoners at the bar brought me those goods now produced: I gave them a guinea for these gowns and petticoat.</p>

            . I live in Petty France, Westminster. On a Sunday afternoon the prosecutrix came to my house, told me her house had been broke open and robbed. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060035"></xptr> went and found the middle of the door, the glass-door and lock, and hinges, were broke. I heard the chest was found in a hog well: I found it empty, only some rags and papers in it. It had been dragged along the ground, by which we traced it to a public-house in Tothill Fields, where we found the three prisoners, and apprehended them. They all confessed: they said they sold the things to Mrs. Ross in the New Way. They likewise owned it before t he justice. I went down with another officer, and took Mrs. Ross to the justice. She denied it at first; she sent her servant with me to a house, six or seven doors from her own, where the goods were; they were in a coarse bag. These are the goods now produced.</p>
               <p>One of the prisoners asked if the witness could swear that they confessed before the justice? - She said, upon my oath, they did.</p>

               <p>Wyatt was my servant on the 2nd of November—on that day I saw Parker in my house—in consequence of something which occurred, I went to a house in Redcross-court, which Parker represented as her house, with two police-officers, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening—we passed through a passage into a back room where Parker was—we looked round, and did not see any thing belonging to me, or where any thing could be secreted—she then led the way to the wash-house behind, where there were two or three women—we looked round, and found nothing there—an officer said it was her sleeping-room—we wanted to know where any property was likely to be that belonged to me—she said it was up stairs—one of the washerwomen then said, "You must not go there, my husband is there"—Parker said she was not going to that room, it was another room—we went up to the top room, second floor, we found nothing there—we were examining the boxes, but the washerwomen came up, and were very angry that their room was being searched—in the mean time Parker had got down stairs again—we came down—she went to the front-room on the ground-floor—we searched in that room—Parker was in the room—and we found the articles stated in the indictment, which be<lb></lb>long to me.</p>

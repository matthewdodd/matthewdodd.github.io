On the 31st of October I lost thirteen gold rings, a pair of silver salts, and a great quantity of remnants of muslin worked in aprons, out of my shop window. I likewise lost two remnants of lawn, and a pair of half-boots.</p>
               <p>At what time of the day were they stolen? - I went out to an auction at Esher. I did not come home till ten or eleven at night, then I found my house was robbed, my sister wa gone to London, and she had locked up the house, and no person was left in the house; the house was locked up when I went to the auction.</p>
               <p>Was you the first person who got home? - Yes. This (producing it) is an inventory of the things I lost, which I gave in at the publick office. I found the house as I left it. I imagine the person must have got in at the window.</p>
               <p>In what situation did you leave the window when you went out? - Shut down but not fastened.</p>
               <p>How high is it? - Near six yards from the ground.</p>
               <p>So high that a man could not get up without a ladder? - I believe a man could with a step or some such thing. Mr. Shakespear took the prisoner up and put him in prison as a vagabond; he suspected he had robbed me. That window is in the chamber.</p>
               <p>Is the shop a part of the dwelling-house? - Yes. The clerk at Litchfield-street office desired me to be favourable to the prisoner upon his discovering my things to me, that was the reason of its being charged only a single felony. When he was taken there were pawnbrokers duplicates found upon him of some of my things. I went to one Davies's by St. George's church in the Borough, and enquired if Bullon had been to pawn any rings there since I had spoke to him before of my having been robbed; that was about a fortnight ago. He told me there was a watch which some man had pawned there, and a ring with it. He told me the man was taken to Litchfield-street. I went there the next day, then the prisoner owned where he had pawned the things which the duplicates were for which were found upon him when he was taken.</p>
               <p>When did you see him before the justice? - On the same day I think that I was at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Was he there when you came the first day? - He was in New Prison; he was brought up that day or the next, I am not quite sure which. The duplicates were produced at the office. He told the clerk of the office in my hearing of the different pawnbrokers,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220011"></xptr> with whom he had pawned my-things. He was sent to the pawnbrokers with some men to guard him.</p>

               <p>Can you, upon looking at these duplicates, tell who they were given by? - Yes, here is the place of abode upon them, Thames-street, and so on.</p>
               <p>Where is Church-street? - In the Borough.</p>
               <p>Where is Kent-street? - Behind St. George's Church, in the Borough.</p>
               <p>Were there any goods found in Middlesex? - Yes; a great many.</p>
               <p>By means of the duplicates? - No; none.</p>
               <p>What is the name of the pawnbroker in Middlesex where any of the goods were found? - One is Laton; I went to Laton's. The prisoner was examined and then we went with him to those places. I went to one pawnbroker in Oxford Road; Dobree I believe his name is; he gave the property up before the magistrate, and so did several other pawnbrokers.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Crease, of West Smithfield, an oil and colourman, On the 22nd of February, between five and six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop, and chose a butter brush, which came to 6d.; he put a 5s. piece into my hand - I saw that it was a bad one, and I handed it over to Mr. Price, the clerk, who came out of his counting-house - the prisoner was close by at the time; he had been in the shop before - Mr. Price sent for a constable; the prisoner attempted to go out, and I collared him - I had sold a brush the day before to a man who I believe was the prisoner.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Crease- it is the custom for me to receive money; I keep the key of the till. I saw the prisoner on the 21st of February, but before that another person had come in for a brush, and paid a 5s. piece; I put it into the till - in ten minutes the prisoner came, and bought a brush, which came to 4d.; he gave a 5s. piece, which I put into the till, and the following morning I found the two 5s. pieces were both bad, as there was no other crown in the till - I opened the till between seven and eight o'clock; I took the two crown-pieces, and put them by themselves in one of the partitions in the desk; the prisoner came on the 22nd, about the same hour in the evening as on the 21st- he again asked for a brush, which was served him by Nicholls; the prisoner gave him a crown-piece, which he handed to me, and I discovered that it was the same as the other - I sent for an officer - I recollected the prisoner again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You said if I could not give a good account of myself, you would give me in charge. Witness. Yes, I did - I forget his answer, but he did not give a good account; I think he said he worked at a baker's - the first brush that was brought came to 6d.; the first the prisoner bought was 4d., and the second he came for was 6d.</p>
               <p>MR. SCARLETT. Q.Were these the only three bad crowns you had? A. Yes, the only three crowns.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable B</hi> 96.) I saw the prisoner on the 24th of January, in Great Peter-street—Oliver was with her—I saw something pass between them, done up in a small parcel, in a bit of rag, or something—it came from Oliver to the prisoner, who put it into her bosom—I went and asked what she had got in her bosom—she said, "Nothing"—Ford, who was with me, searched her—she rather resisted, and I was forced to hold her hands—he found this rag with eighteen counterfeit sixpences in it—she gave two or three different accounts of how she got it, and at last said she bought it of Oliver, and gave 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I have heard what has been stated—it is correct—I took this rag from the prisoner's bosom in a baker's shop—she said she bought it of Thomas Oliver, and gave 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I went to Oliver's; when I opened the door about an inch, the bedstead was against it—I made a shove, and it opened about half a foot, and I saw Oliver with a mould in each hand—he knocked them together, and broke them all to pieces.</p>

The prisoner put in a written defence, stating, that a man whom she met in the Broadway, Westminster, had given her the parcel to carry to Tothill-street, where he was to meet her in half-an-hour.</p>

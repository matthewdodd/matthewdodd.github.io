                  </hi>. I am a brewer, at Ratcliff-cross. I have now three partners; I had then two partners—the prisoner was our collecting clerk in Aug. 1849—I think he had been so about six months—he was paid a weekly salary, and I think a commission beside—it was his duty to collect money from our different customers, and to bring it that night or the next morning to one of the partners with this book, which he was in the habit of taking—he took it from our counting-house every morning to collect, and he either entered the money in this book himself, and had the initials of a partner to it, or if another person wrote it there would be no necessity for the initials—I did not receive 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the prisoner on 14th Aug., 1849—here is an entry in Mr. Ward's account of 16th Aug., "By cash, on account, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and some other figures, which I understand to be, "less 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—that may be dis<lb></lb>count, I do not know—this would indicate that the prisoner would only have to pay 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—if it had been brought to me I should have taken the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this entry is the prisoner's writing; there are no initials to it—the prisoner ought to have had the initials of one of the partners to it—it would have been his duty to do so for his own security—there is no entry whatever of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. being received from Mr. Snell—here is nothing entered after 27th July except an entry of thirty-one gallons of ale returned; no cash—the prisoner went away on the evening of 16th or the morning of 17th Aug.—he gave no notice of his going—we did not owe hint anything; he had been paid to the previous Saturday—I think he left about the middle of the week—his wages were from 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and some portion would have been due to him from the Saturday till the time he left—he did not come to claim any wages—this book came to us by post or by hand, I think on the day after he left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was I paid only by salary? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have stated that you bad a salary, and I believe a commission also—in the first instance you had 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and the business not turning out as it should do, it was reduced to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. salary and a commission—I do not believe that about two months before you left you were put on commission solely—I believe my son is at the brewery to-day, or else out about business—you certainly left on 16th or 17th Aug.—it is most unlikely that twelve months ago you were sitting at your desk in my office—the only thing I know is, I saw you one day about four months ago, and said if I could find a policeman I would give you in charge—you made me no bill—there were no payments that were not entered in this book—this is the book you took every day, and all you have received would naturally go into it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JUST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you keep an account of his commission? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have looked in the ledger, and it was all in one sum paid to the Saturday before—he was paid every Saturday morning—either I or my partners would see his book every day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He owed me 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I debited myself with this 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave him the account in. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not have an account from him in which he debited himself with this money; no, he did not send such an account</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I brought my own connection to him; I had a respectable trade, some of the first publicans in town; he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a salary, and a commission; he thought I was getting too much, and he dropped my salary; his son knows it, and he has kept his son away; he put me on commission altogether; it ran on, and I found that this commission was not enough; I expressed my dissatisfaction to his son, and he said, "Go on a little bit;" I acknowledge to the money that Mr. Snell paid: twelve months ago I went to Mr. Larchins, and saw his son; he said, "Have you made out your, bill?" I said, "Yes, and I want my money;" be kept trifling with me, and desired</p>

               <p>me to find some empty barrels, which I did, and sent them home nine months ago; this I am prepared to prove by Henry Larchin, but he would not bring him in Court, nor Mr. Woodgate; this is the first time I was charged with anything against my honesty; I believe it is a concocted scheme got up by the wine doctors; I think I was justified in holding back this 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when there was 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. owing to me on my commission; a commission man has a perfect right to pay himself, if he debits himself with it, and credits bit employer; he knows if his son came in Court, and he was subjected to a <hi rend="italic">cross fire</hi>, he would not succeed well; I never shunned their office, and never heard anything of this till the wine merchant threw down the gauntlet <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He was paid every Saturday morning all that was due to him—I have not employed him since then—it was long before that he was employed to get the empty barrels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> For two months I received no salary; there is 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to me; his son was before the Magistrate; I called him twice, and be <hi rend="italic">skulked</hi> out of Court; I wanted to call Mr. Woodbridge and Henry Larchin, junior.</p>

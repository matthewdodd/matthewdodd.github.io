                  </hi>. I live in Wilson-street, Finsbury. Between one and two o'clock in the morning of the 1st of May, I was returning home alone—I am almost a stranger in London—I received a blow at the back of my head—I felt the effect for some days after—I rather think it was from behind—it knocked me down—it was with the fist I believe—as soon as I got up, I saw the prisoner running off with my hat—I instantly called the police—this hat produced resembles mine—I have no particular mark on it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 219.) I saw the prisoner running along Farringdon-street at a furious rate—hearing a cry of "Stop thief," I ran after him—he ran up Turnagain-lane—seeing I was close at his heels, he fell down—the hat was picked up, and given to me—he had no hat on—the prosecutor identified the hat—he was a little excited in liquor—he was not drunk—he had been drinking—the prisoner was drank—I did not see the prisoner with any cap—he came up, and said he had lost his hat.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that the prosecutor had come in contact with him: after which a scuffle ensued, he being intoxicated, that he found the hat on the ground and took it up, believing it to be his own.</hi>)</p>

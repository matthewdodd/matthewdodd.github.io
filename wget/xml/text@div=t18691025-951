                  </hi>. I live at 29, Trafalgar Road, Old Kent Road, and am a warehouseman—on 5th October, about 9.30, I was in Covent Garden, nearly opposite Garrick Street—it was very dark—as I was going along I received a blow in the face, and immediately felt a hand going over my waistcoat—I caught hold of it and said, "You have robbed me of my pin"—I then received a second blow—I called out "Police I"—I received another blow, which closed my eyes—they were very bard blows—I thought they wire given with some heavy instrument—we struggled across the road down Garrick Street—I held the man all the time—I then saw it was the prisoner—just before I gave him into custody he gave me a severe blow—I let him go for a moment, but ran after him and caught him again—I took him about 100 yards altogether—I never lost sight of him for a moment, except when I closed my eyes—I had a pin in my scarf at the time he came up—I missed that afterwards—I saw it again at the Police Court—it was shown to me by a policeman—it was worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was dreadfully hurt with the blows, and was bleeding.</p>

Q.</hi> What time did you leave your employment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 6 o'clock—I then went to buy some china—and after that I went to Covent Garden, to see the proprietor of a public-house—I had two glasses of sherry and water while I was out—I was at the public-house about I quarter of an hour—I only had two glasses of sherry and water, from the time I went out till 9.30—I was perfectly sober—the blows were very bird—I did not see any instrument—I had just come from the public-house.</p>

I am a tailor, at 65, St. Martin's Lane—I was in Garrick Street, on 5th October, about 9.15—I saw the prisoner and Dodgs struggling together—Dodge held the prisoner till a policeman came up—I saw the prisoner hit Dodge on the nose, and his face was smothered with blood directly—I interfered, and helped to hold the prisoner till a policeman came—I went to the station—just as he was going into the door of the station he threw something away—a boy picked it up and gave it to me—it was this pin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)</p>

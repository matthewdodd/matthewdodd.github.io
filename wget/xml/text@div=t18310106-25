On the 30th of December I was in my cellar, and heard a bundle thrown down the stairs, and some one coming down, which caused my suspicion; I put my light behind a cask, listened, and heard a person go into the kitchen -I went to the kitchen door, and saw the prisoner coming out with a pair of brass candlesticks, one in each hand; I collared him, and said, "You rascal, what do you do here?" he made some resistance, but I got him into the kitchen, and threw him on his back - he threw me off, and got up; I told him to put the candlesticks where he found them, which he did, on the mantel-shelf over the fire-place.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I took the prisoner from the prosecutor - I asked what he had been doing with the candlesticks; he said he took them to look for 1d. he had dropped at the bottom of the stairs - it was about half-past twelve o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went in and had some beer - I then asked a man the way to the privy; he told me, and I went - I was pulling the back door; it stuck, and my bundle fell out of my hand - I could not find it, and I got the candlesticks to get a light to look for it; this gentleman then came and asked what I wanted with it - I told him, and said, "I dare say you heard the bundle fall down the stairs;" the mistress found one of the half-pence, and a young man found the other - I had only one of them in my hand.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BAWCOMB. It was not dark, and there was no candle in them - the stairs lead to the kitchen and to the cellar; none of the customers had any right down the stairs, unless they were going to the privy - there were two halfpence picked up without a light at the bottom of the stairs; there was no one in the kitchen - he did not mention about the 1d. till I had him on the ground, and had hold of his handkerchief.</p>

I received information on 8th or 9th July—I watched Mr. Ritchie's premises, and saw the prisoner come out to his dinner, about 1 o'clock—I followed him to an eating house, in Nile Street, Hoxton—I went in, sat on his left side, and had some dinner; he had some dinner also—I talked about the weather, and felt something in his pocket like bobbins of silk—I left after dinner, and followed him to Old Street Road, when he looked behind, and I think he had an impression that I was follow<lb></lb>ing him, for he turned short round, and was making back for the City Road—I touched him on the shoulder, and said I wished to speak to him—he said, "I don't know you"—I said, "I am a police officer, and wish to know what you carry in your left hand coat pocket"—he seemed very much confused, and said, "A bobbin or two of silk"—I said, "I will not expose you in the street, and took him to the Nelson public-house, where I asked him to show them to me—he took out three small ones—I said, "Have you any more?—he hesitated, and said, "Yes, I have another," and pro<lb></lb>duced this big one—I said, "How do you account for having them in your possession?"—he said, "I brought them out for patterns"—I said, "I shall take you in custody, for stealing them from Mr. Ritchie, your master.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silk trimming manufacturer, at 31, Murray Street, Hoxton—the prisoner has been in my employ upwards of fourteen years, and for upwards of five years has had the absolute control; I left the entire charge of the silk stock to him—I missed some silk on 29th July—I had previously communicated with the police—these four bobbins are mine, they have my brand, "W. R." on them, and the silk is my own dyeing—it is worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he had no authority to take out silk for patterns,</p>

               <p>nothing leaves my premises without being entered in my work book, which is here—my wife, myself, and my nephew make the entries in it—I cannot tell who made entries in it on 29th July, without referring, and there are so many names, it will be difficult to trace it out; it is a kind of ledger, under the names of the work-people—the prisoner had no business to take these bobbins off the premises—one of them belongs to a job which I gave him to do shortly before 12 o'clock, on the day he went out to dinner at 1.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You gave it to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gave him the order, and selected the silk for the purpose—I know his brother, Benjamin Brown, perfectly well, he has worked for me for several years as an out-door hand—I never had a conversation with him about patterns—he may have made a pattern for me as additional work—he is a weaver, and I have told him if he likes to make a pattern at the end of his work he can; from the materials which have been given to him; the excess may be employed to make a pattern or patterns, at the end of his work—if he wanted materials for pat<lb></lb>tern making, he would come to me or to the prisoner, and they would be properly entered—I did not say to him, about eighteen months ago, "If you want materials, ask your brother, and he can take them to you "—the rules in the factory are absolute.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's brother, and have worked for the prosecutor twelve years, up to June—when I had time, I used to make patterns and new designs, and in, I think, 1864, I got a prize of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Ritchie for doing so—I had frequent conversations with Mr. Ritchie about patterns—he told me I was to let my brother know if I wanted materials for patterns, and I should have the materials from my brother; my brother would bring them to me, to save my time in coming up and down—I lived at 6, Tyson Street, Bethnal Green Road at that time—I am quite sure he told me that—on this day I had an appointment to meet my brother opposite the Lying-in Hospital, at the corner of Old Street—the appointment was made the Saturday previous, at his mother's, to receive from him materials to make French patterns for Mr. Ritchie—my brother wanted me to come to the place of business, but I told him I could not afford to lose my time to run up and down for the materials to make the patterns with—the Lying-in Hospital is about seven minutes' walk from Mr. Ritchie's—he was to bring a pattern with him, which I was to make from—I have never seen this fringe pattern (<hi rend="italic">found on the prisoner</hi>)—he did not show it me, but I told him that when he brought the silk he was also to bring a pattern—he said he would bring two—he designed this pat<lb></lb>tern—I kept my appointment on the 29th, but did not meet him, and afterwards went home to work—I did not go to Mr. Ritchie's because I did not think it was any consequence—not seeing him, I thought he would bring them to me at night, when he had done his business.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would these bobbins of silk have been suitable for making the pattern? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—when I make a pattern I am not entitled to take it to any person; that would not be doing justice—if I make it for Mr. Ritchie, and he approves of it, I should treat it as his—I was not examined before the Magistrate, but I was there, ready to give evidence—I worked for other persons besides the prosecutor up to April—after I left off working on his premises, I worked for him or anybody else who would give me a job, but I had no job from the prosecutor.</p>

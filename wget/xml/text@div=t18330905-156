            . I am in the prosecutor's service. On the afternoon of the 5th of August, I saw a short man in the passage with his trousers down - I asked what he did there; he said, he did not know; I ordered him off the premises - I went to the door afterwards, and saw the same man talking to the prisoner - I found this key in the cellar the next morning.</p>

            . On the 23d of March I had a message from his lordship, who lodged in Duke-street, St. James's, desiring me to deliver a hamper to the prisoner Dogherty, whom his lordship permitted to live in the house in Berkeley-square out of humanity. These things were taken from the house in Berkeley-square. My wife gave me information, and I missed a bed, a bolster, and two blankets: they were taken while I went with a message to his lordship. I had left Dogherty and my wife in the house. The things were in the room where he slept. I had seen them some time before; he was out when I missed them. He returned in about an hour. I asked him what he had done with the bed and blankets? he said he had sold them; fell on his knees, and begged I would not inform his lordship of the transaction. He was in liquor; it was between one and two o'clock in the day time. He told us where he sold them. I found them at Marlborough-street. I suspected Mackin, as I had seen him three or four times at the house; he came to see Dogherty. Somebody gave me information. I went and found another bed had been taken out backwards; he owned to taking that, fell on his knees again, and begged for mercy.</p>

I went and searched Appleton's house, and found the bed, bolster, and blanket, and a stewpan lid, with the figures 3-2 L C on it.

            . I am a plaisterer, and live at No. 14, Great Mary-le-bone-lane. On the 23d of March, in the morning, I was at work in his lordship's house; Mackin came in with me as I went to work. I did not see him again till breakfast time, when he came along the passage to me and said,</p>
               <p>"Is the old gentleman up?" meaning

             I said,</p>
               <p>"I dont think he is." I saw him go under the stairs and take out something, what it was I did not know. I went to my work, and between four and five o'clock Stuart informed me somebody was forcing a bed through the two pair of stairs back window. I ran up and saw Dogherty standing there, and asked him about it. He said he had hid the bed. He took me up into a room where there was some hair, and under the hair was the bed. I suspected Mackin, and saw him about six o'clock, and took him. His lordship came soon after. I heard Mackin tell Dogherty he should not have taken the things away by day-time, but by night.</p>

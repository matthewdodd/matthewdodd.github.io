             (Police-constable S 117). On the night of Saturday, the 15th of December, about eleven o'clock, I was in Pratt-street, near <placeName id="t18330103-104-crimeloc596">Camden-town chapel</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was he not on the common pavement? A. He was close to the chapelgate; persons can go on that side, but there is no one goes there all night - the houses are on the other side, or mostly so.</p>

             (Police-serjeant S 3). On the night of the 15th of December I met the prisoner and this witness; he said he had stopped the prisoner coming from the chapel with some coals; I said, "Perhaps he has a right to these coals;" the prisoner said, "No, my friend, I have no business with them at all, they don't belong to me at all; I take such a bag home once a fortnight, instead of using them in the chapel, and I did not think that any of your men would take such a mean advantage of me as to take me into custody;" he said the Trustee was a good sort of a man, and he did not think he would appear against him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Clark hear all this? A. No, I sent him to get a wheelbarrow to carry the coals; he did not say at that time that he had taken coals from his own house, to light the chapel fires, and he thought he had a right to a return for them, but he said so before the Magistrate, who told him he must go and make a Judge and Jury believe it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did he say? A. He said he had taken over a quantity of coals to the chapel, when they were out of coals, and when he went home that night, his wife said, "William I am out of coals, I wish you would fetch those you took to the chapel."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he not the communnion plate and many valueable things in his care? A. Yes; he lighted the fires and had care of the coals - they were supplied by an order from the vestry clerk; he applied for an order on the 17th of October.</p>

            . I am a widow, and live in Grove-terrace, Kentish-town. I remember seeing the prisoner in the early part of October come across the street from his own house to the chapel with some coals in a scuttle; his wife called, and asked him if he had the tinder-box - he put down the scuttle in the street, and went back for it; he then took the scuttle of coals into the chapel - I saw him about a week afterwards take some coals in a bag into the chapel on his shoulder; he said to me, "Good morning;" I said the same - it was a thin dirty bag, and appeared to have coals in it; I said to him, "You are loaded:" he said they were out of coals at the chapel, and he was taking some to light the fires.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When were you applied to, to give evidence on this subject? A. Last Thursday; I had not mentioned this circumstance - I was not before the Magistrate; I heard of the prisoner's being in custody: there was nothing to make me look at the coals.</p>
               <p>MR. DOANE. Q. When was it you observed the coals in the scuttle? A. It was on a Thursday morning, in the early part of October, at twenty minutes past nine o'clock; as I passed the chapel I looked up, and saw the time - I could see the time every day if I looked up; it was a black scuttle - I cannot tell what day it was when I saw him again, but I had particular business on the first day, which makes me remember it; I never saw him carrying coals at any other times.</p>

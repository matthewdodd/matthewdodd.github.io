                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Bidmead, an umbrella-manufacturer, of 7, Grace's-alley, Wellclose-square. The prisoner was also in his service—on 27th Sept I found four umbrellas in a corner of the cellar: I removed them—Mr. Bidmead was from town, and returned on the 29th; and in consequence of information I gave him, he gave me directions to put the umbrellas in the same place where I found them—these are them, (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) there is a private mark on them—they are Mr. Bidmead's—they had no right to be in the cellar—two are finished, and two unfinished.</p>

I put myself in a house opposite—at half-past seven o'clock I saw the prisoner come out at the warehouse-door with a bundle under his arm, which contained the four umbrellas produced—I went after him—he ran away as fast as he could—as soon as he got out towards his own home, in Spitchurch-lane, I caught him, and told him he must go to the station with me—he said, "You are wrong, how dare you interfere with me? it is my own property"—I said they were not his, two were finished, and two not—I took him to the station.</p>

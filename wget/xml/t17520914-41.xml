He staid there till about five or six at night; I missed my buckles about half an hour after he was gone. I had a suspicion; I went to him on shore and took him, and then carried him before Justice Bury. As we were going from the Justice to New Prison, he confessed he took them out of the ship, and had slung them over board, for fear of being discovered.

             were with him before the Justice, and they confirmed that of his confession.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his defence said, they teazed him so that he thought of saying he had flung them overboard, thinking then they would decline the prosecution. He called upon the evidences for a character; Mr. Cooper said he had a good character, but he had not known any thing of him for a year past. Chapman said he always bore a good character, and he had known him a dozen years.</p>

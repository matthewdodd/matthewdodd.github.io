I have known the prisoner five years - he lodged at my house - I had lent these spectacles to Towers, who returned them one Monday morning when the prisoner was there at breakfast with my husband - he snatched them from me. and said "These are handsome; I have got a handsome case, and I will make you a present of it" - I said "I have a very good case" - he replied, "Mine is a very handsome case, and by dinner-time I will return them to you, and you will not repent that you have got it" - he went out and did not return till night - I then asked him for them - he said "I forgot to call, but the gentleman will call to have a pint of beer, and the will bring them" - he went to bed that night; in the course of that day I asked him for them, and he said the gentleman would call and bring a few friends - he continued to come backwards, and forwards till the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060065"></xptr>Friday, when he went with my husband about the license; when he came home I spoke rather roughly to him, and said it appears to me that you mean to rob me of them; he said "Do you doubt such a man as me;" he then pulled out a pair of old ones from his pocket, and said "You may see with them;" I then asked him where they were, and he said at a silversmith's and watch-marker's, and gave the child directions where to go; I have never seen them since, nor did I see him till last Saturday week.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said you ought to have a good case for them; and you said I have and old case; I said I know a friend of mine who has several steel cases, and he will not charge me much for one; I had forgotten to call for them; when I took them, you said do not put them loose into your pocket; and your niece gave me a bit of paper to put them in. Witness. No; I deny that positively.</p>

            . I was present when the prisoner took the spectacles, and said he would get a pretty case for them; she said she had and old case that wanted mending; but he said he would take them; I went to the house of a watchmaker to get them, but I could not; I heard her ask him about them several times, and saw him produce another pair on the Friday night; and he said "Take them till I bring yours;" he went away on the Saturday morning, and we did not see him again.</p>

            . I am a beadle. I took up the prisoner on the 9th of March; I asked him if he had had the spectacles; he said he had them in his possession, and some person took them from him in a joke.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took them to get a case; she gave them into my hand; I put them down by the side of my saucer, and said I did not know what to do with them; she said to her niece, "Mary, go and get a bit of paper," which she did; and she said, mind you do not break them. I got a little in liquor, and how I lost them I do not know, I came home from Wapping on Friday night, after being out on their business, and she asked me again about them, and went into a great passion; I said, I have mislaid them at present, and there is a pair which you may use, and if I do not find yours, you shall go to a friend of mine and suit yourself; I told her she might go and get a pair of a friend of mine, who was a watchmaker in Conduit-street.</p>
               <p>COURT to SARAH SIMMS. Q. Did you get him to go to Wapping about your husband's business? A. Yes; he did not tell me that he had lost them there - he did not mention the name of a watch maker in Conduit-street, and say I might go and get a pair there - he said my own were there.</p>
               <p>COURT to ROBERT BURGESS. Q. Were you before the Magistrate? A. Yes; the prisoner did not ask there for the young girl to be examined.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not the Magistrate say there would be an opportunity of examining her at another place? A. No, he did not.</p>

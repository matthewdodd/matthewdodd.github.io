               <p>On the 13th of November, at ten in the morning, I had occasion to go from the shop to the accompting-house, where I had not been half a minute, before I perceived the prisoner leaning across the compter, with his hand in the till; I jumped off the chair, and made to the door: the prisoner ran out of the front door, and I pursued him; he ran through different courts; and I pursued him till he was stopt: the shop is at No. 14, <placeName id="t17881210-21-crimeloc98">Birchin-lane</placeName>

I am positive he is the same man; he was only out of my sight by turning round the corners of the courts; he was taken and delivered to the constable, who took him to the Compter; there was 8 s. 6 d. missed out of the till; I had counted it a little before.</p>

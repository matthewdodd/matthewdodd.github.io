Not that I am aware of - the magistrate put down that his father was carrier to a butcher, instead of which he was a butchers' carrier - his mother cried - I do not know what made her cry - I thought it was because she supposed her boy would be frightened.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was passing down James-street - I heard a cry on the left hand side of the way of, "Oh! oh!" very loud indeed - I saw some one run across - I pursued, and heard something fall, but not thinking of that, I went seven or eight doors down the street, when Mr. Nunn caught me - I fell into his arms - immediately after him came Carmody, and some one called out, "That is him" - I said,"No, it was not me that threw that," or something to that effect - Nunn then went away - I do not think he has seen the purse till to-day - the boy lost a cap at the same time- I apprehended the person who took the cap and money, threw the money away, and took away the cap.(Edward East, of No. 4, Grenville-street, a carpenter, gave the prisoner a good character.)</p>

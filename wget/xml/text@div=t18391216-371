Mr. Wilson gave me in<lb></lb>structions to take some one—I saw Mr. Field, a carpenter—he pointed out a sack—I searched it and found two sacks, marked "Josiah Wilson," and on further search, I found five more old sacks, but I could not discern the name—I put them in the sack again, taking away the two that had the name—I gave them to Mr. Field—I took the prisoner as he came up to me at the time I was untying the sacks—he said, did I want to search the sacks—I said, "Yes"—I asked him where he bought them—he said, "Of a man named Hagger," and then in a minute he said, "Of the name of Warner"—I said, "I must take them"—on that Saturday evening Watkins and I went in search of Warner, and found him in a beer-shop—he came out—it was dark, and he ran away.</p>

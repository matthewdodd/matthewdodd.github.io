               <p>JOSEPH HOILES. I gave my daughter Caroline two pairs of shoes to take to a shop on the 2nd of October, between twelve and one o'clock in the day; she was to go from my house in Wheeler-street to Raven-row, Spitalfields - she returned in about an hour and a half, with a Police-officer, without the shoes - the prisoner was afterwards taken up in the evening.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's daughter - he gave me two pairs of shoes, and I took them along the street; the prisoner asked me if I would go on an errand, and said when I came back that he would give me four pence halfpenny; I said I was not going that way - I was going on my way, and he said "Look at the Buy-a-broom;" he then twisted the pinafore round my head, and took the shoes out of my hand, but before he took them he asked me if I should know him again - I am quite sure he is the man; I saw him again the same evening.</p>

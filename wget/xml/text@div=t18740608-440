                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Newman Place, and am a widow—on Monday, 2nd March, I was living with the prisoner at 24, Cardigan Road, for a few days to take care of her while she was ill—on the second morning I gave her her breakfast in bed, she complained very much indeed, and I advised her to keep quite, she said she would, providing I would lay along side of her, for a time—she kept saying all the morning about her sufferings, and said death was preferable to her sufferings—she was my adopted daughter, I brought her up from seven years of age to twenty-one—she is now forty—I laid down by the side of her and fell off in a doze—she was restless—I got off the bed suddenly, and took a knife from her side—I went and sat in a chair—she suddenly attacked me—she said "You shan't leave me"—she rushed on to me and tore my jacket, I held on as well as I could, opened the window and cried out "Murder"—she took me by the hair of my head, and beat my head on the bars of the-grate, saying all the time "You shan't leave me"—froth was coming from her mouth, I recovered myself by her night dress and the iron bedstead—I took up the chair and I knocked the knife out of her hand, and she broke the wash hand basin across my head—when I came to myself she had again got the knife—she had cut my throat first, then she was going to cut her own throat, and I took hold of her,—she drew the knife through my hand, and chopped me on the other, and I fell helpless to the ground—I had been crying out "Murder!" all the time—she made another attempt on her throat—I was nearly insensible—during-the whole of that time she was repeating "Death, death, that is preferable to my sufferings"—when I laid down at the; side of her she put her arm around my neck and kissed me, and said what a good mother I had been.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been sent for to take care of her, because her head was bad—her husband came and said she was very ill, and he must put her in an asylum, as something was very wrong—she has been mar<lb></lb>ried thirteen years—I have always treated her as a daughter, and she me as a mother—I don't believe she knew what she was doing at the time—I don't believe she would harm me—she said she was so sorry she was afflicted, as she would be my good friend in my old days—the doctor said. "Keep knives and things from her"—she once nearly set her bedroom on fire—she would beat her head about—she was tearing her hair and running hair pins in her poor head—I told Mr. Kneller I was afraid to stop, and did not like ray position at all—this was the change of life, women who have had no children at the change of life, their symptoms are worse than those that have had children—the blood flies upwards on the brain—this night she was thoroughly wild, like a maniac.</p>

               <p>2nd March last—the prisoner was admitted that afternoon—she was suffer<lb></lb>ing from a wound in the throat, and fracture of the left knee cap—there were several bruises about her—the prosecutrix was suffering from a superficial wound on the leftside of the throat—she had two ribs fractured, also on the left side, and superficial wounds about her face-the prisoner remained in the hospital sixty-six days; the prosecutrix for twenty-five days—Cleves had some wounds on her hands—this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) would have caused those rounds—I have had many opportunities of watching the prisoner, and my opinion is she is not sound of mind—about forty is the age when change of life takes place; it is a kind of transitory mental derangement—a Woman can pass through the process without it—it may afterwards disappear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> All these circumstances spoken of by the prosecutrix are incident to this period of life—when women have no children, the symptoms may be more aggravated—after the evidence I have heard, I am of opinion that she is of unsound mind.</p>

                  </hi>. I, am a surgeon—previously to the 27th February last, I had been attending the prisoner for about a month—during that time she was' suffering from great mental disturbance, and what she came to me for was accompanied by a good deal of melancholy and depression of mind, so much so, I put her family on their guard against her—I saw her husband at my surgery—I advised him to get her into a hospital, because they were not in a position to pay—she was suffering from change of life.</p>

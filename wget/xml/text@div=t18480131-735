                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Purnell, of Camberwell—the prisoner is my son—he is eleven years old. On 6th Jan., at ten minutes before nine o'clock in the morning, I went out to work, and left him to go to school—I left eight sovereigns at home, in a box—I came home about three—he was not at home—the eight sovereigns were gone—I did not find him till the Friday week following, at a house in Lambeth-walk—he then had a pilot-coat on, and a hat called a <hi rend="italic">south-wester</hi>—I asked him where he had been—he said, "At Mr. Walker's, at Bermondsey"—I went to her on the Tuesday following, and asked her if she knew this little boy—she said, "No"—I said, "Perhaps you don't know him in the dress he has got on"—she then said, "I think I do"—I said, "Perhaps you know of some money he brought here"—she said, no, he had not brought any—I told her that he said he had ought her earrings, and rings for her fingers, and food for the house, with some of the money—she said he had not; she had lent him 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the day before.</p>

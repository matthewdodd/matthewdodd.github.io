The prisoner was in our service—on Sunday, the 10th of April, the prisoner came into the parlour as she was going out with the children, I saw some flowers in her cap which I suspected were mine, and while she was absent I searched, and missed several articles from two closets, of which the prisoner frequently had the keys, and no one else, but myself—this twenty yards of lace, handkerchief, habit-shirt, and other things now produced are mine—I can swear to them—they were found in her box.</p>

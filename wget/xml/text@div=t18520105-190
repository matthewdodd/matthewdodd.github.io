I do not know her name, she is a little short woman"—I said, "I suppose you mean Mrs. Hans?"—he said, "I do not know her name"—I said I had a woman of that description, and likewise a person they called Mrs. Bare—when I mentioned Mrs. Bare the prisoner said that was his wife; he then asked if I had not had some boxes come there—I told him that there were two boxes, but they were gone—he wanted to go up and see if his property was not in my place, and I said, "Can't you believe me, they are gone; Mrs. Hans and Mrs. Bare went together, Mrs. Hans did not tell me she was going"—he said, "Are you aware that I can go up and burst the door open, if I thought my property was in your place"—I said, "You will do nothing of the sort; if you go and</p>

                  </hi> I live with my mother, Mrs. Abrahams, at 5, Brook's-gardens, Bagnigge-wells. I recollect Mrs. Hans and Mrs. Bare living with my mother—they left on a Friday night, and I took two boxes for Mrs. Bare on a barrow, up to Marylebone—I do not know the name of the street—I think the number was 33—I remember the prisoner coming to my mother's on a Saturday night, and I went to the same house where I had taken the boxes—I showed the prisoner the way—we left ray mother's house about half-past 6 o'clock—it took us about three-quarters of an hour to walk—on the way, we went first to a public-house in Leather-lane, and then we went to one at the bottom of Holborn-hill; but he did not have anything tardiest there—he stopped at three public-houses; we went to one at the corner of the same street where I had taken the boxes, and to a <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> shop a little higher up—at the public-house he said that public-house was too open for him to sit in, in case she might come in, and then she would not go home—he then went to the <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> shop, and had some ale—before we went to the house he said he would try to take the boxes home; that he would take one, find I should take the other—we then went to No. 33, and went into the parlour, where we saw the landlord—the prisoner bad some conversation with him—I went out twice for beer, and when I was coming in the second time, the woman who had been at my mother's followed me in—we had then been in the house half or three-quarters of an hour; during which time the prisoner had been in the parlour, with the landlord and landlady—when the woman came in, the landlord said to the prisoner, "That is her;" and he said, "Now, don't you <hi rend="italic">kick</hi> up any disturbance at all"—the woman went up stairs—she did not see the prisoner—the prisoner took the candle, and followed her up immediately—they had been up stairs a short time when the prisoner called to me and said, "My lad, come and fetch the boxes downs<lb></lb>tairs—I went up stairs and found them talking together, in a back room on the first floor, standing near the window—I did not hear what they said; they were talking very quiet, and appeared to be friendly—the prisoner said, pointing to a box, "Here, my lad, you take this box down stairs"—I took the box, and as I came out of the room the woman began screaming; and I saw the prisoner hitting her—I put the box down, went across the room to him, and said, "What is the use of hitting your wife like that?"—he said, "Trouble your head with your own business"—I saw him give her two or three blows about the breast before I left the room—he struck her in this</p>

"No, I have not"—I said, "You have"—he said, "If I have, you tell the policeman"—I told a policeman, who was on the opposite side, by the public-house—during the time I was in the room, when I went to fetch the first box, I did not see the woman strike the prisoner at all.</p>

I am the wife of Charles Beckett, a printer, and live in the front-room first-floor of this house—I knew the deceased, she went by the name of Miss Knott, and lived in the adjoining room—another woman named Hans lodged there—they both slept in that room—on 8th Nov., about half-past seven in the evening, I was in my room; the deceased came home—I did not Ree her—I heard footsteps a few minutes before nine and heard her go into her own room—a few minutes afterwards I heard the foot<lb></lb>steps of another person following bar up stairs, and a few minutes after they both got into the room the door was shut—I heard quarreling between them—I heard him call her a blasted b----ch—soon after he-come in said "I wish to take away the boxes"—he accused her of being at a low public-house—he mentioned the name, of it, which I do not remember—after that, he said she was with some low prostitutes—she said, "So help me God I was not there"—that transpired—I went down<lb></lb>stairs—I have told you all that transpired—I heard him say he would not go out without the boxes, and she said, "If you will sit down, I will explain everything to you"—the last words I heard him say were blasted b----I—then ran down-stairs to tell the landlady they were quarreling—she was standing on the step of her door—I then returned into my own room—I heard nothing then, but I ran up quick, shut the door directly, and as soon as Dgot</p>

               <p>in heard a scream of "Murder!"—I came out of my room—the back-room door was wide open—I saw a boy standing just within the door, who had come to fetch the boxes away—he had a box on his shoulder—the deceased and the prisoner were in the room against the window, fighting—the prisoner had his right hand raised, striking several heavy blows—she did not strike him—they were standing close together, they fell down together, and they never appeared to be separate—she seemed to have hold of him—she neither struck or attempted to strike him, in my presence—I saw him strike her four or five heavy blows before she fell—I did not see that he had anything in his hand to strike her with—I could see nothing but his clenched fist—he struck like this (<hi rend="italic">downwards</hi>)—she was stooping down, while he was striking her she called "Murder!" four or five times—I did not hear her say anything else—he did not say anything to her—I said to the boy who was standing near the door, "Go and take him away"—and the boy said, "I shall not touch him, for it serves her <hi rend="italic">Joilly</hi> well right"—after she was on the ground she raised herself up again, and he got up too, and by that time she had reached the fireplace, and then he struck her five or six more heavy blows, which appeared to be on the head and face—her hack was to me—she did not attack him, or strike him, when she got up—when she raised herself she had got hold of him round the waist it appeared, but his back was to me—I could not see her hands, after the last blow, she fell on the fender, and he came out of the room, and passed me on the mat—I cannot say where the last blow was struck—her back was towards me then, and there was a very dim light, a candle in the middle of the table—it is a small square room, about as large as from me to that lamp—the fireplace faces you as you go into the room—it was at the fireplace she died—the prisoner said nothing to me as he left the room—I did not see him go out of the house, but he went down-stairs—he passed close by me—I could not see whether he had anything in his hands at that time—I was too much frightened.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say she said nothing, but did you say anything to the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing; after he had gone out I stood and looked at the woman a few minutes, hesitating whether I should go into the room or not—she sat with her face down, and her hair down, and her eyes fixed—I noticed blood running down her face, and about the room, and on the hearth—I ran down to the landlady, and in about ten minutes saw the woman dead.</p>

I have not done it"—I almost immediately heard him call the boy to fetch the boxes—the boy passed me on the stairs to go for the boxes, and I crossed any room to the window, and heard the first blow struck, and the woman scream—I then went part of the way up stairs, nearly to the top, and could hear the woman's voice—she called "Murder!" two or three times—her last words were, "Oh, he has murdered me"—the boy was in the room at that time—I lost my sight in the fright, the prisoner touched my dress as be went out—I was very much alarmed.</p>

I am the wife of Samuel Robinson, a stonemason, of 5, Half-moon-passage, Aldersgate-street—I was acquainted with the prisoner and his late wife—after she had left him he came to my house to make inquiries of me about her—I knew where she was for a little time, I could not tell him at that time—about a fortnight before she died, he came to my house one morning and asked me whether I knew where his wife was—I said no, I did not—he said, "I have heard of my wife, she is 100 miles away, nursing an old lady; I don't mind <hi rend="italic">tramping</hi> 100 miles to have revenge, for revenge is sweet"—he said if he could trace out where the boxes went, that was what he wanted.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just tell us how he said it; what did he say first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said, "I have heard yesterday my wife is 100 miles away, I don't mind <hi rend="italic">tramping</hi> 100 miles so long as I can trace out where the boxes went to, for revenge is sweet"—I said, "Why should you think wrong of your wife, did you ever find her doing wrong?"—he made this reply to me, "Why, I do not know, I have seen her making up some finery, and that is only fit for a loose woman in the street"—that was the remark he made to me—I said, "You know nothing wrong of her?"—he said, "No, I have always found her just, from the very first hour she met with me to the hour she left me"—he sent a letter to me the following day—he said he would not come any more—I could not tell him where she lived, because I did not know at that time—he wanted me, if I could tell him where she was, to come there for a few minutes—he wanted me to make some appointment—I said I could not tell, I knew where she was at work where I sent him, but she was only there for a day or two—in the course of that conversation, he said, "If I catch hold of her, she will repent it," he would lay his hand on her, and she would not forget it—I think the phrase was, "She will repent it," as near as I can say.</p>

I heard of the death of the woman in Marylebone from a policeman who called on a Monday; I forget the date—ten days or a fortnight before that, I cannot be certain which, a man, who I believe to be the prisoner to the best of my belief, came and bought a flat file—on the same day, about twenty minutes afterwards, but I am not certain, he came back</p>

               <p>and said the file did not answer his purpose, and wished me to change it—I said, "No, I shall not change it; because I do not think you bought it here"—he pulled something out of his pocket, and said, "Yes, I did; I b ought this at the same time to convince me that he bought the file there—he selected another file, a triangular one or three-cornered one; I think they call it a saw-file—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the sort of file, and it is also of the same magnitude—we had several of the kind at one time, and we had one or two left at the time this was bought—to the best of my belief, it was the prisoner who changed the file—I have not sworn that it was him—there is the maker's name on this file, and on others that we have—we had one or two files in the shop with the maker's name on them after selling a similar file to this—the policeman took one of them away; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it, because it has a broken point—the maker's name is Robinson—that is not my husband's name—I cannot say whether the file I sold was sharp of blank, but it was rusty, because we never clean any tools.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, D</hi> 64). I was appointed to stay with the prisoner at the station, on the night on which he was taken—I was locked up in the cell with him—he was put in the cell a little after 10 o'clock, and in about 5 minutes he began to speak to me—the inspector ordered me to remain with him, and be careful to have nothing to say to him, but whatever he said I was to notice—he asked me if his wife was dead; I said, "Yes; you have been told by the inspector your wife is dead"—he said, "Well, I done it, and this is the arm that done it," lifting up his right arm—he said afterwards, any<lb></lb>one that would take the life of another ought to be served the same; he should neither employ counsel or Judge, but should plead guilty—he also said that if it had not been for the boy who directed him to the house it never would have happened—he said, in bringing the big box out of the room his wife got hold of him, turned round to him, and said, "Now, old fellow, you have not got all;" that he then immediately turned round and struck her, or attacked her; I think he said struck her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On 8th Nov., between 8 and 9 I o'clock, I was called to 33, North-street—I went up to the back-room, first<lb></lb>floor, and found a woman there quite dead; blood was flowing from various wounds in her face, neck, and other parts of her body—I observed I six or seven wounds on her face, there were sixteen wounds in front of I the body altogether, which I counted, and from afterwards seeing the I pelisse she wore, there must have been more—about nine of the wounds I were on the body—they were all done by the same instrument; they I were every one of a triangular shape—such an instrument as this tile I would have inflicted them—I opened the body afterwards—the wound I mast have penetrated to the back part of the throat, fracturing the bone in its progress—it pierced the angle of the eye, fracturing the bone—it was I not high enough to touch any portion of the brain—it would require very considerable force to fracture the bone there—the first rib was fractured—the most serious wound was on the first rib, on the left side, a short distance from the breast bone—it passed through the large pulmonary artery leading from the heart; that wound of itself was quite sufficient to have calked death—the wound was just the size of the file—the hemorrhage from that artery would make death certain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You examined her body carefully? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes I did not observe any bruises on her body, except a considerable bruise on the angle of the left eye, where there was a punctured wound—I did not see any bruise where there was no wound—I think I must have seen them if there had been, for I examined the forepart of the body very minutely—the cause of death was so obvious I did not enter into minute anatomy—I did not examine the back part; I judge of the wounds there by the tippet.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you first make an external examination before you used the knife to the body? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I examined the wounds in the face first—I did that minutely, and also the head and trunk; but until I opened the body I could not tell whether the pulmonary artery was cut—I discovered on bruises except those that were round the different wounds.</p>

                  </hi>. I come here from the Marylebone Infirmary. I knew the deceased—she lodged in the same room with me at Brooks-gardens, and moved with me to the room in North-street—nobody but us lived in that room—she got her living by going to work with me at feather bonnets", in Wigmore-street—she was, I think, about forty years of age, about my own age—she was a little taller than me, but not much—I do not think she was a very strong woman—I never saw such a thing as this file in the room at North-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am forewoman at Messrs. Grocock's, in Bow Churchyard. I give out work to a number of young women to make up at their own houses—there is a weekly accounting—we pay every Saturday—the young women generally fill up their accounts on paper ruled as this paper is—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—the prisoner, who was in our employ, came to me with this bill (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) on the 10th of Oct.—when she presented it it was not in the state in which it is now—there have been additions made to the items, which have been interlined, since it was presented to me—the items which were on it when it was presented to me were, two dresses, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and other items, making the total amount 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I found it quite correct in my judgment—I ticked the items, and signed the amount at the bottom for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I returned the bill to the prisoner, and it was her duty to take it to the cashier to get the money—since then there has been added to it, ten dresses, at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; twenty, at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and twenty, at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; making the amount 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—no work of that kind had been done by her—I am quite sure these items were not in the bill when it was presented to me—on the following week this other bill was presented to me as the result of her week's work—the items on it then were two frocks, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some other items, and the gross amount was 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I ticked the items, and signed it for 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—since then there had been added to it ten dresses, at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; twenty, at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and ten, at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; making the total 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I am quite sure the prisoner had none of this work—when the bill was presented to me there was a space left between the lines, and on the lines in those spaces these additions have been written—none of this work was done by her which she has put in—those other items are not ticked by me—I authorized her to receive 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. only.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier to Mr. Richard Grocock and his two part<lb></lb>ners. It was the custom for workwomen to bring their accounts to me to pay—before I paid them I required the signature of Miss Shrimpton—the prisoner, who was in our service, presented these two bills on the 10th and on the 24th of Oct.—they were precisely in this state when she presented them, aod, finding Miss Shrimpton's signature to them, I paid her, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the 10th of Oct., and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the 24th of Oct.—I think the prisoner put her name to them at the time, but I could not swear positively—I went before the Magistrate, and the prisoner had an opportunity of producing the persons who she said she had employed—she received her money of me about twelve o'clock.</p>

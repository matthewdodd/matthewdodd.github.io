                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, of 48, Farringdon-street. I occa<lb></lb>sionally employed Camplin on Saturday nights as a shopman, and did so last Saturday night—the prisoner Smith came into the shop at a quarter-past eleven o'clock; I did not hear what she asked for—Camplin served her with a small piece of cheese, about 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth—she gave a small coin, but I cannot swear what it was; I only had an indistinct glimpse of it as he <hi rend="italic">jinked</hi> it and threw it into the till—I should think it was sixpence or a shilling—I saw him put his hand into the till, sweep up a handful of silver, and pass it to her—I distinctly saw two half-crowns and some other silver money passed to her—when she received it, she did not look as it or count it, and was in the act of leaving the shop, when I came and asked what she had got—she said no more than her right change—I said my man gave her a handful of silver, and when I first taxed her with it, she put her band into her pocket—she then said he had given her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was her right change, and the young man was quite a stranger to her—Camplin affected to know nothing about what I was doing—I afterwards told him he had given the woman a handful of silver—he asked me very loudly what I meant, and said he had given her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., her right change—he heard Smith say she was a stranger, and be said she was a stranger to him—I asked the woman her address—she said, "Round the corner," and she subsequently said she did not live round the corner, but at the other end of the town—I asked her where, and she refused to tell me—I sent for a policeman, and he took them to the station.</p>

               <p>I saw two half-crowns in Smith's hands—I saw them pass from him to her—it was very rapidly done—I came round the counter to her as she was going away with the money in her hand, and she put it into her pocket.</p>

I was sent for, and took the prisoners to the station—on the road, Smith dropped a shillings—when we got to the station, she refused to give her address, and said she only had her right change—before the Alderman she gave her address as 11, Clement's-lane—I went, and found she lived there—after the examination was over, when the prisoners were going down the stairs, Camplin put his arms round Smith's neck, and kissed her—she did not appear to resist that at all.</p>

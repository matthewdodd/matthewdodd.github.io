             sworn. - The prisoner at the bar took of me a ready-furnished room, on the 26th of August, at five shillings a week, it was up one pair of stairs; I delivered her the key, and described the sheets that I gave into her possession, and I said I should want to change them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss these things? - A. I missed them on Friday, at half past twelve o'clock, when the prisoner was out of the house; I have got a key myself that belongs to the same room, for being robbed before, it made us careful, and when she came in, I asked her for the sheets, to change them for her; I said, will you give me the sheets, and I will give you others; she said, most assuredly I will; she then went away, and run; I cried out stop thief, and followed her; a man in the street took her; I followed her to Marlborough-street; she said, Mrs. Rodbourn let me go, I will bring them to you on Monday, or directly; my husband not being present, I did not know what to do; I took her before the Magistrate, and she denied ever having them on the bed; I then told her, if she would own to them, that I would not put myself to any expence.</p>

             sworn. - I was going up Sackville-street on the 31st of August, and saw the prosecutrix running after the prisoner, she was crying out stop thief; I asked her what was the matter, and she said the prisoner had robbed her room; I ran after her, and stopped her; I desired<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120053"></xptr>her to come back; she said, let me go, I will return her her property; I said, I know nothing of you, you must go back with me; I brought her back, and the woman desired me to take her to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord and Gentlemen, I can assure you I am wrongfully accused by my prosecutrix, of whom I took the lodgings; at the time I took the room, she said she was sorry she could not make the place so comfortable as she wished; she had taken the key of the door with her, and then charged me with stripping the apartment of that which was never in the room; I declare myself innocent; leaving my case in your hands, I trust in God I shall be acquitted.</p>

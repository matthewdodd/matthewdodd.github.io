               <p>Q. Had you been drinking? - A. Yes; then I went with her to Mrs. Brown's; we went up stairs, and I laid down upon the bed; she asked me for sixpence, which I gave her, and then I fell asleep; Mrs. Brown's son came up to me, waked me, and asked me, if I had lost any thing; I told him, I did not know; the first thing I felt for was my watch, and I missed it.</p>

            When had you seen it last? - A. I had the chain in my hand when I laid down upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to put your hand to the chain? - A. I commonly do when I lay down any where; when I missed it, I went down stairs, and the prisoner was there; Mrs. Brown said to her, I am sure you have got the property, she said, she had not it, and Mrs. Brown said she would have her searched; I sent for a brother tradesman of mine, and my wife happened to be there; she, came and I sent my wife for an officer, and while she was gone, the prisoner put her hand in her bosom, and said, here is your watch, take it; I said, no, it is too late, there is an officer sent for; she then put it upon the hob in the fire-place, and said, who can hurt me, if the property is not found upon me; a little while after, the officer came in and I gave charge of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain you were sober enough to know that you had the chain of your watch in your hand? - A. Yes.</p>

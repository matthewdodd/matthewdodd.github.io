               <p>Prosecutor. A man brought me the stockings back; he is a cheesemonger's man; I did not see him pick up the stockings.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Marcello. I did not see him drop any thing.</p>
               <p>Court. You have said before, the stockings were found upon him: did you see the stockings found upon him? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury. There is a deficiency in the evidence; they have not brought the person who saw the prisoner drop the stockings, nor the person who picked them up; that he broke the window it is clear; that he dropped something it is clear; but what it was that he dropt is not proved.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Deane, a stationer, of No. 29, York Street, Westminster. He is the landlord of the house, and lives in it—the prisoner was a lodger there—she occupied a front attic—she had been with us three weeks when this affair happened—no one else occupied it with her—on the morning of 23rd July I missed from a box in her room a great coat, and a pair of plaid trowsers—I did not go up myself; I sent a little girl that I keep—I saw the prisoner afterwards, I think about 11 o'clock—I asked her if the little girl had turned out the whole of the boxes to look for the property, and she said she had done so—I said it was a most extraordinary thing, as the things were in that place when she took possession of the room—I said, "My husband is going out in a hurry, and when he returns I must come and look and see if I can find them"—she then went up stairs—I saw her come down again in about ten minutes—she ran down the stairs very quickly, accompanied by a young girl named Eliza<lb></lb>beth Groves—I then sent the servant up again—the moment she got to the door and opened it, she screamed out "Fire! the place is in flames!"—I did not go up stairs myself—I was standing between my parlour and shop door—I smelt the fire, but I did not go up—I sent for a policeman—a soldier of the Grenadier Guards, lodging in the floor below the prisoner's room, went up—I saw the prisoner about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after this—she had the key of the door round her finger—I was looking out of my shop door as she came up—I said, "You have set my place on fire"—she said, "My good woman, I know nothing at all about your place being on fire"—the policeman was behind her—after she came inside the house, she said to one of the lodgers, "Is it natural I should come back if I had set the place on fire?"—I gave her into custody as she came in at the door—I did not go into the room at all myself—I was dreadfully alarmed—there were my own three children in the house, and my lodgers' children.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mrs. Deane. On the morning of 23rd July I was sent up into the prisoner's room to search for a coat and pair of trowsers—I could not find them—the prisoner was there while I was making the search—there was no fire in the room or in the fireplace, nor any candle alight—I think it was about 10 o'clock—she came down stairs about five minutes afterwards with a slop pail, and she took a jug of water up stairs with her—she came down again about five minutes after—a girl named Elizabeth Groves was with her, with a baby in her arms—they went out together—Mrs. Deane told me to go up and see if her things were all right—when I got up the door of the room was locked—I had a key which I opened the door with—when I got into the room I discovered the bed, and the sheet, and pillow case, on fire—there was smoke in the room—I hal<lb></lb>looed out, "Fire!"—I put the blanket on the blaze—it was alight and blazing—Mr. Moon then came up—he went down again, and got a pail of water—it was smoking then—Mrs. Deane sent me for a policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 18, York Street, Westminster, with my father. I know the prisoner—I saw her on the night of 22nd July, the night before this happened—she left her key with me, and told me to call about half past 10 o'clock next morning—I went up, and knocked at the door—I took her two slices of bread and butter—I did not go in—I saw smoke, and smelt fire—she partly opened the door—I said, "What a smoke! I smell fire!" and she said it was only the candle—it was not like the smoke of a candle—I did not see any candle in the room—there was a table there, with nothing on it—I did not see any candle alight—she went in, and shut the door, and then came down—I went out with her—I am quite sure I smelt burning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the Grenadier Guards. I live at Mr. Deane's house, on the second floor front room—I knew the prisoner as a lodger in the other attic over me—on the morning of 23rd July I heard a dreadful scream of "Fire!"—I ran out of my room, and seeing smoke over head, I went up to the prisoner's room—I saw a dreadful smoke there, and Mrs. Deane's servant trying to smother the fire on the bed with a blanket—I ran down to my own room, took a pail of dirty water, and threw it on the bed, squeezed the bed up together, and put out the fire—after I had done so, I perceived that the place had been burnt, the wood<lb></lb>work of the room—I should think it is four or five feet from the bed—I took hold of it, and it was hot, and nearly burnt my finger—I afterwards</p>

               <p>pointed it out to the police sergeant in the prisoner's presence, and she said, "Oh, this was done three or four nights ago, with the candlew"—I said, "How could that be; for it was so hot that it burnt my finger?"—the policeman went and took hold of it, and said it was quite warm then—the prisoner then said she had just done it in lighting a candle and sealing a letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did she not appear agitated and confused? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at all—Mrs. Deane seemed much alarmed—it was a small room—I should think the bed was within four or five feet of the place that was burnt.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far do you think the bed was from the wood work that was burnt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think ten or twelve feet—the candle was burnt down in the socket.</p>

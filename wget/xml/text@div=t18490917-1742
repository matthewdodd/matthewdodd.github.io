                  </hi>. I was in the service of Mr. Charles Baker and another—it was my duty to take down meat in a cart to Christ's Hospital, at Hertford, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. I have known the prisoner two or three years—about two months after I began to go to Hertford, I saw the prisoner outside his house—he keeps a beer-shop at Enfield Highway—it was about the middle of March—he called me, and asked if I would go in and have anything to drink—I did, and we had a pint of ale together—he asked me if I could bring down a joint of meat or two worth the money—I said I could, and took him down a leg of mutton the following day—he asked if I would stop there and take breakfast—he said I might as well stop there as anywhere, else, and he would get breakfast for me at half-past six in a morning—I stopped, and breakfasted there from that time, and I continued to take meat there every other morning; I did not miss once in any journey—I was paid for the meat about once a week, on an average of 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—I remember leaving him a clod of beef in April; he paid me 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for that—the fair wholesale price was about 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—no bill was made of the different joints—when there was a settlement between us, we got a piece of chalk and chalked it on a board—he did not pay me in full; he always knocked off the odd halfpence—he told me he ought to have half the profit as well as myself—I put the meat in the cellar when I took it down, because it was a more sly place—he told me to take it down there, and nobody would have any suspicion—he said that several times—I had offered him a piece of meat once in the tap-room, and he told me not to offer it there, he would make it all right, and I took the meat into the cellar—I sold meat to other persons down the road—the meat which I delivered at the prisoner's was my master's; it was not paid for by me—it was given me by Wildgoose—I cannot say that I have not stolen some myself—I told the prisoner that</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Whilley Villas, Holloway, and am a collector of the Inland Revenue—on the night of 11th April I went to bed about 11 o'clock, leaving the doors and windows safe—I was awoke in the morning by the ringing of the front door bell—I went down and opened the door, and saw a sergeant and a constable—they came inside, and went to the back, through the kitchen—the constable had his hand severely cut—I found the scullery door open, and the bar wrenched from the outside of the window—the house was entered by that window—I missed three shoebrushes and some bacon—these brushes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine.</p>

On the morning of 12th April, about 4 o'clock, I saw the prisoner at the back of the villas—there was a good light at that time—I could see his face—when he saw me he ran into in empty house thirty or forty yards from the prosecutor's—I searched for him, and found him in the water-closet—I asked him what he was doing there—he dropped the brushes and bacon from under his coat, and struggled with me through the rooms—he tried to get away—I got him out to the back of the house, and knocked him down with my truncheon—I took him up, and was taking him into the Caledonian Road—as I was opening the gate he cut me severely across the hand with a knife, or something of that sort—I was compelled to release my hold, and he got away—I pursued him into some empty houses, but he got away—I was laid up nearly a month—I picked up the property and went to the prosecutor's house, when he iden<lb></lb>tified the things—I found a basket of tools at the back of, the empty house the prisoner entered—there was a screw-driver, a putty knife, and a stock and bit—I saw the prisoner again on 23rd June, at the Kingsland Station, with twelve or fifteen others—I looked round and said "That is the man"—I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

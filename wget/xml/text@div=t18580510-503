                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Adam Cox, of No. 51, Houndsditch, manufacturer of steel goods. On the Monday or Tuesday before Good Friday, the prisoner called on me, and brought me a letter—he said, in very broken English, that he could not speak English at all, but would come at 5 o'clock with an interpreter—he came at 5 o'clock without an inter<lb></lb>preter, and spoke very well indeed; I could understand him as well as I can you—he looked at some goods, and said that he wanted goods to the amount of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that he had come from Holland, and that the Portuguese Synagogue would pay for the goods—he selected tea-pots, plated goods, and other small things—he went away, and said Chat he would call in the morn<lb></lb>ing—hedid so, and looked at forty-one or forty-two dozen of ladies' pen<lb></lb>knives, very small—they were tied up in grosses on the counter; twelve packets tied up together made a gross—he asked me what I would take for the lot—I told him we would take 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen, if he would take the lot—he looked at some more things, and then spoke about the penknives again—we both counted them, and made them thirty-one dozen and one-third—I had occasion to move them on to tho shelf I took them from, and had to turn my back, and leave the counter two or three yards, and when I returned I missed five dozen; I said, "There were five dozen more"—he said, "Oh, no; you have made a mistake"—I took them down again, and found only twenty-six dozen and one-third—I received some information from William Dillon, and jumped over the counter—the prisoner had put his hat upon some other goods—Ikicked it over, apparently by accident, picked it up, and found one dozen of knives inside it, wrapped up in a cloth—I have not found the other four dozen—I accused him of it, and, with an oath, he said it was quite an accident, and, as my employer was not at home, I let him go, thinking I had all the property—I like to put the best construction on everything, thinking it might be a mistake on my part.</p>

             went up the yard, and was speaking to one of the lodgers; a little while after that I went and put my hand upon the shoulder of Mills, and I immediately felt the shot all about my face and breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the report of any thing at the time that you felt the shot - A. I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner. - A. Yes; and I knew his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him before you felt the shot. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were stunned by this. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fall down. - A. I do not know, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. After your recovery did you see the prisoner. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to state whether Mills received any injury or not. - A. Yes, he was shot in the eye.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Where you with 
               <persName id="t18071028-82-person832">Mills</persName>
             the whole of the day. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of you had been firing at the sparrows in the walnut tree. - A. Mills fired once at the sparrows in the walnut tree, in the yard of the prisoner's house; it was at the back of the prisoner's window, about thirty or forty feet from it. I have a shot in my pocket which I took out of my head with a comb; here is the hat I had on at the time (produced the hat).</p>
               <p>Court to jury. You see there are some shot holes in the front.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did this happen. - A. Between five and six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you received the shot was it that you had been firing in the yard. - A. He shot the sparrows about one or two o'clock.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH GIBSON. - Mr. Knapp. You live at Poplar. - A. Yes, in the adjoining room to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house was it that the prisoner shot out of, as it is supposed. - A. Out of the one pair of stairs, and I live in the one pair of stairs, the rooms join, there is only lath and plaster between them; they both look into this yard, and they are both on the first floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you looking out of the window in the course of that afternoon. - A. Yes, just at the moment of time Mills and Ive were shot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at the bar before you heard any thing. - A. I never saw him; I had not been to the window five minutes before I saw Mills and Ive standing with their backs to the privy, and their faces towards my window, in their own yard, talking to a woman in a room immediately over me in the same house; I did not hear what they said; I heard the report of a gun, and the smoke came out of a window adjoining mine. I saw the boys drop their heads.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean that you saw the smoke come out of the room that the prisoner inhabited. - A. Yes, apparently so; it exactly came in that direction. I could not see the prisoner, nor the window of that house, for the projection of the house that I live in,</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You saw the boys drop their heads immediately upon the report of the gun. - A. Yes; and in the course of a minute, when they held up their heads, I saw their faces covered with blood, and I heard them cry out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they drop or fall with it. - A. I cannot exactly say, they were in their master's yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard the prisoner say any thing to the boys, or the boys to the prisoner. - A. I heard the prisoner swearing in his own apartment; it was a man's voice.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you particularly familiar with the prisoner's voice, so as to say it was his voice. - A. Yes, I have heard him swearing several nights, and cursing several nights since I have been there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know this man much before. - A. No, I am a total stranger to him; I have not been long in the place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. How near does that walnut tree grow to the prisoner's window. - A. It was pretty nigh the privy where the boys were; the branches overshadow the privy, it is twenty feet off the prisoner's window.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the boys directing any discourse to the prisoner. - A. No, they were merely in conversation with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280060"></xptr>the woman above me. Some minutes after the accident I heard the prisoner say he would blow their brains out, but who he said so of I do not know.</p>

            . Q. What are you. - A. I am a waterman and lighterman. On the day this accident happened coming along I saw a number of people around this butcher's shop, I asked what had happened: they said two boys had been shot by the man next door; in consequence of that I went into the house where the prisoner lived. There was a door in the passage at the bottom of the stairs, that was fastened; I broke it open; I called out before I broke it open; there was no answer given. After I broke it open I went up stairs, I found the door of the prisoner's room was locked, I desired it to be opened, it was by the prisoner's wife. I then saw the prisoner standing by the bed side, he had a flannel waistcoat in his hand, and only a coat and waistcoat on; I asked him how he came to be guilty of such a rash action as to shoot the two boys; he blasted and swore at me, and asked me what authority I had to come there and take him; I told him that did not signify, he must go along with me; he said he would if I would let him put his clothes on. In fact I put his clothes on. A young man came in after me; he handed the gun over the bed to me, calling me by name, he said here is the gun that he shot him with, I suppose; the prisoner said, damn you, that is the gun, and he would shoot them again, or any one belonging to them. He wanted the gun from me, saying it was his property; he said frequently to the same purpose, that he would shoot them again, he did not care for any judge or justice; I believe he was very much in liquor. I took him before the magistrate, and here is the gun; it was quite damp with the sulphur, at the time I put the ramrod in the inside; it came out quite foul.</p>
               <p>Q. You were accidently passing at this time. - A. Yes, I do not know that ever I saw him before this time.</p>
               <p>GEORGE FLETCHER. - Mr. Knapp. You are an assistant to Mr. Smith, a surgeon. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you called to the assistance of these boys that had received this injury. - A. Yes, the boys appeared to be very much wounded about the head and face, with a number of small shot; Ives had one of his teeth broken; Mills had received a shot in the center of the right eye, which has deprived him of the sight entirely, it never can be restored; there was one or two in the neck, and one in the breast of Ives. Mills is in danger now, in consequence of the wound; there is an abscess in the back part of the eye.</p>

Do you remember his having any accident. - A.He had a piece of timber fall upon his head about thirty-eight years ago, it hurt him a good deal, I did not see it done; for this two years I have taken notice that he has not been in his proper senses; he has done no work lately, only little jobs, hanging a grindstone.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he is about eighty years of age. - A. I cannot tell; but I believe he is eighty-four.</p>

            . - Mr. Gurney. You live in Old-street. - A. Yes, I am a millwright.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner. - A. Thirty-five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a piece of timber falling on his head. - A. Not that which Bragg speaks of. He had an accident in the year seventy-seven, a second accident; I was present at this accident. I will relate how it happened. In order to drive an old cog out of a wheel, some come out at one blow, and sometimes they require three or four; the cog flies fast when it is drove out, and it met Rigby upon his head; it was a severe blow, we thought he was killed.</p>
               <p>Q. After that time did he appear to you that he was hurt in his intellects. - A. Yes, he fell short in his intellects within a twelve month after that, so far as disabled him from going through his business as he used to do, he was not so sharp as he used to be; before this any difficult job, he was the man that was picked out to do it. After this accident he was able to do a easy job, but not a difficult one.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280061"></xptr>Court. It had impaired the sharpness of his senses, still you thought he knew right from wrong. - A. Yes; he fell so short he was not fit to be put about much work.</p>

            . - Mr. Gurney. I believe you are a carpenter. - A. Yes, I live at Poplar, within a door or two of the prisoner; I have known him twelve or fourteen years; I always took him to be deranged and insane, not like another man; he is more so at some times than at other times. I have seen him outrageous when he has been at his own house, and swearing and tearing and going on in an irregular way, to what a man ought to in his senses.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Was he a sober man - A. Sometimes he was sober and sometimes not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have described him as raving and swearing when he was outrageous, was that when he was sober. - A. I took upon it that happened when he was in liquor; I never saw him in his house. I did not know he was in possession of a gun.</p>
               <p>Court. What part of the house have you seen him outrageous. - A. In the one pair of stairs. I could see him from my garden; he has been swearing at the window as if at somebody in the yard when there was nobody in the yard; it occurred very often years past down to the present time; he was directing all these oaths to a creature of his own imagination.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WICKSTEAD. - Mr. Gurney. I believe you keep the Black Horse in Limehouse. - A. Yes, I have known him between twenty and thirty years.</p>

               <p>Q. Has he been during these twenty and thirty years in his mind or out of his mind. - A. Deranged in his mind. I have seen him when sober take up a tea kettle and knock his wife down without any provocation; he has talked all night when a-bed, he has come up into the garret when I have been a-bed; I have been so frightened at him, I have gone out of doors from him; he is worse when he gets a little liquor, he is so when he is sober and he is so when he is drunk. I have seen the gun hang up in his room; I am frequent in the habit of seeing him, and it has remained so on him down to the present time.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a very old man. - A. Yes.</p>

            . I believe you are a tanner in Bermondsey. - A. Yes; I lived once in Poplar in the same house with him eleven months, two years ago, I saw him every day at that time; I thought him out of his senses, one sign being so rapid in his discourse, cursing and damning, knocking the things about the house, and stamping about like a madman, when there was no person in the room with him; I have seen him beat his breast and strike his head many times, and damn himself; I have seen him strike the table and say, I will strike you next, when there was nobody there.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the whole of his conduct such as to make you believe that he was mad. - A. Yes.</p>

            . You are the wife of the last witness - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband being out at work you saw more of the prisoner than he did. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From all you saw of his conduct, did you think him to be a man in his senses. - A. I always took him to be a man ramping mad. Early in the morning when my husband has gone out to work, I have been obliged to get out of my bed and fasten the door for fear of his coming into the room, not that he ever hurt me. I have seen him beat his wife without any quarrel at all; I have taken her away When he has been by himself he has been ramping and making a noise, I have thought there had been plenty of people with him when there has been no one; I thought him a deranged man; for that reason I kept my door fastened.</p>
               <p>JOHN LEWIS. Q. I believe you are a mill wright. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the prisoner come to you sometimes. - A. Yes, twice, when he had no business with us; he would set down upon the frame I was working upon, he would run on what he did when a boy, he would sit about ten minutes; we took no notice of him; then he would go away; he talked like a man out of his senses.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately was that - A. About a year ago.</p>
               <p>NORRIS SULLIVAN. I believe you are the landlord of the house the prisoner lived in. - A. Yes, he has lived there nigh twenty four years; I never thought him a in his senses from a little while after he come into the house. I never liked him to come in the shop when I was shaving; if he was at all contradicted he was like a man up set. I have been obliged to go out of the house many times when I have contradicted him; he has got a long staff and pursued me.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you observed this strange conduct increase of late years, or has it been much so the whole time. - A. More so lately than it was before.</p>
               <p>MR. TUCKER. I believe you are the prisoner's son-in-law. - A. I am, I have known him thirty years; he has conducted himself in every respect like a man out of his mind. I recollect a circumstance, I believe it to be twenty five or twenty six years ago, I lived three or four doors from Mr. Rigby at that time, I saw the prisoner coming down the lane with a stove and a fire in the grate, he threw it all in the ditch; I have lived in the house with him fourteen months, and during the time I have been with him he has been sitting by the fire in the arm chair, I have seen him snatch the kettle off the fire, take hold of the tea things and chuck the first thing he could take up at any body; and when he is in liquor he is generally full of talk. When I have thought him most in his senses, I have begged him not to come near me.</p>
               <p>Q. Your reason for that was you were afraid of his insanity. - A. Entirely. When you converse with him a little time he is quite up and out of his senses.</p>
               <p>NOT GUILTY.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor. I have been acting for the trustees of a charity instituted by Sir John Cass for a free school at Aldgate—Sir Jamet Flower and others are the trustees—the houses Nos. 1 and 2, Nursery-place, Hackney, in the parish of St. John's, Hackney, belong to the trustees—I act there for Sir James Flower and others—I remember seeing coppers in those houses about six weeks ago—I went there on the 3rd of Dec.—I found the coppers of Nos. 1 and 2 were missing—I have seen them since in the possession of the police—I fitted them both to the places, and reversed them—I have no doubt they are the coppers that came from there—one would not fit both apertures—they were set in brickwork—they are of the ordinary size, about eighteen inches, but were not quite circular—when they got into the aper<lb></lb>ture they fitted exactly—there could be no possible doubt about them—there is a bump on one side of one of them—the prisoner lived very near the houses, and has resided there for eight years, as I learn—he is a marine-store dealer.</p>

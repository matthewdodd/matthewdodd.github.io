                  </hi>. My husband keeps a chandler's shop in Weymouth-street, New Kent-road.

On Tuesday, 4th Nov., the prisoner came, about 8 o'clock in the morning—she asked for an ounce of tea, and half a pound of sugar—she tendered in payment a counterfeit half-crown—I proceeded across to the other counter to detect it—she exclaimed, "If it is a bad one, don't detect it; give it me back"—I asked her where she lived—she said, "In George-street, round the corner"—George-street is directly opposite my shop—she said her husband had given it to her—I offered to go with her to her husband, and I left the shop with that intention—she said she would lead me a dance, or something to that effect—I met a policeman, and gave her into custody, with the half-crown.</p>

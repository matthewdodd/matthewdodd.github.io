                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Thomas Emmott, a jeweller, in Holborn. About the 16th of September, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner Davis and another, who is not into custody, came into the shop and wished me to show them some gold pins—I laid a small tray before them—they looked at them and passed remarks upon them, and asked the price of several—at that time Cleaver came in and inquired the price of some cards, on the other side of the shop—I showed him some—we did not agree about the price, and he went away—Davis and the other boy were still looking at the pins—directly Cleaver left the shop, Manning came in, looked about, and asked questions, and talked with the other boys—I suspected I was robbed, and as Cleaver had left the shop I sent a per<lb></lb>son after him, who brought him back—I then accused all four of them of robbing me, and sent for an officer—I thought I heard something link on the edge of the counter—I looked and saw a pin there, which I think fell from Manning, as it was nearest to him—I am positive it is one which had been in the tray, and I do not think it had dropped down before—I have no doubt that Manning dropped it—I could not tell how many pins were missing from the tray, as I did not know the number that were in it—this other pin was produced by the officer.</p>

About twelve o'clock on the 16th of September, I was called—I went to the shop with another officer—the three prisoners and another lad were in the shop—we took them into a back-room adjoining, and searched Manning and Cleaver, and at the bot<lb></lb>tom of Manning's pocket I found a garnet pin, which was claimed by the shopman—this other pin was handed to me by the shopman, which be said had been put upon the ledge.</p>

               <p>John Newell, Samuel Pearce, Josiah Parkes, philip sellick, and Robert Trevett had omnibuses on that road—my omnibuses started between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, from Paddington—on the first day, I was watching to see my omnibuses come down Holborn, and there were two or three omnibuses with each, hunting them, and driving them on as fast as they could; Trevett's and Bolton's omnibuses in particular, and Mr. Bird's also—I believe there was no other that day—I watched them several other days, and saw them drive close up to he pavement, and drive their poles close up to my omnibns, so that no passenger could get in—on those other days I saw the omnibuses belonging to the other defendants I have named doing so—I do not know that there was one who has not done so—the whole of them have been a continual annoyance—on the 15th, I lengthened one of my omnibuses to Maida—hill, still continuing on the same line of road, through Paddington—on that day, a new omnibus, called "The Emperor," No. 352, with the name of "Edmund Sylvester" on it, started against the one of mine, which ran to Maida—hill; and another, called "The Albion," No. 177, with the name of "Thomas Corbett" on it, started in opposition to the one of mine, which went to Paddington—John Sylvester drove the "Emperor, "and John Smith was the conductor; but whether they did so the first day it started, I cannot tell—Gough drove the "Albion," and one of the Trevett's, (Thomas, I think,) was the conductor—I had observed Cow<lb></lb>deroy driving his omnibus the first week, which he every now and then does drive—he was one who ran his pole up against me, and put me on one side, and was annoying me—I saw the other defendants in the first week; and omnibuses would come down from Paddington to where I set out, wait till I came out of my yard, follow my omnibuses up to Paddington, wait till they turned round to go, and then immediately gallop close before them—one day, one of my horses came home with the wheel run over his foot—sometimes there was a pannel broken—I saw Sylvester's omnibus run against my pannel one day in Oxford-street—I have seen them come fol<lb></lb>lowing my <hi rend="italic">buses</hi> home, without plying for hire; and they would stop for an hour, to see whether we attempted to go out again—this was done frequently, every day almost—about three weeks after we started, there came a very rainy day—one of my <hi rend="italic">buses</hi> let water—we took the passengers out, and put them in another <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—I got into the bus that let water, and made them drive it down to the maker's in Whitechapel; and the "Emperor" followed me all the way, and stopped there four hours—John Sylvester drove the "Emperor" there, and John Smith was the conductor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever meet any of the defendants any where? <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Yes; the first I saw of them was Josiah Parkes—I forget when it was but it was near the beginning of my starting—I found him in my yard in Holborn, when I got there, we went into the public-house, and had a glass of brandy-and-water—he told me I was a madman to start if I did not buy times—that the "Pad<lb></lb>dington committee" would run me off the road, and ruin me—I said no, I should try—I alterwards saw Trevett, Hill, and Cowderoy, all three together, I think it was on the 4th of July—I had just come home from the bazaar, and got out of the <hi rend="italic">bus,</hi> when Robert Trevett came, laid hold of my coat, and said I should go and have something to drink—I said I had not had my dinner, and I seldom took any thing before dinner—he said, would I come back—I said I would—I went back, and Trevett, Hill, and Cowderoy were there, drinking—they asked me whether I meant to do what was rights—I said I meant to stop if I could, and keep on my omnibus they said it</p>

               <p>was no use, for their committee was so strong it was no use for one to op<lb></lb>pose them—It would cost them about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week each man, and it would cost me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to oppose them, and if I could afford to stand the loss of that I had better stop—I said, "Never mind that, I shall stop as long as I can"—Cowderoy said, "Why don't you buy times, and belong to us?"—I said I never would belong to any committee of that kind while I lived—I would stop, if I could, and Cowderoy said, "Ah, do, old one, start half a dozen, that will soon end it"—they got drinking very hard, and got warm with liquor, but nothing more passed about the omnibuses, except that I should be sure to be ruined; and Hill said, "He is an old one, and has been amongst us many years; we must let him in some how or another"—Cowde<lb></lb>roy said, "Why don't you sell him your times?" and Hill said, "I will take five hundred guineas for them"—my son was there at that time—I left them to go home—Hill ran over the road, caught hold of me, and said they had been standing treat to me, and I must to them—I said I wanted no more, but I would give him a glass of brandy-and-water—we went, and Joseph Bardell came to the door—we went out, and spoke to him in the street—he said, "It is of no use your going against this committee; they will ruin you as sure as you are born; go and buy somebody's time"—he said they were such b----y <hi rend="italic">out-and-outers,</hi> they would beat anybody, and even if Mr. Horne, or the greatest stage—master in London were to start against the Paddington committee, they would be sure to be beaten—he said, "Hill, why don't you sell him your times?"—Hill said, "I did offer them to him a little while age at five hundred guineas, but I won't take six hundred for them now"—my son was not present at that time—I had no further conversation with Bardell and Hill that night, but I have seen Bardell frequently—he told me they would be sure to best me—they would have nobody there but what belonged to the committee, and bought times—he said he belonged to the committee, but did not often go—Robert Trevett has called upon me three or four times—he has told me it was no use my running, they would suffer no one on the road except they pur<lb></lb>chased times—he said I had better purchase times, or I should be ruined—they had ruined several, and they would ruin me—Bolton has called upon me three or four times, and had the same conversation, but he ad<lb></lb>vised me at one time to go to Kentish—town—I made a reply that I did not like Kentish—town, as the turnpikes were heavy—he said the turn-pikes should not cost me much, as he was proprietor of the gates—he said it was no use my attempting to go against so many of them, that they paid but a trific a week in, and there was such a body of them it was foolish of any one individual going against so many of them—I do not recollect having any conversation with any of the other defendants—I run on and was losing a great deal of money, till I called a sale at Mr. Allen's, in St. Martin's, on Wednesday, the 29th of July—my omnibuses stopped for that sale on Sunday night the 26th—the other omnibuses continued with me—they came dowm on Saturday morning, the 25th, and followed me all day long—they seldom came on a Sunday—I did not see them on the Monday—my sale took place on Wednesday—I sold five horses—my omnibuses were only on bire—on the Thursday my Paddington one went out again—the de<lb></lb>fendants' omnibuses were out that day, but I did not see them—on the Friday I saw the "Emperor" and the "Albion" follow my one <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—they <hi rend="italic">tuco'd</hi> him, as they call it, all day, one before and the other behind—selveaterdrove the "Emperor," and I believe Gough drove the "Albion"—I started my other omnibus on the 2nd of August—the other omnibus still</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183509210200"></xptr>
               <p>continued to pursue me in the same way as before, or rather worse, as they supposed I was beaten, and they set too with more vengeance against me—one of my omnibuses is on still—the other ceased running on the 30th of August—the whole of this book is not in my handwriting, but I see it every day of my life, either night or morning—It contains the earnings of each bus—I have seen John Sylvester up at Paddington two or three times—he has said, "It is a pity you should go on so; why don't you come and buy time? they will never let you have any time without you come and buy time"—Smith joined in the same conversation—neither of them told me who employed them, but I have seen the same horses working in the "Emperor," and then in Mr. Bolton's omnibuses—and the horses worked in the Albion" in Mr. Trevett's—I have been a horse-dealer thirty-six or thirty-seven years, and have been unfortunate twice.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi>

PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long is it since your first bankruptcy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About seven years—I was then a horse-dealer, and in the same yard which I now keep—I purchased the premises about three months afterwards—they took bills for them at different dates—my first divident was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; there was another about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and there will be ano<lb></lb>ther—I will swear that more than 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. has been paid—my second bank<lb></lb>ruptey was at the latter end of 1834—there has been no dividend declared on that as yet—It is in the hands of Mr. Green—I cannot tell what my cre<lb></lb>ditors will get—Hill asked me to give 500 guineas to buy time—I dare say he knew I was a bankrupt—when a man is unfortunate it is generally known—I hava had conversation with a person of the name of Bardell, the brother of the two Bardells who are indicated—he is a vetrinary surgeon, and a very respectable man—he asked me how I came to indict them—I said it was my attorney's advice, and I could not go from it—my attorney is Mr. Norton—he advised me to indict the Bardells—I went with Mr. Bardell to Mr. Norton's, and there was a conversation about their putting in bail. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now Mr. Bardell is alive, and is here; do you remember his asking Mr. Norton why he advised you to put his two brothers into the indict<lb></lb>ment, when they were innocent? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect it—Mr. Norton might have dropped such an expression as, That he was determined they should not be witness for the other defendants—It was not in my presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that such a villanous expression might be used, and you forget it; such an infamous expression? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Norton's answer was, "we have no occasion to press the indictment against your brothers"—Mr. Bardell went on to say something about the bail, and Mr. Norton said, "The indictment has no occassion to be pressed against your brothers; they have not much to fear; but you must put in bail"—he said that after advising me to include them in the indictment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was any thing said about a hundred pounds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never to me, or to Mr. Bardell in my presence, upon my oath; nor did Mr. Norton say that he put the Bardells into the indictment that they should not be wit<lb></lb>nesses, nor anything to that effect—Mr. Norton did not tell me why he put the Bardells in the indictment—I went to him to indict the Paddington committee, and he indicted whom he pleased—I appointed with Mr. Bar<lb></lb>dell to meet him at Mr. Norton's—I went there to meet him—he got there first.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Norton say that their names must remain in the indict<lb></lb>ment; his object was to prevent their being witnesses; because, if they were ommitted, the paddington proprietors would subpœna them against Bray? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never, sir; nor that their evidence would be of importance, I having commissioned Joseph Bardell to raise 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to take my omni<lb></lb>buses iff the road, and discontinue further opposition; and if he could not get 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to take 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and they to take my stock at a valuation—there was not a word said about it—we were there half an hour, talking about the indictment a little, but the most was about putting in bail.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Nonton say in Mr. Bardell's presence, that if the proprietors did not consent to your proposition, he would ruin Bolton, Pearee, Bird, and Trevett, or he would have his heart out and his limbs broken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No: Bardell was not desired to ask his brothers if the proprietors would come to terms—I saw Mann this morning—I do not know whether he is a wit<lb></lb>ness for me—he is one of the persons who complained that he was hunted—I never gave Mann directions to drive against Bolton—not any person—I do not know this man (<hi rend="italic">looking at a man named Archer</hi>)—I never saw him before, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever say to your conductor, in Archer's presence, "Go on wwith that omnibus (<hi rend="italic">pointing to one</hi>), and stick to him; I will have the shirt off his back before I have done with him?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never in my life—I know Parish, the policeman, No. 45—I never had any conversation with him about this—I do not know that ever he was obliged to lead my omni<lb></lb>bus out of the way—I know No. 7 has—I never spoke to him in the Poultry about my opposition, to my knowledge—I know a person named Alexander—I have no recollection of mentioning the name of Alexander to Parish.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say, "I should have been very well off, if Alexander had not put me in the hold?" A. I said I should have been better off if Alexander had come out with me, as he promised—I possibly might say we should have made the Paddington masters look about them—I have been summoned two or three times by the police for causing an obstruction—I have heard of the names of Colson and Wilson as time-keepers—I have seen Colson, and spoken to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever said this in his presence, That unless you could receive 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the proprietors, you would indict them all fro a conspi<lb></lb>racy, and ruin them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never in my life to any soul—I remember two of Trevett's mem being taken into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember using this expression, in the presence of Colson, that you had been as good as your word; it was not the men you wished to hurt, as you could get nothing out of them, but their masters, and that the law must take its course, unless you were paid 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to take your omnibus off?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never, to any man upon earth—I have spoken to Bates, the policeman, No. 7—he has summoned my driver two or three times fro obstructing the road and he summoned me twice, once was for taking time at the Bank—he said I should not take time—my man got off by paying 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was summoned to Marlborough-street—one of Mr. Bol<lb></lb>ton's omnibuses ran against mine—my son got into a gallop, and they were both <hi rend="italic">had up</hi>—It is the men that are summoned, but the master always at<lb></lb>tends, and if they are fined he pays it—I know Bates has often told me of my men doing wrong—I said, "Then summons them, I have nothing to do with it; I have spoken to my men about it, and they said they did no such thing"—I cannot tell whether Mann is here—I have not subpœnaed him—I was not afraid that he would tell the jury that I ordered him to drive against Bolton—I never said so—nor about getting 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know the policeman, No. 13—I do not know his name—I recollect his having two persons in custody one night at the Mansion-house.</p>

               <p>would have all the omnibuses removed from the Bank; and you would be d----d if you did not line the street with <hi rend="italic">buses</hi>, if it cost you five hundred pounds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—I mean distinctly to swear I never used to that man any such expression, but I remember his having the men very unlawfully taken up—their words were taken to come on Monday.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> About how many witnesses have been subpœnaed by Mr. Norton in this case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A great many—I have heard fifty or sixty—there were only four witnesses went before the Grand Jury and only two of them were heard—the amount of debts at my first bankruptey was about 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the second time not 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not paid fifteen shillings in the pound on either commission.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you aware that, not having paid 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., you are not in point of law, entitled to any property? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, Sir—I succeeded to my stable in about three months after my first commission—I never left it the second time—It was mortgaged to my bankers, and they let me remain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Thomas Bird a creditor under your second commission? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I know of—I do not know the man—I have no recollection of his name for a penny—I never got into his debt—I had some bills of exchange out, but very few—I have no recollection of Bird's name in either of my bankrupteies, or in any kind of dealing—I did not enter a bill of Bird's for a backney-coach—I have no recollection of it—I hired my omni<lb></lb>buses of Mr. Boswell, in Aldgate High-street—I set them up on the 8th of June—I paid part of the hire of them 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., having had them twelve weeks—I had my <hi rend="italic">buses</hi> ordered before Alexander had any idea of coming out—he then told me he was coming out—I did not agree with him to bring out omnibuses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you mean by saying just now, if he had come out as he agreed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, Sir, "as he said he would," I did expect him to come out with me, and I thought he was coming out on that day, but I heard after<lb></lb>wards the Paddington committee had given him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to stop him—I consulted with Mr. Norton a very little time after I started, I believe about three weeks—he had been my attorney before—I have heard that forty or fifty omnibuses ran from the Bank to Paddington before I set up; but I do not know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not state in your own yard, to Mr. John Bardell, that you did not wish to indict the Bardells at all, but your lawyer said they must be in the indictment as he had a reason for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said I had no animosity against them—I did not say I did not wish to indict them at all—I told them Mr. Norton said they must be in the indictment, he had a cause for putting them in—I did not say I did not know the rea<lb></lb>son, but if he would meet me at Mr. Norton's I would go and see if I could not get them out—I did not go to Mr. Norton's for any such pur<lb></lb>pose—I went to Mr. Norton's on a Sunday, with Mr. John Bardell—I do not recollect his asking Mr. Norton why he had put his brothers in the in<lb></lb>dictment—I will swear it was not said in my presence—I do not recollect Mr. Norton being questioned as to whether they could not get out of it—there was very little said—we were not there ten minutes—I will swear I did not hear Mr. Norton say their names must remain in the indict<lb></lb>ment his object being to preven their being witnesses for the defence—I will swear I never heard it; nor that their evidence against them would be of importance.</p>
               <p>

               <p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's son. On the 8th of June, my father commenced running two omnibuses, Nos. 348 and 349—I have been coachman to both of them—I began about three weeks after they started, but I was repeatedly with them before—I rode on horseback with them—the drivers of the other omnibuses tried to oppose us and to injure us, by pulling up against us—they would cross us and go before our <hi rend="italic">buses,</hi> and their conductors would jump down, if passengers bailed us, to get them away from our <hi rend="italic">buses</hi>—the names of the present defendants were on those omnibuses—Bolton had five on the stones, Bardells, 1 think, had four, Richard Bird had two, Thomas Bird had two, Carpenter had two, Cowderoy had sometimes five sometimes six, Hill had two, I believe—John<lb></lb>son,</p>

               <p>I think, had three, Newell had three, Pearce had three, Parkes had three or four, Sellick had three, and Trevett two—they were all run<lb></lb>ning on the road before the 15th of June, and it was them which so annoyed us—on the 15th of June, the "Albion" and the "Emperor," op<lb></lb>position omnibuses, were put on—I cannot exactly remember who was the coachman of the "Albion," but John Gulliver drove it, and when he did not, some odd man did; George Dodd was the conductor; John Gough has driven it, and Trevent been the conductor—I do not know his christian name—I believe it is Robert—the name on the "Albion" was Thomas Corbett, No. 177, and on the "Emperor" was the name of Edmund Syl<lb></lb>vester—It was No. 352—the driver of that was John Sylvester, and the conductor John Smith—these two followed us every where we went, and the other omnibuses still pursued the same line of conduct as they had before—when we stopped, the opposition omnibuses stopped also—I saw that done on the 15th—about three weeks after that I began driving—I think No. 348 was the first I drove—I cannot tell which of the opposition omnibuses accompained that—I think it was the "Emperor"—but one of them did, and sometimes both of them—we started from the Wheatsheaf, at Paiddington, and went to the Bank, and the opposition omnibuses accom<lb></lb>pained us, if we stopped they stopped also—If we turned round, they would turn and follow us up the by-streets and any where else—If I met any of the other omnibuses they would stop with me also, so that I had always two with me.</p>

               <p>they should be sure to ruin us—he said they were ordered to follow us wherever we went, and to stop out till ten o'clock at night—(they very often wished me to go to Edgeware, and dared me to go forty or fifty miles into the country, and they would follow)—he has also said it was not use to run in opposition against the Paddington committee, they were so strong—I have not heard Smith say as much as that—he has said, when he has met Mr. Bolton, "That is our governor," or, "Do you see our governor?"—our conductor was Joseph Raines—we stopped on the 26th of July—they had continued to follow us till that day—I think that day they stopped at Paddington—my father came out again on the 29th, and I went out on the 30th with No. 348—the "Emperor" accomopained me then—my omnibus broke down; and when I drove the other <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> the four o'clock journey, they both accompained me—If a passenger tried to get in, they would jump down, and try to persuade him to get into their <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the conductor or driver of Bray's omnibus say any thing while they were following your father's to the stable? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; as they passed they said, "We will break the b----y cobler; we will melt his b----y wax"—that was either the driver or the conductor—I believe it wa <hi rend="italic">Cuddy</hi> Mann—my father is a bot and shoemaker, and lives in Finasbury—I re<lb></lb>member my father's omnibus starting again that eventing—while we had been waiting, Bray's <hi rend="italic">buses</hi> were at the Fountain Abbey, the public-house at the corner—our <hi rend="italic">buses</hi> always go roung that corner, and as soon as our buses turned that corner, I saw Bray's men get up in haste and follow them our—two <hi rend="italic">buses</hi> went from the yard together, and both Bray's followed them—they started from the Wheatsheaf, at Paddington, which is about half a mile from the Fountain Abbey.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever observed your omnibuses and Bray's on the line of road? <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Yes; I think on Whit-Tuesday, the 9th of June, I saw Bray's <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> and my father's in Regent-circus, Oxfort-street—that is the place they generally call at—the Magistrates will not let them stand there, so they trail gently bu; but they were thenstanding at the corner of Ox<lb></lb>ford-street—I saw a gentleman passenger in the act of getting into my father's <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>, and Lee, who was then conductor to Bray's <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>, went to my</p>

               <p>father's <hi rend="italic">bus,</hi> and pulled the passenger away, and put him into Bray's <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—he put his hands round the gentleman, and pulled him right away—I was not near enough to hear any thing said—Lee and the conductor of my father's <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> got fighting through it—the fight did not last above a mi<lb></lb>nute—some one parted them—the omnibises then went off together—I believe ours was a little first—they were very nearly abreast—the "Al<lb></lb>bion, "No. 177, was my father's <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—he has no partner in any way—I have seen Bray's and my father's racing together since the time I spoke of, but not to notice any particular circumstance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know there is a Paddington committee? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not—there is what is erronecously called a committee, a meeting of the proprie<lb></lb>tors of that road—they meet on Thursday nights at the White Lion—I have been at the meeting—It is held in the first floor front room—any one may walk in—there has been no secrecy when I was present—there is very seldom any thing done there at all—sometimes some of the pre<lb></lb>prietors would come and tell another that his men had been kincking up a disturbance on the road—It was always settled between the person who made the complaint, and the person whose servants were complained of—I have known of drivers being discharged by the proprietors on account of—their misconduct—I cannot say who it was—the subscription that was paid was half-a-crown a week for each member—It was to pay the time-keepers—there is no other subscription among the proprietors that I know of—the half-crown was not paid there in general—one of the conductors pays for his three omnibuses down Oxford-street—there are several time-keepers—one is deputed to receive the subscriptions, and pay the others—I never knew of any subscrition between my father and the other pro<lb></lb>prietors, to support any opposition while Mr. Bray was running his omni<lb></lb>buses—I have the sole management of my father's omnibus business, and had it at that time—If there had been any subscription made to oppose Bray, it must have come under my knowledge.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not Bolton's always follow Newman's wherever it went? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have seen it before it, and behind, and on the same line of road—It was one of Bolton's <hi rend="italic">buses</hi>—I do not remember the name of it, or who was the driver on conductor—Mrs. Turnbull was a proprictor up to the last nine months—I never remember seeing her name on a <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>. nor her attending the commit<lb></lb>tee—I did nto attend them rugularly till the last Christmas—I have bees there before—I do not remember seeing her there—I do not remember her having an omnibus run against her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the expense of running an omnibus from Paddington if you get no customers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-week; it depends on the number of journeys it runs, and whether a man is fortunate in his cattle; that is for one <hi rend="italic">bus,</hi> five journeys a-day—I do not know how many proprietors there are—I never reckoned them up—I know Thomas Evans and George Bingham.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As far as I understand, your being at Regent-street was a mere ac<lb></lb>cident? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was there for the purpose of watching—I think it was after dinner—I thought I woulde take a walk down the the road, to see in what manner Bray worked his <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> against my father.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tell me somebody that was there beside your father—was Gough there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think he was—I did not see Sullivan there—I do not know Smith—I did not see either of the Bardells, nor Carpenter, nor either of the Birds—I do not know that Johnson was there, nor Hill, nor Pearce—he might be there—Thomas Evans was there, to the best of my knowledge—the room was full of a number of people.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you say that Bray ran with one of your omnibuses, when<lb></lb>ever it went, was not that the one that had Corbett's name on it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; Corbett's name was put on about a week after Whit—Monday—Bray's con<lb></lb>tinued to run against one of my father's which had not Corbett's name on—I have seen it at different times of the day—one day at one time—some times at another—sometimes he stopped at the same time we did, and some<lb></lb>time he went on, just as it suited his own fancy—he did that from the very beginning—those which I term the regular <hi rend="italic">buses</hi> kept on at the regular time—the others stopped with him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever send your horses down to H olborn, to change the horses in that one that ran against Bray's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, occasionally; only to that one, that was the "Albion, "No. 117, I believe, but we have two or three "Albions"—I do not know that that "Albion" ever stopped for Bray's omnibus, when it was in Bray's yard—I have not the slightest no<lb></lb>tion that our omnibus ever stopped in Holbom or Southampton-street, while Bray's was in the yary—It was sent to Holborn, because Bray's men said they would not give them time to change, they would make that pair of horses work all day long, when Bray's <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> was working against our regu<lb></lb>lar one—If they saw the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> he but on to protect our regular once, they would turn down some of the back streets, and if we stopped he would pop out of some of the streets.</p>

               <p>and wait to see whether I went on—we pulled up for a passenger if I was first, they got into mine, and if Mr. Bray's was first, they got into his—there was no opposition offered by Bray's men, not pulling people away—I stopped at Regent-street, which is the usual place for stopping, and Bray stopped there—our other omuibus, the "Triumph," followed me three minutes behind—I did not see it, but that is the time—I stopped opposite Day and Martin's—there is a batter's shop only ten or twelve doors from Bray's stables—we have stopped there ever since the road has been estab<lb></lb>lished—Bray's still kept with us all the way to the Rank—It came in behind me—every omnibus is allowed three minutes there—he took a turn round Cornhill, and as I came from the corner of the Bank, he came from the corner of Cornhill at the same moment, and kept on with me in the same way, all the way up to Paddington—where I stopped, he stopped—John Lee was the driver—he had been in the service of Mr. Trevett—the conductor was <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> Raines, I believe—I had not known him in any other character, but I heard he had been a fighting man—he had been a con<lb></lb>ductor before, I believe, but not employed by Mr. Trevett—I took my second journey at three minutes past twelve o'clock that day—Bray's, that went with me the first journey, went the second—he proceeded in the same way as he did on the first—we have regular customers that go by the omnibuses—we carry them one day, and perhaps not again for a week—we have not a regular body to ride down in the morning, and ride back again—I was followed all that journey just in the same way, by the same John Lee.</p>

I remember when Bray's omnibuses first made their apperance—they appeared to me to be running direct against Trevett's—I saw Mr. Braw and his men frequently—I have heard the man say to Trevett's men that they would <hi rend="italic">melt the old cobber's wax</hi>—they would say to them, "We will be with you, you b—s," and use very bad language; and somtimes they made use of the word snob—I do not know that they talked of any body else beside Trevett—this violent opposition went on, I should think, about a week—Bray's omnibuses did not take their time, and take their turn as the others, when they first started—they afterwards had time given them—they did not keep their time as other omnibuses did—they used to come in, and go round Cornbill, and ply for hire, if they could get passengers; if they did not, they wanted to come in and take time—that occasioned a disturb<lb></lb>ance, because they would want to <hi rend="italic">cut in</hi> betwixt the three omnibuses which were allowed to stand at the Bank—I have found it necessary to interface, by their coming in irregularly, wanting to <hi rend="italic">cut in,</hi> and throw the others out, which almost endangered the people's lives, by thowing omnibuses and horses on the pavement—they have come in at times and taken their times regularly; at other times they have not—they have gone out in all kind of ways; at other times taking times—they have gone to the corner of Cornbill, and stood there—I have crossed over to tell them to go on—one Friday evening, about two months ago, Mr. Bray's omnibus had been playing round Cornbill; hethen came and wanted to go in between the first and second omnibuses which were standing there—I spoke to Mr. Bray, and said, "Why don't you wait till the first is gone, and then come in third?"—he theb said, "I will be d—d if I don't get them all turned away from the Bank, if it costs me five hundred pounds, and I will line the street with omnibuses.

               <p>one time, walking up the Poultry with old Mr. Bray, five or six weeks after his omnibuses came—he had spoken about an officer who had been so kind as to assist him in getting up a horse, and had said to him, "Mr. Bray, you are very nervous; get on one side;" and he said he should give him a sovereign, if he might—I said he might—he said he would ask leave, and I belive he did—the sovereign was given, and divided between myself and others—I said to him, "You must be very uncomfortable in driving in opposition in this way: you can't expect these men to give their bread away without trouble"—I told him I thought he would be much more confortable if he had purchased one of their times, as they had purechesed them before—he said, "We should have shown them better"(or something of that)"if Alexander had not deserted me"—(we had before had notice that there were six omni<lb></lb>buses coming down)—he said he should have been very well if Alexander had not put him in the hole, as Alexander had promised to start with him, and then they should have made the Paddington masters look about them.</p>

The Bank is situated there—I can hardly say that it is left to me to settle the times of the omnibuses there, but I generally do—the officers of the ward seem to be under my direction—I wrote a circular letter to the omnibus pro<lb></lb>pritores in 1833, in consequence of the great confusion at the Bank, and the Governor of the Bank having written to me that he should put the Bank Act in force; I saw him, and told him I would enter upon it, and make some arrangement, which I did—I was instructed by the police committee to make some arrangements, that times might be set by the proprietors, and kept by the time-keepers—I invited the proprietors to meet me, to make some arrangements which I prescribed; one was, that no longer should any <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> be allowed there, as we found a great many robberies took place, and there were thieves taking advantage and robbing the public—the officers were ordered to remove any persons of that description—a few of the par<lb></lb>ties met me, but by no means half their number—Mr. Shillibeer was then in opposition with them, not subscribing properly to their funds—I could not get them to terms but by threatening to put the Bank Act in force—they said, if I could get the twenty-nine proprietors to agree to having fifty-nine omnibuses, they would be satisfied, if I pointed out an offi<lb></lb>cer in whom the ward would have confidence—one was appointed, who was to pay no respect to any one, but to summon every person who did not keep his three minutes—that went on for some time, till Mr. Bray began to make a disturbance, and threatened that he would continue it—he said it to me, I belive—I summoned him before the police-com<lb></lb>mittee—he said that he should not belong to their committee—he would run his omnibus and take time, and I had him summoned before the police-committee—he had not had time then, our officers being strictly</p>

               <p>bound by the list they had, they could not give him a time, without putting some one out; and in trying to take time, he had caused the obstruction—I could not give him time then; he must have had the concurrence of the committee, as after the arrangement had been made, it was final—after this, Mr. Bray applied to me, and I told him I had ceased then to interfere, the Police-committee of Aldermen not being uniform in their decrees—a worthy Alderman assumed, that this was a monopoly, and therefore he would not sanction any list—I said, "As I formed this list by the wish of a former committee if this court, and you won't sanction it, I will have nothing more to do with it"—before this there had been tolerable order at the Bank—I had no complaints, and if they had not been tolerably well conducted I should have heard—there was good order kept generally, as long as that list was observed—I did not hear of any time being allotted to Mr. Bray, as I ceased after the first list—If he has been admitted, it is in the new list—I know Budd, the time-keeper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hosier, and live at No. 371, Oxford-street. I have had opportunities of observing the omnibuses that drive up and down from paddington to the Bank for the last five years—those with "Aaron Bray" on them have been conducted in the most did orderly way imaginable—previous to the omnibuses of Aaron Bray coming on the road, they were conducted as orderly as it was possible for vehicles of that description to be; so much so, that I allowed them, two years ago, to change horses at my house—since Aaron Bray began running up the street, to my coat, I have found that the disorder has been so great that ladies could not come in their carriages to my shop—they were afraid—I have seen the other omnibuses stop to take up passengers on several occasions—I have seen Bray's omnibuses pull up with the pole against the door of the other omni<lb></lb>buses, to prevent a passenger from getting in, in more instances than one—from what I have seen, Bray was decidedly the aggressor, because I con<lb></lb>sidered he was in opposition to the others—before Bray came, the road was orderly—they were going quitely about their business.</p>

I am a wine and spirit merchant, and live at No. 412, Oxford-street, I have observed the omnibuses drive up and down from Paddington to the Bank—I have had frequent opportunities of observing the conduct of the drivers—the conducting of the omnibuses before Bray's came on, was upon a very excellent principle, and since that, they have been a great annoyance to the passengers—I have had occasion to ride down to the City, having a nervous debility, and have been annoyed by Mr. Aaron Bray's omnibus coming close to the one I wished to get into—I think that Bray's omnibuses were the aggressors.</p>

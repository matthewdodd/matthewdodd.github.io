               <p>JOHN NISBITT (Police-constable E 6). I stopped the prisoner near Russell-square on the 24th of July, at halfpast six o'clock in the morning; she had these articles on her - I asked what she had got: she said various articles which she had brought from Charlton-street, Somers'-town where she lived - that she was going to Mr. Ardin's, in Staples Inn, and she was laundress there; I then looked at the things, and asked her if he had said she was to carry a set of boot-trees there - she said she had heard of them, but she did not know whether she was to carry them that morning or not; I said, "I will go there with you:" we went a few steps, and then she said, "I am going to my daughter" - I then took her; this was about five hundred yards from the prosecutor's.</p>

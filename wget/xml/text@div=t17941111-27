               <p>I am a corn factor, I know the prisoner perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any dealings with him? - Yes, to a considerable amount; always had a very high opinion of him; he has frequently bought corn of me, to the amount of a hundred pounds at a time; he used to pay for the corn, sometimes in drafts on a banker, and sometimes in cash; and if he wanted credit for five times the sum, I should not hesitate the least in the world; I was surprised when I heard the young man was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. You have known him down to the prectent time? - I had not seen him for one year.</p>

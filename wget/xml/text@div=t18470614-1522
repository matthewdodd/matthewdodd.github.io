                  </hi>. I am a beer-seller, and live in Hog-lane, Greenwich, On Monday, the 7th of June, the prisoner came to my house between five and six o'clock—he and I afterwards had some conversation together—I am clear that I had at that time 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. silver coin in my pocket—I did not give away or put away from my pocket that money—no one but the prisoner sufficiently near me to have taken it from me—the prisoner went away about seven o'clock—in about a quarter of an hour after, I found my money was gone—I went after the prisoner—I found him; and charged him with having my money—he said to the police-officer, "I have some money, but what money I have, that man gave me for adulterating his beer"—the money was produced, and it was mine.</p>

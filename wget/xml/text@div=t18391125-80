                  </hi>. I work for my father, George Calvert, who lives on Islington-green. On the 1st of November, I went with a range to Bruns<lb></lb>wick-place, Ball's Pond-road, in an iron truck—when I took the range into the house, I left the truck drawn up to the curb-stone—this was about a quarter before nine o'clock—I was away about twenty minutes, and when I came back it was gone—I went to the station-house, and while I was there I heard a truck going past, I went out, and saw Henry Dyer with the truck—it was then about twenty minutes after ten o'clock.</p>

I was in St. Paul's-terrace, and saw the two prisoners putting the truck over the posts at the end of the terrace—they saw me come up, and William Dyer said, "Policeman, will you give me a fill over the posts?"—he said he would give me a glass of gin—I gave them a lift, and asked who the truck belonged to—William Dyer said it belonged to him, that he came from Rotherfield-street, he was going to the floor-cloth makers, to get some floor-cloth, that the other person was a young man he had hired to help him with it to his house.</p>

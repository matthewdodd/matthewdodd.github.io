                  </hi>. I have premises at Nos. 19. and 20, King-street, St. George's-in-the-East. On the Saturday night, the 24th of April I was the last person there—I left the premises all secure and fastened—the premises about on Grove-court—there is a sky-light to the foundry, and there is some timber there—between twelve and one o'clock in the morning of Mon<lb></lb>day, the 26th of April, I received information, and went to the foundry—I found the inner door of the foundry open and the things disturbed—there ware foot-marks there—some person had removed the skylight and descended on some loam that was there—I missed about 20lbs. weight of old brass, and some copper—I afterwards saw some found in the court—it was mine—I had seen it safe on the Saturday night—the premises belong to me and another person.</p>

On that Sunday night, about twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner coming off the prosecutor's foundry, at the top of Grove-court—I looked to see where he got down—he got down in Grove-court, and from there into Grove-street—I went down to the street-door to tell the policeman—the prisoner passed while I was at the door, and his shoes were in his hand—I told the policeman—he brought him to me at six o'clock in the morning—I said he was the person.</p>

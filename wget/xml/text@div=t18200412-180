            . I live with Lady Lushington, in York-place. I was out of a situation when I lost the property - I lodged in <placeName id="t18200412-180-crimeloc1046">North-street, York-place</placeName>

On the 14th of March, the prisoner came to lodge with me, and we slept in the same bed. I missed the things on the 16th, they were in my portmanteau. I went to bed about ten o'clock, he was there, and it was safe; I saw the prisoner when I awoke at half-past six o'clock dressed - the morning before he got up at seven. He went out and never returned to the house. I got up at half-past seven o'clock, and missed my shirt and money. We took him between one and two o'clock the same day, and he declared he had not done it. I found the three farthings on him, one was new, and notched round the edge, and the other was an old one worn whitish.</p>

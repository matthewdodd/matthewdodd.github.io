                  </hi>. I live at 217, Evelyn Street, Deptford—on the 12th August I had three sovereigns in my drawer, and I had nine reserved in my cash-box—my drawer was not locked; I did not go to it that day—in the evening I went out for an hour—that day I missed two of the three sovereigns that were in the drawer—I had not been out before I missed them—the only other occupants were Mr. Evans and His son—on missing the sovereigns I said to the prisoner I had missed two sovereigns, one English and one Australian, and that was all that passed On that occasion—on Saturday, the 4th September, I went to the cash-box, when I found the lock was unlocked, and three sovereigns Were taken and Six left; I had previously seen them in the purse inside the box—I said to the prisoner "I have lost three sovereigns; that is five within three weeks; this loss I cannot stand"—she said she did not know, if was a bad job—I Said that no one had been in my room; that I always locked my door when I went out, and nobody was in the house but her and Mr. Evans—I was not aware then that the key of the next room opened my door—I did not send for the police till Mr. Evans returned, and then I gave the prisoner into custody—she said in the room before the policeman "I have taken the two, but not the three"—at the station she admitted it again.</p>

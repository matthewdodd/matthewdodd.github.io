On March 6th, I went to 7, Maze Square, Whitecross Street, and saw the prisoner and Catherine Murray, on second floor—told him I should take him for feloniously marrying, his first wife being alive—he said I had made a mistake—he was not the man—I said I had seen his first wife who he was married to sixteen years ago—he said I should have to prove that—I went on 4th March, to St. Philip's Church, Bethnal Green, and received this certificate from the minister—I compared it with the registrar from which he copied it—on the same day I went to St. James', Shoreditch, and received this other certificate from the sexton there—I compared it with the registrar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brass finisher, of 5, Broad Arrow Court—the prisoner is my next brother—I was present at his wedding to Emma Stent, in October, 1856, at Bethnal Green Church—they lived together four or five years and had two children—he then went into the 9th Lancers, and while he was away his wife went away with another man—when the regiment came home I went to Hounslow, and found he had got drunk and had been tried by Court Martial, that was in 1869—when he came out he asked where his wife was, and some of his neighbours said that she had gone away from the neighbourhood, because she had got a child—I saw her last at Guildhall—I had not seen her then, 1869, and a long time before that—she left the neighbourhood—the neighbours told him that she had left a long time before with one of her old companions—I did not know where her old companions lived—I do not know they lived at Bethnal Green—it is over six years since I saw Emma Stent—she was then receiving parish relief for her daughter, and I found out that she had had a bastard child and went to the parish and stopped the payment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had no conversation with my brother about that—I have often seen his daughter, and a very nice girl she is; she is fifteen years old—I never troubled myself to ask her whether she lives with her mother—she came and said how are you uncle, and that is all I know.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, May Street, Whitecross Street—I have known the prisoner four years—I was married to him on 31st January, 1871, at St. James's, Curtain Road—before we were married I asked him if his wife was living, as I had heard he was a married man; he said she was dead, but he would go with me to look for her to satisfy me—we went down Whitechapel way to ask after her—we could not find out where she was—we only went once—I often spoke to him about it, and seven months ago a friend told me she was living, and living with another man, and would never trouble the prisoner or me, and she begged me not to tell my husband of it—I was very unhappy about it, and said I would really see whether she was the right woman or not.</p>

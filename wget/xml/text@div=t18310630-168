            . I am a Police-constable. On the 4th of June I saw the prosecutor in Goswell-street-road - he had no hat or coat on; he complained that those fellows had robbed him - I saw two or three persons at the top of the street, and saw the prisoner run off; he was sixty or seventy yards from me - I followed, but lost sight of him; I took him in a hay-loft, in Black Horse-yard; I knew him by the description of his clothes - I had gone within forty or fifty yards in the pursuit - he had nothing when I took him.</p>
               <p>CHARLES KNOTT. I am a Police-constable. About two o'clock in the morning of the 4th of June, in consequence of information, I went to Black Horse-yard; I heard some footsteps in a loft; Davis and another man were there - I went up a ladder, and called to the prisoner to open the door; I called many times, but received no answer - I began to force the door open, and I heard the prisoner making his way through the roof, on the opposite side - I forced the door, and ran across the loft; I found the prisoner three parts out of the loft, through the roof - I went through the same place after him; I followed him along the roof of that loft, over the stable, and then over the roof of a dwelling-house, where I believe his mother or mother-in-law lives - I then saw him lay down two hats; this is one of them - he then let himself down to another roof about three feet from that, and got into another loft, where he was laying concealed between three trusses of hay; when I removed the hay, and found him, he pretended to be asleep - I called to him a great many times, and then removed the hay; I took hold of him by the collar, and pulled him out through the yard, and at the entrance of the yard, I received this coat from some person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prosecutor said it was a dark night? A. It was not particularly dark: it was daybreak; I should not have known a man running seventy or eighty yards from me - I did not see any one else in the loft.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The place I went through is where we go through to mend the tiles.</p>
               <p>Six witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

Yes; the first house, to the bar of those which are now standing, I do not know the number of the house; I went upon suspicion that there was somebody upon the house getting the lead; a person of the name of Smith was with me; I heard a rattling among the tiles, upon the top of the house, and searched every room as we went up; we went up to the top of the house; as we were getting out, I saw some lead tied up, about four or five hundred weight of pieces cut, it had the appearance of being cut with a knife; we went down stairs through the next house, and when we had got to the bottom room, we found the two prisoners concealed in a closet; they begged us not to hurt them, and we took them to the watch-house; we found two knives lying in the place where the lead was cut up; the door of that house stood upon the jar; the door of the other house they could not get out at, because it was boarded up; I had been at work there; I quitted the house at six o'clock, there was a fence round the two houses, I found the door of the fence open; what lead was not cut up was marked across, as if it was ready to cut up (produces the two knives and a piece of the lead;) the cutting appeared very bright.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What are you? - A. A bricklayer.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course the whole house is to come down, is it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the care of the house? - A. Joseph Stevens.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get into the house, when you went to work? - A. We had no business in that house.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH STEVENS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I left this house safe at six o'clock in the evening; I am employed, under the City of London, to take care of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The keys are left at the Surveyor's office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And any body going to the Surveyor's office, having an authority from the City of London, might go in there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Who went in after six o'clock at night, you do not know? - A. Nobody has the key but the Surveyor.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the house surrounded with a horde? - A. Behind it was, but not in front.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. As to the keys you took no trouble at all about them? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. They hang up in the office, do they not? - A. No; they are put in drawers, and not locked up; Mr. Constable not having been paid, I do not think we ever received them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Constable here? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. For ought you know, there might be no keys to the house, or in whose custody they were, if there were any, you do not know? - A. No, I do not.</p>

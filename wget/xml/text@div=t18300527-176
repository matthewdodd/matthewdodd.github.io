The prisoner was at my child's wake this day three weeks, and it will be three weeks tomorrow since my sheets were stolen - they were taken from a window-ledge; they were not clean - one of them was very much stained, and they were laid by to wash; the prisoner did not leave the house on the day of the funeral - she slept there till four o'clock on the Tuesday morning, when I went to market and left her there; the sheets were then safe.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's son. My mother went out about six o'clock in the morning; I had seen the prisoner go out at four - she had nothing then but her own things; in about a quarter of an hour after my mother went out, the prisoner and Kelly burst open the door; Kelly asked where the sheets were - the prisoner said they were under the head of the bed; Kelly said, "No; here they are on the window-seat;" she put them on the table, and the prisoner took them off and went down stairs with them - I thought she was going to soak them; Kelly went away in ten minutes - the prisoner did not return.</p>

            . I lodge with the prosecutrix. The prisoner and Kelly went out early that morning, and after the prosecutrix was gone, the prisoner and Kelly came back - Kelly said the prosecutrix told her to wash the sheets, but her husband came and told her to go and get his breakfast - she said she came to wash the sheets; he then said she might stay; I saw Kelly take the sheets off the window, and while I was dressing one of the children. I heard the prisoner on the landing-place say, "I am going;" but I did not see any thing in her hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did we force the door open? A. It was pushed open while I was blowing the fire; I said,"Oh, my God!" I thought it was locked, but it was but a poor lock.</p>

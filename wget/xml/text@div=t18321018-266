I fell in with the prisoner; he had been an old shipmate of mine - he said he was in distress; I told him to call on me, and I would give him some employment - he did so, and I gave him a bag, containing jackets, trousers, shirts, and a variety of other things, to take to the rendezvous house, on Towerhill - I afterwards went there, but he and the things were not there; I received information, and went to the Angel, in Back-lane - I found him there, and part of my things were on his back; all he had on, except his braces, were mine - there are still three shirts, some jackets, and trousers missing.</p>

I took the prisoner; he had these things on - he at first said he had sold the rest to a Jew, in a house; I asked him to tell me where the house was - he then said he sold them to a Jew in the street: I found 6s. 5d. on him, which he said was part of the money he had got for them.</p>

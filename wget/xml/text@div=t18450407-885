                  </hi>. I live in Beech-street. On Thursday night, the 21st of March, between twelve and one o'clock, I was on Snow-hill, and was about five yards from Fox and Knott-court—Coomber took hold of my left arm, and asked me to go home with her—I said I would not, I was going home—she was alone, but in about a minute Brown came up. and took hold of my right arm—Smith was behind—they all three pulled me round the corner, and Brown asked Coomber if I was going home—Coomber made no reply to her, but asked me to go home with her—I said, "No"—they then asked if I would stand a drain—I said I had no objec<lb></lb>tion, but the public-houses were all shut up—Coomber then unpinned her shawl, and lifted my left hand to her breast—I had my right hand in my pocket, in which I had a purse, containing two sovereigns, two half-sove<lb></lb>reigns, two half-crowns, and four shillings—I took my right hand out of my pocket to take my left hand from Coomber—they then all pushed me about—I put my right hand back to my pocket, and my purse was gone—I said, "You have taken my purse"—they swore they had not—I took hold of Coomber and Brown and called a policeman—the policeman came and took them—the purse was found on Brown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Brown.</hi> I was the first to speak to this gentleman; I asked him to go home with me; he went up the court with me, and the officer came and said he had a great mind to take us to the watch-house. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, I never saw any one, to speak to them, from the end of Chancery-lane till I got within five yards of Fox and Knott-court—two of the prisoners polled me up the court, and Smith pushed behind.</p>

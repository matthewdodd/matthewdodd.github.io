Erlebach was in my service—he left about six months back, but was still occasionally employed by me—I did not send him to my chambers on 11th Dec. for any books—he had no authority to take any—I saw them safe between nine and ten o'clock on the morning of the 11th, and missed them in the evening.</p>

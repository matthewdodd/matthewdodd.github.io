            , on the 15th of May, Whitsunday, on my return from Edmonton Church, at the end of sacrament time as near as I can recollect a quarter past one, a little more or a little less, I was going to Wynchmore-hill, I was on foot and quite alone, and near the entering of a lane, called Mr. <placeName id="t17850914-2-crimeloc8">Tashmakers Lane</placeName>

               <p>How far was that from Edmonton church? - A mile, the man presented a pistol to me, and said, Madam, your money or your life, I begged him to take that from me, and I would give him all I had, he told me not to be frightened, I should not be hurt, and I gave him two half crowns, and sixpence, and he left me immediately, I went to Wynchmore-hill, I suppose he went from me, I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Do you know the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at him? - Yes, he is the man.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - I never saw him in my life before.</p>
               <p>How long might he stay with you? - I suppose four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Was you so long getting out the half crowns? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body go by at the time? - Not anybody, I did not see a creature near me till I was out of the field in the lane.</p>
               <p>Is it a public path? - A public path from the church.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - In a day labouring working dress.</p>
               <p>What sort of a hat? - A very old shabby hat flapped round his head.</p>
               <p>And had you a fair opportunity of seeing his countenance? - Yes, my Lord, I stood with him some minutes particularly begging he would not hurt me, and pleading to save one half crown.</p>
               <p>You mean to tell the Jury, the prisoner is the man? - I am too sure he is the man, if I had had the least doubt I would not have come into this Court.</p>
               <p>How long after was he taken up? - The 17th of July.</p>
               <p>Court. That was two months after the time, did you recollect him again immediately? - I recollected him the instant I saw him, I mentioned the robbery as soon as it was committed, I was walking with Mr. and Mrs. Dale and Mr. Holmes after tea, and in a lane near Salmon's brook this man met us, and I instantly said that is the man that stopped me on the Whitsunday, the reply was, are you sure of that? and immediately Mr. Dale and Mr. Holmes seized the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that near the place where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140005"></xptr> you had been robbed before? - It was some distance, I cannot tell exactly how near.</p>

               <p>I seized the man by Mrs. Holmes's directions, that that was the very man that had robbed her, I said, are you certain sure? she pointed with her fingers, says she, that is the fellow, with that we seized him, the poor man absolutely utterly denied it, and said, he was not the person, and so he still continued, the man behaved very decent, and very pretty; and I certainly did take him, I searched him and found a pistol in his pocket, which I tore out of the bottom of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Was it loaded at the time? - No, it was not in a condition to fire at anything.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mrs. Holmes. Do you recollect whether that was the sort of pistol that was presented to you? - Yes, my Lord, as near as one pistol can be to another, when I came home, I said it was like an old great horse pistol.</p>
               <p>Dale. He said at the time he overtook her, he would not hurt the hair of her head, he is an easy quiet poor creature.</p>
               <p>Holmes. I can say nothing more than to coroborate the evidence Mr. Dale has given, except I asked him how he came by the pistol, he said he did not know he had it, I said that was impossible, then he said he carried it to protect himself, I afterwards remonstrated with him, and he said, being a gardener he carried it to frighten the birds.</p>

               <p>Did you ever know him to carry this pistol about? - I never saw it before then,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140006"></xptr> I asked him the use of it, and he said, he had it to frighten the birds, I asked him which way, he said, he struck it down at them, and by striking it down it frightened the birds off the trees.</p>

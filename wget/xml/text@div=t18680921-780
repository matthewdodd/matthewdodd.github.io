                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, and live at 10, Sarah's Place—on 28th August, about 8.30, the prisoner came to my shop—I served him with two cigars, or rather he helped himself—he paid me with a florin—there was a dispute as to whether he had taken two or three cigars—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 41/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—he held his hand out, and said, "Governor, you have made a mistake, I have only had two cigars"—I said, "I beg your pardon," and gave him 11/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more—before he had passed over the door step I tried the florin in the detector, and it gave way—I said, "hoy"—he took no heed but went out directly—I sent my daughter after him, and I went after him—I saw them talking together—he turned to go on—I went up to him and took hold of him, and said, "We must come back and talk about this"—he went back with me—I took up the florin, and said, "This is a queer piece of stuff you have given me"—he said, "Not me"—I said, "Yes you, and no mistake, and I gave you 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change"—he said, "Oh, I have no change about me'—he put his hand into his left-hand pocket and pulled out a handful of coppers, and said, "That is all the change I have got"—I said, "Yes, and there is the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. among the copper"—he still persisted that he had never been in the shop before—he first said, "I paid you for the cigars," and then he said he had never been in the shop—I sent my daughter for an officer, and gave him in charge with the florin.</p>

I saw the prisoner give my father the florin—directly he left my father told me to go after him—I did so—he had got a few doors from the shop—I told him to come back, father wanted to speak to him—he said, "What is the matter?"—my father came up, and they went into the shop together—I was sent for a constable.</p>

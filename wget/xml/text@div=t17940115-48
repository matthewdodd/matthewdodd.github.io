               <p>I lost a gown the 4th of January, a dark cotton gown, I have a piece of the same; I missed it half an hour after the prisoner had taken it, it was kept up two pair of stairs in the bed room, it laid on my bed, I missed it about half after three, I was gone to market very early, I returned from market, I was not gone half an hour, I missed it when I returned, when I lost it I enquired of different pawnbrokers.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it before? - Before I went out, not ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened when you missed it? - I had people that lodged in the house, and they said to me, your bed-room is open, madam; I said, how do you know it? she said by seeing light come down stairs, with that I says to her walk up stairs, and see if I have lost any thing, she went up stairs with me, and I missed that dark cotton gown off the bed, directly I missed the gown I went to different pawnbrokers, as such this pawnbroker's master said he had such a gown brought in half an hour ago, it was the third I went to. His name is Coudley, he lives in Ratcliff-highway; he shewed me the gown, and I said that was my property; the gown is here, the body has some of my own joining, it was not big enough when it was made across.</p>

            When you got your gown what did you do? - I left it in the pawnbroker's hands, as such the girl, the prisoner at the bar, on the next Monday afternoon went to pledge something else, not of mine, but of other peoples, I did not see the girl. I desired them if the person came again to detain the person, till they owned that they pledged my gown; he did, he had her before the justice, and I saw her at the justice said swore to my property, I never saw her before, till I saw her at the pawnbroker's, she never lived at my house; the pawnbroker sent for me, in consequence of my directions.</p>

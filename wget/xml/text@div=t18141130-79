Yes; her sister was my house-keeper; she was my servant up to August last; the prisoner's sister was ill, she said, give me a bed, I will go and live some where else.</p>
               <p>Q. After the prisoner left your house, did you miss any of your property - A. Yes; I missed all the things the officer has in his possession; I missed them in

             The prisoner and her sister were in my service, and I missed a number of articles more than is here.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner's sister had been with you some time, had she not - A. More than ten years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. She had a child, had not she - A. That is a year and a half or two years ago; she went to Hatton Gardon office, and swore that to my son; she could not put that on my shoulders; I am eighty years old.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, at the time that she went away, were you called to see the things that she took away - A. She called me to see her box; I said, I did not want any thing in the box.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time she went away, did not you say, you was very well satisfied, that she was very honest - A. I said so, because I thought they would remove the goods else where.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go to see the prisoner's sister, the house-keeper, and keep to company - A. No, never, not at anytime, I went with Dr Taylor to see her, only once; her sister said, my sister does not like to see you; the sister liked me, but the prisoner did not; that is a good while ago I went with Dr. Taylor; I gave the prisoner's sister a one hundred and twenty pound note, and hoped she would live to come back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Why you wished the prisoner to come back again - A. No, I never asked her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you offer to pay the rent of a house to the amount of eighty pounds a year - A. No, never that is all a falsity.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had charged the prisoner with stealing these things, did not you invite her to come and dine with you - A. No.</p>

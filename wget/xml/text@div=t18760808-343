This was shortly after 12 o'clock on Saturday—there had been a fire before on that night—I do not know whether Boydell was a paid agent of the Fire Brigade—I was in the habit of leaving him my jacket in the Pimlico fire-station; I had been good friends with him—upon this particular occasion, before anything happened to me, I was not talking to Boydell near the George—I was so ill that a Magistrate came and brought a prisoner in my presence for me to make a dying de<lb></lb>claration—Boydell was not brought—I did not say anything on 26th of June against Boydell—there were two matters; one outside the George public-house in Lower George Street, and the other outside a shop in Union Place—when the persons ran away from near to the George public-house Boydell was left there in the street, and never followed them at all; he was not present at the violence in St. George's Place—Union Place goes off by Sloane Square Railway Station, and Lower George Street is on a line with Sloane Square—I do not think it is more than 150 yards from the George public-house to the place where I received the injuries—I know Ryan by sight—I knew a man named Bow, and one named Kelly; it did not begin by those three men jeering me—I took a man in custody; I do</p>

I am a lamplighter of Lower Sloane Street—on Sunday morning, 25th June, I left my house at 1.15 to put the lights out—I went into Lower George Street to call my brother, who is also a lamplighter—on my way I saw a disturbance by the George public-house—there were about five or six people there; they were very noisy—I saw Goodgame there; he asked them in a polite way to go away, they would not—then the fireman came up; the constable was pushing the people away—the fireman said "You shan't take them into custody while I am here;" with that the constable tried to get away from him to take one Of them, and the fireman pushed him down—I saw Ryan there and saw him strike the constable with his fist on the neck, rather forcibly—this happened opposite the George Inn, not at Union place—I never knew Ryan before, I am quite sure he is the man who struck the policeman on the side of the head with his fist—several others kicked at him—I saw no more blows or kicks there—the only blow was one which Ryan gave him near the George—the con<lb></lb>stable got up again; the policeman was not down when struck—it was before he fell that Ryan struck him—he did not fall from that blow, he fell by the fireman pushing him before that—he got up again and then he was struck—they all ran away but Boydell, who did not move—the constable got up and ran after the others, I followed behind—they ran down Union Place; about 150 yards off; I came up to them—when they got together again, about four of them, attacked the policeman and threw him down and kicked him—I saw Ryan there; the other three ran away and Ryan with them—in Union Place the whole of them kicked him, about four of them—I</p>

I am a physician living in St. George's Square, Pimlico—between 5 and 6 o'clock on Sunday morning, 25th June, I was called to Goodgame's house, and I found him bleeding from three contused wounds in the head, two in the forehead, about 2 inches long, and one on the top—I did not consider them at that time to be dangerous; he was covered with bruises nearly all over his body—the right side of his neck and jaw, his ear, his arm, and his right knee were bruised—his helmet and clothes were covered with blood—the injuries were such as might have been produced by kicks—I examined a boot taken from one of the prisoners, and the heavy nails on the toe corresponded with the wound upon the policeman's forehead—on the left ear there was a bruise which might have been caused by the blow of a fiat, and another on the right side of the neck which might have been caused by a kick or a blow—I saw him again two or three times a day; erysipelas set in about the second day; he was then in a very dangerous condition, and congestion of the brain came on, and he was in a most comatose state for some time, and delirious, and then he had congestion of the lungs, and continued in a very serious state, and he is—still under treatment, and will be for five or six months—he is not fit for duty, nor likely to be for a considerable time—I think he is out of danger—a Magistrate attended when he was in that serious state to take his deposition, and I considered it necessary to have another opinion—Ryan was before the Magistrate, but not Boydell—the examination was taken at the constable's house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the same house as Ryan—on Saturday night, 24th June, Ryan was very tipsy; about 11.30 he was sitting on my stairs asleep—his mother and brother live in the same house; they were not there—my brother came in ten minutes after and asked me for a light—Ryan was then on the stairs tipsy—that is all I know—I saw him next morning going out at 9 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's brother—on the night of 24th June I saw him on the stairs at 11.30 drunk and incapable, and fast asleep—I dragged him, with the help of my other brother, and put him on a chair—I and the last witness dragged him from the chair and put him to bed; I slept in the same bed—I awoke at 6.30; my brother was there, and the witness Groom was in the next bed—I was up in the room at the time of the row; I sat up till 1.30, and then I heard a row—I heard a rush going down the court, and I went out and saw two men in Union Place; they knocked the policeman down and ran down another court—one of them was Bow, and another Campbell—they were the only two I saw—I was going to give information at the police-court, but I was not asked; it was not mentioned in the police-court before me—I was up at the police-court, but was not examined; I was called at last—my brother <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> was there—it was he and I who dragged my brother oft" the stairs—he slept in the same room with Groom—<hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> is eighteen, older than I am—he is now at home.</p>

I gave my information before the Magistrate on the last day—I said there that my brother was drunk on the stairs when I came home; that was about 11.30—then I said we put him on a chair, and that he was so drunk he could not sit up straight—we undressed him and put him to bed; I slept by his side—they asked if I knew anything of the row, and I said "Yes"—I went to bed a little after 1.30; I had been sitting up for Jeremiah, who went out for some supper—he used to work for a man named Gubby—he was out there about twenty-five minutes, and returned at 1.30—he was out while I put my brother to bed—Groom came in while I had him on the chair, and we dragged him into bed—he never brought any supper—I saw the row about 1.30—the George public-house is close to our house; I could get there and back in a very few minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Whitaker Street, Pimlico—on Saturday, 24th June, there was a disturbance at George Street, Chelsea—I went out and saw the men there; I stayed there and saw the occurrence—I saw the constable in George Street—two men were creating a disturbance, Bow and Campbell—the constable asked them to go away, or he would take them in custody; they refused to do so—he then went to take hold of Bow and they fell to the ground, the constable and Bow together—they both got up,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187608080060"></xptr>
               <p>and while the constable was speaking to Bow a man, Kelly, came up and struck the constable in the face, and he fell to the ground and was kicked by Bow in the left side; that was in George Street—Kelly then ran up George Street towards Sloane Square—I picked up the constable's hat, and he ran after Bow and Campbell round Frog's Island to get assistance—I ran with the constable's hat in my hand for assistance, and when I came back the men had escaped—I did not see what happened afterwards—I knew the names of the three men who assaulted the constable—I did not see Ryan there—Kelly is a big, broad man, larger faced than Ryan.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Ryan in his defence stated that he belonged to the</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">th Middlesex Militia, and had completed his month's training on the day before this occurrence, and got intoxicated, and had been in the company of these men on the night in question, but had left them two hours previous to the row. That he was taken home drunk by William Murphy, who had gone away out of the neighbourhood, so that he would not appear against these three men if they were taken. If he had taken any part in this affiair, he would not have stayed on the very ground where it occurred. He complained that his identification was unfair, as he was put between five or six tradesmen, respectably dressed, he being the only roughly dressed man amongst them.</hi>

            . I am the wife of Robert Garland. The prisoner was in my service - she used to account for what she bought two or three times a week; I found her generally honest, and used to burn the accounts when she gave them to me, and if she had spent any of her own money I paid it her - we paid ready money for every thing but bread; I called on the baker, and said I would pay the bill, meaning the last week's bill - they said there had been a bill ever since the 10th of January, and I had issued money weekly for it to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH SMOUT. I keep a butcher's-shop, in North-place, Gray's Inn-road. I have been in the habit of supplying the prosecutor, and used to send with the meat a ticket of the weight and price - I never received any money from the master or mistress, but I received of the prisoner 2l. about August last, which is all I received since the 18th of February, 1839; I have now a bill against the prosecutor for 24l. 16s. 2 1/2d. - I recollect on the 17th of February sending in a loin of mutton.</p>
               <p>MAS. GARLAND. I cannot tell what I paid to the prisoner for the butcher's bill - I suppose it might be 12s. or 14s. a week; I used to give her sovereigns and silver for marketing, from 2l. 10s. to 3l. a week - I cannot speak to any particular sum.</p>

What does the Fellow want? says I, and gave him a Cuff, that beat off his Hat and Wig. Upon this the first of them ran away; but the Prisoner taking up his Hat and Wig, swore at me, snatch'd my Pocket off, push'd me up towards the Wall , and brnised my Thigh against a Post, and ran away. I scream'd out, and follow'd him, and catch'd hold of his Sleeve, upon which he swung my Pocket to me again, and with struggling he got from me, and left the Cuff of his Sleeve in my Hand - here it is.</p>

             . The Prisoner pluck'd at my Daughter's Pocket, I saw his Face plain by the 'Lights in a Shoemaker's Shop. She struck off his Hat and Wig, he took them up again , and said, Damn you, you Bc, do you beat off my Hat and Wig. Says I, don't abuse her for she's with Child; for I did not think at first that he had been a Thief. Damn ye for an old Bitch, says he, and struck me a Blow. I cry'd, Thieves! and she cry'd, My Pocket ! My Pocket! and follow'd him.</p>

             , Constable. About New-Year's-Day, it being my Watch Night , I heard a Noise of singing and Rioting in the Street, and sent out the Watchmen, who brought in the Prisoner and his Companion. Next Morning I sent for Mrs. Burkett (having heard that she had been robb'd) and she said the could not be positive to them both till her Mother came.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Burkett. I said I could not swear to his Companion whom I had taken but little Notice of.</p>
               <p>Constable . The Prisoner's Breeches were the same Colour of the Piece of the Cuff, but his Coat was of a lighter Colour.</p>

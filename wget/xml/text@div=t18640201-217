I am a customer of Mr. Waddell's—I know the prisoner as being a clerk of his—these three receipts are in the prisoner's writing, and were given to me by him for sums paid by me—I believe they refer to these two invoices, one for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and the other for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the discounts made it come to 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid all three sums to the prisoner himself on Octo<lb></lb>ber 5th, November 13th, and December 1st.</p>

I was town and country traveller to Mr. Waddell—I re<lb></lb>member some goods being sent to Jones and Bonham; they were a class of goods that I could make a very little indeed with amongst the customers—they were slightly damaged in the gilding, and were a style of pattern that the customers at the west-end, who they were intended for, did not approve—they were unsaleable—I had had them out several times.</p>

                  </hi>. I formerly practiced as an accountant, but do not now—in the early part of December, last year, I was called in by Mr. Wain<lb></lb>wright, who was about to become a partner of the prosecutor's, and went there to go over his books—I found that the amount of gross profit was very small—I was desirous of ascertaining whether that arose from an ex<lb></lb>penditure made for opening out the business, or from forced sales—I made an estimate as to the rate of profit which the prosecutor said he always got on his goods, and found that if that rate of profit had been obtained there was a deficiency of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I called the prosecutor's attention to it, and asked him whether there had been any forced sales—he said there had been none whatever—I was subsequently called upon by the prosecutor, and Mr. Wainwright, to attend a private meeting at the White Hart hotel—the prisoner was present, and he was asked, in the presence of Mr. Wad<lb></lb>dell and Mr. Wainwright, to account for this apparent deficiency in the stock of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Waddell told him that he held him responsible, inasmuch as he had had the stock in his care, and had kept the books for some time—the prisoner said nothing in reply, but he ultimately said, "I think, Mr. Wad<lb></lb>dell, you are treating me in a very unfair way indeed, in putting me in this position before Mr. Ogan and Mr. Wainwright, when you know I have fre<lb></lb>quently sold goods by your orders at the best prices that I could get"—Mr. Waddell made no reply whatever to him, and Mr. Wainwright and I then left—the prisoner referred to a stock-sheet, which had been taken on the 1st November that year, and that list was said to represent stock to the value of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the stock being taken by myself, it was found only to amount to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and some odd pounds—I said it would be much more satisfactory if that stock-list could be found, as any deficiency of stock could then be traced</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186402010017"></xptr>
               <p>—Mr. Waddell directly said, "Well, Mr. Wood, you had that list; why don't you produce it?"—the prisoner replied, "I can't produce it, you know that; you told me yourself that you had stuffed it away, to prevent Mr. Ogan seeing it"—Mr. Waddell made no reply to that—Mr. Wainwright left the matter in my hands; I was a personal friend of his—I asked the prose<lb></lb>cutor several times as to whether there had been any forced sales—he never said anything about the sales to Jones and Bonbam—I never heard the names mentioned.</p>

I was the person for whom this property was being valued by Mr. Ogan—I was present at the White Hart—I heard the prisoner say that he had sold some goods, and that goods had been sold by auction in his name, and that he had sold goods at what he termed forced sales—I don't remember the conversation—I left the matter in the hands of Mr. Ogan.</p>

I am a glass dealer, of 18, Finch-street, Whitechapel—I have been a customer of Mr. Waddell's many times—I have purchased goods of him almost every week, from him personally—sometimes when I have paid him he has put the money into his pocket; he made no entry while I remained—I have been there sometimes twice a day to buy goods, and always paid him; be always put the money into his pocket, and never gave me an invoice—he said, "Mr. Sherer does not want an invoice for his goods"—I have seen the prisoner there; I heard the prosecutor say to him, "Never mind about booking Mr. Sherer's invoices, he does not want any invoice for these goods"—the last time it was an amount of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or something like that—I met him in Houndsditch, and he took me into his warehouse, and I bought two quantities of lustres of him; I generally used to buy job lots—I was with the prosecutor in Houndsditch on one occasion when the prisoner came out of Mr. Johnson's, and handed the prosecutor a paper, and said, "That is a cheque that I have received from Mr. Johnson"—Mr. Wad<lb></lb>dell said, "If you are going to the office, don't book this cheque till you see me"—that was in the beginning of October; I don't know the day of the month.</p>

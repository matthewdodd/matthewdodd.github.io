                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Loveland, who is clerk to the Board of Guardians of the parish of St. Luke, Chelsea. The prisoner was relieving officer to that parish—he was appointed in May, 1839—his salary at first was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—that was raised, in Nov., 1852, to 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was his duty to give relief to the paupers, and to pay certain bills connected with the relief of the poor—on 26th Oct., 1853, he received this cheque for 56<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that included various sums that he was to pay—the relief of the poor for that week included this bill of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was owing to the London Fever Hospital for the maintenance of three paupers while they were there—they were three paupers who were sent to the Fever Hospital—the prisoner received that cheque, and it was his duty to pay this and other bills—on the following week, on the passing of his accounts, he produced this bill as being paid, with this receipt on it, "Received. C. Hyde"—it was then treated as a discharged account—the prisoner continued to act till the latter end of Nov. last—he was suspended on 22nd Nov., and absconded a few days afterwards—I saw him again on the Fast-day.</p>

LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you personally look for him, as you say he had absconded? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, we sent to his house—Mr. Smith took his duties—Mr. Smith told the Board that he was not competent to discharge all the duties, and assistance was given to him—this cheque is my writing—I cannot say that I handed it to the prisoner—I was in the office at the time I drew it—I cannot say that I saw the guardians, whose names are attached to it, sign it—this "T. M. Loveland" is not my writing—the amount of the weekly cheque is not similar week after week; it varies according to circumstances—the prisoner was suspended on 22nd Nov.—I do not know that subsequently he assisted Mr. Smith in his duties—Mr. Smith entered on his duties immediately after the suspension—I never heard that the prisoner went to him for the purpose of assisting in making up his accounts—certain patients who were paupers went to the Fever Hospital—that is not a matter within my own knowledge—I am not able to say, from my own knowledge, that Hannah Manning was a pauper—I can say that she was charged in his relief list, and John Bird was charged in his relief list—here is his relief list—I cannot say whether I was</p>

               <p>present at the Board of Guardians when the prisoner applied, just before he was dismissed, for his wages—I do not think I was—I have heard him apply for wages, but not since Michaelmas, I think—I never heard him apply for wages, and state that he had expended 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—I never heard of it—I have heard him several times apply for wages—I never heard him state that there were nearly 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to him—I generally attend each meeting a portion of the time—I will not state positively that I heard the prisoner make an application since Michaelmas—my memory is in a state of doubt as to the date.</p>

ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you heard him apply, and his application refused? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, because the books were not made up—I cannot say that I handed him this cheque—there was no other sum out of which he could have paid these bills but this cheque, and it was given him for that express purpose.</p>

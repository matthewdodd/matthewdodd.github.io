               <p>in Oct. I had purchased some books from a man where he lives, and amongst them were several odd volumes—he called on me to know the names of those books, because some more books had come from the country, and he thought the volumes wanting might be amongst them—I gave him the names of three books, and he then went away—I saw him again on the Wednesday, the next day but one—he brought two books to me, supposing they might be those I gave him the names of, but they were not—he took them away with him—he said the other person had brought up some books, and he would let me know when it would be convenient for me to see them at his house, No. 11, Lans<lb></lb>downe-mews—on the following morning I went to his house—I did not find the books—his wife told me they were taken away and sold—I did not see Watts there.</p>

On the fifth of August I went home about ten o'clock at night, my landlady told me she had taken in a lodger but did not very well like him, because she had sent for his character, as he directed, and could hear nothing about him. He was then in bed in my room. I had three shirts in a handkerchief, which I brought home from the washerwoman's. I carried them up with me to bed, then unlocked my chest and put them in, and went to look for my night cap but could not find it, so tied a handkerchief about my head. When I got up in the morning

             was in bed with the new lodger, for I cannot swear it is the prisoner, seeing but little of him. Malphus said, here is the cap you was inquiring after last night in our bed; the stranger lay bald headed. I went to work, and about seven or eight o'clock a messenger came and told me my chest was open. I went with him and found it was broke open, and the things mentioned in the indictment taken away. Mentioning them by name.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you locked it after you put your things in it over night?</p>
               <p>Black. I am certain I did. I advertised the things, and about a month ago the prisoner was taken up for another robbery and committed. I had intelligence of it and went where he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got your things again?</p>

               <p>A. Elington. No, nor he to me. When he came he brought nothing but a roll of paper, and said he was a writer to a lawyer.</p>

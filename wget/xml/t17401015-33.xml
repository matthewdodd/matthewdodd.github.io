             . On Monday Morning, the Prisoner and another brought 3 Pumps to my House, in Thames-street, to sell; 2 Porters had them in Baskets on their Backs, they sent the Porters to the Alehouse, and then I suspected that they were stolen. I asked them how they came by them, and told them I must stop the Goods; they said they would fetch somebody to their character, and went away. I went immediately for a Constable, but he not being at home, I went to a Ware-house by the Water-side, and these Men, and 2 others with them, came to me there; but when they heard that I had been for a Constable, one of them escap'd, and the Prisoner we lock'd in and secur'd. When we were before the Alderman at Guildhall, the Prisoner had 2 Hours allowed him to send for his Friends, but to no purpose. There were the Dates of the Year on all of them, one was mark'd 1729, R.F. another 1738, and the other 1689, W.S.I. The Prisoner said, that his Brother had them from another Brother at Gravesend; but if they had been honestly come by, they would not have been brought in Baskets; besides the Person who own'd them, could not think of taking up a Pump which was put down in the Year 38.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, Ask him, if he did not order his Sister to buy a Hundred weight of Lead of my Brother?</p>
               <p>Machen . I do allow my Sister to buy Lead in the Shop, but not knowing it to be stole.</p>
               <p>Richard Seller. One of these Pumps is mine, I lost it out of my Yard on Saturday Night, or Sunday Morning; it is mark'd 1689, W.S.I. I saw the Prisoner about the House at 10 o'clock that Night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming from Billingsgate, and met this other Man, and the 2 Porters; he asked me to go with him to sell some Lead, and said, he had it from Gravesend, but he is run away. I knew nothing of it's being stole.</p>

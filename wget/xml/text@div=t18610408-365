                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Moses, Son, and Davis, clothiers in Aldgate—the prisoner was in the shirt department there—his salary was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week; a week of not more than 5 days—Saturdays he had almost at his own command—it was part of his duty to make contracts with the workpeople—his other duties were very general in his department—he had the entire superintendence; engaging the shirt-cutters and arranging their wages—he had no authority to receive back any portion of the wages which be agreed to pay to any particular workman—it was all piece-work—we derived no benefit from any portion of returned money—his duty with regard to the vouchers was to take a blank voucher and enter upon it, in columns described there, the work given up and brought in, and the price to be paid for that work—the true cost of the work—a workman so receiving that voucher would take it to the ledger-keeper for examination—he would enter it in his ledger, return the voucher to the workman with his initial, and the workman would then take it to the cashier for payment—he would receive in payment whatever the voucher represented in point of value—the voucher would be returned by the cashier—I have some of them here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the figuring is in the prisoner's writing, and the initial in the ledger-keeper's—the other parts carry on them the name of Upton—they are vouchers in favour of him—we have in our different establishments 2,000 employés, directly and indirectly, in and out the houses.</p>

               <p>we are subject to that sort of thing occasionally—they do not often run away from our place, they do sometimes—we should not blame the prisoner for that—it is impossible for me to say how many persons he would have to engage and to give out shirts to in the ordinary course of business—we are not <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Moses and Son; we are Moses, Son, and Davis—I should think he would have more than 100 persons during the week to engage and give out shirts to—it is he that has to give the work out to them—he takes their names and addresses down—he would not do that every time they came—sometimes they are dilatory in bringing back the work—he would not have to look after them then; we keep boys for that purpose—it is not the prisoner's duty to do that—he ought not to have done it—it was against the rule of the house to have any communication with the workpeople, out of doors, or at their own homes—he knew that—it was generally known—that rule was not in writing—I do not think I ever told him of such a rule—it did not require that he should be told—when the work was brought home, it was the prisoner's duty to check it and see that it was correct; and then he passed on the voucher.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, living at 39, Freeling-street, Caledonian-road, Islington—I know the prisoner—he was in the shirt department of Messrs. Moses, Son, and Davis—I went there on 25th April, last year, and applied for work—I saw the prisoner, and asked him if he was in want of a shirt stitcher for shirt trimming, as his brother said that he was—he said that he was not very busy, and said, "Did my brother send you?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I shall be out at 7 o'clock to night; meet me outside"—I did so—in the course of the evening we went to a public-house at the corner of Vine-street, Minories—he asked me what I could do white and fancy shirt trimmings for—I said, "I am receiving 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and produced a book from another house at the same time—the book was given to Mr. Lewis—he then asked me what I could do twill trimmings for—that is a commoner class of trimming—I said, "6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per gross," being the same as was in my book, and which I was then receiving elsewhere—he said, "Well, Upton, you know I have the sole control of Messrs. Moses, Son, and Davis; I can give you work, and I can give you 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per gross for white and fancy, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for twill, and you know these are prices which are not paid elsewhere, but the difference you must return to me, and as long as you do that you shall have plenty of work"—from that time I had work—I received payments at those rates, and returned him the difference.</p>

Y." are put to it when I return the work—I don't know why I changed the books; probably I might have left the other one behind—I cannot state the reason—the prisoner's writing is in that book as well—it was white shirt trimming that I received 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a gross for—the trimming means the front, the two wristbands, and the collar—that would count as one shirt; twelve of them a dozen, and twelve dozen a gross—they were given out to me sometimes five or six dozen at a time; sometimes more, and sometimes less—I cannot say whether I have received a gross at any time—there was a time given us all to work, according to the time they wanted the work—a time was always fixed, but not always the same time—I have had half a gross out for a fortnight—that was regular—I was not found fault with for keeping it out—I have been found fault with for keeping work out longer than the fixed time, but not frequently, and not by the prisoner; by persons who were there, shirt hands—I can't give you their names—the prisoner found fault with me—I have been found fault with by the shirt hands—I say that the prisoner never found fault with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and am the father of Alfred Upton—I know the prisoner—I have seen him from time to time with my son—I have seen money pass from my son to the prisoner on three occasions; once, from 10th to 15th of July, in Gracechurch-street—I cannot positively swear whether it was a half-sovereign or a sovereign, but it was gold—I was not near enough to distinguish which of the two it was—the second occasion was at a public-house in Fenchurch-street, somewhere about the latter end of August—I think it was a sovereign then, but I could not positively say—it was gold—the third occasion was on 24th December, near the London Hospital—it was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then—I did not notice anything particular being said between the prisoner and my son, only a little dissatisfaction—I suppose that from the irritable manner in which the money was received—I judged from the prisoner's manner that he was disappointed with the money, from his tone and gesture.</p>

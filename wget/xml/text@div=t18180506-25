I had been playing with the prisoners and a man named Bennett, after which we went into the tap-room - I went to sleep, and was awoke by feeling my watch being drawn out of my fob - They did not get it then. I got up, and told Bennett it was time we left the company-we both went out, the prisoners followed us, and said a pot of beer was owing. Taylor snatched the watch out of my fob, I collared him, and tried to get the watch away from him. Bennet said he had got it - He was knocked down, when two others and a woman got on the top of him - They got away with the watch.</p>

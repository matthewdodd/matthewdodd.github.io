               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.Have you any partner in your business? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has this man lived with you? - A. I think he came the 1st of September.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a very good character with him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You do not mean to say, that this sugar is not to be had at every grocer's shop in London? - A. It is a very difficult matter to get it exactly the same.</p>
               <p>Q. You can make a great number of samples out of one hogshead? - A. Yes; but this was a particular kind of sugar, it is Surinam sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a great many hogsheads of the same sort? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A vast quantity of course would come from the same country as well as that which you had? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. The bags, I presume, you cannot swear to? - A. No, they have no marks upon them.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable: I was sent for by Mr. Cobb to watch the prisoner; I followed him down Ivy-lane, and almost at the bottom, I stopped him; I asked him if he was not a smuggler; he said, no, he was not; then I told him he had something in his pocket that was not his own; then I went to the Crown public-house, in Cannon-alley, St. Paul's Church-yard; he went to the necessary, and took this paper of sugar out of his pocket, and threw it down; I got it up again with a scraper; then I searched his right-hand pocket, and took this paper of sugar out; after that, we took him back to Mr. Cobb's, and he gave charge of him.</p>

               <p>Q. What business had you to take him to the public-house? - A. He would go in there.</p>
               <p>JAMES WOODMAN sworn. - I am an officer; I was with Plush, I know no more than he has said.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Cobb.) Q. Is that Surinam sugar? - A. It is, it exactly matched with the sugar that he had been beating over.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you he had bought the sugar? - A. He did not at first, he did afterwards; he at first said, he had never taken any before, and it was only a little for his own use.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>THOMAS TWINCH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am a porter; I know the prisoner very well: Last Monday was a week, I met him in Watling-street, very near the Old-change, and a man that I never saw before, came up to him with some sugar in his apron, and asked him to buy it of him, and he asked me, I told him, I did not know what to do with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know it again? - A. Yes, I think I should.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at those parcels? - A. They were both in the same coloured bag at that time; this one I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Plush.) Q. Is that parcel in the same coloured paper that it was when you took it from the prisoner? - A. No; the paper underneath is the same colour as the other.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it? - A. Last Monday week.</p>
               <p>Q. At what hour of the day? - A.Somewhere about nine or ten o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. How came he to address you? - A. I do not know, he said he was in distress.</p>
               <p>Q. You will swear to that parcel? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What will you swear to it by? - A. By the size of it, and the colour of the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the only reason? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you will venture to swear positively to it? - A. I think I can swear positively to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you do not know the contents? - A. I knew it was sugar.</p>

               <p>Q.Longer than that, sure? - A. Not personally, I knew him by fight before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him by fight? - A. As a porter I may have known him two or three years.</p>
               <p>Q.Intimate with him about a twelvemonth? - A. I had not been particularly acquainted with him, only having a pint of beer with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he work with? - A. Mr. Cobb, in Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he live with, before he lived at Mr. Cobb's? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he lived at Mr. Cobb's? - A. I do not know.</p>

               <p>Q. So a strange man came up, and asked if you would buy any sugar? - A. Yes; he said it was good sugar he would warrant, and he supposed about four pounds of it.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not opened? - A. I do not know that it was; I did not see it opened.</p>
               <p>Q.Then how can you venture to swear that it was sugar? - A. It was sugar.</p>

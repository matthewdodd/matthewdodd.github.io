                  </hi>. I am a news agent of 115, London Wall—on 1st January, about 11.20 p.m., I was in Old Street, and the prisoner gave me a blow under my chin, my eyes became dazzled and I caught hold of somebody—I called out "Thieves, police, murder"—my pockets were turned inside out by somebody else; there were three men—they took away 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I jumped up and ran after the prisoner.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I am quite sure the prisoner is the man who struck me. John Dean Claridge. I am a dealer in unredeemed pledges, of 132, Bidders Street—I was in the City Road at 11.20 on this night, and saw two men knock the prosecutor down, who called out "Murder"—the prisoner is one of them—they ran, and I followed the prisoner and never lost sight of him—I kept in the middle of the road, and when I came up to him he was <hi rend="italic">skrinking</hi> down by the side of a wall, behind another man—I gave him in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been drinking, but I have taken no intoxicating drink for twenty years—I did not at the police-court acknowledge to being drunk—I was about 10 yards from the prisoner and prosecutor, and no one else was within 10 yards of them—there were only two men with the prosecutor, but a third man was on the other side of the road—I do not know which of the men struck the prosecutor—I think the prisoner was sober when he was given in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Vosper. On 20th Oct. I was residing at 36, Milton-street, Cripplegate—I have been an inmate of the workhouse—on the evening of 20th Oct. I went to the tap-room of the Flying Horse public-house, about half-past five o'clock, to call my husband to his tea—the prisoner, his wife, and several friends, were there—my husband was tossing the prisoner for a pot of porter, and then a young man tossed him—the prisoner pressed the young man's knuckles open, to see what he had—my husband said that was not fair tossing—the prisoner called him a b—<hi rend="italic">snob,</hi> and said if he did not mind his own business he would put him on the fire—the prisoner held up his hand, as if to strike my husband—his; hands were clenched, and my husband struck him—I did not see him strike my husband with his fist—the next thing I saw was the prisoner's wife pass him a poker—it was a good-sized poker—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—he held it in his hand, and flourished it round the room for a few minutes, and I acciden<lb></lb>tally received a blow—I firmly believe the blow was intended for my husband, but I stepped in between them—I do not believe he intended to strike me—the prisoner was at one end of the room, and my husband at the other, with Mr. Mansel trying to part him from the prisoner—I believe the blow that struck me was aimed at my husband, and I went in between them—I received the blow across my head—it bled a good deal—I am suffering from it now—I had a baby, ten months old, in my arms—I was taken to Mr. Simpson's, a surgeon, who dressed my head—I went to the hospital on the Wednesday evening, and remained there a fortnight—I am still under the doctor's hands.</p>

                  </hi>. On the evening of 20th Oct. I was at the Flying Horse—between 5 and 6 o'clock my wife came in to fetch me in to tea—the pri<lb></lb>soner was there, his wife, and three or four of his comrades, and I and Hackett, a friend of mine—we were sitting in the room for about half an hour, or so, and all at once the prisoner said, "I will toss any <hi rend="italic">snob</hi> in the room for a pot of beer"—I tossed him, and lost; and then Hackett tossed him, and lost—the prisoner forced Hackett's knuckles open, so that he could see the coin through, and then he said, "It is a woman, that I will have"—I said it was</p>

               <p>not fair—he said, "What have you to do with it, you b—<hi rend="italic">snob</hi>? I will put you on the fire"—I said, "You had better do it"—he held up his fist to strike me, and I <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with my fist, and struck him in the face—I cannot say whether I drew any blood, for I was directly dragged away—a confusion occurred in the room in an instant—the prisoner came and stood in the middle of the room, and both of us were showing <hi rend="italic">science</hi> at one another with our fists—his wife directly got up, took the poker from the fireplace, and gave it into the prisoner's hand—he got hold of it by the middle, and kept swinging it round—I was about three yards from him—I stooped my head down, intending to run in and butt at him, when my wife came, and, seeing me in a confusion, ran to save me—I did not see the prisoner strike her, as my head was down—I cannot say who he was aiming at—he was flourishing the poker round (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>), not striking down with it—my wife was a good deal hurt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Flying Horse. The prisoner was lodging at my house, and had been for some time—on the evening of 20th Oct. I was in the parlour—I heard a noise in the tap-room, went in, and saw the prisoner with the poker in his hand—it was so accidental I hardly know what he did with it—he was flourishing it about, and it went on the woman's head—I do not think he meant to do anything of the sort—he has always been a very quiet man—I directly took hold of the poker and took it from him—he was in liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I examined the woman's head on the evening of 20th Oct.—there was a longitudinal con<lb></lb>fused wound over the <hi rend="italic">os frontis,</hi> of about an inch and a quarter in length—it divided the common integuments, not dividing the structures to the skull, nor was there any fracture—it was rather a severe blow—it came in a slanting direction, not straight down—the skin was grazed on the right side of the wound.</p>

               <p>I am a linen draper. Mrs. Llewyn, whose husband keeps a nursery ground, who lives in the New-road, Blacksriars-road, she and Worth came to our house, about two o'clock on Friday, the 27th of March, and Mrs. Llewyn told me that Andrews had bought three or four pounds worth of trees and roots in their garden of her husband, to send into the country, and Andrews offered Llewyn a bill of forty-five pounds, and wanted change, but Llewyn could not give the change, and she told me that Andrews wanted some linen drapery goods, and she said she knew a person she could recommend him to, and she came down to ask me if I would take the bill, and give him the change for about ten or twelve pounds worth of goods, and give him the difference? I told her if the bill was good I would take it, then they went back again, and in about an hour or an hour and half after they came again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they shewn you that bill? - No, they had not, Andrews had the bill; in about an hour after they all three came down, and Andrews shewed me the bill, of forty-five pounds four shillings, on Sir

            ; then I told Andrews that I would take the bill; but at the time that he was looking out the goods, I sent my young man to a banking house, to know if the bill was good; and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160063"></xptr>answer was, that the bill was a very good one; then I gave him the difference of the bill, thirty two pounds twelve shillings, he had twelve guineas worth of goods; then they went away. The next morning I went to the banking house, and took the bill for payment, and they told me that the bill had been stolen, and they would not pay it.</p>
               <p>Jury. You took the bill yourself? - I did; I was asked up to Sir

            , and I informed him where I took the bill, and I was coming out of the banking house, and I saw Worth through the window, passing by the door, and I went out and collared him, and I told Worth, that the bill I took of him yesterday was not a good one, and it had been stolen, and he told me that he knew nothing at all about it; and he was taken up before Sir Benjamin-Hammet, and examined before him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Worth was examined before Sir Benjamin as a magistrate? - Sir Benjamin swore me, and him likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mrs. Powell came, she represented the whole business, as laying with Andrews, and Worth as having no intent in it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that she represented in the presence of Worth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Worth ever claim any property in the bill, or having any thing to do with it? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. After Mrs. Llewyn had made this representation to you, then Andrews came and produced the bill? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did Andrews stay with you while you was treating for these things? - Full three quarters of an hour; he staid all the while my young man went to the banking house and back again to inquire after the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. It had never happened to you to hear of its being a stolen bill till the day after? - To be sure; if I had I should not have taken it. (The bill produced.) This is the bill; Sir

               <p>Q. Were you the last person that came out of the room? - I was.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Andrews. On Saturday, the 7th of April, I accompanied my wife, by her desire, into St. Giles's, to the Red Lion, to see her daughter, she wanted to speak to her; within a few doors of St. Giles's my wife let go my arm, and she told me that she see a paper laying, which she thought to be a pawnbroker's duplicate, and she picked it up, and it proved to be a bill or a note wrapped up in this piece of red paper; that was about one o'clock in the day.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160064"></xptr>Q. Where did it happen, do you say? - Going into Broad-street, about five doors going out of Holborn into St. Giles's, on the right hand side; then we went to the Red Lion, and I opened the paper and looked at it, and I did not know what the circumstances were, not the value of it; I called for a pint of beer and told my wife I would go to Mr. Palmer's, an acquaintance of mine, whom I supposed might tell me what it was; I went directly to the Joiners Arms, Westminster-row, and there I see Mr. Palmer, and delivered him the bill, and told how I came by it; he told me he did not think it a matter of any great consequence, for very few tradesmen did chuse to be troubled with them; and he had it in his custody till eleven o'clock that same night. I never see any advertisement or ever heard of any, and kept it almost three weeks, and shewed it to a number of people, I suppose a hundred had sight of it. I happened to shew it to a person one day, and they told me they thought the bill was worth all the money, and they blamed me for not changing it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this bill in question? - Yes; Andrews brought it to me, I think on the 7th of March, Saturday afternoon, he told me his wife had found it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did he bring it to you? - I suppose because I was the only person that he knew; and I shewed it to several different people when he was by, and went into the parlour and shewed the company there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any question about its goodness or badness? - I told him that it was a bill that I would not take for my master, and I would not have any concern with bills of that sort, because I had orders to the contrary; I think I told him that the bill was not worth a shilling, I am very sure I did.</p>
               <p>Q. However, he shewed it publickly? - Yes, he did many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he leave it with you at all? - Yes, I think I got it for an hour in the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Would you employ him again? - Certainly I would. He is a very steady workman, very industrious; he has four children.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been employed under Mr. Meymott? - Ever since the 27th of October last.</p>
               <p>Q. What till he was taken up? - No, I believe he was out of work because of the hard frost, we could not get timber up the river.</p>

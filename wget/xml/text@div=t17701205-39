             the elder. I am mother to the child that has been abused; she was ten years old the fifth of October. The day after St. Luke's day she drew beer for Mr. Ivory. Her master came down to the place where I work to acquaint me that my child had been abused by the prisoner. I went to her; she was in a bad condition; her private parts were swelled to a great degree, and there was blood and nastiness upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear as if a man had lain with her?</p>
               <p>Matthews. She did; she has been at the hospital for the force. Mr. Gloster, the surgeon, examined her, but he would not come to give evidence without I subpoena'd him, and it was not in my power to subpoena him. I am a very poor woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the child tell you how she came to be in that condition?</p>
               <p>Matthews. She told me the prisoner threatened to kill her if she told it to any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any disease upon her besides the force?</p>
               <p>Matthews. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Matthews. I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had your girl been there to draw beer?</p>
               <p>Matthews. Near six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. She is very young, but I suppose you have taught her her catechism and the like?</p>
               <p>Matthews. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You being a married woman, now having examined the child, can you take upon you to sware that she had been laid with by a man?</p>
               <p>Matthews. I found her body so that she must have been lain with by a man.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray is there not a boy draws beer at this house.</p>

             the younger. I draw beer at Mr. Ivory's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the nature of an oath. Now if you was to sware that which is not true, what do you think would become of you?</p>
               <p>Matthews. I should go to hell. The prisoner lodged at my master's: one morning when my master had called me, I opened the door to answer him; the prisoner bursted into the room; he said if I cried out he would knock me down and kill me that minute; he flung me down upon the bed, and put his private parts into my belly; he hurt me very much, and their was blood and nastiness came from me; he said if I told any thing of it, he would kill me that minute. I was afraid to tell my master or mistress for fear of losing my place, and my daddy and mammy beating me.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050024"></xptr>Q. Did you perceive any thing come from him?</p>

               <p>Matthews. Almost six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it?</p>
               <p>Matthews. The maid went away on Thursday night, this was done on Friday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lie with the maid before?</p>
               <p>Matthews. Yes. After he had done what he pleased with me, he said if I told any body of it, he would kill me, and then he went out of the room. About a day or two afterwards, I went into his room in the morning for his candlestick; I was to get them out of all the lodgers rooms to clean: he took his candlestick up and flung it at me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer to use you so again?</p>
               <p>Matthews. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you tell of it?</p>
               <p>Matthews. I was afraid to tell; the maid found it out by the sheets.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after was that?</p>
               <p>Matthews. I don't know rightly: my master can tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after his throwing the candlestick at you?</p>
               <p>Matthews. About three days after that, the maid went up to make the bed, and found the sheets in a bad condition. I was out a getting in the pots; when I came in my mistress asked me what was the matter with me; I did not know what to say; I told her at last; my master went directly to my mummy; she came and examined me; and then we went before the justice.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a boy at your master's at that time, that drew beer?</p>
               <p>Matthews. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lie by yourself any time?</p>
               <p>Matthews. Yes, every time my master had no maid.</p>
               <p>Q. How often had the maid lain with you before she discovered the nastiness you speak of upon the sheets.</p>
               <p>Matthews. Two nights.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Ivory: I came there on Wednesday the seventh of last month; I lay along with this girl that night. When I made the bed the next morning, I found the under sheet in a very bad situation; it was all over matter; I did not know what might have happened; I took no manner of notice, but when I went to make the prisoner's bed, I found it in the same condition, only not so bad as hers. Finding the sheets in that condition, I turned the feet part up to the head to lay myself and the child clean. Not knowing what it was, next morning I found it a great deal worse all where the child lay; I went directly and acquainted my mistress with it; being a mother of children, it shocked me very much. I desired her to examine the child, for I was afraid somebody had injured her. My mistress came up and saw the situation the sheets were in from the running. The place on the sheets was as broad as the palm of my hand; the matter was yellow and white. My mistress<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050025"></xptr> asked her what was the matter with her; she bursted out a crying and said, it was the children. She said he burssed into her room and threw her upon the bed, and told her if she resisted he would kill her. Her shift stood alone with matter</p>

            . I examined the child on the nineteenth of November last, in the presence of Mr. Howard, Mr. Gloster, and the house surgeon of the Infirmary. We found upon inspection of the parts, that there was a discharge; we did not take it to be venereal, but the fluor albus; there did not seem to be any mark of violation, on the contrary, the hymen, which is the test of virginity, was almost entire; the passage was very straight.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hymen partly broke?</p>
               <p>Purdue. Only that part that generally breaks to allow for the fluor albus to issue through; the passage was so straight as hardly to receive a finger. I had a letter from the commanding officer of the regiment to examine the prisoner, who was said to have the foul distemper. I went to him to Tothill Fields Bridewell, and I examined him and found him intirely sound. I examined him the eighteenth, the day before I examined the girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath do you, or do you not, believe that she had been entered and defiled?</p>
               <p>Purdue. I think it was impossible; I believe she had never been defiled.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear as if there had been any attempt of that sort?</p>
               <p>Purdue. I did not see any thing of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no swelling, or any other signs?</p>
               <p>Purdue. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But this was a month afterwards?</p>
               <p>Purdue. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not all these symptoms have disappeared in a month's time?</p>
               <p>Purdue. If there was any inflammation or swelling, it would have disappeared in that time. If she had been entered, I should have imagined the passsage would have been much more open than I found it: the passage must have been more open if she had been entered by a man.</p>
               <p>Q. If all the swelling that was occasioned by the force had disappeared, could you form a sufficient judgement, whether she had or not been known by a man?</p>
               <p>Purdue. To the best of my judgment I think she had never been defiled: the hymen, as I said before, which is the test of virginity, was most intire.</p>
               <p>Q. It must be a complete month between the act done and your inspection: you have heard the act. Might the swellings and the appearances of force have disappeared in that time?</p>
               <p>Purdue. I should think it might; I should think she never could have been penetrated by any man: the discharge was quite a vicid: when I saw it, it had the appearance of the fluor albus, not of the venereal infection. I am certain there had been no laceration from the beginning, for if there had there must have been some mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the fluor albus incident to all ages of the female sex?</p>
               <p>Purdue. Yes, more or less.</p>

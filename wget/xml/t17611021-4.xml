               <p>Q. How came you to see him then?</p>
               <p>E. Taylor. I saw him look over into our house; my mother lives at Hornsey, and takes in washing; she is very lame, and very hard of hearing; I fetch cloaths for her to wash, and carry them back again. About three in the afternoon, on the 24th of last month, we were drinking of tea, I heard the fall of something like a key; I went to the gate, and turning my head, missed the things mentioned; I ran and saw the head of a man, but he going down the hill, I lost sight of his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the things taken from?</p>
               <p>E. Taylor. From off of a pair of chest of drawers; I had just ironed them; I called for help, and

             and I were half an hour looking about for the man, knowing he could not be got far. At last we found the prisoner hid in a ditch, and all the things tied up in a handkerchief, and a hat laying by the things. He owned the hat to be his, and said, he thought the parcel was a quantity of apples, and that another man had given them to him. We found him but a very little way from my mother's house.

               <p>As I came along by the side of the house, a man had got this bundle, tying it up in a handkerchief; he asked me if I would go along with him, and I should have half of what he had.

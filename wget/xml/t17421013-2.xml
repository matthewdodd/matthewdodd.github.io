Says she, I will give you a Dram. I said I would not have any. She whipt my Bundle out of my Hand, ran up Stairs, and I ran after her; she called a Woman up with a Quartern of Gin, and said, Damn you, you shall not have it under Six-pence. So I came out of the House. Mr Dickerson's Man, seeing I was robbed, sent me a Shilling to get a Warrant, and I took her up; When we got her to the Cross-Daggers, she said she would send for the Things if I would make it up; and the Things were brought, but I would not make it up; this was three or four Hours afterwards.</p>

I asked him to give me a Dram; we had a Quartern of Gin, which he would not pay<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174210130003"></xptr> for, for he said he had no Money; if he had no Money, why should he go up Stairs? There was three Half-pence due for Gin, and he said he would leave them for that. <rs id="t17421013-2-verdict9" type="verdictDescription">

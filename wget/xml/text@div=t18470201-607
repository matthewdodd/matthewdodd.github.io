                  </hi>. I live at Lee, in Kent, and am a plumber, in the service of Mr. Catherine Church, who is a widow—the prisoner was in her service about fourteen days—he had 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he was in her service on 11th Jan., when he was sent to Morden College, Blackheath, to do a job—on that day the policeman showed me 15<hi rend="italic">lbs.</hi> of lead, and 9<hi rend="italic">lbs.</hi> of solder—I ex<lb></lb>amined it, and, to all appearance, I believe it to be Mr. Church's—I ex<lb></lb>amined the bar of solder particularly—there are some indentations on it, which I recognize—here are the same indentations on this other bar, which I have brought with me from the premises, which is of the same shape and quality—the prisoner had received such a bar of solder to work on the pre<lb></lb>ceding</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber, and live in the Broadway, Deptford. On Monday evening, 11th Jan., the prisoner came to my shop about half-past five o'clock, with a basket—he emptied the contents, which was lead and solder, on my cutting-board—I had some conversation with him—he asked me if I would but it—he said he had been at work for a lady at Charlton, that he lived in the Minories, and he was tired of carrying it fur<lb></lb>ther—I asked him if it was his property—he said, "Yes, I will give you one of my cards"—while he was doing that the policeman came in, and took pos<lb></lb>session of the lead and solder and him.</p>

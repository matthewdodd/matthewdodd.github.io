                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of Spencer-place, Goswell-road—last Monday, in consequence of information from Mr. Hall, I went to his shop, at 29, St. John-street, about half-past one o'clock in the afternoon—the pri<lb></lb>soner was behind the counter, serving—I saw a female there, purchasing some black velvet and trimmings—I saw the prisoner cut off the goods, and deliver them to her—he gave her two bills—she said one was to show her customer—one was for the velvet and buttons, the other for the trimmings—I saw her gire him some money, but I did not see the coin—before the prisoner gave her the bills, I saw him band them to another shopman, who returned them to him, and he gave them to the customer—he did not take the bills to the cashier—I saw him give the customer some change, but I could not see what—she made a remark, "You have given me a shilling short"—he said" No, my good lady, there <hi rend="italic">was</hi> the trimmings"—she said, "Yes, so there <hi rend="italic">was"</hi>—she turned to me, and I said, "Every one is liable to make a mistake"—I was the next customer the prisoner served—I bought some gambroon—I paid him for it, and he gave me this invoice, which is stamped—he went to the cashier with this—when the purchase was made by the lady, he did not make any entry in his book in my presence—I was watching him—he did not make any counterfoil—when I had the transaction with him, there was an entry made in his book, and he went to the cashier and brought me the bill stamped.</p>

When a customer comes, a bill is made out, and the shopman makes an entry of the number of the transaction in his book, and makes a bill and counterfoil, takes them to the cashier, leaves the counterfoil and money with the cashier, gets the bill stamped, and takes it back to the customer—that is the regular practice—I was in the shop on 22d Oct.—the prisoner handed to me a bill of some black velvet and trimming that he had sold to a woman—the amount was 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and some odd pence—Mr. Adlington was in the shop—I signed the bill, and gave it back to the prisoner—he handed it to the lady—she said, "This is not right"—he said, "Yes it is; 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. makes 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Mr. Cowtan was the cashier then in the box—he is not the regular cashier—he acts only while the regular cashier goes to dinner—while Mr. Cowtan was at the desk I sold an article amounting to 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I desired the prisoner to make that entry in his book, as I am not accustomed to serve in the shop; when I do, I get a young man to enter it—that was immedi<lb></lb>ately before the transaction with the lady.</p>

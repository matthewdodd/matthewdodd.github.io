                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live with my mother in Vauxhall-square, Lambeth. On Tuesday, the 80th of March, I received six sovereigns from Mr. Carter, of Leadenhall-street, which were due to my husband—I had a glass of spirits, and being a stranger in London, I missed my way—I met the prisoner in Holborn, and asked her to show me the way to Blackfriars-bridge—she said she would—I thought it very kind, and asked her if she would take something—she said she would—she had a glass of gin—seeing me with money, I suppose she was induced, instead of taking me over Blackfriars-bridge, to take me to a house in St. Giles's—I did not know the name of the place till next day—she insisted on my going to bed—I was afraid to say I would go out, never being in such a place before—I was frightened—I put my pocket under my head, with the rest of my clothes—the prisoner turned her back, and I counted my money—I had my six sovereigns all right then—the prisoner slept in the same bed, and she was the only person in the room—next morning when I awoke, the prisoner was gone—I called "Ann"—she had told me her name was Ann—another woman came into the room—the said she would go and fetch her, which she did, and when she came into the room, she had my bonnet and cloak on—I took my stays from under the cloak, and the lace was gone—we were in the first floor room—I asked them to show me the way home—they insisted that I should not go till I had taken a glass of rum—they gave me something which had the appearance of rum—the moment I drank it I fell asleep—my boots were taken off my feet —when I awoke, I found an old pair on my feet—a woman was in the room—I asked her for the prisoner—she said she would take me to her—I went up stairs, but she was no where to be found—I then bribed a girl to go to my mother, and she returned with a friend, and a pair of boots—I then went to the station, and gave information—I missed my money when I awoke in the morning—I got my bonnet and cloak back again from the prisoner—it was after that that I fell asleep, and had my boots taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner, on the 31st of March, at No. 3, Buckeridge-street, St. Giles—she was lying on the bed, drunk—I found a pair of boots in the adjoining room on the left, and the stays were given me on the first floor.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Harp public-house, in George-street, St. Giles. On Wednesday, the 31st of March, the prisoner came to my house and called for half-a-pint of gin, to be put into a bottle to take with her—I changed a sovereign for her—she gave the money back to me to keep for her—she treated half a dozen people at the front of the bar—she came again in half an hour for another half-pint of gin, and changed another so<lb></lb>vereign—she treated the people again, and left the remainder of the change with me—in the course of the day she came again and asked for some of the change—I gave her some, but not all, as she was tipsy—she came three or four times in the course of the day, and at last reduced it to 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge at No. 3, Buckeridge-street, in the lower apartment.

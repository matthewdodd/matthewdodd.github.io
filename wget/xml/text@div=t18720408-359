               <p>Lane—I know the prisoner—he is a tinker and plater—he deals in all kinds of goods, the same as I do—I was in Cutler Street, Houndsditch, on 21st February—a man came up and said "Will you buy some plated goods?"—I said "Let me look at them"—it was about 3.30 or 4 o'clock—I saw they were damaged goods—I said "I am no judge of them, there is a man of the name of Charles Turner, who is a tinker and plater; he is a better judge of them than I am; he might purchase them of you"—I told him where Turner lived, and he went away—the goods were in a coarse bag—I did not see any case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The man said he got them in the country in exchange for crockeryware—I knew Turner, a long while ago, at Aldershott—I go down to the barracks and buy soldiers' clothes and different things—that was three years and a half ago—I have never sent persons round to him before—I know him to be a hardworking man—I don't know where he was last September—I never heard—I was in Manchester myself then—I did not know that he was at Guildhall then—I have never been a witness before—my character is well known—I am well known by the police as being a hardworking industrious man—I am a general dealer, and deal in anything I can get a living out of—we stand in Houndsditch, and any one who comes with goods we ask if they have got anything to sell.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am a pickle merchant, at 33, Christopher Street, Finsbury—I know Turner—I supply him with pickles, such as onions and mixed pickles—his <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> transacts the business in the shop that I deal with, and I have been in the habit occasionally of buying a funnell or dripping-pan, or something of that kind—the prisoner is a dealing man—I have known his wife five or six years; but I have only known him six or seven months—he lives about ten minutes' walk from me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am in a large way in the pickling business—the prisoner carries on his business next door to the chandler's shop, which his wife carries on—I don't know where he was last September.</p>

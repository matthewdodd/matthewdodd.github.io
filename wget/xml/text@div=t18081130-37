               <p>Q. Nobody but you and the women - A. The watchman came in, but I did not give him any thing to drink; we went down a street, which I believe is Arlington street, and there I stood talking with Webb a considerable time against a door; she rumaged about me a good deal, and when I left her I came into Piccadilly, to my lodgings in Park lane; on crossing the street, by the porter's lodge, I clapped my hand to my side and missed the book; I had it in a side pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you perceive it after you took it out at the public house - A. I put it into my pocket again; I had not felt it after I left the public house; I went again up Piccadilly, a woman ran against me; she said my dear where are you going.</p>

               <p>Q. That is another woman, neither of the prisoner - A. No; I told her to go about her business; I was robbed of my book; at the very moment there was a man passing whom I did not know at that time; I went home to my lodgings; I saw no more of them that night; the next morning I was sitting in my own room in my lodgings, there came two people to enquire for me; they told me they had found a letter that I had respecting a horse; they asked me if I had not been robbed the over night; I told them I had and of what, and that they were in a book, and a letter I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they produce any thing to you - A. They shewed me the ten pound notes and a letter that I had from lord Titchfield, respecting a horse; I cleaned myself and went along with them to Bow street; the prisoners were there; I knew

            . I am a publican, I keep the Blue Post, Bennet street, the corner of Arlington street. The prisoners all three came into my tap room about twelve o'clock and called for a shillingsworth of brandy and water; they tendered a one pound note for the payment of it; I changed that; they sent for a second shillingsworth; I sent the change, eighteen shillings; I went to the tap room myself, I found the watchman there; I told him he must go, he had no business in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the watchman there, is that the prisoner - A. Yes; he said he would go. I returned to my bar; he did not go then; I went and ordered him out a second time; before they went they had half a pint of brandy and shrub; they tendered another one pound note for it, which I refused.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who it was that tendered it - A. I think the watchman, but I am not positive: my waiter came to me, and said sir, I think them women have been robbing some man, I have seen them shoving notes down their bosom; in consequence of what the waiter said I went into the parlour, I picked up a letter, I opened it, it was not sealed, which led to a suspicion that some person had been robbed; it is the letter the first witness has been speaking of.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Is that the letter that you had - A. Yes; that is the letter I lost.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hollings. The prisoners all went out; I sent for them, saying I would change the one pound note; they all three came back; the watchman said as soon as he came into the house, I had no occasion of being in such a hurry to turn them out, they should have spent a crown or more before they had left; I told them they should spend none there, they had robbed some one, I would detain them and have them searched; they denied having robbed any one or having any money about them except a few shillings; they seemed very much frightened. The prisoner Coddington, that was just now convicted at that bar, came in with them the second time.

               <p>Prosecutor. I am perfectly sure it is my pocket book.</p>
               <p>Webb's Defence. I had been to Bond street with a gentleman, he gave me a pound note, a guinea, and half a guinea, to get me some clothes. I met this woman, I gave her something drink; I met the watchman; I had a shilling's worth of brandy and water. This gentlewoman said she had picked up some notes in Oxford street; she gave one to the watchman to get it changed. The publican said he could not give change. As for that man, I never saw him before with my eyes till I saw him at Bow street. I am as innocent as a child unborn.</p>
               <p>Worley's Defence. The notes which the runner took from me in the house I picked up in Market street, before I saw this good woman. I told her I would treat her with something if the watchman would get change for a one pound note; the landlord said he could not give change: when we came out he sent his boy after us, saying that he could his change. We went back; the officer stood for no repairs; he took them out of my bosom. As for the gentleman that came to swear against me, I never saw him till I saw him at Bow street.</p>
               <p>Abbot's Defence. I was calling eleven o'clock. I went up to the White Horse cellar to put up the shutters; these two ladies went into the public house with a man, he asked me to come and have a glass, being a cold night; I went in, I asked who was going to give me a glass; mother Worley said the gentleman has altered his mind, he will not give you one; I went out of the house and put up the shutters. I went in and asked the mistress of the White Horse cellar what time I should ring the bell, she said half past three. I went and called twelve o'clock. Going my round I saw these girls: one of them says come over, I will give you something to drink at the Blue Post; I immediately went out of my box; this girl asked me to get change, and to get something to drink, she said let it be short and sweet; she asked me to call for a shillingsworth of rum and water; I gave it her; I never set down after she gave me the note. Mr. Hollings gave me a half guinea, a seven shilling piece, and a sixpence. Mother Worley said I will have change; I told her the landlord would not give her change; I returned the note back; the landlord ordered us out the second time; I went out directly; the girls followed me. Going up Arlington street, the landlord sent after me to bring these girls back; when we came back, he said to me which of the girls gave you the first pound note; I said Poll Webb; and who gave you the second pound note, I said Worley; he said he had a good mind to keep us all prisoners, he should keep the girls prisoners and turn the watchman out to do his duty. I did my duty till past two o'clock, when the patrol took me. I walked quietly with him to the watchhouse.</p>

               <p>Abbot called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Webb and Worley called no witnesses to their character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouse keeper to Mr. John Robinson, of Nassau-place, Commercial-road. On the night of the 8th of Novem<lb></lb>ber, the prisoner came into the warehouse and produced this note—I took it and asked him where he came from—he said a gentleman at the corner of the street gave him the note to bring in, and that he was to give him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for his trouble, and said very likely he would have a parcel to bring away—I sent for a constable—Mr. Vesper deals with us for articles such as are expressed in this note—(<hi rend="italic">note read</hi>)—"13, Sidney-place. Sir,—Send by bearer, 2 best pilot or Petersham coats and trowsers, four or five sizes, blue or brown. Addressed to Mr. Robinson. (Signed) <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS VESPER</hi>."</p>

He deals with Mr. Robinson for clothes, such as are described in this note—I write all his orders—I never knew him to write one himself—this writing is similar to that of a young man who lived in our employment, but who was discharged nine months since—I believe it to be his—it is not mine, nor my master's—I have seen my master write for the last ten years—I do not know the prisoner—our house is half a mile from the prosecutor's.</p>

The prisoner was given into my charge at Mr. Robinson's warehouse, at half-past seven o'clock in the evening—he said he was ordered by the man who stood at the corner of the street to go into the shop and deliver this note, and perhaps he would have a parcel to bring, and he would give him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for doing so—I was on duty not far from the shop—I saw no man, but he had time to walk off if he had been there.</p>

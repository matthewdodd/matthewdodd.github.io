                  </hi>. I am a retired sea officer, and live at 4, York-place, Walworth-road—about 4 o'clock, on 21st October, I was disturbed by a violent ringing of my bell—I got up, looked out of window, and saw two men running down my garden—at the end of the garden there is a wall which keeps it from the mews—I hastened down as fast as I could, and followed the persons with a sword in my hand—they jumped over the wall—I called out "Policeman!" and he said, "I have got him"—I then went back to the house—I found the staircase-window open—it looks on to the roof of a water-closet—by getting on to that water-closet a person could get from the garden into my house through that window—the window was shut when I went to bed, but not fastened—this caddy-spoon produced by the policeman was in the tea-caddy that night, another spoon was some-there in the parlour, and the gloves were lying on the parlour-table—they are my property—one spoon has not been found.</p>

I went to where the policeman says he took me; I was lying there asleep, and he took hold of my collar, and pulled me on my legs.</p>

            . On the morning of the 18th of July I came down stairs a little before eight o'clock, and not finding my breakfast ready I walked out as far as Blackfriers bridge. and returned soon after eight; as I was coming down King-street to my own house I saw my young man, who was left in charge of the warehouse, pass me very swiftly, returning home; I hastened my pace in order to see what was the matter, as I found he was ringing the bell very hard before I could come to the door to ask him the question; he came towards me and told me that we had been robbed: I asked him who, and where; he said come along. I have just now left the two thieves in Cheapside; I went with him into Cheapside, he told me he had left them under Bow church clock; he said come along; I hastened with him up Cheapside, and on looking down Bow-lane the young man pointed out the two prisoners at the bar as the men. We followed them from Bow-lane into Basing-lane; seeing the two prisoners go into a public house called the Red Lion, the corner of Red Lion-court, Basing-lane, I immediately sent the young man to get a constable; he did so, and we went in and apprehended the two prisoners drinking together out of one glass. We found no goods upon them; the goods were dropped at our own door.</p>

            . On Tuesday morning, the 18th of July, at the house, 36, King-street, Cheapside; it is the corner house of Trump-street; that warehouse has two doors in it, one in Trump-street and one in King-street; I took the shutters down in the morning; I always make it a rule to secure the Trump-street door. On my sweeping the dirt out of King-street warehouse door, when I had swept the dirt off the pavement, I came in the warehouse, I heard a person rustling at Trump-street door, I went immediately and opened the door, leaving the King-street door open. On opening the door the prisoner

             asked me for a person of the name of Corbett; I then said that I knew no such person thereabouts; he then said the firm was Corbett and co.; I still said that I knew no such person thereabouts; then he said he had got a direction in his pocket, he wanted me to read it for him, but he made an excuse, said he could not find it. In the mean time I heard a rustling noise at King-street warehouse door, which I had left open, I turned myself round and saw the prisoner Wilson conveying some printed cottons out of the warehouse, from off the pile which lay on the counter in the warehouse; I called out to him, who is there? and before I could leave the Trump-street door I saw the prisoner Wilson come round the Trump-street door to go into the market, from the King-street door, without the goods; by seeing him and knowing him to be the same person I saw conveying the cottons out of King-street warehouse door, I asked him what he wanted there, he turned himself round and said he wanted a person of the name of Smith; they then both were at the Trump-street door, I immediately secured the Trump-street door and went to seek for the property I was left in care of. On my going out of King-street warehouse door I saw the eight pieces of cotton lay by the King-street door, on the pavement, with two or three ends lodging against the threshold of the door; I picked up the goods, brought them in, and laid them on the counter; I secured both the doors of the warehouse and put the key into my own pocket, I then went and stood in the private doorway and saw the prisoner Wilson standing at the bottom of the street; in the Crossway of Cateaton street, looking up the street, with his back to Guildhall, I went up stairs to get my hat, I came down stairs, went down the street, I saw neither of them; I then went into Cateaton-street, and made my way into Cheapside; I saw Wilson and Simpson nearly under the clock of Bow church, in company with a Jew, with a bag under his arm; they were all talking together; I then hastened into King-street as quick as possible; I was ringing the bell very violently, finding no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180909200011"></xptr>person in the warehouse I turned myself round I met Mr. Bloomfield close to the door, I told him that we had been robbed, and wished him to hasten with me, that I had left the two men in Cheapside; we pursued after them and found the two men in Basing-lane; they stood there about a minute or two, they went into the Red Lion public house in Basing-lane. I went and got a constable; we went into the public house, I gave charge of them both, they were taken to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. The goods that were taken out, were they your master's goods - A. Yes; I can swear to the goods; they were all of one pile laying on the counter.

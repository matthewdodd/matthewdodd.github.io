He asked if Hopkins was there—I said no, he was gone away long ago—he had a glass of something, and then went into the yard—I thought he was gone out—a person came and inquired for him, and my wife said, "He is in the yard"—I went and called, "Is any body there?"—no one answered—I got a light, and as I went past the privy the door was slammed to—I went past, and the person who was in the privy got out—I then went to the privy, and the place was all strewed with feathers—I went to the stable, and missed the fowls—I got two policemen and went to the prisoner's house—I asked what he had done with the fowls—he said he knew nothing about them—in about ten minutes they found the fowls, dead.</p>

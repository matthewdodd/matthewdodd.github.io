Of late I had missed a great number of penny pieces at different times, from the top of a chest of drawers in my own bed-room; they were all piled up in shillingsworths. On Tuesday night, the 12th of this month, I was watching for the prisoner's coming up in the room adjoining, which my servant sleeps in; he came up stairs into his own room, and, after pulling off his shoes and stockings, he came into my room; his room is at one end of a passage, about four yards long, and my room is at the other end; his door is to the left, and mine to the right; he went in without any hesitation round the bed to the drawers where the penny pieces were; I had the door open a little way exactly behind him; he took one shillingsworth, and put it into his right hand pocket; he then took a second shillingsworth, and he was putting it into his pocket, I jumped out upon him; they were piled up in shillingsworths, there were twenty-six shillingsworths in a row, and the odd shillingsworth was at the end; I said, Charles, is it possible that it is you that have been robbing me; I should as soon have thought my own father would have robbed me as you; I then called my wife, and she came up; she then called up my servant,

            ; I said, Betty, you are now convinced I have not complained of losing money without occasion, and I have now caught the thief; I told him to go to bed, and I would talk to him in the morning; he strongly denied having taken any before; I had missed two shillingsworth the Sunday before, but I should have told you that I insisted upon his putting back the shillingsworth out of his pocket; he put them out of his pocket without any resistance on to the drawers; he went out in the morning to work as usual, at a dye-house in Old-street-square; he was a soldier twenty-three years in the guards, he was discharged last May; he returned in the evening, and I sent for him; I asked him what he thought of the business that happened last night; he said, he did not think any thing about it; I was talking to him about it, and about the girl having given warning in consequence of it, knowing herself innocent; I told him if he would only lay down the four shillings that I could swear had been taken within a night or two, and go away quietly, and never let me see him again, he might; he said, he would not; and I sent him to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q.(To the Prosecutor.) Had you a clock in that room? - A. Yes; but there was a dial in the taproom that went very right, and he had a clock in his own room.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH RILEY sworn. - I am servant to the last witness; when I went up stairs I saw the prisoner with some penny pieces in his hand that were on the drawers; he said, he had never taken any before.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I did not touch them at all; I had some penny pieces in my pocket of my own, and he took them from me; he said, if I would give him four shillings, I might go about my bu<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200061"></xptr>siness, and I would not; it is a spiteful thing of him. <rs id="t17990220-58-verdict304" type="verdictDescription">

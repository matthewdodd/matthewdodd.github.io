I told her I understood she had picked up a purse containing my money - I never got it again; it was a dark blue purse - I could swear to it if I saw it; I cannot tell how near she was to me when I dropped it.</p>

            . I am going on for nine years of age; I saw the prosecutrix and the prisoner there - I saw the purse drop a little way from the gutter - the prisoner took it up, and put it into her apron; the prosecutrix was six or seven doors off - I went and asked her if she had dropped any thing; the purse was near the colour of my hat - the prisoner put it into her apron.</p>

            . I live with a pawnbroker. The prisoner redeemed several articles from his shop on the day in question, and paid me a sovereign; I had known her before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had left my house at half-past nine o'clock; I went to the pawnbroker's, and took a half-sovereign, not a sovereign - I got a few things out for my child - this woman asked me if I had picked up a purse; I said No; the lad then said the woman was like me, but not me, she had a blue gown on.</p>

I was in my counting-house, and he was in the shop; I heard the till rattle, as if it were shut - I came out, and saw the prisoner behind the counter- I suspected he had something; I sent him out of the shop, and as he went out I thought he stooped, as if he were depositing something; when he was gone out I looked at the spot and saw three shillings, with a piece of bacon covered over them - I took out my knife, marked the shillings, and left them there; I went into the counting-house, and as the prisoner came in I saw the bacon move - I went and the three shillings were gone - I asked where the three shillings were; he said he had not had them - a young man came in. and said he would go for an officer; the prisoner said, "Pray don't," and he gave me three shillings out of his mouth; I suppose they had come from the till, by the rattle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Is that your only reason for supposing they came from the till? A. Yes- I had not counted the money in the till; I suppose they were mine - I said I would blow his brains out if he did not give me the money, but he did not give it to me till the man said he would go for an officer.</p>

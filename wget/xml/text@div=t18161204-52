            . I am the wife of John Podd, who lives in the Curtain-road. I missed the notes on the 27th of October. I lodged with the prisoner. The notes were in a small box, which was in a chest in my room; I had seen them on the 19th. I had a lodging in the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. There were other lodgers. I never left any body in my room. I saw them seven days before I missed them. The 10l. note was No.577.</p>

On the 31st of October, about ten minutes to seven o'clock in the evening one of Pickford's vans was at in the inn - I saw this hest of tea put into it to go to Mr. Huntress, of Gospeloak; I saw the prisoner come and take it out of the van, and asked what he was going to do with it - he said to carry it into the office; he took it up the yard, and I thought he was going to the office, and that he might belong to it or something - he walked up the yard with it, and some how concealed himself in the yard, for I missed him, on going into the office to give the clerk an account of another van which was loading; in about five or ten minutes the watchman of the gate reported that the chest of tea was gone out of the yard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.What height was the van from the ground? A. I should think from three to four feet; it was the usual height.</p>
               <p>JOHN BUNTING. I am a watchman of Pickford's yard. On the 31st of October, about ten minutes before seven o'clock, I met the prisoner coming out of the yard with a chest of tea on his shoulder - I was at the gateway, and asked where he was going with it; he said to Deacon's, which I thought meant the White Horse - I let him pass, followed him into the street, and stopped him again; he said he had left seven chests in the yard, and should have left but six, and was taking this back - I let him go, believing him; I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Look at me. Witness. I am certain of you- I first stopped you under the gas-light, and next time about ten yards further; I went up the yard to inquire, but did not see you again.</p>
               <p>JOHN HOLMAN. I am a porter at Pickford's. On this Saturday night I saw the prisoner in Wood-street, with a chest of tea on his back, just opposite Bull's Head-passage - he crossed the road; I went over, and he threw it off his back into the passage - I do not know whether he saw me; he ran away as fast as he could, and I after him calling Stop thief! he was caught in Noble-street - I am sure he is the man; I saw him taken - the tea was there when we returned, and the officer took it.</p>
               <p>JAMES TOMKINS. I am an officer. I was going up Love-lane, and saw the prisoner coming down Wood-street with a chest of tea on his shoulder - I watched him; he turned into Bull's Head-passage, and threw it on our feet - Holman pursued him calling Stop thief! he was stopped in Noble-street - I am sure he is the man.</p>

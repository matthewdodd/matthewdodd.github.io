               <p>EDWARD EVANS. I was at the Adam and Eve, public-house, Westminster, on the 5th of September - I went from home about twelve o'clock, and remained at the public-house the rest of the day; I was not very much in liquor, and I left my friend who I had been with, at half-past seven o'clock in the evening; I had some money on my person - I had never seen the prisoner before I was at Queen-square-office; I do not know how I got into her company.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You had 2s. 6d. in the office the next morning, and you told the gentleman you had lost no money.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not know that you had more money then than you had the next morning at the office? A. Yes; my landlord brought me half-a-crown that morning.</p>

            . On the 5th of September, I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor; he appeared to be in liquor, but appeared to have been extremely ill-used; he was quite stupified from the effects of the usage; the prisoner was accompanied by three young men and a boy about ten years of age - she placed the prosecutor against a door, and supported his head with her left hand, while she put her right hand into his breeches pocket, and passed something to the boy, who made off; she then put her hand again into his left hand pocket; I watched her; she changed her position, and put her right hand before his eyes, and put her left hand into his breeches pocket; I saw her put something in her bosom; I went and asked her if she was his wife; she said No - I went and told a grocer, who came out, and said it was a pity there was not a street-keeper about - I went on to Shetton-ground, and when I returned I saw three youths ill-treating the prosecutor in a most barbarous manner; the prisoner had his hat in her hand, partly concealed by her apron; I went up and remonstrated with them - I was afterwards desired to give my address, which I did; the prisoner ran off as soon as she knew there were officers coming.</p>

            . I am the officer. I came up and took the prisoner, who was running away; I found 2s. in her bosom; she said she had some money which she brought out to buy something.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the house where the prosecutor was drinking, and my friend sat down by him; he gave us some beer to drink; he had half-a-crown, and said he had pawned his coat for 6s., and had no more left- he then got up to go and he fell into the sink; I raised him up and set him against the wall, and told her to mind him while I went to get him some water; when I got back his hat was off, and I put it on his head.</p>
               <p>COURT to EVANS. Q. Did you pawn your coat that morning? A. Yes, for 6s.; I had but 1s. 11d. in the morning, and thought that not enough; I was sober then, and I went to the Adam and Eve with my friend, and we drank several pints of beer together; I then left him to go home; I was not so tipsy till I was knocked down and ill-treated.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Orchard public-house at Black wall; the prisoner was my pot-man. On the 26th of June, between one and two o'clock in the day, I wanted the prisoner, and went to the pot-house where the pots were cleaned, he was not there—I then went to the cellar—(the prisoner had no business there at that time)—I heard a chopping, and law him on his knees, behind a pile of wood in the corner of the cellar—he was partly concealed—I asked what he was doing—he said I chopping wood, or putting the cellar to rights, or something to that effect—I told him to go to the parlour, which was where it was his duty to be at that time—when he was gone I went to where I had seen him, and found a quantity of metal stowed away in a spittoon—it had been cut up and flattened—it was such as the pots are made of—I locked up the cellar, and placed the key in the bar—in about a quarter of an hour afterwards, I found the prisoner again in the same situation, where the wood was—I asked him what he was doing—he said, "Chopping wood"—I told him to lock the cellar-door, and take the key to the bar—he came out, and locked it—in the evening I sent for a policeman—I went to the cellar, and pointed out the place—the metal was still there—this is it—amongst it is some which has my name on it—the metal had no right there.</p>

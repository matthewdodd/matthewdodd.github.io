            , pawnbroker, in Whitechapel: I took in a great coat, on the 18th of December, between eight and nine o'clock, of the prisoner at the bar; she said, it was her husband's; she made a better appearance then than she does now; she said, her name was Shaw, and that she lived in Red Lion-street; I lent her half-a-guinea on it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see her afterwards? - A. In about two hours, at the prosecutor's shop; they brought a man and woman to the office, I said, they were not the person; I then went down to Mr. Brickell's house, and the prisoner was there at work; I am sure the prisoner was the woman that pawned it. (It was produced in Court, and deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never was out of the shop from the time I went to work, at eight o'clock, till this man came and took me out.</p>

               <p>I am a taylor, I made the coat; I went with Mr. Brickell to the pawnbroker's; he said, it was pawned by an old woman; in consequence of which, he took up an old woman that works with him; when she was brought to the pawnbroker, he said, that was not the woman.</p>
               <p>Jones. It is a strange story, I don't know what he means; he was not at our house with the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to the prosecutor? - A. I said it was an elderly, short woman, in a black gown, I believed; they shewed me a woman in the lock-up house, she was not the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Brickell.) What description did the pawnbroker give you of the woman? - A. When I went to the pawnbroker's, I had nobody with me; he said it was a short elderly woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he shewn any other woman? - A. Yes; an old woman that had worked with me before, but that was not the prisoner. This is my coat, I found it in Mr. Windsor's shop; Wedderburn made it.</p>
               <p>Court. Were you in the shop when the prisoner came to work that morning? - A. No; I were in bed; I saw her in the shop about nine o'clock.</p>

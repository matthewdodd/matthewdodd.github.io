                  </hi>. I missed one of the marked shillings, in the till, and the policeman found a marked shilling on the prisoner, at six o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing—I know nothing further—we did not count the money in the till all day—if people came and wanted change, the money was used—there were 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the till in the morning—we did not count it again in the evening—the money was paid out in the day, and it might be brought back again—I was advised, at the station, to give the prisoner into custody—that was the reason why I did not charge him at the moment—one marked shilling was found on him in the evening, which was one I had given to Mrs. Bell—silver had gone out, perhaps twenty times in the day, in the course of business—we do not keep check-books—Mrs. Bell was not before the Magistrate—she was unwell at the time, and she was unwilling to attend.</p>

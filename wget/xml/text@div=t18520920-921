                  </hi>. I am a hair dresser by trade, and live at 28, Great Saffron-hill, Holborn. On 6th Sept., between 4 and 5 o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon, I had occasion to go to a lodging house at 16, George-yard, White-chapel—I knew somebody who was lodging there—when I got there I saw the prisoner lying down on a form by the fireplace asleep—I sat down on a bench opposite to wait for my friend, as he was not here—after I had been sitting there about five minutes the prisoner awoke, and said, "You b—y wh's get, what do you want here?"—I said I had called to see one of the travellers—he told me to go out—I said I should not go out till I thought proper—he immediately stood up and walked across to a kind of bench or settle where knives are kept, took up a knife, and tried it with his inger—he put that one down, and took up another—he then came up to me, and said, "Now I will see whether you will not go out"—he put the point of the knife so close to my face that it just raised the skin—I had not said or done anything to provoke him—he then rapidly drew back the knife, and made a plunge at my face—I put my head on one side when I saw the blade coming, and put up my hand to save my face, and received a wound just inside the knuckle joint of the thumb—upon that I jumped up and struck him with my left hand—that was after I was stabbed—Sergeant Price, who happened to be inspecting the house at the time, rushed into the room, and took the knife out of his hand—I gave him into custody—I have been under the care of a surgeon since, at the London Hospital—the wound is not well yet—I have suffered a great deal of pain from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say to you, when you said you had called to see a traveller, "Why do you not go to where you lodge yourself?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and I then said I would go when I thought proper—the first time he put the knife to my cheek it just raised the skin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He was after knocking me down with great force, and kicked me very severely on the jaw before I used the knife; he was aggravating me. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> That is not true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He had lodged there before, and they were looking after him to put him in prison; he stole several things from the house. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did lodge there some three weeks previously, and it appears that the prisoner lost a shirt, and accused me of taking it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 15.) I was at this lodging house on the 6th September—I was on the first floor, and heard a scuffle in the kitchen—I went there, and found the prosecutor bleeding from the right hand—he said, pointing to the prisoner, "That man has stabbed me"—the prisoner then held this knife (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>), firmly grasped in his right hand—I seized him by the wrist and took it from him—I then said to him, "You are an old man, you should know better than to use a knife"—he said, "Am I to stand and be struck by him"—I took him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital. On 6th Sept. Harvey came there—he had an incised wound across the joint of the</p>

               <p>thumb, cutting rather deeply, another one on the fore finger, and a slight graze in the eye—the cut on the finger would correspond with a cut with the back of an old knife—such a knife as this would produce such a wound—I considered the wound dangerous then—he might have had a stiff joint for life—He is not under my care now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was only taking my own part; he was aggravating me; I was a lodger in the house the same as himself; I was told that he tock my shirt; he slept in the next bed to me; he was very cruel to me this day; there was a knife on the table, and there being nothing else there, I snatched it up and stabbed him, because he would not let me alone and behave himself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Clay, at Nicholas-lane, as bill brokers and bankers. We have been in the habit, for three or four years past, of having bill transactions with a firm in Nicholas-lane, which traded under the name of Messrs. Covington—they have been in the habit of sending us bills for the purpose of discounting—those transactions have been carried on with Mr. Maude—about 12th April this year, I heard of the death of Mr. Covington senior—about twelve months before that Maude said that there were six partners, Mr. Cov<lb></lb>ington senior, Mr. Covington junior, himself, and 1 do not recollect positively the others, but I remember some one of the name of H—, which I afterwards learned was Mr. Hill—he named five besides himself and enumerated their names; it did not occur to me as very important, and I did not take the names down—Whitby was not present, but he confirmed it afterwards, I do not know when, exactly—I cannot charge my memory with the conversation, except that there were several partners—I should not like to say that he enumerated them—when Mr. Covington died, I had another conversation with Maude; he came in, and Mr. Clay referred to the death being in the paper, and said, "I suppose there will be more to divide"—I understood that he would get the benefit of that—Maude said, "Yes, there will be"—he also said that there were four more partners remaining; I thought he meant four besides himself—he at that time produced some bills to me—I asked him incidentally, whether they were his usual trade bills—he seemed rather surprised at the question; and I said, "There is nothing of accommodation about them"—he said, "Certainly not, we have no others"—from April to July we continued to advance him money on various bills to between 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and l,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—about 14th July, I told Maude that I was going on the continent for. eight weeks, and asked him if he was likely to want any money during my absence—he said that he would let me know—I have a letter here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this other letter is the reply to it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Dear Sir; Nicholas-lane, July 13. We have as you desired us, made a rough calculation of the amount of bills we expect to receive in the course of business in the next six weeks, which we find will amount to about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; our liabilities are, I am happy to say, very light")—that is in Maude's· writing—I returned to town on 26th Aug., and on 27th Aug. Maude called with reference to some bills sent to us in my absence—I had the account of his bills before me (<hi rend="italic">looking at a book</hi>)—I believe the bilk I referred to were one for 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Whitbyi, one for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Gane, one for 117<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on Gane, and one for 77<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on Eichardson—I said, "I suppose these are genuine trade bills"—he said, "Yes"—I believe Mr. Clay was present, we generally sit together; it is very seldom that we are away from each other—he did not tell us how they came into his hands, we did not like to ask him such a question, as they were regular trade bills—we have two classes of accounts, in one we discount bills at once without any reduction, the other is where we have banking accounts, and a certain proportion is left as a balance—that proportion is 25 per cent.—we have a banking account with Messrs. Covington—I asked Mr. Maude how much he wanted on these bills, he said, "140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—we certainly should not have advanced him that amount unless he had made the representation to us with reference to the number of partners in the firm, nor without inquiry, if we had known that he was the only partner—we certainly should not have advanced it unless we had believed that there were several partners in the firm; nor under any cir<lb></lb>cumstances if we had not believed that they were regular trade bills—we</p>

               <p>had other transactions of a like nature up to 22nd Oct—we saw the name of Gane on one of the bills—we had refused a bill on 18th Oct., and about 22nd Oct. Maude called; he had left three or four bills with that of Gane's, and pressed me to take that bill; I declined—he brought it again, and I declined—he said that there was a bill of Gane's due that day which would not be paid—I said, "Perhaps the better plan will be for me to tell you why I have doubts about it; some little time ago I saw the name of Gane in a list of County Court judgments; and I said that if a man could not pay 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I thought he was not fit to accept a bill for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he still urged me, I declined, and he took it away—I saw Whit by on, I think, 2nd Nov.—I was not at that time aware that he was the acceptor of those bills which had been the subject of conversation—I did not know him as Whitby, but simply as Messrs. Covington's clerk—he came in, and from the fact of my having called there the day before, and got the information that his name was Whitby from the office, I said, "Is your name Whitby?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Are you the acceptor of those bills which were brought to us from Covington and Co.?"—he said, "I never brought you my acceptance, I purposely avoided it"—Mr. Clay replied, "But you had two-thirds of the money always, you took care not to tell us that you were the acceptor"—he said something which I forget, and my reply was, "Do you think we should have discounted your bills if we had known you were a clerk to Covington and Co."—he said, "Has not Mr. Maude told you all this?"—that had such an effect upon me that I was astonished, and I recol<lb></lb>lect that remark distinctly.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you say your firm is? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Thomas Reginald Kemp and George Clay, we hold ourselves out to the world as Kemp, Clay, and Co.—there are no other partners, the "Co." means nobody—we added Co. to our firm when we first began business together; there was nobody then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you not holding yourselves out as you say Maude did, as having partners that do not belong to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Our firm is Kemp, Clay, and <hi rend="italic">Co</hi>.—I do not know that there is any object in the "Co.," I do not recollect why we put it in—there are hundreds and thousands of firms who do so—I do not know what prompted us to do it, it is well known that we are only two—I did not intend to represent that there were other persons in the firm than myself and Mr. Clay, nor would that imply that there were, there is Sir John Lubbock and Co., but there is only Sir John Lubbock in the firm—I had recently been bankrupt, and I believe my partner had been bankrupt some years before, but I had known him twenty-five years, and did not know it; I hear it now, but do not even now know when it was—this matter was investigated on several occasions at the Mansion House—Whitby was charged before Alderman Wire, and discharged—it is not by my directions that he is included in this indictment, nor by my partner's, to my knowledge; I was rather surprised to see him—I do not say that I am not prosecuting him willingly, but I was astonished that the Lord Mayor discharged him, because I thought him the worst of the two, and I was astonished to see him here as the Lord Mayor had discharged him—I did not know that he was in the indictment till yesterday afternoon—I have had dealings with these gentlemen three or four years, to the amount of several thousand pounds, in bills, never in anything else—I found Whitby's name on a good many of them—they were taken up at maturity—I do not think it would amount to 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I should think quite 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—we are left creditors to the amount of 875<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I do not think the plan of keeping</p>

               <p>back 25 per cent. continued during that period, but in the hundreds of thousands we do I cannot recollect, (<hi rend="italic">referring to a book</hi>)I think it began in 1854—we had been discounting for him since 1852—we deducted the 25 per cent in 1854 because he then opened a banking account—instead of paying him the whole of his bills, we deducted 25 per cent—I call that a banking account—we are bankers, and have depositors independent of bill transactions—25 per cent was kept back from the latter end of 1854—supposing Maude has had every shilling on these bills, there would be 875<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. owing to us, because the bills amounted to more than that; there would have been a balance in hand if all the bills were paid, to the amount of 25 per cent, on 875<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that plan was adopted because we were, of course, more liable with our bills than we were with our banking accounts; in times of difficulty, we feel it our duty to supply money to persons who bank with us, but general customers we should let go elsewhere—we consider banking customers entitled to more allowance than ordinary customers—I cannot say whether that is our only motive, we might feel inclined to keep one customer, and not another—we did not deduct the 25 per cent, because we were inclined to keep Maude, but among the number of customers we have in times like the present, when money is dear, we feel it our duty to find them money</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But it appears that that is like taking their money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You cannot call it that, because we have got their bills—suppose you bring me 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bills, and I give you 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I have not got any of your money—we, of course, keep back 25 per cent, our object in doing that is the same as other bankers would, to keep a balance on the account—it is our practice always to have 25 per cent on every account, for conducting the account</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was your object in making the proposal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We ask them if they are inclined to open a banking account, or they might hare asked us—we have a great number of these accounts, and when we can get them, of course we do.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you do so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will not swear that I did. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think that Mr. Maude proposed that when he wanted 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of bills discounted, you should only give 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not very likely that either of us would have put it in that way—we never knew that he was pressed for money—I swear that I cannot tell you who proposed it, he or I—it may have come from Maude is 1854, he having 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per thousand in our hands—I call this a banking account, if a cheque had been drawn for it the next day it would not have been paid, but it would have been paid immediately the bills became due—if a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill had been paid next day he would have been entitled to 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but if a cheque was drawn before that, he would not get his money, because he would not have any to get—this had not been done with Maude till 1854—I cannot say whether this was held as a matter of security, but if any one were to open an account with us to day we should tell him that it is our habit to keep 25 per sent on every account—we should not tell him that it is for security, because it would not enter into our minds, but we should not, nevertheless, go and discount his bills because he brought them, and there was a balance in our hands—I do not think any such idea as keeping it for security was in our minds—I will not venture to swear that it was, or that it was not—I do not know why we did not adopt it till 1854, except that it was an advantage to both parties to have a banking account—I never heard Whitby's name till that day—we are nearly opposite to Coving<lb></lb>ton's premises—I do not know that Whitby has been there the whole time</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185511260110"></xptr>
               <p>that Maude has been carrying on the business—I have been in the habit of, seeing him for twelve months at least—I do not remember that it is more—I have seen Mr. Covington's clerk it may be two years—I never knew him in any other way—I very seldom went there, Whitby frequently came to us—I never saw him on the Coal Exchange—though his name was on the bills, I never knew that hid name was Whitby—Maude has been in the habit of paying us cheques—they were on Sapte and Co. I think, but it was very seldom, that he paid us in that way, not above once or twice—the bills were usually taken up by the acceptor—we received very few sum of money from him—we have been in Nicholas-lane four or five years—I did not know old Mr. Covington personally, or by sight, or any of the Coving<lb></lb>tons—I never saw anybody in the business but Mr. Maude—I find now, that the name of Mr. Maude is painted under that of Covington on the door, and I have no reason to doubt that it was there before—I have not been a partner with Mr. Clay the whole five years, only since 1852—I know that there is such a person as Mr. Hill, I know him by sight—I had a conversation with him after this inquiry at the Mansion-house—I did not tell him that I did not believe that Mr. Maude ever intended to defraud us—I swear that—I will not swear that there was nothing to that effect—I do not think Mr. Clay in my presence said so—I will not swear that he did not—I did not say, "We want our money; it is a very small sum for Mr. Maude's father and brothers to make up between them," nor did Mr. Clay in my presence—Mr. Hill requested to know whether he could talk to us as men of honor—I said, "I prefer listen to what you have to say "—he said, "May I say what I wish without a word being breathed?"—we said, "Yes"—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">objected to this, and the rest of the conversation was not given</hi>)—I think Mr. Maude's father and brothers were mentioned—I shall be very cautious with this, to swear to the truth of it, because I should imagine that Mr. Hill's recollection would be equal to mine—I do not believe that Mr. Maude, or his father, or son were mentioned in the way you put it—their names were mentioned—I have not the slightest recollection of what was said about them, because I purposely avoided remembering it—I said, "Mr. day, I shall have nothing to do with this; if anything is to be done let counsel confer together, and let the matter be arranged with them, I will not be any party to this proposal"—I would not even say that what was said about Maude's father and brothers was not said by me, because it was general conversation, and a great deal of it was going on—what was said about Mr. Maude's father compromising the matter, was said by Mr. Hill—it was not suggested by me or Mr. Clay—Mr. Hill came in, shut our door, and asked if he could speak with us in confidence—Mr. Clay said, "Yes" Mr. Hill said, "Can the matter be arranged if the friends meet together? "—I said that I did not know, for I thought it was a felony, and was quite guarded—then the conversation went on again, and Mr. Hill went away under the impression that we were not indisposed to compromise it if counsel were of the same opinion—I did not know what the compromise would be—I was a bankrupt in 1848 for about 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know that 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound was offered as a compromise in this case before any charge was made against the defendants—it was made to me personally, but in confidence—the gentleman is in Court—it was Mr. Surr, but without his permission I ought not to say—I have paid a good deal in the pound since my bankruptcy, but I paid nothing at the time; I have really struggled on till the last moment—I bought up the debts to the amount of 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were very old debts and I gave 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—I</p>

Massey a month before my bankruptcy—I would not dare to swear so long ago, but I should hardly think it possible, because I had only been in difficulties some four, five, or six months—I did not receive money from them to the amount of 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor yet at many shillings—I was bankrupt in 1848—I had stopped payment several months before—Mr. Massey did not get a farthing from me because I had stopped—I should think he has, but not from me, from the bills and securities, many thousands—there was not also a considerable sum of money belonging to Miss Carter when I stopped payment—she had not parted with a considerable sum to me, the whole she had in the world—she was a ward of mine, and had about 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she had had about 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it, and by my recommendation, she invested it in shares, and other things, which became valueless, and she afterwards proved against my estate for it, and got nothing, but she had a good deal after I failed—they had a bill of sale on my property, and realized the whole of that bill of sale—I had given her the bill of sale, because she advanced me a sum of money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Kemp, as bill brokers and bankers, and have been so four years. I was a bankrupt in 1847—I know Maude—he had dealings with us, under the name of Covington and Co.—I recollect seeing the death of Mr. Covington in the papers—Maude came after that, and I said that I had observed the death of Mr. Covington, and asked him if it was one of their firm—he said, "Our senior partner"—I said, "Of course, it will be well for the remaining partners?"—he said, "Yes; the remaining partners will be benefited certainly"—I forget whether he mentioned the number of partners—(Mr. Kemp was present)—I asked him if they were all trade bills, as we are in the habit of asking very often of all our customers—he said that they were all <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> trade bills; they never had any others—I do not remember that he said what they were given for—I recollect Mr. Kemp going out of town—he told Maude that he was going out of town for some weeks, and wanted to know what amount of discount he would require during his absence—Maude said that he would write—I recollect Mr. Kemp's return, on 28th Aug.—he came on that day to agree to the account, and receive the bills due to him—(bills had been delivered to him, making about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether)—we then asked him again if they were <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> trade bills, and he replied that they were—Mr. Kemp said, "You must have a very good business, Mr. Coving-ton" (we always addressed him as Mr. Covington) "for so many partners to live out of it"—he said, "Yes, and they do a very large sum too"—I did know him as Mr. Maude, but if I had been asked his name I do not think I should have remembered it—we agreed to let him have 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I wrote him this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), the body of which is in my writing, which is an unusual thing—he had said on one or two occasions, after Mr. Coving-ton's death, "The remaining four partners"—we afterwards obtained some information about Gane—before the money was advanced, Maude said, in my presence, that the bills generally were for lighterage, in the way of his business—there was an interview with Mr. Truefit, the solicitor, and he gave certain information—up to that time I had not known that there was not more than one person in the firm—I was not present at the interview—if I had known that Maude was the only person in the firm, I would not have advanced the money—I was present at an interview with Whitby, about 2nd Nov.—he came over by Mr. Kemp's directions, and Mr. Kemp asked him if his name was Whitby—he said, "Yes"—Mr. Kemp said, "Are you the acceptor of these bills, which we have had continually in the name of Whitby?"—he said, "I am; has Mr. Maude said something to you about it?"—Mr. Kemp said, "But you brought these bills?"—Whitby said, "No; I carefully avoided bringing my own acceptances"—I said, "You did not carefully avoid coming for the money for them, because you have generally had about two-thirds of the money put into your own hands"—when Mr. Kemp heard him confess that, he turned to me, and said, "Well, this is, the</p>

               <p>grossest swindle that ever came under my notice"—Whitby has made a statement to me about the partners, but my memory docs not sufficiently serve me to explain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> This cheque is Kemp, Clay, and Co., when did you start the Co? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the time I went into partnership with Mr. Kemp, and we thought that we might eventually have a "Co."—we had no particular reason for it—it was done by arrangement—it is no unusual thing—I can scarcely tell you what our motive was—I had been bankrupt in the panic of 1847—I did not know that Mr. Kemp had been a bankrupt till after I became his partner—I do not know whether he knew that I had been—I dare say that I felt bound to mention it—I have no doubt of it—I will not swear that I did—I do not think he ever mentioned to me that he had been bankrupt until I was fairly his partner—I knew Maude by the name of Covington more than Maude—I knew his name was Maude—I do not think he ever represented himself by any other name, but he was Covington and Co. to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not his name over the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know that I ever saw the door—I lived opposite, but his office is up a court—I had been there two years before—I can see the gateway—I do not know that his name is there now—our object in instituting this prosecution was to punish people who came and committed fraud—I will not say that it was public justice only—our object was to get what was stolen from us—if we could have got that, I do not know whether we should have let public justice shift for herself—I believe if they had brought the money for these bills we should have given them—we could not have prosecuted if they had the bills out of our hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, did not you institute these proceedings to get the money out of the relations of Mr. Maude? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We took the proceedings certainly, and we should not have gone on with the prosecution if they had been paid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Burr and Gribble, solicitors, in the city. I knew Mr. Covington, sen.—I am one of his executors—he died in March or April this year—I knew Maude, carrying on the business of a lighterman—I have known him since I think it was about 1851, when he joined Mr. Covington, sen., as a partner in this very trade—Mr. Covington, sen., was not a partner in the house at the time of his death—Mr. Maude certainly had no partner to my knowledge in Aug. this year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there a member of the Covington family whose name was allowed to remain in the firm? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in. the firm, but to be used as a licensed lighterman, which the regulations of the Lightermen's Company require—his name remained in the business, and he took out the license—one son first, and another afterwards—the first son was a partner and the second was not—it was known to me that the establishment was carried on the name of Covington and Co.—I made the arrangement in receiving Mr. Maude into the business—the old firm was continued—I acted for the Messrs. Covington, and Mr. Bower, of Chancery-lane, acted for Mr. Maude—before entering into the arrangements I inquired about Mr. Maude of several bankers, and among others of Messrs. Masterman—I believe he had been in their house—I ascertained the respectability of his friends and</p>

               <p>connections—he paid a sum of money to come into the business, and for the purpose of doing so mortgaged a reversionary interest under his father's settlement, to Mr. Covington, who therefore left his money in the firm—that represented nearly 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he brought in in actual cash 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I only know from others the state of the accounts now—up to a certain point I had the highest opinion of him—I know of other moneys which he has brought in—his father and his family have advanced money to the firm—I know that on this very reversionary interest 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. further was raised, and went to pay off some of the bills—Mr. Covington facilitated that—that was not on the presumption that it would pay both—I got some other security substituted for it from Mr. Maude, which I now hold, and allowed him to have the deeds—it is a business requiring a very active life on the part of the proprietors—the Covingtons are a very old established firm, and unless I had been sure that all was right I would not have done it.</p>

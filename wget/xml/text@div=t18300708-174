I know Mr. Charles Hamerton - I never saw the prisoner till last Friday, the 9th of July, when he came to my warehouse, and said he came from Mr. Stevens, of Hackney, for the sum of 32l. - I had never heard of Mr. Stevens' name, and there had been no transaction on which such a claim could have been founded; he brought this letter, which was wafered, and this enclosure was in it; I read it, and asked from whom he brought it - he said from Mr. Stevens that morning; I asked him again, and he said from Hackney that morning - I said the wafer was wet, and I would send for a constable; he said he hoped I should not get him into trouble, as a man at the corner of Basing-lane gave it to him, and told him he should be well paid for the job - this is the letter - (read)</p>

            . I live at Stamford-grove. This letter is not my writing; I know nothing of the transaction - the prisoner is a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>JOHN LANCASTER. I am a constable. I took charge of the prisoner for attempting to impose on Mr. Hancock - he said a person had employed him, and would be waiting at the corner of Basing-lane, for what he was to receive from that letter; I told him I would let him go up on one side to point out the man, and I would take him - when we got to the corner there were two men standing at the corner public-house; he pointed out a man dressed in blue, and then said the man had a green coat on - he then said, "No, that is not the man;" I said, "Perhaps it is Bow-lane or Friday-street;" he said, "No, I am confident this is the street;" the other persons did not go away - I took the prisoner to Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had just left my wife in Red Lion-street, Whitechapel; I met this man, who asked if I wanted a job - I said Yes; he said, "Come along, I will give you one;" he took me to that street, and told me to take the letter to No. 18, and he would pay me for it - I took it; the gentleman opened it, and it was that bill - I cannot read or write.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the West York Rifle Militia, raised at Pontefract—on Wednesday, 19th January, about half-past 1 o'clock, I left Pontefract with Hacket, a deserter—I fetched him out of Hatfield Gaol the day before—this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was given to the corporal, and my instructions came from him—I went with Hacket by rail from Ponte-fract to Hull, and then by steam to London—I landed at Fresh Wharf on Friday, 21st, with Hacket and the corporal—Hacket was fastened to my wrist by a handcuff—he stood at Fresh Wharf, London Bridge, with two other men and four women, who appeared to have been waiting for him—they</p>

I am a corporal of the West York Rifle Militia; by virtue of this document purporting to be signed by the quarter-master-general, I received Hacket, and took him with the last witness to Hull, and then up to London—during the whole of this time he was in custody under this document—I went to get a billet at the place the billet indicated—the prisoner was with us—Hackett asked to have the hand changed from the handcuffs, and as soon as it was unlocked and his hands were at liberty, he knocked Dawson down and held him down, and I got a <hi rend="italic">clout</hi> of the head—the prisoner ran away as soon as he had got Hacket at liberty—I saw Dawson follow him.</p>

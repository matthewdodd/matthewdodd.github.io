               <p>standing there, or, at least, sitting down there—I heard the captain tell him to go down, as it was too warm for him to windward—I think it was Gresley who stripped him—nothing was done to him then, except clean clothes put on him—I was then close aft to the cabin, coiling up the main sheet, as far from Gresley as I am from the door of the Court—that was the only time I saw him stripped.</p>

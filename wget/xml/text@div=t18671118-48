                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Webb, of 5, Old Woolwich Road, Woolwich, where my husband and myself keep a small grocer's shop—on Monday, the 9th September, Acton came to our shop and said he wanted to see to our scales and weights—he said, "I come from Inspector Farmer"—I said, "I have heard we must have them seen to," and asked if he did the stamping and all that was required—he said he did—he then said the inspector would compel us to have them done, and he would bring me some more weights to-morrow and take mine away—he then went away, and in about half an hour came back in company with Horton, and said he had orders from Inspector Farmer to go to several shops and do their weights, and he thought it would be more convenient to me to let Horton do them there than take them away—Horton had a basket containing scales and weights and pieces of lead—Horton then took my weights and said they were too light, and he hammered some pieces of lead into them—he said it was a very good job I got them done, for I should have got into a great deal of trouble when the inspector came—he then asked for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said I must have two new weights, which he would bring to-morrow—Horton made out the bill produced, and after I gave him the money he gave</p>

               <p>it to me receipted—he said he could not wait till the next day for the money, as he had to pay it to Inspector Farmer the same night—he brought the weights the next day, and said Inspector Farmer would call in a day or two and stamp them—he showed me a list, which he said showed where he had to call—I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and he took the old weights away—I told, him I thought he had not done the weights exactly right, as I had been told the lead ought to have been run into them—he said, "Oh, nonsense, you cannot have the lead run in, for if you were you would be obliged to have them stamped every time."'</p>

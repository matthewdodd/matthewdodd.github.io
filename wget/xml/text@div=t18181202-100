            . I am a fishmonger, and live at Rumford. I became acquainted with two men, named Hanchett and Clarke. They made a communication to me, which I informed Mr. Wood, the overseer, of. I saw Mr. Storey. I went to town with Hanchett and Clarke, left Rumford on Sunday night, about eleven o'clock, and walked all the way. I arrived at the Green Man, and Bell, Darkhouse-lane, with them about three o'clock.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020045"></xptr>We then went to Mr. Ford's, the Tiltboat, and remained there half an hour at breakfast - it was then near six o'clock. They accompanied me to the market, to buy some fish. I returned to the Green Man and Bell, and left my fish there about seven o'clock, then went with them to <placeName id="t18181202-100-crimeloc556">Petticoat-lane</placeName>

At eight o'clock I saw the prisoner standing outside a house in Petticoat-lane. He said to Hanchett, have you sold all your blackberries? He said Yes. Martin put his finger to his nose. Hanchett then put his finger across his mouth. The prisoner, and Hanchett crossed over, about twenty yards from me, and appeared in conversation. We crossed over, and all four went into a court, which Hanchett called the Gaff, The prisoner then asked me how much money I wanted? I said 2 l. worth. Clarke said he would have half a score. and Hanchett said, he would have a score - the prisoner went away. Hanchett said, he had made the agreement with him, and that I was to give 2 l. for 100, that is 5 s. for 20 s. The prisoner returned in about five minutes, with a great quantity of shillings, and gave me five score. I I gave him a 1 l. note. He said that was not enough by 5 s. I said I wanted some half-crowns, but he would have the 5 s. first. I then gave him a score of bad shillings back - I had then only four score. Clarke said he would have half a score - the prisoner said, why not have a score. Clarke said he had not money enough. I asked how much he wanted? He said 1 s. 6 d. Martin gave him 20 s. - He then gave Hanchett a score, he paid him 5 s. for them. The prisoner then went across the road to get some sixpences, and half crowns. He beckened to us, and we all went over into a court - he told us to stay there; he returned with the sixpences, and said he could not let us have the half crowns then.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had finished dealing, where did you go to - A. Clarke, Hanchett, and I walked to Stratford, got on the Harwich coach, and went to Rumford - we got down at the Sun public-house. kept by Marshall, we went into the taproom, and called for a pot of egg-hot - I paid two bad shillings for it, I had informed Mr. Wood that we would call there. We called for another pot, for which I paid two more bad shillings. A woman tapped at the window, I went out to see what she wanted - she was gone - Hanchett and Clarke were alarmed, ran out, and said they were going to make away with the money. I laid hold of them, took them into the taproom, and made them sit down. Mr. Wood came in, followed by Turk, and Adams, who took them into custody. I gave Mr. Wood ninety-six shillings, and eighty-three sixpences.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. What part of Petticoat-lane, is the Gaff - A. It is in Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived at Rumford - A. Nine months - I knew Hanchett and Clarke, by seeing them about for three months, but have not been acquainted with them above a fortnight. I used to walk to town, to buy my fish, and have met them coming up with mushrooms, two or three times in the week - I do not expect to be paid for this.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and overseer of Rumford. Nicholls informed me of a proposal being made to him by Hanchett. I sent him to inform Mr. Story It was agreed he should go to town with Clark and Hanchett and to return to the Sun public-house. On the 23d I informed Marshall that they were coming, and told him to take what counterfeit money they offered to him, also to send and let us know when they came, which he did about eleven o'clock. I sent him to Mr. Story, and Adams. When I got to the Sun I saw a woman tapping at the window, saying something was the matter. I drove her away, went in, and found Nicholls standing over Clark and Hanchett, insisting that they should not leave. As soon as I saw Mr. Adams, I seized Hanchett by the wrist, and Adams took Clark. We took them both into the front parlour - Mr. Story came in, and they were searched. Nicholls gave me ninety-four shillings, and eighty-three sixpences, which I produce, with four shillings which Marshall gave me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have known Hanchett all his life. He is a labourer. The money was out of my sight while Mr. Talbot had it.</p>

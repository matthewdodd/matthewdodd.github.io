                  </hi>. I am an analytical chemist, living at 93, South Street—on the 7th August last, I was going home after taking a lady friend of my wife's home, and on my return from Blackheath Hill to my residence in South Street, I called in at the Guildford Arms, and had a small glass of brandy and water. It was as near as possible about 10.15 at night—I took out my purse to pay for what. I had, and I left by one door, and those two women (<hi rend="italic">the prisoners</hi>) left by the other—I do not know whether they saw my purse—they left at the same time I did—I went out of the door and went down by the wall, and one of the prisoner's came on one side of me, and the other on the other—Crew deliberately hit me on the left side a violent blow, which I felt for some days, and do at the present time—the other prisoner also did the same—in fact for some moments I scarcely knew whether I was in my senses or not—the blow was just above the hip, on the lower rib—immediately I found I had been robbed—I put my hand to my watch, and found that safe—I put my hand in my pocket and found my purse was gone, and Green said "What have you lost?"—I said "My purse," and she at once picked it off the ground empty, and I said "You must go with me to the station"—the other prisoner remained at a short distance—I attempted to take both of them, but finding that useless, I secured Crew, took her to the station, and gave her in charge—I returned in search of the other, and found her at the Guildford Arms in company with a man—I also attempted to take her to the station, but fearing that I might be molested by this man, desired the landlord of the house to send for a constable, and with some hesitation he did so—the constable came and took her to the station, and she was charged with the other prisoner—I had a pain in this side—it laid me up for two or three days completely—there is no truth in the prisoner's Crew assertion that I gave the other prisoner 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to watch, while I remained with Crew for an immoral purpose.</p>

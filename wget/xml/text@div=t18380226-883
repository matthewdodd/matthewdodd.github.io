I am a shoemaker, and live at Blackheath-hill About seven o'clock, on the evening of the 31st of January, the prisoner came to my shop and wanted a pennyworth of nails—I served him—he offered me a shilling—I looked at it, and said it had rather a suspicious appearance, but my eye-sight was not so good as it used to be—he said it was a good one—I rubbed it on my coat—I cannot say that it had a very bad appearance—I gave him change—I showed the shilling to my daughter—she looked at it, and gave it me back—I put it into my left-hand trowsers pocket, where there was no other shilling—I kept it there till I went to bed—I then took it out, and put it on the mantel-piece—I found it then in the morning—I am quite sure no other shilling was put there—I then nailed it to the counter—Posthumous Mence came in, in the evening—I took the shilling from the counter, and gave it to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Acton. On 10th last July I received a bay mare—I did not know whose property it was, as I could not understand the party, but the prisoner, who came with him, acted as interpreter, and told me to take it down to grass, and it was to <hi rend="italic">bide</hi> till Tuesday—on the Tuesday the prisoner came down alone, and took it away, and a chestnut horse also, which Berquer owns, but I did not know whose it was till after it was gone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were the shoes to be taken off the bay mare? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; if she was not fetched by the Tuesday the shoes were to be taken off, and she was to be turned out to grass, but the prisoner fetched her away on the Tuesday—I had seen Kesterman and Berquer before, but had had no dealings with them; I had four horses of theirs—the prisoner came backwards and forwards three or four times to see that the horses were going on all right, and to give me directions—he brought down a gray mare with Berquer, which was afterwards taken away by Berquer's interpreter after the prisoner had gone—I dealt with the prisoner as the agent of the prosecutors, he gave orders as to the horses' shoes, and when the grass was getting rather short, he gave me orders to put them in a fresh field—he sometimes brought three or four people down, besides Kesterman and Berquer—I have a man there to attend to the horses—this matter was investigated at the time, a year ago, before Mr. Alderman Humphery, and it was dismissed—my man was examined before the Magistrate, and his wife as well—I have not been asked by the prosecutor to bring up the man and his wife now; they told me I was not to do so—my man used to look after the horses in my absence, and if the prisoner came down in my absence my man and his wife would be able to speak to that, and they were examined before the Alderman.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, Surrey-place, Old Kent-road. I purchased a strawberry coloured mare in July, in the presence of the pri<lb></lb>soner, who was in company with Kesterman—I believe Kesterman could not speak English; I heard him speaking French to the prisoner, and perhaps half a dozen other Frenchmen; they all seemed together—there were several Englishmen looking on—I purchased the mare for eighteen guineas, with a reservation that I was to give 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. commission—I purchased a bay mare afterwards, on Tuesday, 13th, at the prisoner's recommendation; he said he was requested by Berquer and Kesterman to sell me that and a chestnut horse, that they were on the Continent purchasing horses, and if I would take the bay mare at the price he offered I might—I purchased her, paid him the money in gold and silver, and took a receipt, which was in the solicitor's hands, at Guildhall, twelve months ago; but I paid him for the chestnut horse in three small checks—in July I was at Rymer and Sower's, late Dixon's—the prisoner was there, in company with Berquer—he showed me three or four horses—I cannot speak French.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On 3rd July, did you purchase a horse or a gray mare? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I offered him the cash, fifteen sovereigns—he said he would not take it, because if he did Rymer and Sower would not take it, and I had better pay the money in the office, which I did—I paid 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the chestnut horse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you undertand, on the Saturday, that Berquer and Kesterman were going on the Continent to buy horses? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoner said so; and that if I did not purchase it then, he thought I should lose it, and I said I would not give any more—when I went to the Repository in Barbican, the prisoner showed me various horses in the presence of Berquer—I was there the best part of half an hour, and the horses were trotted up and down—I did not know whether he was principal or agent, for they both had blue frocks on—while they were trotting and showing the horses, I heard Berquer talking to him about them—it was the prisoner who first sought me out as a customer; he came to me by himself about the horses more than once—on one occasion I said I could not lose my time by going to Dixon's, but if be could bring the horses to Smithfield I would look at them, and he brought the strawberry and the bay mare on Saturday, the 10th—he was by himself when he first brought them, and when he brought them again he was with Kesterman and Berquer—I have seen him in their presence three or four times—I never frequent Dixon's repository—I saw him altogether half a dozen times, because he importuned me to buy many horses; if it had not been for him I should not have bought the strawberry mare—I offered him the money in Long-lane; Berquer saw that—the prisoner told me, if I did not like the bargain, if I brought it back and would lose a sovereign he would take it back—if a dealer comes from abroad and has one or two horses left, it is preferable to get rid of them—he said he was to remit the money to them in Belgium—I could not pay him, as the Bank had closed, and I said he must wait till next day—I told him to take the chance and go to Hill's bank to get the cash, and he said he would do so—before the Alderman a claim was made for the horse under the Police Act, and the bank clerk was called—I was examined at length, and the claim was not entertained.</p>

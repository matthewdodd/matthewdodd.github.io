               <p>Q. Can you tell what things were left in your house when you went out to dinner?</p>
               <p>Pierce. There was my gold watch and a gold chain, and a white cornelian seal; there was a purse and 3 moidores, a mourning ring in one drawer, in another drawer there was a muslin apron work'd, and 6 stockings, 2 silver tea-spoons. When I came home I did not think to look for my watch; the next morning I call'd to the woman to fetch my watch, and she could not find it; then I examined and found I lost many other things.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner was carried to the Gate-house on Tuesday night, the next day by promising to be as favourable as I could, she confest 3 places where the things were; I found one apron upon her, and the Constable has the watch and many things.</p>

            . As I am keeper of the Gate-house, I happen'd to be at the Justice's at that time, when the Prisoner was there, and I went with others with a search-warrant in Dean-street to her lodging, but only found an apron; the Lady desir'd. I would use all arts I could to make a discovery, and if she would confess, she would forgive her; I got a maid-servant to lodge with her, she making little improvements, I talk'd to her the next day about the Lady's promise, which she might depend upon the assurances I gave her of a free forgiveness by the Lady, she made a full discovery, and told me of a box at Templeton's.

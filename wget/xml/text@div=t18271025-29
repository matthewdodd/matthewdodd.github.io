            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the day after this Monday; I went with Holloway, and found him coming out of Angus' shop- I told him he was suspected of taking Holloway's money; he said he knew nothing about it: I took him into a private room of the Fulham Bridge public-house - I searched him, and found 3s. 6d. in silver and 71/2d. in copper: I then said to him, "Has your wife any money at home?" he said she might have 1s. or 2s. unknown to him; I asked what he received for wages on Saturday night - he said 17s.; I asked what he gave his wife on Saturday night - he said he gave her nothing on Saturday night, but gave her 2s. or 3s. of it on Sunday morning; I said I must lock him up while I went to his wife - he said he was very willing: I put him in the watch-house, and went to his house - his wife was not at home: I was directed to where she was; I went to the place, but she was not there - I waited till she came back; I asked her if she had any money, and went with her to the prisoner's lodgings (I knew she was his wife, and that it was his lodging) - and in a mug over the dresser were 10s. in silver; on searching further, there was a paper with a quarter of a pound of moist sugar - I was going to lay hold of it, but his wife laid hold of it, unfolded it, and gave me this piece of paper; I opened it, and found five sovereigns - I looked round on the floor, and saw a quantity of things rolled up in the form in which pawnbrokers roll them - they appeared to have been recently redeemed; there was a hat-box, and some things in it - I do not know their value; I found 6s. 9d. on the wife's person - the prisoner had told me there was no money at home, except his wife might have a few shillings unknown to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I tell you there was or was not money at home? A. He said his wife might have a shilling or two unknown to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the sovereigns in a box, or in the sugar-paper? A. On the sugar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the Monday morning I went to work as usual; I had not been at work above half an hour, before the prosecutor came, and said, "How are you?" he said, "Shall we go and have something to drink?" we went and had a pint of half and half - he said to the woman,"Put this up to me." He went out again, and had some rum and milk, then went to breakfast, and after breakfast there was some half and half had - and after dinner there were two gallons of beer, which was placed to his account; we went to tea, and remained at work till seven o'clock in the evening: there were six smiths, four wheelwrights, and three coach-body makers at work in the upper shop; we left about seven in the evening, leaving the prosecutor and another man in the shop - we went into the public-house; this man came in, and called a man out; we remained there an hour, and then went home: I went to work, as usual, on Tuesday morning till one o'clock, when this man came and said he wanted me; I told him what money I had - he searched me, and said, "Have you any money at home?" -"Yes," said I: he said, "Where is your wife?" - I said,"I don't know; she was at home at breakfast - I am going to dinner, and expect to find her at home:" he said, "Have you any money at home?" - I said, "Yes; if I had not, how could I keep myself in the winter when I am out of work:" I told him a man had paid me 8l. 17s. - he locked me up, and went to Pimlico: I was taken to Queen-square, and remanded till Friday; I was brought into Court, and the Magistrate asked how I came by the sovereigns; I told him I had been in the habit of earning 30s. a week in the summer, and had put this by, except what had been paid me by a man at Pimlico, which had been 25l. at different times - Mr. Harmer has the receipt which was given for it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WOODBERY. He said he had no money, except his wife might have a trifle - he said nothing of having received 8l. odd.</p>

            . I live at No. 15, Arlington-street, Pimlico, and am a house-painter. I received 25l. for the prisoner more than twelve months ago, and used it in my business - I have paid him the whole at different times; I sometimes paid him 3l. or 4l., and sometimes 10s., just as I could; the largest sum I ever paid him was 4l. 11s. or 12s., that was since the 7th of August last; since that he has received 8l. from me - the last payment was on the 9th of October; it was paid at my house, to his wife - it was paid in cash, whether in silver or gold I cannot say, for it was given by my wife - I ordered her to pay it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give it to her in gold or bank notes? A. It was not in notes; whether there was a half-sovereign, or it was all silver, I cannot tell; when I made the last payment, I took a receipt in full of all demands, which I gave to my daughter within the last five days, and I believe it is in Mr. Harmer's possession.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the receipt given? A. On the 9th - I wrote it, and the prisoner signed it; I heard of the prisoner being taken the day after - I knew he was remanded for further examination - I did not attend before the Justice, to prove I had made him the payment - I did not think it my duty to attend to other people's business.</p>
               <p>Q. Then a friend lent you money in distress, and you did not think it your duty to attend for him when charged with a capital offence? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told the Magistrate I received the 25l.; he said if I could bring the man forward, it would be a great thing on my side.</p>
               <p>COURT. We have before us an account of what you said to the Magistrate; do you wish it to be stated.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>The prisoner afterwards desired this statement should be read. It was as follows: - The prisoner says, "I have nothing to say- I never meddled with his money, I have worked hard for the money the officer found - it is part of 25l. which I received from a friend."</p>

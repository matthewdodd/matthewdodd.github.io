             depos'd, that he being a Joiner or Cabinet-maker, &amp;c. wrought as a Journeyman with Cartwright Richardson, and that both he and Austin sent him away from the Work-house (which was not the Dwelling-house) in Black Raven Court in Chiswell-street, about the latter End of February last, pretending they had some Experiments to make, by way of melting. That the next Morning he went to their Lodging for the Key of the Work house, and coming to it found Embers of Charcoal, some Crucibles and Metal. That Austin Richardson coming about 9 or 10 a Clock, he enquired what they had been doing: That thereupon he answered, that they had been making some Trials as to coining of Money, having melted Brass for that Purpose, but that he could not make it bear, but he had been told by a Friend of something that would do better, and he would try the Experiment with that. And that about the 8th or 9th of March following, they did coin with Several Metals mixt 12 Pieces in the Likeness of King Charles the Second's Shillings, and 25 Pieces in the Likeness of Half Crowns: And that the Saturday Night following he went with Austin Richardson, and he put off one of these Half Crowns at a great Wholesale Grocers in Smithfield. And that some Days after, Cartwright Richardson ask'd him (this Evidence) why he was afraid to put the Money off, telling him he had put off one of those Half Crowns at a Cheesemonger's Shop in Drury-lane over against Covent-Garden; but he reply'd, he would be no farther concern'd than he had been. And that then they bid him take care of the Tools, and he hid them under the Boards of a Floor in the Closet. That afterwards Austin Richardson was arrested, and he being with him in the Counter, he threatned to impeach him (this Witness) of Coining: Whereupon he thought best to secure himself, and therefore went to Mr. Morgan, who was ordered by Mr. Pinkney, Deputy-Warden of the Mint, to take care of the Affair of Coinage in his Absence, he being gone into the Country, and acquainted him with the Matter on Saturday the 22d of August. But being arrested on Monday on an Action of 20 l. by Cartwright Richardson, could not go to make out his Information as he had appointed Mr. Morgan, by reason that he was a Prisoner in the Marshalsea. Mr. Morgan depos'd, that March did come to him the 22d of August, and inform'd him that there were two Brothers that had been concerned in Coining, and he proposing to have them apprehended, he desired him to let it alone a Day or two longer, because one of the Brothers was out of the Way, promising he would come to him again the Monday following, but did not come; and on Tuesday a Person came to him, and told him that Cartwright Richardson had arrested March, thrown him into Prison, and so he could not come to him. That he advis'd him to get him to a Justice of the Peace to take his Examination; and that afterwards he having given an Account where the coining Utensils were, they went with an Officer to apprehend Cartwright Richardson (for Austin Richardson was then Prisoner in the Counter) at his House in Swan-Alley near St. James's, secured him, and took him with them the next Day when they went to sieze the Utensils.

Mr. Woodman depos'd, that having received a Note from Henry March, he went to him, and he giving him an Account that he had been put in Prison at the Suit of the Prisoners, that he might not give his Information against the Prisoners: He went to Mr. Morgan in the Tower, and Measures were concerned to get Justice Nichols to take March's Information, who went to the Prison to him and took it there; that he also went and talk'd with Cartwright Richardson, about arresting March, who sent for a Lawyer, to answer him; who speaking in the Plural Terms, owned, that March did not owe them 20 l. but did owe some Money, but there were some Reasons for arresting him, in such a Sum, beyond his Capacity of getting Bail, and had they known that he would have done such a Thing to hang them, they would hang him. And that when Cartwright saw the Utensils taken out, he sell into an Agony and Fit, and said, The Lord have Mercy upon him, there is enough to hang an hundred People; but said he knew nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172410140006"></xptr> nothing of the Matter, but could not say as to his Brother, he had an ill Character.

             depos'd, that when they went to apprehend Cartwright, at Austin's House in Swan Alley, he was deny'd; but searching the House they broke open a Chamber Door, and found him, he not opening it: That when they told him, that they apprehended him for High-Treason, he reply'd, I thought so. The finding the Tools as before depos'd. was confirm'd by several Evidences; and Moulds, Crucibles, and Pieces of melted Mettal were produc'd in Court; and also a false Half Crown, which March swore was one of those coined by the Prisoners and himself.</p>
               <p>The Prisoners in their Defence utterly deny'd the Fact, or having any Knowledge of the Utensils. As to the Utensils being found there, they insinuated they might be put there by March himself, by Way of Revenge, in that they had a Difference, he having pawned two of Austin's Clock Cases, and stole their Tools, for which they had threatened to arrest him; whereupon he threatened, That if they did, he would hang Austin. That March did come to Cartwright's House, on Sunday the 23 d of August (the Day after he had been and accused them to Mr. Morgan in the Tower) and desired to have the Key of the House in Black Raven Court, (where the Tools were found) under Pretence of showing it to an Acquaintance of his Wife's, a Midwife, in Order to take it, and kept the Key two Hours and a half, in which Time he might hide the Tools there, in Order to carry on his Plot against them. That he had the Key was prov'd by two Evidences, and that he kept it near two Hours, by one of them, though March pretended he brought it again in Half an Hour; but he did not produce this Midwife, or any Person, that did want to see it, in Order to take it. And it was highly probable, the Reason was, that when he went on the Saturday to Mr. Morgan, and gave him Notice of two Brothers, he did not consent to compleat his Information, not go immediately to apprehend them, but put it off till Monday, that he might have an Opportunity to get the Key on the Sunday, and put the Tools there: Which was more probable, in that his Pretence was, That Austin was out of the Way, when at the same Time he knew he was in the Compter. That as to their arresting him, it was not to prevent his proceeding in his Impeachment against them, but he did really owe them 4 l. 6 s. and call'd Evidences to prove it. That the Reason of arresting him for so much beyond that Sum was, Because they were bound for him in several Sums. And though he was not arrested 'till the Monday after he had informed against them, they knew nothing at all that he had done so; and though the Process against him was not Serv'd upon him, it had been entred Several Days before. To lessen the Credit of March's Evidence, they urg'd, He was a Person of an infamous Character, had pawn'd their Goods, stole their Tools, and did this in Revenge, because they had threatened to arrest him, for what he stood indebted to them. That he had been more than once convicted of Perjury, had stood in the Pillory at Rochester, and had burnt a Ship; but they had not Records to prove it. They call'd a great many Persons to their Reputation, who gave them a good Character. The Court also observ'd, in Favour of the Prisoners, That the Proof of the putting off the two Half Crowns, the one by Austin, the other by Cartwright, depended intirely on the Credit of March's Evidence, and that the Persons to whom they were said to be put off, tho' living at no great Distance, were not produc'd in Court, who might probably remember that they had about that Time taken such Money.

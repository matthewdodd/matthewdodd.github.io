             and Emma Lane, Lloyd, the prisoner, was then coming out at the parlour-door, and Haines and Emma Lane stopped him, and said, you are the man that has robbed Mrs. Uther; he said he was not the man, and that he was a man of consequence, and he was astonished that I should stop him in the street; he said he was a serjeant-major in the Sepulchre's corps; he said he could bring people forward to prove that; he begged that I would let him go; I said no, I will not let you go till you go back with me to my house, and I see what I have lost; accordingly I conducted him back, and when he came to my house I went up stairs to see what I had lost; I saw the second drawer at the top open; I looked in the drawer, and as I had laid my cloak there the day before the first thing, I missed it; I came down stairs, and desired they would detain him. In the mean time, the witness, Mr. Harris, brought my cloak in; Mr. Harris said, what have you lost; I said a black silk cloak lined with purple; he said, I have got it, it was thrown into my yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Mr. Harris live? - A. In Wilson-street, Finsbury-square; his premises lay back into Christopher's-alley, where the prisoner ran down.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the prisoner throw it away while you were following? - A. No; he had turned the corner too quick for me to see; Mr. Harris refused to give me the cloak till I sent for an officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. This was between twelve and one o'clock in the day time, when you and your children were at home? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What state was your outward door in? - A. The outward door was open, and the chamber-door was locked, and on the prisoner was found a key that would open it, and eleven other keys in his breeches, by Harper the officer; when I came down in the morning, I left two children in bed, and when they came down the eldest brought me the key, and said she had locked the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is your little girl? - A. Between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Q. The chamber-door, when you last saw it, was unlocked? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. The person, whoever it was in your passage, he said, good morning, and passed on very quick; you looked up your stair-case to see whether your door was fast or shut? - A. I did, and he passed on very fast.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after that you saw the person again? - A. Not more than a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost sight of him for a minute; where was it you first saw him again? - A. I saw him turn the corner of the alley where he dropped the cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. How far distant is your street-door from that alley? - A. My street-door is two doors from Wilson-street, and in Wilson-street I saw him turn down the alley.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw the prisoner down the alley, you observed him with his hat in his hand, talking about the election? - A. Yes; he ran very fast.</p>
               <p>Q. The person, whoever he was in your house, it was only a momentary sight you had of him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, madam, I am sure you give your evidence in a very decent and becoming manner, you would not undertake to swear to whom you had seen so momentarily? Will you undertake to swear that he is the man that was in your house? - A. What struck my curiosity was, his saying good morning to me, and then he made a little bit of a halt.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That made you take more notice? - A. Yes; when I met him on the stairs, he had on a blue coat, a striped waistcoat, and a pair of kerseymere breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. The alley that laid back from Wilson-street is Christopher's-alley, how low down from Wilson-street is that alley? - A. About five or six doors.</p>

             sworn. - I work in Christopher's-alley: I was going to dinner, I heard the alarm of stop thief; the prisoner was running down the alley, singing out Burdett for ever, no Man-warning; I thought it was a quarrel between the parties, so I let him run by me; still I heard the alarm of stop thief, and people running; then I ran after him, and followed him up to the house where he ran into; I did not rightly know, whether he went into the house or the yard; Mrs. Uther and some more people came up; I went into the passage and the yard, and looked into the privy, and seeing there was no way to get out there, I said, he must be in the house; I returned, and knocked at the parlour door, and asked if there had been such a person; they said, yes, there had been a person there, and offered a parcel, and they would not take it in; and coming out of the door this young woman laid hold of him, and said to me, is not this the young man; I said, this is the man that I followed.</p>

             sworn. - On the 26th of July a man came to the office door, and said a man was wanted in Crown-street; I went there directly to the prosecutor's house; when I came into the room there were several people there with the prisoner at the bar; Mrs. Uther gave me charge of the prisoner for opening her room door, and stealing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120023"></xptr>a silk cloak; I took the prisoner to the office, and there I searched him; in his waistcoat pocket was a small key, and in his breeches I found this handkerchief, and eleven keys tied up in it; they are common keys, of different sizes; I produced these keys before the Magistrate, and after the prisoner was examined I tried the door with one of the keys, and it opened it the same as any other key would do.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. I do not know whether you ever examined a serjeant of the guards? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. They are just the same sort of common storehouse keys which the serjeants of the guards have? - A. I do not know. (The cloak produced and identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>

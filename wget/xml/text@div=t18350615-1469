                  </hi>. I live in Upper John-street, Islington—the pri<lb></lb>soner came to my shop on the 16th of May, between eight and nine at night—she asked for a quarter of an ounce of five shilling tea, and half a pound of sixpenny sugar, which would come to four pence, and tendered me a bad half-crown—I said, "Where did you take this? "—she said, of a man, who she supposed was gone home from his work—I took the goods from before her, and went round to look for a policeman; but having no one there, I returned, after I had gone twenty or thirty yards—she was still in the shop—she said, "Is it a bad one, Sir?"—I said, "Yet; you know it is, and if I could see a policeman, I would have you taken up"—I retained the money, and she went away—I put the half-crown on a shelf, and marked it on the 19th, when I showed it to a policeman—I kept it till I produced it at Hatton-garden—this is it.</p>

My husband lives in Pulteney-street, White Conduit-fields—he is a cow-keeper—on the the 16th of May, the prisoner came about half-past nine o'clock at night—she asked Connolly for a pint of milk, and she gave her half-a-crown, which she gave to me—I returned it to her, and she went to get change—she then gave me the half-crown—I taxed the prisoner with it, and asked where she got it—she said a gen<lb></lb>tleman gave it her, at No. 13, Leman-street, and she was an unfortunate girl—I gave it to the officer.</p>

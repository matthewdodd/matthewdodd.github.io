I reside at Mulgrave Place, widow. The deceased was my husband, John Dorman, aged fifty-eight years; a labourer. I was present at his death, which occurred at 9.20 p.m. yesterday, 2nd August, at Mulgrave Place. On Thursday night, 27th July last, the deceased was at home with me. John Gordon, who lodges in the house, was going out to fetch a pot of beer. I was sitting down on the door<lb></lb>steps, and Gordon came prancing and dancing around me and pulling my dress, which I did not like. He put his foot against me and tumbled me down the steps. I got up and went in and told my husband what he had done, and I said to him (my husband) 'I might as well have no husband.' My husband got up and went into the passage. Gordon was there. I saw my husband thrown down by Gordon in the passage and Gordon standing over him. I helped my husband up and into his room. Gordon went out and shortly returned to our door. A tumbler was on the side table by the door. 'Gordon took up the tumbler and threw it with violence towards my husband, who sat in the chair about 3 yards off, and it struck him on the temple and the tumbler was broken. My husband neither spoke or moved, blood flowed from my husband's head. Gordon went into his own room. The police came and took Gordon into custody. My husband followed to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUGHES</hi>. The deceased had been two days on the sick list, he was a strong man. Twelve months ago he had a fall and cut bis head; he had been drinking then. He had a fall four months ago; he had a slight scratch then. Gordon and deceased were the best of friends. Gordon and deceased had both been drinking on the 27th. They were both in the Royal Artillery service together. The deceased had I been twice out that day to the Queen public-house. A staff stick is kept in my room. The stick produced was thrown into the room. I did not tell my husband to go and knock Gordon's brain out. He remained in bed till his death, except for about two or three hours on Monday last when he went out. I said to Gordon before he died I would make it up, and so my hus-band did. After the injury my husband had no drink, no beer', he had three glasses of port wine in the five days; he had nothing to drink after his pension day. I did not strike my husband with a buckle. He was not subject to fits; he would fall occasionally and that would be from overflow of blood to the head. <hi rend="italic">The mark of Eliza Dorman.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Dr. Sharp, divisional surgeon, of Woolwich—on 27th. July, I saw the deceased man at the station suffering from three wounds on the scalp, one above his right eye, one on his fore—head, one on the outer side of his right eye, and one near the occiput—I found no fracture, nor was he suffering from any symptoms which led me to suspect fracture—I dressed the wounds, and on August 1st, I was sent for and found him lying on the floor in a dangerous and unconscious state—I prescribed for him and saw him again next morning—he was still uncon<lb></lb>Bcions except for two minutes when he said that he felt his head very bad—he died on 2nd August, and on 4th August I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> and found a fracture of the skull and a large clot of blood on the surface of the brain-death was caused by pressure of the blood on the brain from the wound over the right eye—the skull was fractured there, and it was such a fracture as might be caused by a blunt instrument—the scalp Around there had been healed—he was recovering from the effects of drink when I first saw <hi rend="italic">him.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were other bruises on his forehead which appeared to be quite recent—the fracture was not the result of the bruises—his liver was that of a man who had drank rather hard.</p>

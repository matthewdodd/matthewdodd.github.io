                  </hi>. I live at Chelsea. I married the prisoner on the 6th of July, 1837, at Paddington-church, in the name of Thomas Russell—I am sure that is the truth—I know his father when I see him—I did not go with his father any where—I did not go to his father's house—I with the prisoner two years and a quarter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am parish-clerk of Thames Ditton, in Surrey. I produce the register of marriages, at that church—on the 23rd of June, 1834, there was a marriage between Thomas Russell, bachelor, and Ann Stevenson, spinster—the prisoner is the man who was married—I know Stevenson—I saw her alive last Monday, at Marylebone.</p>

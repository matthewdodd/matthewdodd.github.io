                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mrs. Elizabeth Cook, at the Home-office, Whitehall—the prisoner was the housemaid. On Friday the 20th of July, I put a £5 Bank note into my purse in the top drawer in Mrs. Cook's bed-room—I went to Brentford on the Saturday following—I returned in the evening—I looked into the drawer, and found three £5 notes were left in the purse, and one had been taken out—Mrs. Cook spoke to the prisoner, and she said she had never seen such a thing since she had been in the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of John Dixon, the landlord of the Rose and Crown. On the 21st of July the prisoner came to our house with a jog—she asked for change for a £5 note—I took the note, and got five sovereigns at Mrs. Carpenter's, in King-street—I put them on the bar, and she took them up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. I went to the Home-office, and asked the prisoner if she knew any thing about the note—that was before twelve o'clock—she said she did not—I made a variety of inquiries, and told her she must consider herself in custody, I should take her away, but before I did so she must be searched, which was done in another room, by a female—after six o'clock in the evening, I went with the prosecutrix into the beer cellar, and found three sovereigns and eleven shillings.</p>

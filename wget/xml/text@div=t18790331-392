I live at 5, John's Road—at 12.30 on the morning of March 6th I saw the prisoner pushing the door of No. 7, as I was coming from a dance with a friend—he seemed to be cross, and pushed the door with both hands—I said, "Go away; what is the use of your standing at the door?"—he said, "That is nothing"—I said, "She has got one young man; she can't open the door, and can't stop with you"—I then went in and shut the door—I saw him again from my bedroom window about 1 o'clock, pushing at No, 7 again—I opened my window and said, "Go away and don't make a noise, disturbing people"—he went down a little court, and I went in and shut my window.</p>

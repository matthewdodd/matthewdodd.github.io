                  </hi>. I belong to the barque Queen of the Fleet—the prisoner was a seaman on board—on 27th July about 1.15 I was on the main hatch when the man named George Frank ran by me, crying "Murder, murder, help"—I was then struck from behind on my left side two or three times by the prisoner, who ran after Porthouse, another seaman, who was too smart for him and got away on the poop—I also ran on to the poop and the chief officer ran into the pilot-house and shut both doors, so I was left alone on deck with the prisoner—I went down from the poop and took this knife from him (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I threw him down and when I got up I was weak from loss of blood and was taken down into the cabin—the prisoner had been in the crew about four months, there had been no ill-feeling between us, and up to that time he had been a quiet man—he had been kept from liquor about twenty-five days; I received altogether six—wounds in my left side—they are pretty near together—I was taken to the hospital, and afterwards brought to London—this happened about twelve hours from Antwerp—my wounds are healed but I feel pain internally and also suffer from shortness of breath.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a seaman on board this vessel—on 27th July, I heard a cry of help—I went on deck, I saw the prisoner threaten Porthouse with a knife—Porthouse ran away; my watch was below—I went on deck again—the prisoner had a knife in his fist, and was going up to Pratt's side—he struck Pratt two or three times with a knife—he was afterwards knocked down and the knife taken from him—he made no complaints—I undressed Pratt, his wounds were nearly together—there were two large ones, the others were lightly touched—this occurred about 1.30, or 1.45 in the night.</p>

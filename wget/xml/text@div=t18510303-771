I went to lodge at Mrs. Hill's—I went by the name of Sheridan there—I remember Lewis coming to me in Goodge-street—I was going in my own name then—Maria Ball persuaded me to go by the name of Sheridan—I applied to Mrs. Hill for lodgings for myself and another, and a person to nurse me—I took it as Mrs. Sheridan; I went out that night and returned about nine with Lewis—Mrs. Hill remonstrated with me for bringing a man—I said it was my husband; I knew he was coming—he passed as Mr. Sheridan—he was not drunk—Mrs. Hill did not come up<lb></lb>stairs and find Sheridan and me in bed together—Miss Lewis asked if I could be accommodated with a little coal if anything happened—it was a double bed-room—several gentlemen came while I was confined, amongst them Sheridan—I am quite sure of the day of the birth of my child, it was nearly a week after I was at Hill's—Sheridan did not sleep with me the Saturday, Sunday, or Monday—the Wednesday after Johnson, my brother-in-law, came and saw me—he asked me if I'd had that fellow there—I told Mrs. Hill, Sheridan was my husband—my brother said, 'Now,. Mary Ann, what do you think of yourself, and the fellows of this town'—Mrs. Hill came and said she had been told I was not a married woman—I said, 'Oh, yes, I am'—she did not say 'If you are married, where were you married?"—I did not say at Shrewsbury—she did not say she was a native, and which of the two Churches was it—I told her the mar<lb></lb>riage-lines were in Sheridan's pocket—I did not say to her the coat was in pledge, I said so to Lewis; that was a story—Sheridan did not come that night, nor in my bedroom, and undress himself partly—after my confinement I used to sit in the kitchen—she (Mrs. Hill) did not say, 'You will think it very hard of my not letting your husband come, if I was mar<lb></lb>ried'—I never told Mrs. Hill I went from my father's house to get married to Sheridan, and had spent about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and pawned all my clothes, and that I had been with Sheridan nine months—Sheridan was in the house the night I was confined—Mrs. Hill took the child down for him to see—I never said to her the child was Sheridan's—I was out not more than one night; I sat up all night at Mrs. Waters's—Sheridan was not with me—I vas not out three nights—I told Mrs. Hill I had been sitting up at Mrs.</p>

               <p>Waters's—I said nothing about Sheridan—Mrs. W. Rogers and Lewis paid the midwife; I gave Jane Lewis 3. myself—I recollect being here for the summons—we did not go to Goodge-street, and inquire for a coffee-house, or to Tottenham Court-road; we went to the Mews—I saw Sheridan that day at a coffee-shop, opposite where I am staying—Lewis was with me—I have not seen Sheridan since—on 26th Jan., about seven in the evening, I was in Goodge-street, in company with Sheridan, my child, and another—I applied to a milkman to know where I could get lodgings—I went to Matthews's; had two rooms, one was for Lewis, the other for me and my baby, nobody else—Sheridan had a bed to himself with the little boy in another room—on 31st Jan. I went to fetch Lewis, and returned with her next day—we staid there till the day before we applied for the summons—Sheridan did not say it would not do for him to stay with me after the summons was taken out—I and Sheridan did not sleep together at Matthews's, or the other house; he did not send me for Lewis—I saw Sheridan most days from the time of my coming to town, till taking out the summons—after I left my father's, I went to my uncle's—Sheridan did not stay with me—in Wolverhampton I represented Sheridan as my husband—I never employed him to write for me; I can write—the paper now shown me is Sheridan's writing, he wrote it of his own account—the three papers now shown me are my writing."—Re<lb></lb>examined: "I never had any connection with Sheridan—I left my father's in Sept. because I was pregnant, to hide my shame—I took with me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., my savings—Sheridan did not go with me, I met with him down at Liverpool—I went by the name of Sheridan at Wolverhampton, because I did not want my father to know but what I was married.")—Jane Lewis was examined as a witness for her—witnesses were examined on the part of the then defendant, and the summons was dismissed, and Parkers and Lewis were charged with perjury.</p>

               <p>to the memorandum-book which Merriman keeps—I should think it was between seven and eight o'clock when Mr. Richmond came—I cannot speak exactly to the time—I do not think I had been out for two hours previous to his arrival—I should say certainly not after five or six—I re<lb></lb>member that, by Mr. Lowe lunching there that day, from the date of the day being brought before me—I believe that was the same day that Mr. Richmond come—he did not dine with me that day—he dined in the breakfast-room—the drawing-room is on the same floor—I joined him after dinner, and remained with him from nine I should think till twelve, trans<lb></lb>acting business—he had been my agent before for my Ashton-under-Lyne property, but at this time be became my general agent for the whole of my property, which circumstance fixes this interview more strongly in. my memory—I went to bed that night about twelve—I did not leave the Hail that evening—the first time I ever saw the prisoner was about 50th Jan., this year, when she came to me at Hill-street, Berkeley-square—the prisoner was shown into my library by my servant Topham—I had received a letter that day—it is burnt—that was the first letter I had received—I was standing near the fire when she came in—the tat at the other end of the room by the door—no one else was present—I asked her what she wanted to see me for—I cannot say exactly the words she said—the said, "I am in a very deplorable condition; my name it Mary Ann Parkes; I am the daughter of Parkes, of the Hyde, you are the father of the child that is here"—she had no child with her—I do not know whether the meant in the house, or the street—she said, "You were walking with Mr. Jesson in the village of Enville; you were both very <hi rend="italic">groggy.</hi> you took me to the Cat, and the result of that interview was the child; you promised to meet me in the Rookery next day"—I said I had never seen her in my life before—she repeated that I was the father of the child—I told her to go out of the room, rang the bell, and Topham came—while he was there, she said she must go to law, if I would not support the child—the said nothing to me about the letter I had received, to my recollection—I received a communication from Mr. Day, a solicitor, that evening—I called on him, and he finally ceased to act—I have never had any improper in<lb></lb>tercourse with the prisoner—it is very unlikely that she has known me for twenty-one years—I do not know her—I did not tee her, that I recollect, on 28th Feb., 1850—I do not know her father's house at the Hyde—I was not in the habit of going there when a boy—I have never been there—I have never been to the village—I have been to the iron-works there once—they are about two miles from Enville—I afterwards received two other letters—I burnt one, and preserved the other—this is it.</p>

               <p>Monday, and Tuesday—after some time I asked whether she was married, and a Mr. Johnson, who she said was her brother-in-law, came—after he was gone, I went straight to her, and said, "Mrs. Sheridan, I am informed you are not married"—she said, "I am"—I said, "If you are, show me your marriage <hi rend="italic">lines.</hi> and then you will put the world at defiance"—I put it to her twice, and she said so twice—I asked her where she was married, and she said, "In Shrewsbury"—I said, "Where I am a native, and I know it well"—she gave me no answer—she said her mar<lb></lb>riage <hi rend="italic">lines</hi>. were in the pocket of Sheridan's coat, which was in pledge, and that he was the father of the child—on the night she was confined, he slept on a sofa—on the next night I would not allow him to sleep in the house—I asked her how she met with such a fellow as Sheridan—she said at her father's house, he was a policeman, and came there on business about nine months ago—they left my house on New Year's day—Sheri<lb></lb>dan had left some days before—I turned him out.</p>

I was called to the labour of the prisoner about eleven o'clock—she was delivered about half-past three in the morning—while she was in labour she cried—the nurse, Jane Lewis, asked her why she cried—I did not hear the answer, and I asked her—she said because she was so reduced—I asked her how long she had been married—she said, "Up<lb></lb>wards of ten months"—Jane Lewis said, in the prisoner's presence, that she would pay me as soon as Mr. Sheridan had got change for a sovereign—I called the prisoner "Mrs. Sheridan."</p>

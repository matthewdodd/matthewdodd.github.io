               <p>GRANT HEWITT sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Bailey, the prisoner asked me to shew her some printed cotton, and said, she wanted nine yards of one to make a gown; I asked her two shillings and four-pence per yard for it, she bid me sixteen-pence; I told her to get out of the shop, or I would have her turned out, she being in liquor; she asked me to shew her some stanner; I shewed her some, and sold her three yards, at a shilling per yard, which she paid for; she then asked for some muslin, which I sold her a small quantity of; she wanted a bill very much; I suspected her, and was rather dubious of leaving the counter, but I did, and as she was crossing the shop, the print was discovered; I did not see her take it, there were two or three other customers in the shop. (The pieces of printed cotton produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went into this gentleman's house, and bought four yards of flannel; I was very heavy in liquor, and went to put the slannel under my cloak, and whether the piece of print stuck to it I don't know; I have only been three weeks in this country.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bailey. The flannel was laying on the counter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 30, Richardson Street, Bermondsey—about 12 o'clock at night, on 9th April, I was in the Borough Road—I stopped for a purpose—some men came up to me—one seized me by the throat, one held my hand, and the third held the other hand, and one rifled my pockets—I called out in the best way I could, and a policeman came up—I did not lose anything, to my knowledge—part of my guard was broken—I had had a glass or two, but I knew what I was about—I had never seen the men before.</p>

About 1 o'clock on 10th April, I was in Rockinghara Street, and heard a noise, went up, and saw three men rifling the prosecutor's pockets, and the prisoner holding him by the throat on the pavement—the other three men escaped, but I took the prisoner from the prosecutor—he said, "I have lost my watch," but it was in his pocket safe.</p>

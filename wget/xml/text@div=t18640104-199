I am the wife of William White, who keeps a re<lb></lb>freshment house at 94, High-street, Woolwich—on 22d December, the prisoner came in for two pennyworth of pork, and put down a shilling—I said that it was bad—he said that I was labouring under a mistake—I put it into the test, and showed him that it was bad—he said that I could not tell by that, and he could bend a halfpenny by that if I would allow him—I said, "You tried to pass a bad two-shilling piece on me, five or six weeks back"—he denied it, but said that he might have been in the shop if he wanted anything—I told him he had passed bad money to me several times before—he said that he could prove he never did such a thing, and that he took the shilling in change for a half-sovereign—less than three months before, I had served him with 3/4b. of pork, and he gave me a half-crown—I gave him change, and then said, "You have given me a bad half-crown"—he said, "Well, don't holloa; a bad half-crown will sound hollow, but I have got plenty more"—I gave it to him back, and he gave me a good one—I cannot positively say whether he came again, but I took another—I am not certain from whom—I gave the bad shilling to the policeman.</p>

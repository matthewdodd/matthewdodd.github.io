                  </hi>. I am a rule-manufacturer, of 25, Old Compton-street, Soho. On Saturday morning, Aug. 28rd, about 6 o'clock, or 20 minutes afterwards, I was in my parlour behind the shop, and heard some one trying to turn the lock of my private street-door—they succeeded, came in, and shut the door again—I then heard something like a dog, or a person without shoes, going along the passage—somebody knocked at the door, and as I went to open it, the prisoner and another man opened it, and rushed out of the passage—I cried, "stop thief!" followed them, and saw the prisoner taken</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185109150002"></xptr>
               <p>—I afterwards went into the kitchen, and missed two gowns, six muslin curtains, and other articles; thirty or forty altogether—I have not seen them since—they must have been wrung out of the tub, and placed ready, and the persons must have entered the house for them a second time—they had not time to do it when I heard them in the passage—I did not miss the articles till I returned from the police-station.</p>

I went to work at his house on 23rd Aug.—I knocked at the door about 10 minuteof a quarter-past six o'clock—it was opened by the prisoner and another man, who had a bundle under his arm—they rushed by me, out of the house—I hallooed, "Stop thief!" ran after the prisoner, and saw him taken by a policeman—the other man got away—they had shoes on.</p>

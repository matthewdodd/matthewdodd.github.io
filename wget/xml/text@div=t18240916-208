I entrusted him to receive money for me. I had a customer of the name of Mariner, who lived in Great Surry-street, Blackfriars; he was indebted to me 37 l. 3 s. 6 d. in the month of January last, for which the prisoner never accounted to me; it was his duty to account to me for what he received from day to day, immediately that he returned; he left me one Thursday in the latter end of March. I never saw him again till Wednesday fortnight - he was in my debt when he left.</p>

            . I am a linen-draper. In the month of July last, I paid the prisoner 37 l. 3 s. 6 d. for Mr. Hathaway - here is his receipt for it. I am certain I paid him some sovereigns, but I cannot tell whether I paid him any notes or not. I have paid him several sums of money. I cannot say whether I saw him write the receipt or not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I lost 40 l. from my side pocket, and thinking to overcome my loss, I sold goods for less than I ought to do, and intended to make it known to Mr. Hathaway, but he sent for an officer.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Are you sure of that? - A. I am; upon that I turned my horse about to take off the party to go home; upon that the prisoner called out to make fast the gates; I knew his voice; he said, lock the gate, and was answered by a voice, unknown to me, that all was fast already; the prisoner then said, the d-d b-rs of light horsemen are here again, shoot them, shoot them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Are you sure that was the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150011"></xptr>soner's voice? - A. Yes; there was a large company of people assembled upon a rising hill, in a bit of ground adjoining his house; there might be twenty, more or less; they were about sixty or seventy yards from where the prisoner was; upon that the company began to give huzza, huzza, and as I was passing on, I saw

             and Edward Martin, jun. who lived in the house, I believe; my lads, says I, you had better behave, as there is some person here now that knoweth you; Hodges said to Martin, I believe that is Arnold, is not that Arnold's voice; upon that I passed by them in a direction to come away off in a little gentle trot, and as we had got to the summit of the hill, just as we had to pass over a rivulet of water, I heard a voice say, fire; I cannot say whether it was the prisoner's voice or not, and immediately a gun was discharged; we went on to the gate, and they continued firing upon us, I should suppose there were twenty guns discharged, more or less; when we came to the gate, we found it chained and padlocked; we got off our horses and broke the gate open as soon as we could; I never knew that gate locked in my life before; it is a road leading to the sea-side, and also to the farm-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether those guns were loaded or not? - A. Yes; I heard several balls; there was one just at the gate, which I thought would have gone through one of the horses, but it did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You don't know who discharged any of the guns? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. I now ask you, upon your solemn oath, if you have any doubt as to the voice, or as to the person of the prisoner? - A. I have none.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Erskine. Q. You are speaking of the 6th of September? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning was it when you first came upon the premises of the prisoner? - A. About six o'clock; we were there six or seven hours.</p>
               <p>Q. He was taking in his wheat? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were there assisting him in getting in his harvest? - A. Ten or a dozen persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner that morning? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You searched his house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the search of his house did any body accompany you besides Twentyman? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you molested by the prisoner? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you rudely addressed by him? - A. Twentyman and he had some words.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he obstruct you in your search? - A. He treated me very well.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you something to drink, I believe? - A. I drank a glass of brandy with him.</p>
               <p>Q. He was getting in his harvest - you having actually searched his house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you found nothing? - A. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted that you searched every where that your duty suggested? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you all went away from his premises? - A. Twentyman and I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. To a cove by the sea side, which is a place, I understand, very open to smuggling? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you had entirely finished your search at Bawden's premises? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your design, or did you communicate your design to Bawden, or any of his servants, or any body you knew connected with him, that you intendeded to search over again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard the words b-rs of dragroons, shoot them, had you not passed his house? - A. We had passed under his house towards the sea-side.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you going? - A. To the beach, to look for smuggled goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you going when you saw the prisoner, and heard his voice? - A. I was going up where the soldiers gave me directions, that he was seventy yards from his house.</p>
               <p>Q. If the dragoon had not told you there were people behind the hedge, you and all your party would have gone home? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if the dragoon had not led you back to the house of Bawden, you would have gone homeward, having examined his house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When I am defending a man, who is trying for his life, I do not mean to impute to you an intention to swear that which is not true, but we are all liable to be mistaken; in the first place, you have stated the distance to be about twenty yards; what time of night was it? - A. Eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. The sixth of September? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not as light as day? - A. No, it was a fine moonlight night.</p>
               <p>Q. By moonlight, at the distance of twenty yards, and a hedge between you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you swear that you saw the prisoner by moonlight, at the distance of twenty yards, and a hedge intervening, I take it you mean to say that you believe you saw him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it has happened to you, as it has happened to all of us in our turns, not wickedly, to take a false oath against a man; but I believe it has happened to you, that you have mistakes one man for another - Are you as sure of that as you are that you saw the prisoner? - A. I am sure I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it never happened to you to make a mistake of one person for another, to make a charge upon one man, and afterwards find out that you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150012"></xptr>were mistaken? - A. I once called a man forward for a hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. It so happens, I see, that the Nobleman is here who was the Magistrate upon that occasion; did you not swear to one man and afterwards find it was another? - A. I said I would not swear to May, but to Crease.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you believed May to be the other man? - A. No; I said I could not swear to him; the Collector says the information, not me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not think it was May? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not send for a man of the name of Orgill, and then see your mistake? - A. No; I told my Lord, before-hand, that I could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard at this time the words, the d-d b-is of light horsemen are here again; had they been with you in the morning? - A. No; only Twentyman and me together.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you heard the words, shoot them, shoot them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time there was no firing in consequence of those words? - A. Not directly.</p>
               <p>Q. There were two persons there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the other? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard these expressions, where did you go? - A. We took our route to go right away home.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing this gate had not had a chain and padlock upon it, would you not have passed it without taking any notice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was nto a chain and padlock that you had over seen upon the gate before? - A. Never before.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you broke them, and went through? - A. We unhung the gate behind.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was the place where you saw the man behind the hedge, from the gate? - A. I should suppose it must be three hundred yards or more, I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to the gate when the firing took place, or had you passed through? - A. No; we were two hundred yards from the gate, I should suppose, when the first firing was.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was that from the house of the prisoner - a quarter of a mile? - A. No, one hundred and fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from the gate to the prisoner's house? - A. Two or three hundred yards; I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot take upon you to say what became of those two men after you saw them, and after you heard the words, shoot, shoot? - A. No, I cannot tell what became of then after that, it is impossible, I was going from them.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance of time was there between your hearing those words, and your coming to the rivulet where you was fired at? - A. Three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance might that be - you was riding; - A. We walked our houses, I walked my horse, and the dragoons met, it might be four or five hundred yards, I apprehend; I am speaking as near as I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there were several shots, by some wicked persons, fired at you? - A. There were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any body say, fire, fire? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to say that it was the prisoner's voice? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Somebody unknown, said, fire, fire; and then the guns were fired? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no mischief happened - I do not mean that that circumstance lessens the wickedness of the persons? - A. There was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. When the information was taken before a noble Lord, against May and another, are you conscious of having charged any man, and I did not swear to him, I only called him forward, and told my Lord, I could not swear to him, and he was discharged, and the other was fined two guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the house only that you were to search for smuggled goods? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the fields? - A. By the sea-side; we thought they might have been moving the goods in the night.</p>
               <p>Mr. E<note>[Text unreadable in original.]</note>skine. Q. My Learned Friend Must have misunderstand what you said to me, and what I said to you - you said, but for the dragoons you should have gone home? - A. Yes, I should have went home.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How far was this large company upon the rising ground from the hedge where you saw the prisoner? - A. About sixty or seventy yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see these two persons with the twenty persons? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. How loud were the words spoken by the prisoner? - A. Pretty well as loud as he could speak.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they spoken loud enough to be heard by the people upon the hill? - A. It was loud enough to be heard a mile and more.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the distance from which the answer proceeded? - A. Three or four hundred yards; I cannot say for certain.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any answer made? - A. There might be one, but I did not hear any; I apprehended some violence was going to ensue, I did not pay any great attention.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a public highway that the gate crossed? - A. It was the common road from Withiam.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the way to the cliff? - A. No, it is a gate that leads from the high-road to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a gate which people commonly use as well the prisoner's servants, as the public at large? - A. Yes, it is quite a common gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find that gate locked before that night? - A. No, I never saw it locked before.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it at this time that made you apprehend danger? - A. It struck me, that that was the case; there were a number of men there, holloaing, and making a violent noise, huzzaing; there were a great number of them together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards hear or observe any thing that increased your fear? - A. I heard a noise, to the best of my recollection, cry, shoot the b-rs; there were several, I believe, said that; I then retreated towards the gate that I came in at, and found it locked; I was going to tell the party we could not get through that way, and I heard a bullet pass between me and our party; then we went towards the gate, a number of guns were find till we had got the gate open.</p>
               <p>Q. How many guns were fired? - A. I did not pay much attention.</p>
               <p>Q. How many do you guess? - A. I can't say how many.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there half a dozen? - A. I think there were that or more.</p>
               <p>Q. From whence were those guns fired? - A. From some persons ftanding pretty near Bawden's house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards do you think from Bawden's house these people were placed? - A. I suppose the gate is three hundred yards from the house; it is impossible for me to say whether they fired from the house or where.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How far, according to the best of your judgment, were the peaople who fired from the house? - A Fifteen yards perhaps, or so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Erskine. Q. You cannot understand the question, I think? - A. I don't pretend to speak positively.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. To the best of your recollection, how far were there people from the house? - A. It might be perhaps about ten yards, or a trifle more; I might be three hundred yards from the place where the guns were fired, and the gate was further.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think they might continue firing? - A. Some few minutes perhaps.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp - Q. I understood you to say, it was not so light a night as you had observed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Several witnesses make use of the word shoot; did not you say so? - A. I said I thought there were.</p>
               <p>Q. You were about three hundred yards distant from where the persons fired? - A. I cannot speak positively.</p>
               <p>Q. It was near that? - A. I suppose it was.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Jackson. I am serjeant in the 2d regiment of the Queen's dragoons; I was with Arnold and Pettitt on the 6th of September last, at Goodriddy; about ten o'clock in the evening Arnold and I went down to the cliff, and ordered Pettitt and the other four dragoons to stay in the field to see that nobody fired upon us, or threw any stones; and as we were coming home some person cried out, lock the gate; Mr. Arnold, Mr. Pettit, and four dragoons were with me at that time; then we came on very gently, and coming under the hill, near Bawden's house, I saw a numbher of men upon that hill.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was that hill from the house? - A. About seventy yards; and coming a little further, there was a dog set upon us; Arnold said, is there no one that can shoot the dog? upon which I drew my pistol, and fired at the dog, but missed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you saw the dog, had you heard them make use of any particular language - bad they called out? - A. To lock the gate, and I heard somebody cry, the gate was already locked; when I fired and missed the dog, they fired upon us from the top of the hill.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there upon the hill do you suppose? - A. I suppose a dozen or twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. How many shots were fired? - A. Two or three, before we got to the gate; when we got to the gate, we found it fastened; I ordered a dragoon to dismount and unhang the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. How many shots? - A. I suppose there might be twenty; I did not hear more 
than three myself.</p>




               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Erskine. Q. Had this gate not been shut, you were in your way home? - A. Yes, we were going home then.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150014"></xptr>Q. Had not the gate been locked, you would have passed through it? - A. Yes, we should have gone home quietly.</p>


               <p>Q. It was immediately upon your firing off this pistol at the dog, that the firing took place? - A. Yes, from the hill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. Q. Do you happen to know how far a musket will carry a ball? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, which, after being revised by his Counsel, was read as follows:"I leave my case to my Counsel; I cannot impute to Mr. Arnold, or to the witnesses who have given evidence against me, the wicked design of falsely swearing away my life; I have no doubt they were fired at in the manner they have sworn, and are only mistaken in imputing it to me; the situation of the farm I occupy under Lord De Dunstanville, is upon a very exposed and remote part of the sea coast of Cornwall, where there is a great deal of smuggling; my house had been searched in the morning: no violence or resistance, or any such disposition, has been imputed to me; on the contrary, I behaved with civility to Arnold, and there was no temptation which could lead to the commission of such desperate wickedness; I had no malice to Arnold, or to the persons with him, I was a stranger; they had made no seizure, nor had I any to apprehend; they had searched peaceably, and having found nothing, were retiring to a distance from the village; they had done me no violence, they had offered me no provocation to the wicked attack made upon them; I declare most solemnly, in the presence of God, I was, and am yet a stranger; at the time it was made, I was with the persons who had assisted me through the day in bringing in my corn; the report of the firing was heard by all of us at a considerable distance, and I intreat the Court to hear their evidence in support of my innocence; the distance of the place where I live, makes it impossible for me to be at the expence of bringing up my neighbours and acquaintance to speak what they know of my disposition; but I have a certificate from most respectable persons, if the Court can receive it: Lord De Dunstanville, my landlord, will, I am persuaded, bear witness that he believes me incapable of the wickedness imputed to me. Gentlemen of the Jury, I commit my life with confidence to your humane and impartial judgment.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Lord DE DUNSTANVILLE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Erskine. Q. Your Lordship has a considerable estate in this neighbourhood? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the prisoner is a tenant of your's? - A. Yes; I have known him personally these two years, by reputation four or five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe him to be a man capable of the desperate wickedness imputed to him in this indictment? - A. By what I know of him, I should certainly think not; I never heard any thing against the man, except that he certainly has been suspected of smuggling; I know nothing against him; I always understood him to be a very quiet, sober man.</p>
               <p>Q. And your Lordship does not think him capable of the desperate wickedness of shooting at another? - A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your Lordship recollect the circumstance of Arnold bringing May and Crease before you; I have a saint recollection of it, and I think it was as you have stated it.</p>

               <p>Q. And what were you doing all that time? - A. We got supper; Mr. Bawden made some liquor for us, and we were drinking till eleven; then a woman came, and said, there were horses come upon the cliff; Mr. Bawden got up, put his back against the door, and insisted that every man should go to his seat; we heard the firing of the guns.</p>

               <p>Q. How many were there of you? - A. Eleven.</p>

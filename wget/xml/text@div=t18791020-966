                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant R</hi>). On 2nd September I took the prisoner at the Marquis of Lome public-house, Woolwich, and told her she would be charged with marrying James Middleton, her first husband being then alive—she said "I was in a convent, and my mother compelled me to marry him against my will"—I took her to the station—I have compared this certificate (<hi rend="italic">of the second marriage</hi>) with the original, and it is correct.</p>

I am a private in the 108th Foot, at Portsmouth—I know the prisoner, and was present in 1872 at her marriage with James Coyle at a Roman Catholic Chapel in Deesa, Bombay—James Coylo was in my regiment—I last saw him about five seconds ago—they were married with the consent of the commanding officer—she went with the regiment, and came home with it in 1876, and remained with it till he was discharged.</p>

I am a shoeing smith in the Royal Horse Artillery, Woolwich—I first became acquainted with the prisoner in April last, and went through the ceremony of marriage with her on 25th August at the Registry Office—she gave the name ot Margaret Gillas, and represented herself as a single woman, and about a fortnight afterwards her husband came and claimed her—I have not lived with her since.</p>

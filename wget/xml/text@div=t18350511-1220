                  </hi>. I live in George-street, London-fields. I did lodge at the prisoner's house in Great Cam bridge-street—I am married, and sell coals on commission—I occupied her two parlours on the ground-floor, and the top room—the prisoner appeared to be the landlady—I missed a flute.</p>

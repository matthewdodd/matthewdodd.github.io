               <p>Magistrate of the County. The prisoner lived in a house adjoining my father's stable—for some time past we have missed wood and planks there is some here which I had seen safe on our premises about two or three months ago—I have frequently seen the prisoner on our premises in consequence of which I made a remark to my father, and went, on the 2nd of November, with Mr. Pritchard, the inspector, to the prisoner's premises—Mr. Pritchard told him we had come to look over his pre<lb></lb>mises to search for my father's wood—he said he was sure there was none of my father's property there, and we were welcome to look—we went into the yard and found two pieces of plank—it was then an entire bit, but has beet sawn since—the prisoner said, "Master John, it does not belong to you it is part of a shed I bought of Mr—," some name that I cannot recollect—I brought it home—we went into the cellar and found the picket pos behind the door—he said he had used that to put down some posts, and said it was my father's—he had no right to take any of my father's pro<lb></lb>perty—I found other things which I believed to be my father's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the horse-patrol. I went to the prisoner's premises, and found the things—on looking round, Mr. Peter Mallard said, "Here is some of my wood "—the prisoner said, "No, Sir—he said, "Yes, it is "—the prisoner said, "Mr. John gave me that, if it is yours "—Mr. Mallard doubted that, and said he would call his son; and we went in together—we found the picket post and some pieces of willow in the cellar, which young Mr. Mallard claimed as his father's—the pri<lb></lb>soner said Mr. John Mallard had given him a piece of willow to make toy for his children—Mr. Mallard said he did not give him this piece—the prisoner then said he took them, thinking there was no harm in it—Mr-Mallard asked him how he accounted for the plank coming to his premiwi—he said he could not account for it, and then begged Mr. Mallard's par<lb></lb>don, and hoped he would forgive him.</p>

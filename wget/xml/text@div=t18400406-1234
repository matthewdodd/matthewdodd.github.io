                  </hi>. I live at the house of Mary Kingsmill, in Ball-yard, Belton-street, St. Giles's. I have known the prisoner some time—he was in the habit of coming backwards and forwards to the house. On Wednes<lb></lb>day morning the 1st of April, I had 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in a box in my room—I locked the box and put the key into my pocket—I laid the box on a table by the kitchen door—it could be seen from the street through the window—I locked the kitchen door safely, and brought the key away—about six o'clock that evening, on returning home, I found the kitchen door burst open—the hasp was pulled out—my box was on the table broken open, and the money gone—I went in search of the prisoner, and found him in the kitchen when I returned—I charged him with robbing me—he said he had robbed me, and spent part of the money, and he would give me his clothes next morning to pawn to make it up—I gave him in charge, but he was dis<lb></lb>charged before the Magistrate, as I had not the witness I have now, and I did not think of telling the Magistrate what the prisoner had said to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am twelve years old, and live with my father in the same house as the prosecutor—the prisoner formerly lived in the same street—I have often seen him. On the evening of the 1st of April, a little before six o'clock I went into the yard and saw the prisoner come through the passage—he went down the kitchen stairs, pulled the hasp out of the door, went in, got the poker, and broke open the box—I ran down the area, looked through the window, and saw him take the money out of the box and put it into his pocket—he came out and went into Broad-street—I told the prosecutor, and he went in search of him—I am quite sure he is the person.</p>

Q.</hi> How long have you known the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A good long while—I know him perfectly—I was at the top of the kitchen stain when I saw him do this—the kitchen stairs lead into the yard—the street door is not left open, but on the latch—any body could open it—I knew where the box was because I used to go into the room—I always saw the box there—it was locked—I did not know there was money in it—I could see it was silver money he took—there ware no halfpence—it was 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Dennis told me so—the prisoner took it out with his hand—he broke the box open with a poker—it was a good large box, about two feet by one—he knocked the front piece of wood out—I watched him because I saw him making a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> at the kitchen door polling out the hasp—the kitchen door is at the foot of the stairs directly opposite it—I was on the kitchen stairs when I saw him take up the poker—I then ran round, looked down the area, and saw him break the box open—I could see down to the door from the stairs—I did not tell Toomey what evidence I was going to give to-day—I have had no quarrel with the prisoner.</p>

I went with Barton for him to point out where be stood when he saw the kitchen door broken open—it is on the landing at the head of the stain—I could see the kitchen door from that place—he afterwards took me outside to look down the area—a person there could see the box on the table, and all that passed in the kitchen.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Does the kitchen open straight from the top of the staircase? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the window is about a yard on the right on the side facing the door—I could just see the edge of the window from the stair<lb></lb>case—the box was on the table in front of the door, not a yard from the window—I could see the table when the door was open—it stood between the door and window—the boy described every thing to me—when Too<lb></lb>mey gave the prisoner in charge he mentioned what the prisoner had done, but did not state about his confession the first time.</p>

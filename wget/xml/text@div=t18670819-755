                  </hi> I am a merchant, and reside at 41, Bedford Square—between nine and ten on the evening of the 25th July I was in Caroline Street—I noticed three or four men—the prisoner was one of them—when I got to the corner of Tavistock Street there was one on each side of me, and the prisoner in front—he grasped my watch—the chain broke—I took the watch out of his hand—he ran away and I followed—when nearly at the top of Caroline Street one of the men tripped me up—I got up and followed the prisoner—when I got close to him he threw himself down—a constable then came up and I gave him in charge—I never lost sight of him—my watch was a valuable one.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of the prosecutor. On the 21st of March, between eight and nine at night, as I was crossing Norwich Street, I was obstructed by the prisoner and another man; they were looking in at a milliner's window; a woman passing asked them why they stopped the way? they said they were looking at a pretty girl in the shop; I went on to the <placeName id="t17780429-6-crimeloc31">Hay-market</placeName>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>You advertised the watch as lost? - Yes; because I thought I might, by that means, get it the sooner.</p>

               <p>In the market a woman put her hand in your pocket? - I do not know who it was; they were gone when I turned about; then I missed my watch.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker in Prince's street, Leicesterfields. On the 21st of March the prisoner brought a watch to my house between nine and ten in the evening, he offered it to pawn; I stopt it; he wanted two guineas upon it; I asked him what it was made of; he said it was gold. I asked him the maker's name; he said he could not tell. I asked him whose it was; he said it belonged to an acquaintance of his in Russel Street, Covent Garden, and that he lived but a little way off, and he could soon fetch him. He went away: presently after a woman came and claimed the watch; I detained her, and she would not tell me where the man was who brought the watch; but said, if I would let her go, she would soon bring him. I would not let her go; I went out and saw the prisoner on the other side of the street, and went and secured him; he came quietly to the door, but then attempted to make his escape.</p>



               <p>[The watch was produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutrix.]</p>

               <p>ANN BROWN sworn.</p>

               <p>On the 21st of March I met the prisoner in the Hay-market; I believe it was between eight and nine at night; he asked me to go and drink something; I had been to tea in Swallow Street; we went in and had a glass of something to drink, and he asked me to lend him a guinea.</p>

               <p>Where did you go in to drink? - I am unacquainted with that part of the town. He asked me to lend him a guinea; I said I had not got a guinea, but I had picked up a watch in the Hay-market, I would lend him that to raise a guinea on, and if it was advertised I could fetch it out. I afterwards saw the advertisement of it; he went to pawn it, and the pawnbroker stopped it, and he came and told me; I said they had no right to stop the watch I had found, and I went and claimed it, which I would not have done if I had stole it.</p>

               <p>Court. What time did you find it? - I believe between eight and nine at night, near Panton Street on the pavement.</p>

            . On the 22d of September last, I was ordered by the justices at the rotation, at the Curtain in Shoreditch, to Clerkenwell prison. The prisoner, Delaforce, was ordered to Newgate; Delaforce and I, and two other prisoners, came from the justices in a coach. Lumley was an <rs id="t17751018-42-deflabel197" type="occupation">officer</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17751018-42-defend379 t17751018-42-deflabel197"></join>; he was in the coach with us. As we were coming along in the coach, Delaforce, who I had never seen before that day, wanted my money to pay for the coach. I told him I did not chuse to pay any thing; and I told him, I had no money: then Delaforce took my knife out of my pocket, and cut my gown to pieces; he cut my pockets off and took them away; he beat me all this time; there were in my pocket three pence in halfpence, a shilling, and four keys belonging to my boxes; he carried one of my pockets to Newgate with him; he twice knocked me off my seat, and he cut my eye out with my own knife; he also took my hat and cap, and a handkerchief. I cried out, Murder! but the coach never stopped till it came to Newgate. Mr. Llewin rode on the coach box; I complained to him, when the coach stopped, of the ill usuage I had received from Delaforce, and I desired Llewin to get my things from him; he got only my keys and my pocket from him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Lumley do all this time?</p>
               <p>Bignell. When Delaforce was beating me, and I cried out for help, Lumley said, he might murder me for what he card; he did one time attempt to take Delaforce's hand away when he was beating me. Lumley is lame with one hand.</p>

            . I am a servant to the governor of Clerkenwell prison; the prosecutor, Delaforce, and two other prisoners, were put into a coach, and Lumley was with them as a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180034"></xptr> guard. I went upon the coach-box; I did not see what passed in the coach; I did hear the prosecutrix cry out in the same manner as she had done in the morning at the justice's; she had been in fits at the justice's, and had behaved very strangely. Immediately as the coach stopped at Newgate, the prosecutrix complained to me of Delaforce having beat and robbed her. I searched Delaforce, and I found a pocket in his coat pocket; and I also found three or four iron keys upon him which I delivered to the prosecutrix. Lumley had a cut upon his hand; he is as harmless a man as ever breathed.</p>
               <p>Delaforce's Defence.</p>
               <p>I did not cut the prosecutrix; she would not pay her share of the coach; we were both very much in liquor. I did strike her with my elbow; she fell down in fits in the coach; I did not take any thing from her.</p>
               <p>There being no evidence to affect Lumley, he was not called upon to make his defence.</p>

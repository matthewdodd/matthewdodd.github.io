                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Stagg. On Friday evening, the 23rd of April, I saw the prisoner's great-coat on a nail in the bed-room occupied by him, myself, Withers, and Craig—I looked into the pocket of it, and found three pieces of lace—I looked into the pocket in consequence of a young man telling me he had found some lace there—I put them back into the pocket, and informed Mr. Shields—I locked the coat up in the state it was in, in my box, and kept the key till Mr. Stagg came home—it was in the same state when I took it out, and it was hung on the same peg as before—I remained in the room when Mr. Stagg and the prisoner left it to go down to tea—nobody came into the room till Mr. Stagg and the prisoner returned—I saw nobody put any lace into the pocket, nor did I put any in myself—the lace Mr. Stagg took out, was what I had found in the coat—I believe them to be our patterns, hot could not swear to that lace—on the day before, the prisoner had the box of thread lace on the counter, and was saying what a good stock of lace we bad—I saw him se<lb></lb>veral times with the box on "the counter—he appeared to admire one par<lb></lb>ticular</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I took charge of the prisoner from Mr. Stagg, and took him to the station—I searched him there, and found five cards of lace, and three pairs of kid gloves in his great-coat pockets—they were in the flap-pockets of his coat behind—the station is nearly a quarter of a mile from Mr. Stagg's—as I was going from Mr. Stagg's to the station, I saw the prisoner remove something from his dress coat pocket into his great-coat-pocket—I judged it to be wrapped up in paper—I heard the rustling of paper, and three of the cards of lace were found in one paper, and two in another—when we got to the station, before I searched him, I saw him again take something from his dress-coat and put it into his great-coat, and heard the rustling of paper then— the gloves were in paper—the last time I saw him do this, he took his great-coat off, folded it up, carried it to one corner of the station, and there laid it—this was all before I searched him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Alexander Peartree, a jeweller in Arlington-street, Hoxton. I employed the prisoner by the week, to make artificial flowers—she went out about the 12th Nov. with three boxes, containing caps and artificial flowers, to sell for me—she did not return—I saw no more of her or the flowers or the money—I believe she did it from distress.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was to teach her daughter to make flowers, for which she said she would give me more money than I had earned at the business before, I was greatly distressed, and had to ask her for a few pence to get food; she said she would give 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and could not give me more; I complained, and she then fixed a price to each bunch of flowers, which was more than any one in the trade would give; she then brought me three caps, and said I was to take them for sale; they were made with dirty materials; the boxes I had were only paper, and not fit for such a wet afternoon, having no oilskin, consequently the goods were very much damaged and rendered unsaleable; being driven to despair, and cold and hungry, I did not return, but got employ elsewhere.</p>

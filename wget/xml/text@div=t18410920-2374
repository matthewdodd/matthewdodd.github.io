                  </hi>. I am a carver, and manufacture chairs. In July last the prisoner was working for me at home—he took two chairs to Mr. Goodrich for me, and took the bill in the evening—his balance was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—if he received the money, or part of it, he ought to have brought it back—he came the next week, and said Mr. Goodrich wanted me to make one chair for him, which, if I made, he would pay me, and when I sent it to him he brought me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I was to have the remainder on Saturday night—he came on Saturday night, and said he had been to Mr. Good<lb></lb>rich, and he would pay me at ten o'clock on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He sent for me, and said he wanted me, he had two sets of chairs for me to sell; I asked what he wanted, he said 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took the pattern out, and was four days selling them—I sold them for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he gave me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my trouble; he then said, "I have got four sets for sale." he wanted 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the set; he said if I got 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would give me a sovereign for them. I went out for five days; I showed Mr. Goodrich the pattern chairs; he showed me a lot of wood, and said if the party would take part in goods he would give me 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Mr. Owen went with me, looked out the wood, and took it; he said, "That man is a stranger to me, I should like you to bring me the chairs." There was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. left, and I said, "I will see you have the elbow-chair." I took in the chair, and Mr. Goodrich paid me a sovereign, and that I kept, ac<lb></lb>cording to the agreement. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He said Mr. Goodrich would buy two sets if I would take part in wood—there was no balance due whatever—I paid him—he was satisfied—he had no right to stop the sovereign—he had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of me that night for the work he had done.</p>

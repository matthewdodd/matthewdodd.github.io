               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I ask for a knife? A. Yes - the prosecutor lent it to you, and you returned it to him; I saw you turn up Cooper's-row with the bundle - there was nobody near, or I should have given you in charge; the knife was tried to the box at Lambeth-street, and fitted the lock.</p>

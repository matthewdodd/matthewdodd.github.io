                  </hi>. I live at 6, Short's Gardens', Endell Street, and am a house-painter—on Wednesday, 7th July, between 11 and 12 p.m., I was standing near a baker's shop in Seven Dials, at the corner of White Lion Street—I saw the prisoner driving one of Carlo Gatti's carts in a careless manner—when the cart passed me I heard a screech—I rushed to the spot—I saw the off wheel go over the lower portion of the girl's back, the horse attempted to stop—I had noticed the reins were loose in the prisoner's hands, and flopping on the horse's head, as if it was fatigued with the journey—it was going at a jog trot, five or six miles an hour—I called the attention of a police-constable and pursued the cart—the prisoner went on as if he was not aware of it—I saw a policeman stop the cart—I picked up the boy, who was also run over—I persuaded the woman to go into a cab and the girl was pat on her lap—I did not think she was injured—she asked for her mother—the inner side wheel skidded the boy's neck for about 18 inches along the road—his head was under the cart—I placed the boy in a cab and another young man took the girl and put her in the woman's lap—I was agitated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The constable was at the inquest—I don't know his name—the verdict was accidental death—the girl was about 6 years of age, the boy was younger—they were running hand-in-hand across the road.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher in Soho—on the 7th July I was outside the Clock House in St. Andrews Street, coming along with a pony—I saw the prisoner in an ice-cart coming from St. Martin's Lane in the direction of St. Andrew's Street, at the rate of about six miles an hour—I saw the two children standing in the road, then some people halloed to them—the prisoner took no notice, but went on—there was nothing to prevent his seeing them—he could have pulled up if he liked—he went on after the accident four or five houses at about the same pace—he seemed to be asleep—I saw a man run after the cart—a policeman stopped it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, lodging in Newman-street, St. Luke's, my husband was a plane-maker. On the 27th of Jan. I lost sixteen plane-irons, which I kept in a box in the cellar—I did not miss them till I found them in the hands of an officer—they are mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Mrs. Lazenby's house. At half-past six o'clock, in the evening of the 26th of January, I went into the cellar—I saw a good many plane-irons, and took sixteen—I wrapped them up in a cloth—I went to the prisoner and said, "If you please, sir, will you buy these?"—he said, "Tell your mother or father to come"—I said, "Would my big brother do?"—I then went and fetched a boy named Charles Walker—he said he would come as my brother, and then the prisoner asked if I could write—I said "No"—he asked Charles Walker whether he could write, and he said, "Yes," and <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi> Walker wrote down where I lived, and my name—the prisoner gave me 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the irons, and said he could not give any more—I said, "I suppose that must do"—we went away—my mother afterwards went with me to the shop, and said, "Please, Mr. Jones, has my boy been selling anything?"—he said, "No," at first—the irons were lying on the board—I said, "Yes, here they are, mother"—then he said, "Oh yes, he I did sell these here"—my mother said, "Pray how much did you give for I them?"—he said 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said, "Do you think I should send my little boy to sell these things for 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he dare say she knew all about it, and if she gave up the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. she should have them again—he said, "We don't want any <hi rend="italic">bother</hi> or piece of work about them"—my mother had not got the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. then—the policeman came and asked what was the matter—the pri<lb></lb>soner said, "There is nothing the matter, it is all over and settled."</p>

                  </hi>. I received information from my boy relative to these irons—I went to the prisoner's and saw him standing in the shop—I asked if my little boy had been there, and what he had been selling—the prisoner said, yes, he had been selling something—I am sure he said he had—I asked what—he said plane-irons—I asked what he gave for them—he said 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked whether he was not ashamed of himself buying these things—he said he thought I knew about it—he said to the boy before he left, "I will be d----d if I don't mark you."</p>

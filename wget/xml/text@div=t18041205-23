             sworn. - I am son to the last witness: On Sunday morning, the 25th of November, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I saw the two prisoners at the bar looking in my father's shop-window; I was in the street talking to a young woman, about twenty feet from my father's house; I did not see either of them go into my father's shop when I was conversing with the young woman; I did not attend to them, my back was to them; I turned my head, and I saw Peele drop a cheese, but I had no suspicion that he had stole it from my father's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do when he dropped the cheese? - A. He picked it up again, and when I had done talking with the young woman, I went to my father's door; a milkman was asking my mother if she had not lost a cheese; I then immediately ran after the two prisoners at the bar, I saw them with the cheese; they crossed the road, and walked fast away.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your running after them, did they run? - A. Yes, and I ran as fast as I could; I catched Fisher at the back of Canonbury-house, in the field, he had just entered it out of the road; they both ran together to Canonbury-place, and then they took different ways; I took hold of him by the collar, and told him he was the man I was running after; he asked me for what; I told him for stealing a cheese from my mother; he said he was not the man; I then asked him what he ran away for; he said, surely he might run if he liked; I had hold of his collar, and by assistance I brought him to my father's house; I delivered him into the care of the person that assisted me, till I fetched an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know how the other was taken? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. You are certain you never saw these young men go into the shop? - A. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. When you turned yourself to look, how was the door, open or shut? - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. How long time passed from the time you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050024"></xptr>first saw them, when they had no cheese, and the time you saw them drop a cheese? A. It might be about six or seven minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you no farther than twenty feet distance? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And all this time talking to this young woman, with your back rather turned from the shop? - A. Rather turned.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the shop door secured? - A Only by a common thumb-latch.</p>

             sworn. - I am a gentleman's coachman: On Sunday, the 25th of November, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, I was coming from town towards Crannis's house; I asked at Crannis's house what was the matter, seeing people stand there; in consequence of what was told me, I saw Peele running across the fields as fast as he could run to Canonbury-house; he got behind part of a wall, called Canonbury-park; then he slackened his pace, he had been running very hard; I had a great way to go round to find him. I saw him get over the gate, and there I lost sight of him; I went round, and there I saw Peele a great way in the field, walking behind an old gentleman very gently, with his hands in his pockets; I knew him by following him. I walked up to him, and took him by the collar; he asked me what I did that for; I told him he was the person that I ran for, I could not say whether he was the person that stole the cheese; he told me he was very innocent; I took him to Crannis's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make much resistance? A. He desired me to let him go by the collar, and take him by the arm; when I brought him in, they desired to speak to one another; the other was brought back before this; I told them they should not do any such thing without somebody with them, so I went with them; they said they would pay for the cheese; they told me, if I would go with them, they would shew me where they had hid the cheese; Fisher told Peele where it was. I went with Peele to the place, and found no cheese, the cheese was never found; he desired me to bring him back, and take the other.</p>

            . - Possessing no ability to speak on my behalf, nor my brother prisoner, I have attempted to put my case in writing. Before this unhappy circumstance befel me, I never committed a crime I was ashamed of, or any thing that could injure my character. I have now in Court my master and other witnesses, that are waiting to prove the same. I am apprentice to Mr. Hendenburgh, a gingerbread-baker, Saffron-hill, and having no time to visit my relations but on Sunday; on the 25th of November, I was going to visit my aunt and other relations, I met my brother-prisoner, Fisher; the morning being cold, we had something to drink, and not being accustomed to drink any thing strong, which we then did, we both drank more than did us good; this, of course, rendered us incapable of conducting ourselves with propriety and decency; and coming along Islington, we saw a cheese lay at a door on the ground; we rolled it along, first one and then the other, not intending to convey it away, nor to keep it; what became of the cheese, it is not in my power to say, but in half an hour afterwards a man laid hold of me, and said we had stole a cheese out of his shop; this, of course, we denied; but on saying he would take us to the watch-house, my brother-prisoner, Fisher, said, he would leave his watch, if we had stole the cheese; the prosecutor would have stopped us sooner, or pursued us at the time, and their not doing so, I trust will have influence on your Lordship's mind, if we had carried the cheese away,

            .) As you were so near the door during the time you saw the prisoners there, can you take upon yourself to say whether there was any cheese laying at the door? - A. I can take upon myself to say there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to say, that you saw the prisoners run the very moment you run? - A. No, I went up to my mother's door first.</p>
               <p>Q. How long then was it before you pursued them? - A. About six or seven minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to say, that, when you first pursued them, you saw one of them had the cheese? - A. He had the cheese under his coat, and I could see a part of it under his arm before I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050025"></xptr>to my mother's, but I had no suspicion that they had stole it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had gone to your mother's, after you run after them, did you see them with the cheese? - A: They were got out of the road, and were gone into the field; they were still in my sight; I run in the road after them; the field is open.</p>
               <p>Q. At the end of the six or seven minutes, when you set off to run after them, did you see the cheese then under either of their arms? - A. I did; I saw them carrying the same cheese.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite clear that you saw the cheese under their arm before you pursued them at the first time, and you saw it at the time you ran after them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember either of these young men offering their watch to pay for the cheese? - A. I was gone for the officer.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prisoners.) Which of you was it that offered a watch to pay for the cheese? - A.(Fisher.) It was me.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) Do you remember Fisher offering a watch to you for the cheese? - A. When I got home, they were both in the shop, and the shop was almost full of people, and the outside of the door was crowded; I asked these prisoners what they had been at; they said, they were very sorry for what they had done; and I said, I fancy so too, I find you have stole my cheese; they said, they had done it merely out of a joke; they said, they intended to bring it back again at night; then Fisher pulled out his watch, and offered his watch for me to take no more notice of it; I told him, I would not take it from him; I said, I should have the constable here in a few minutes, and I shall send you to the watch-house; they then said, if they could go and find the cheese, would I forgive them; they both said that; with that, I let this gentleman's coachman take them one at a time to go and search for this cheese; Fisher went first; he came back again, and said to the other, I cannot find it; then the other asked if he might go and seek for it; he went, and he could not find it; then the constable came, and I gave charge of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Edward Belk, who keeps the King's Arms, Moon-street, in the parish of St. Ann, Soho. On Monday night, the 9th of April, about five minutes past one o'clock, I went to bed—mistress and me went up stairs together, and were the last up—the parlour windows were all fast, I am certain, and the shut<lb></lb>ters—I saw all the windows and doors safe—between three and four the policeman awoke me by knocking at the door—I went down immediately, without dressing, and found a policeman inside the door, with a light in his hand—he was inside the bar-parlour—the parlour window was open—when I came back from the station, I observed a table and window<lb></lb>blind removed—the blind had been on the window the night before, not the one which was open, but the window of the bar-door—it was moved to the opposite side of the room—a small table had been right under the window which was open—that was removed two or three yards when I came back from the station—there were two squares of glass broken in the window—they had attempted to cut another square out, and the point of a knife was found broken in it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 138.) I was in King-street, Soho, on the morning of the 10th of April, about three o'clock, and saw three men standing together close to the bar-parlour shutter of Belk's house—they were all three together at first—I saw them separate, and Barrett standing at the front door of the same house, and the two prisoners standing by the shutters—I watched them, and went from King-street into Grafton-street, and staid there—I was then about twenty yards from Mr. Belk's house—I saw them very busy at the shutters—I thought they were trying to get them open—after some time I saw the two shutters open, while they were there, and heard two panes of glass break, one after the other—I then saw them close them again—I kept watching, till a gentleman crossed out of Monmouth-street into Grafton-street, and I left the place to tell him to fetch assistance—I returned in two minutes—I had left the two men at the shutters, and the other standing at the door—when I came back I missed one of the men at the window, and saw one at the front door, and one at the window—the other was out of sight—as soon as my brother constable came up I turned my head to speak to him for about two minutes—I then saw the one at the front door and the two at the shutters again—I told my brother constable to come with me—we went across the road towards them—Connell, No. 136, came up at the time, and got in between the three of them—I told him to secure Stillman, which he did, at the door, and I was going to take Able—he tried to escape—I followed him into Green-street, Leicester-square, where he was taken by Metcalf—I lost sight of him in turning the corner—when I got round the corner I found him in custody—there was only one gentleman in the street then—Able was run<lb></lb>ning when he turned the corner—I knew him again, having seen him be<lb></lb>fore—I knew him by sight, and am certain he is one of the men I had seen at the window shutter—I brought him back to the house, searched him, and found in his trowsers pocket a clasp knife, a purse, and four duplicates—the knife had the point of it broken off—I went to the shop window,</p>

               <p>tried the shutters, and found they were loose—on pulling them they both came open—two panes of glass were broken, and the window was thrown up—Harwood got in at the window.</p>

I was on duty in Green-street—I heard a rattle springing, and saw Able running out of Castle-street into Green-street, round the corner—I stopped him—there was a gentleman running after him, crying, "Stop thief"—Sheppard came up shortly after—when I took Able, he was near an area—I heard something fall from him, which rattled, and fell down into the area—at the same time a penny-piece dropped on the pavement—I said, "You have dropped something down the area as well"—he said, "It is my money"—I took him back, and gave him into custody—after<lb></lb>wards I went back to the area, and found a gimlet, which I have tried to a hole in Mr. Belk's shutters—it exactly fits it.</p>

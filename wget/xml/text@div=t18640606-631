                  </hi>. I live at 62, Banner-square—on 8th May, about 3 o'clock in the morning, I was awoke by my dog barking in the passage, and on going to the window I saw Harris at the shutters of the parlour window of the Hope public-house, which is next door, and projects twenty feet in front of my house—the window is near a little wall, about three feet six inches high—I had a view of him—he had both his hands where the shutters meet—he then pulled with both hands, and with his left hand he pulled the left shutter open, and the right shutter with his right, making a noise—he then put his right hand to the centre window, just under the fastening, and then the glass fell, making a great noise—I did not see him strike it or see any instrument in his hand—I opened the window, and he turned his head up and looked me deliberately in the face—he then jumped over the wall into the garden of my house, and turned out at the gate, staggering us if he was drunk, and got out of my sight—Snape and a tall man were standing opposite me, rather to the left—there was a lamp opposite me—I saw the prisoner take both hands to the window to shove it up—he then entered the house—I threw up my window, making a great noise—I asked for my revolver, which my wife gave me, and fired four shots, while he was in the house—just as I had fired the fourth he came out at the window, placing two coats, one of which appeared very stiff, on the window cell, then he jumped over the wall into my garden, taking both coats under his left arm—he turned round the corner, and just as he got to the corner he made a run—there was a lapse of about a minute between each shot I fired—when I fired the first shot, the tall man, with Snape, walked about twenty yards, and came over by the window—I heard his footstep by the front of the door of the public-house, and then he went off—just as the fourth shot was fired, Harris was coming out at the window—Snape then moved from the tree where he was standing, and walked down directly opposite me under the light of the lamp, and then he went away as Harris went out of the garden with the coats—I then fired a fifth shot—Snape was talking with the tall man very loud, but I could not catch the words—just after the fifth shot was fired, 57<hi rend="italic">G</hi> came up—I told him what had taken place—Harris was sixteen or seventeen feet from me; no further then he is now, only he was rather down—I am certain Snape is the same person.</p>

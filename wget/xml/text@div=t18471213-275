                  </hi> I am assistant to Messrs. Taylor and Angell—on Friday, 19th Nov., about three or four o'clock, the prisoner came to our shop—I am quite certain she is the person—I have examined this lace, it is my master's.</p>

Q.</hi> Which do you know? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I swear to six patterns—there is no mark on them—I know which was soiled—other shopkeepers may have the same patterns—I did not serve the prisoner, but I perfectly well recollect her coming—I had never seen her before—Osborne served her—as soon as it was named to me I said I could recollect the female—there were two of them—I never saw the other before that day, nor since—I saw the prisoner afterwards at the police office, when she was examined.</p>

                  </hi> I keep a beer-shop—on Friday night, Nov. 19, I gave the prisoner into custody for something else, and on the way to the station in my cart, I observed her make a stoop forward in the cart as she was sitting between me and my wife—it was about 200 yards up a little unfrequented lane—she recovered herself in an instant—she had muff, her left hand was in it, and her right hand out—she put her right hand into her muff again and sat quiet afterwards—the officer also saw what she did.</p>

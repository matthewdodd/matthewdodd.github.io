                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Camomile-terrace, Well-street, Hackney, and have done so for fourteen months. The prisoner and his wife, the deceased Elizabeth Gaylor, lived in that house—she was a young wo<lb></lb>man, about twenty-seven or twenty-eight years of age—the prisoner is a carpenter—they had two children, the youngest was about twelve months old—on the Tuesday before she died, the deceased complained to me that she had got a headache—on the Wednesday morning she was taken very sick indeed—I heard her from my room, and I went to her and asked her if anything was the matter, if she felt ill—she said yes, she was very sick and relaxed, besides; what she brought up was yellow, and I said, "Bless me, how bilious you are"—she made me no answer—she was still very sick, and vomited very much—I took her in a cup of coffee, and she brought that up—she asked me for it—I took her in a second one—she was still sick—she then asked me to make her a cup of tea—I did so—she remained quiet a little, and then she was sick again—I should think that was about 4 o'clock—she got up between 4 and 5 o'clock on the Wednesday afternoon and said she would make herself a cup of tea, which she did, and she asked me to reach down a piece of bacon in the cupboard, which I did—she did not eat any while I was there—I saw her again on the Wednesday night, I put the baby to bed, it slept with me, I brought it up by hand—on Thursday morning,</p>

               <p>between 6 and 7 o'clock, I heard her moaning, as if she was retching—I went in and asked her if she did not feel so well—she said, "Oh, I am dying"—she was in bed—she said, in a very low tone, "Oh, good God! I shall die; will you give me a cup of coffee?"—I went in to light my fire, but before I lit it I heard her moan, I went in again, and I saw there was a change—I sent for the doctor, he came in less than five minutes, but when he came she was dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living in Casland-terrace, Hackney. On Thursday morning, 16th Oct., I went to the prisoner's house, No. 2, Camomile-terrace, at near 7 o'clock—I saw the deceased—she had been dead a short time, she was in bed—there was nothing to tell me at that time of what she died—I saw the prisoner a little after 12 o'clock, that same day, at his house—he said that on the previous evening (Wednesday), at the request of his wife, he went to Mr. Stanford's, a chemist, in Homerton, and purchased two ounces of sulphate of potass, as she wished to take it for the purpose of procuring abortion—I believe he also said that she had attempted to pro<lb></lb>cure abortion when in the family way with the former child, and that he was quite innocent, that he purchased it quite innocently—I asked if she had taken it all—he said he did not know, if there was any left it would be found up stairs—by the desire of the Coroner I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examina<lb></lb>tion of the body, on the Friday following—I took out the stomach and in<lb></lb>testines entire, without opening them, and conveyed them in a sealed jar and bottle to Dr. Letheby—I found no disease at all to account for death—I also sent to Dr. Letheby two cups, a spoon, and a piece of carpet—there was a small sediment of white powder at the bottom of each cup—a paper was given to me, on the Saturday after, by a Mrs. Room—I was pre<lb></lb>sent when the stomach and intestines were opened—the uterus was unim-pregnated, she must have made a mistake about being in the family way.</p>

On Wednesday evening, 15th Oct., the prisoner came to my shop, about five minutes to 10 o'clock, and asked for two ounces, of sulphate of potass—I said at first I thought I had not any—he said that he could not get it anywhere in Homerton, none of us kept it—I after<lb></lb>wards found some and sold him two ounces, he paid 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he had plenty in his work basket, at the shop, but he wanted to use some particu<lb></lb>larly that night, he was generally in the habit of getting it at one place—I gave it him in paper, it was not written on—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) to be the paper I gave it in—I should say about an ounce and a half would kill a grown person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bachelor of medicine, living in Finsbury-square, and am lecturer at the London Hospital I received from Mr. Yinall a jar and a bottle, sealed, and two cups—I found in each of the cups a quantity of white powder, which on analysis I found to be sulphate of potass, and the quantity in the two cups amounted to seventy-four grains—the jar contained the stomach and intestines of an adult—I examined them—I found the stomach and upper part of the small intestines very much congested with blood, as if an irritant had been acting upon them—the interior of, the stomach displayed precisely the same appearance—the stomach contained about a small table spoonful of thick matter, which upon analysis yielded this sulphate of potass (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—the intestines also contained a quantity of thick mucus, which is generally poured out under the influence of an irritant on the intestines, and upon analysing it it furnished this sul<lb></lb>phate of potass (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—a piece of carpet was given to me—I examined the matter which had been vomited upon that, and found sulphate of potass in it, which I have here—I found this pocket at my laboratory—I opened it, and found in it this paper, containing 181 grains of sulphate of potass—the quantity in the tea cup and paper amounted to about half an ounce—sup<lb></lb>posing the paper to have originally contained two ounces, an ounce and a half would be gone from it—having heard the account given of the symptoms of the deceased, and having seen the stomach very much irritated, ana having found sulphate of potass there, my opinion is that death arose from sulphate of potass—an ounce and a half would be sufficient to kill a person—sulphate of potass is named in works on toxicology as a thing which in large doses produces poisonous action.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Doughty-mews, St. Pancras, and keep a coffee-stall in Guildford-street. Between three and four o'clock in the morning of the 8th of March the prisoner came and asked for a cup of coffee and a slice of bread and butter—he put 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. into my hand—I said, "This won't do," and he said, "Give me change for half-a-crown"—I laid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. down on the end of the board—while I was taking out 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> he took up the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and put them into his right-hand breeches' pocket—I think he had been drinking, but he was not drunk—I asked him for his half-crown—he said he had given it to me—I said he had not, and afterwards he denied having the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when he said he had given me the half-crown, I said, "You have not"—he said, "Yes, I have"—I said, "Nonsense, don't make a piece of work about it"—he was going away—I went and stopped him—he said if I did not let him go, he would knock my b—nose off—I called a policeman, who took him to the station, and in going to the station I said, "You had better give me the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I will go no further"—he was searched at the station, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and half-a-crown were found upon him—I had no particular mark upon the shillings, but I saw him put them into his right-hand pocket, which they were taken from.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner in cus<lb></lb>tody near the stall—on the road to the station he denied having taken the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. off the stall, and then turned round, and said to me, "I only did it for a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>"—the prosecutor said, "Well, give me the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I will go no fur<lb></lb>ther with you"—he said, "No, I will go to the station"—when he got there he denied having any money at all in his pocket—I considered he had been drinking, but he could walk as well as I could—there appeared some<lb></lb>thing in his eyes as if he had been drinking—he appeared sleepy.</p>

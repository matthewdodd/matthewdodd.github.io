                  </hi>. I am a merchant, and live at Westminster. On the 24th of Feb., between ten and eleven o'clock, I was coming from the Adelaide Gallery—the prisoner came up and spoke to me—I did not at first hear what she said—I had a diamond pin in my stock—I stopped to hear what she said—she came close up to me, and shuffled alongside of me—she had followed me some distance—she put her hand up and snatched my pin out of my stock—I caught hold of her hand, called "Police!" and tried to get it from her—two men rushed up and tried to get her from me—they succeeded at last—I hit one of them and his hat fell in the street—he went after it—I then went and secured the prisoner, who was running away—she had a hand<lb></lb>kerchief in her hand, and in trying to get it from her I felt something prick my hand—I got the handkerchief out of her hand, and took my pin out of it—the policeman came up and took her.</p>

The first Evidence was the Minister of St. James Dukes-place, who deposed, that on the 23d of April, 1693 he Married two Persons, Thomas Lock, a Widower, and Elizabeth Osborne, a Spinster, but could not say he remembered them, but said he was desired by an Honourable Lady, who was present in Court, to go with her to Newgate, to see if he knew the said Payden alias Lock; accordingly he went, where he saw his first Wife; but no sooner had the Prisoner spied her, but that he fell upon his Knees, and ask'd her pardon for his fault, and acknowledged at the same time that he was Married to her, and likewise owned at the same time, that he was Married to the Lady, Mrs. Elizabeth Adey, and would have begged her Pardon, pretending to be sorry for his Offence; the Clerk of Dukes-place deposed that, he was the Father that gave her, and that he well remembered them, by reason they invited him to their House, and gave him a pair of Gloves. Another Evidence said, that he went by the Name of Lock, and lived with her Sister as his Wife, and had a Child by her. An Attorney gave Evidence, that in April, 1693, he drew Writings concerning the Marriage of the said Elizabeth Osborne, with the Prisoner, and saw him Sign the same, by the Name of Thomas Lock, which Writing he produced in Court; and said, that he did see Elizabeth Osborne on Monday last was seven Nights. The Curate of St. Anns Westminster, deposed that on the 29th September 1698, he had a License brought him to Marry two Persons, John Payden, Widower, and Mrs. Elizabeth Adey, Widow, which accordingly he did the same day, and said, that he did well remember the Prisoner to be the same Man, his Clerk likewise deposed the same. Another Evidence said, that by the means and subtilty of Ward, she had like to have been Married to the Prisoner, but that the Care and Prudence of her Friends detected the Villany; and that he Courted her by the Name of

               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with her before she laid hold of you? - A. No; I did not see her till she laid hold of me; she slipped her hand into my left hand breeches pocket, and took out two guineas, a half guinea, a seven-shilling-piece, and three shillings in silver; she turned the pocket inside out; she took from the other pocket a purse containing twelve pieces of foreign coin; she ran away, and I pursued her; but in going through the passage into a yard, and then through another passage into the street, I lost her.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not by your consent you went into this passage? - A. Yes; I went the next morning to Bow-street, and got two officers; I took them with me to Dyot-street; I saw the prisoner standing in the street, with two others, and I identified her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you with her? - A. Not half a minute; I saw her face, I am sure she is the person; she was searched in my presence, and I saw found upon her a Dutch coin that I had lost; I had had it six months; the foreign coins were all different; the purse was not found, nor any other money.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I heard a great noise on the Sunday morning as I lay in my bed, and a person calling out, watch! I asked what was the matter; the people said, it was a drunken man had been robbed; I put on my cloaths, and went to the door; the people were all laughing at his calling out, watch! he pulled some papers out of his waistcoat pocket, and said he had got some notes left; he then pulled out some silver and halfpence, and gave to a parcel of girls that were about him; he went into a public-house with them, and I saw no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180310260011"></xptr>more of him till the Monday morning; after he was gone I found this foreign coin in the passage; when I was taken I was so flurried I did not know what I said; I told them I had had it two months; but when I came before the Magistrate I told the truth, that I had found it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Wellington Road, Bow Road, and am a timber merchant. On 8th June, I went in company with Gover, a sheriff's officer, and some others, to some premises in George Street, Bromley, under a writ from the sheriff—I went into the ground, accompanied by the sheriff's officer, and his assistant, Mr. Phillips, and two men in my em<lb></lb>ploy—the sheriff's officer went up to the cottage door and knocked—no one answered—he looked in at the windows, and could not observe any one there—we walked round to the back of the cottage, and saw the prisoner at work in the garden some distance off, digging or planting in a market garden—the sheriff's officer hailed him, and he refused to come—the officer stated that he should break the door open unless he came to open it, and on that he forced the door open; by that time the prisoner came up to where we were, with a gun in his hand, very excited—he made some remark which I did not distinctly hear—Mr. Phillips, and the sheriff's officer, and others there, seized hold of the gun, and a struggle ensued amongst them for the possession of the gun—I saw that there was a percussion cap on it—the sheriff's officer took out the ramrod and put it in the barrel, and inti<lb></lb>mated that it was loaded—I then got out of the way, fearing that the pri<lb></lb>soner might do me some mischief—after some short time the gun was fired off into the air, each party having hold of it—the prisoner refused to give it up, stating that it was his own property—he walked into the cottage with the gun—I saw no more of him for about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, or it might be longer—I was standing in the garden, some distance from the cottage, and of a sudden I felt a violent blow on my side and my arm—I immediately found that I was shot, and I exclaimed, "I am shot! I am shot! secure him"—I staggered some distance—persons came up and assisted me away—I was taken home and put to bed—one shot struck me in the chin, others in the body and in the arms—I have several in my arm at the present time, a good many have been extracted from me, I cannot tell the number—it was smallish shot—I have none here except in my arm—I cannot say exactly how far the prisoner was from me when the gun was fired; probably half a dozen yards, or it might be a little more—I was standing sideways, not looking at him—I did not speak to him at all that day; in fact, I never spoke to him, that I am aware of, in my life.</p>

               <p>shot, is it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not acquainted with shot; it is larger than mustard seed—I do not recollect ever having spoken to the prisoner in my life—I know that this little cottage and piece of land had been in his pos<lb></lb>session, and that of his family, for a great many years—it was previously in the possession of my father and his partners, and they let it to his father and mother as tenants—they have not had it upwards of twenty years, but a good many years—this is the waistcoat I had on—it is very thickly padded—I brought an action against the prisoner in the County Court—the Judge stated it was a case for a superior Court, and dismissed it, being a question of title—I subsequently brought an action of adjustment in the superior Court, and judgment went by default, and it was under that judgment I went with Mr. Gover and the officer, to take possession—I was standing near Gover when he called out to the defendant in the garden—I think Gover told him to come and open the door, and upon that the prisoner said, I think, that he must break it open—before that I did not hear him say, "What business have you got here?"—we were a long distance apart, and they had to halloo to each other to make each other hear—Gover did imme<lb></lb>diately afterwards break the door open—the prisoner was still in the garden—he then came round to the front with the gun in his hand—there is no back door to the cottage—I did not see him with the gun in his hand when we first went there—when he came up with the gun in his hand I think he asked who it was that broke the door open—he appeared very excited—he did not say, "What right have you to break open my door?"—the parties immediately rushed to seize the gun, and a sort of excitement took place amongst them who should take possession of the gun; the prisoner refused to give it up, and the others refused to leave go of it, and it was imme<lb></lb>diately fired into the air—the others said, "You must discharge it before we will leave go of it"—when he found they refused to part with it, it was discharged—I do not know that he said, "I will discharge it into the air;" I will not say that he did not, because when I found that the gun was loaded I got away—I saw Gover produce his authority; I will not say whether that was before or after the gun was discharged—I did not hear the prisoner say, "You know I keep this gun for frightening birds, I do not mean to hurt anybody," nothing of the kind—I did not hear him say, "Give me an hour to move away my furniture"—Gover and his men began to remove the furniture—they did not begin to take up the plants and vegetables; they commenced taking the furniture out, and putting it outside into the road—the prisoner did not speak to me; I had previously spoken to his mother—I went into her room where she was lying in bed; he and his sister stated that I had been the cause of his mother's death—he did not say in my hearing, "Pray do not ruin me, give me an hour to move my things out of the house, and I will pack up."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sheriff's officer. On 8th June I went, in company with Mr. Hickmott, to give him possession under the writ of the sheriff—I have the warrant here—when we went in there, I saw a man, and asked him which was Moyce—he said that was him at the bottom of the garden—I called to him, and asked him to come and open the door of the cottage—he said he would not—I went and broke open the door—shortly after I saw the prisoner come up round the house with a gun</p>

               <p>in his hand—he said, "Who broke open that door?"—I walked up towards him, and told him that I did—Mr. Phillips, a friend of Mr. Hick<lb></lb>motts, rushed towards him, and seized hold of the gun, as well as two policemen—they asked him to let go of it; he said, "No, it is my own property, I will not give it out of my hand"—they struggled for the gun, and while they were struggling I drew the ramrod, and found that it was loaded—at last he said, "Let go of it; if you are afraid of it, I will fire it off in the air," which he did—I showed him the warrant, and we went towards the cottage, and we began moving the things out—it was as near half an hour as possible before I saw the prisoner again—he was then standing near the cottage window; Mr. Hickmott and I were standing close together, near the gates, about three and a half or four yards from the prisoner—I turned round, and saw that he had the gun in his hand, which he raised, and fired at Mr. Hickmott—I put my hand upon Mr. Hick<lb></lb>mott's shoulder, but had not time to tell him the prisoner was going to shoot him before the gun was discharged—I asked Mr. Hickmott whether he was wounded—I saw that his coat was perforated with small shot—he said, "No, I am all right," but in about half a minute I saw him stagger and fall—he was taken away—the policeman went after the prisoner, and I rushed into the house, and secured the gun—I am not aware that I heard anything said by Mr. Hickmott to the prisoner during this proceeding, or by the prisoner to Mr. Hickmott.</p>

He swore positively the Prisoner was one of them that rifled him he sent to a Friend's House, one Mr. Nicholas, that lived about 3 quarters of a Mile off, to borrow a Horse to ride and that the said Mr. Nicholas would have him drink a Tankard of his Ale and smoak a Pipe of Tobacco, which he did, during which time he gave him on Account how he was robbed, describing the Men and Horses, staying there about 3 quarters of an Hour. Afterwards Mr. Nicholas going with him to the Door to see him take Horse, espied three Men such as he had described coming along, and there being a Gate that they must go through, he went and shut it; they finding the Gate shut, attempted to go back, but Mr. Nichols and the Prosecutor endeavouring to stop them, two of them got away, one of them giving Nichols a Cut on the Head with a Hanger, but he laid hold on the Prisoner's Bridle and held him, and that the Prisoner struck Mr. Nichols several times with a Whip, but he secured him, dismounted him, took the Whip from him; that he had likewise a Hanger at his Girdle, but without a Scabbard; that there was a Wig found in the Road that some of them had dropped, and likewise a Pistol charged with Powder and Ball. All the Circumstances after the Prosecutor came to Mr. Nichols's House were likewise sworn to by Mr. Nichols. The Prisoner denied the Fact; and being asked how he came to be in the Company, he said he was going to one Capt. Scroggs at a Town not far from the Place, he meeting with the other two Men on the Road they undertook to put him into his Way, and that when they robbed the Prosecutor they threatned him that if he offered to stir they would shoot, and that he was at a considerable distance off. He gave no Account how he came by the Prosecutor's Whip. A great many Persons appeared to his Reputation who gave him a good Character; that he hadlived with his Father at Knight's Bridge, who kept an Inn there (and as one said used to draw his Father's Liquorments) and that now his Father being dead, and his Mother being a Woman of an Estate, he looked after it, collecting her Rents,&amp;c. that he had always behaved himself well, and that they never heard of his having committed any such irregularity. The Matter of Fact being thus plainly proved, the Jury found him <rs id="t17170911-36-verdict190" type="verdictDescription">

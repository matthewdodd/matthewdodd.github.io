                  </hi>. I am the widow of William Bint, he was a navigator, and was seventy-seven years of age. On Thursday, 17th May, he came home about six o'clock—we then lived at 16, King's-place, King's-cross—he threw himself on the bed and said he was a dead man—he said he had walked home from Holloway—in consequence of what he said, I sent for Mr. Pratt, a surgeon, who told me to send him to the hospital, which I did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cow-keeper, at Upper Holloway. On Thursday, 17th May, about half-past four o'clock, I was near the Half Moon there, and saw the prisoner and an old man fighting—the old man was very active, and appeared to have the best of it—I saw him knock the prisoner down twice running—there were about four rounds—at the third round, the old man seemed to have rather the worst of it, and at the next round he again seemed to have the best of it—he was very weak, and would not fight any longer—I saw his dead body at the North London hospital next week when the inquest was held.</p>

               <p>drinking-box outside; he appeared to be quite quiet—the prisoner came up and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> his handkerchief in Bint's face—Bint took it up and put it into his pocket—on that Graves struck at him—Bint warded off the blow—they then <hi rend="italic">set to, sparring</hi>, for five minutes, and here and there a blow was struck—I treated it so very lightly, that I sat and laughed at them—at length they I came to blows—I think Bint had rather the best of it—I had never seen him before—there were about four rounds—Graves was on the ground, I think, three times, and Bint once—Graves was drunk, Bint was sober—he had. done nothing to Graves before he threw his handkerchief in his face—I do not think they knew each other—when I saw the fighting was becoming more serious, I interfered, and told Bint to stop, for the other would fight all the afternoon—he then left off—he did not appear to be hurt; the punish<lb></lb>ment was about equal on either side—Bint went to the horse<lb></lb>trough and washed himself—he then sat down on the settle—some little collection was made for him, and in about ten minutes he walked away towards London—I saw no particular blow struck on the stomach; it might have happened with<lb></lb>out my seeing it, but I saw no blow or kick there—if there had been anything unfair in the fight I think I should have observed it: I did not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the North London Hospital. I saw the deceased there about nine o'clock on the evening of 17th May—he was quite sensible at that time—he had two contused wounds over each eyebrow about an inch long, and a few scratches about the thighs and legs, not of any importance—he was complaining of severe pain in the belly—I could discover no external mark to correspond with that pain—I applied my hand, and he complained, on pressure, and his muscles became rigid—he had the aspect of a man who was severely injured, but he did not seem to know it—on Friday evening symptoms of inflammation of the bowels came on, and he became worse, and died on the Sunday—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I found a portion of the small bowel ruptured at a point opposite to where be complained of having received a blow, to the extent of about three-quarters of an inch—the bowel was entirely ruptured, and the contents had escaped into the cavity of the belly—there was very intense inflammation around the parts, almost amounting to gangrene—in my judgment the rupture was the cause of death, and the rupture was caused by a blow—it had that appearance, independent of his history of the transaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would not the rupture be as likely to be occasioned by an overstraining on the part of the man himself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I think not—from</p>

               <p>the mode in which it was ruptured, I think it must have resulted from direct violence; it would not have been so extensive from straining—it would only have caused the descent of the bowel, not the rupture of it—I should say he would have felt great pain on receiving the blow—I should not think it probable that he could have walked two or three miles afterwards without complaining, although I can conceive it possible—I think brandy would be prejudicial to him, and moving about—a fall might have produced the game effects.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received a good character.)</p>

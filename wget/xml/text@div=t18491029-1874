"the prisoner Wyllie threw himself on me, and, with a sheath-knife in his hand, attempted to stab me in the breast, but he was prevented by Rich—I saw him make the attempt, but I did not see the knife—Wyllie got away, and we got Mackenzie to the station—after coming from the surgeon's, I went home about an hour after, through Ratcliffe-highway, I apprehended Wyllie, and took him to the station—when we got there, I asked him whether he had got any knife about him—he said, no, some one had taken it from him, and the sheath also. <hi rend="italic">M'Kenzie.

I heard a disturbance in George-street, and saw Lynch there struggling with Mackenzie, on the ground—I saw Mackenzie throw away a clasp knife which he had in his hand—it was open—Wyllie caught hold of it, and made a stab at Lynch with it, and he was in a stooping position—after that some constables came up, and overpowered him—he threw the clasp knife away, and took a knife from a sheath that was round his waist by a belt, and made a stab at Lynch with it—Mackenzie said, "Come on, my brave Americans, and do for the b—rs!"—I assisted the constables in getting Mackenzie to the station, and received a kick in the knuckles.</p>

Maddigan said, "Yes, you dd rascal, we will soon put you where you will be tried;" I did not have an open knife.</p>

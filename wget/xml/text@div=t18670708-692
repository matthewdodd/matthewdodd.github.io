                  </hi> I am superintendent of the Essex constabulary stationed at Epping—on Wednesday morning, 24th April, I was called up about half-past five to see the prisoner—he was in the office—when I went in he said, "I stabbed a youug woman last night"—I waited a minute or two, and I then said, "Whatever you say will be given in evidence for or against you"—he said, "I done it last night whilst we were out walking"—I said, "Where was this? "—he answered, "On the New Freehold, Buckhurst Hill, "that is about six miles from Epping—I said, "Who was she? "—he answered, "Miss Griggs"—he then said, "May I go outside? I feel so sick"—we went out into the yard, and while we were there he had some water to drink—he said, "I took something last night I ought not to have done"—I asked him what it was—he said, "Acid we use in our trade"—we went back into the office—I then asked him who was, Miss Griggs—he said, "Thomas Griggs's daughter, well<lb></lb>borer, North Cottage, Prince's Road, Buckhurst Hill"—I asked him, "How did it happen? "—he answered, "We bad some words before, and all that"—I said, "What did you do it with? "—he answered, "A dagger" I asked whereabouts—he said, "I don't know, I did not take any notice; in two or three places"—I asked, "What became of the woman after you had stabbed her? "—he said, "I left her; I suppose some one saw her"—I asked what became of the dagger—he replied, "I don't know; I sup<lb></lb>pose I left it there afterwards when I came away"—I asked him his name—he gave the name of Frederick Watkins, 36, Henrietta Street, watchmaker, now lodging at the Fox, Buckhurat Hill—that was all the conversation that took place—I examined his hands and his clothes—I found blood on and between the fingers of his right hand; there was nothing on his clothes—I then took him in custody, and left him in charge of Sergeant Lellan.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman N</hi> 41). I was at the station at Epping on 24th April—I received the prisoner into custody from Mr. Patteson—I told him the charge—he said, "Oh, how did she get home? "—it was about nine or ten in the morning when I received him; I had come over from Loughton, where I am stationed, to Epping—I had known of the affair before—I said, "She walked home"—he said no more till we arrived at Loughton—he then said, "Then she did walk home? "—I said, "Yes"—he said, "What time did she get home? "—I said, "Between four and five"—I put him in the cell—he said he felt queer; the train shook it up—(we went by train to Loughton)—I said, "Shook up what? "—he said, "The stuff I have taken"—I told a constable to give him a dose of physic; I had received some physic at Epping, and brought it with me—I then went to Buckhurst Hill—from instructions I had received from Mr. Patteson, I went on to the Freehold, and saw this dagger lying in the field—I got over and picked it up, and about a yard from it I saw this piece of lead—there were marks of blood on the dagger, and also on the lead—near the lead I found this piece of string; it was not attached to it—this leathern sheath was on the dagger when I found it, but the</p>

               <p>end of the dagger projected through the sheath—I had previously received the end of the sheath from a constable, who brought it from the surgeon—it corresponds with and fits on to the dagger—I should think this piece of lead weighs about a pound—I examined the ground, there was a quantity of blood there, and the grass was trodden down—it is all field there, but there was a temporary fence put up round it; there is no footpath or road through it; they must have got over into the field—I then went back to Loughton, the charge was read over to the prisoner, and he—said it was quite right—on 25th April he was taken to the room in which the girl Griggs was; her examination was taken there—after we had left the room he said, "What she said is quite right"—I then took him to Ilford Gaol—on the way there he said, "I struck her on the head twice with the lead, the second time the string broke; I then took out the dagger, but I did not think to take the sheath off; when I walked away from her I heard her hallooing; I stopped; I had a mind to go back; I thought she would not halloo long, and I did not"—he said, "I had sense enough not to run up the road on the gravel, I ran across the field on the grass"—it is a new road cut through there—he said it was through jealousy, and he asked me if I ever felt jealous—I said, "No."</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon at Buckhurst Hill—on the morning of 21st April I was called to see Matilda Griggs at her father's house—I went up stairs and saw her lying on the bed—I proceeded to examine her—upon first examining her I saw nothing but a mass of blood, in fact the whole of her back was covered with blood—she was being stripped—I called for some water and began to wash away the blood, and I found wound after wound—I found eight wounds on the back—I then asked her if she was hurt anywhere else—she said she had been stabbed on the left breast—I examined that, and found three wounds on the inner part of the left breast; they were in three spots, close to one another, one very close to the nipple—I next examined her hand, and found two punctured wounds on the upper part of the thumb; I should say all those wounds were done by some sharp-pointed instrument—I examined the depths of the wounds as accurately as I could—the one out of which I extracted this brass end of the sheath was nearly three inches deep—that was at the back, just on the side of the right blade-bone; that was a slanting wound, not straight through; the others were in several places, and of the depth of not more than an inch, with the exception of one wound which penetrated the lung; that was rather deeper, but it would not have been prudent to judge how deep, or I might have done mischief—the wound out of which I took the brass sheath was on the shoulder blade, from left to right, supposing him to be standing behind her, low down on the left side that penetrated the lung—I will not be certain whether it was the right or left—that was sufficiently deep to touch the lungs between the ribs; the thickness of the interval was from three-quarters of an inch to an inch—the girl is a fat girl—in my opinion the wounds may have been caused by an instrument of this character, they were of a three-cornered nature, such as a bayonet, or such as this dagger is—I then examined the head, and found two wounds of a different character, contused wounds, on the upper part of the head, more towards the back—they might have been caused by such an instrument as this piece of lead with a sling passed through it—altogether there were fifteen wounds on her body, eight on the back, three on the</p>

               <p>breast, two on the hand, and two on the head—there were marks of blood on the dagger when it was first presented to me—I did not see any on the lead.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you saw her was she in danger? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The was certainly; I at first thought, from her breathing being so very slight, that she was dead—I did not believe there was any wound of the lung until I examined it, but there was decidedly—she continued in danger, she got worse next day, so much so that I recommended that her depositions should be taken, at least I mentioned it to those who said it was necessary it should be done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> This seems to be part of an old bayonet, does it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not sufficiently acquainted with bayonets to say—I attended her constantly—the last time I saw her I saw one wound open, I think the wound from which this was extracted; it was open, and dis<lb></lb>charging, therefore she was not perfectly well—I can't say when that was, probably her mother can. (<hi rend="italic">Mrs. Griggs.</hi> It was on the Sunday as she went away on the Thursday.) She complained of a little bodily illness—I am not able to express an opinion whether all the wounds were inflicted with the sheath or the dagger—I should say not, because the wound from which this end was extracted was of a larger character than the others—looking at the wounds themselves, I should say that all but that one had been inflicted without the sheath; they all presented a very sharp appear<lb></lb>ance, the other presented an oval appearance, namely the form of the sheath—no part of this remained in the wound—I extracted the whole of it—I should say that was the first wound inflicted—the others were decidedly done with the unsheathed weapon, that is my opinion from the nature of the wounds, they were three-cornered wounds, this was of an oval shape—they could not have been inflicted with the brass point on—I say that with certainty; they might have been inflicted with this leather part of the sheath remaining on; that would not interfere with them.</p>

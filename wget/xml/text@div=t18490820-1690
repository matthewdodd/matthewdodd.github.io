               <p>The Rev. <hi rend="smallCaps">ARTHUR STOCK</hi>. I live in the Clapham-road, and am curate of St. Michael's Church, Stockwell. In May, 1848, in consequence of hearing that the Church had been broken open, I went there—I missed my scarf from a drawer in the vestry, in which I had locked it myself on the Wednesday evening previous—I found it unlocked on the Sunday morning—there were marks of its having been forced—I examined the Church, and found the east window broken—the lock of a cupboard under the pulpit had been forced, and a pannel had been cut out of the door which leads into the vestry—the entrance had been effected by a pane of glass being cut out of the east window, large enough to admit a hand to undo the fastenings—I also missed Mr. Kemble's surplice and two keys—I have since seen my scarf—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know it from its general appearance—I cannot swear to it, but I am sure it is mine, from its length and breadth, and from the crease in folding—I have not seen the surplice since.</p>

                  </hi>. In May, 1848, I was living with the prisoner at Dock-head—I recollect one morning his bringing home this scarf—he desired me to go and pledge it—I did so—two or three weeks after he asked me to sell the ticket, and I did so to a person named Moss—I went by the name of Mrs. Cannon.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner put in a paper which related entirely to the next indictment. His brother, William Cannon, gave him a good character, and stated that he had never been in trouble before, but afterwards, admitting he had been before convicted of a similar offence, he was committed for contempt of Court.</hi>)</p>

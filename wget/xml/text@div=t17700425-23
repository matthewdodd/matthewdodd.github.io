I got up about six o'clock on the 4th in the morning, and found my kitchen window, even with the ground, open. There were shutters to it; the keys had lost their springs that key'd them to, and by turning the bolts round, they sell out, so that they opened the shutters and then the casement, and cut the wooden bar out on the inside. They broke two panes of glass, and untwisted the lead from the wooden bar, and took the light out; then there was room for them to get in. I found four locks broke in the house. They had opened a corner-cupboard in the corner of the kitchen, where I had happened to leave some cash, above twenty guineas to gold, and about 4 l. in silver. I missed a pint silver mug from the kitchen. I missed from other parts of the house, the other things, spoons, a tea-chest, tea-tongs, strainer. I never found any of my things again. The lads at the bar were taken up the night following upon suspicion, but they confessed nothing.</p>

            . This instrument (producing a hand iron crow) the watchman found; I tried it, and found it fitted the marks made in trying to wrench open the prosecutor's window-shutters. There were impressions in two places very plain, between the brick work and window.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About a quarter past twelve o'clock, April the 5th, I was in my stand in Hoxton-town, just at the bottom of the prosecutor's garden. I saw these three young chaps going by; I thought they were disorderly from their very looks. When they were got a little way from me, I was relieved by another watchman; and on my going round the town, I met them again, two on the side I was on, and one on the other side. My partner was on that side. I asked them where they were going? They set up a run; I ran as fast as I could. I could hear their feet. I bid my partner blow his candle out. I called out, Blunt, Blunt, war-hawk! He was ready, and held up his stick and stopped them. We took them all three to the watch-house. The next morning I found a dark-lanthorn, two hand iron crows, and a tinder-box. There was half a bunch of matches found in the cage where they were put; and there was another bunch of matches taken out of Darby's pocket before the justice. They were all of a length.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see or hear them fling these things away?</p>
               <p>Whitaker. No, I did not: they were throwed over some pales into a garden. They had run by the place. We catched them near the corner of the garden.</p>

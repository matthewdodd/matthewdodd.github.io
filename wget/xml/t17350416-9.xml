             On Tuesday the eighteenth of March in the Evening, the Prisoner came into my Shop under a pretence of buying a Coral. But a Lady coming into buy a piece of Plate, the Prisoner said she would wait. In a little time, I observed my Workman (who happened to be in the Shop) appeared in a surprise. He told me the Prisoner had put a Card of Gold Rings into her Bosom. I searched her and took out fifteen of them, and she unlacing her felt took out two more, and laid them on a Plate - She begged me to forgive her and let her go, since I had got all my Goods again.</p>

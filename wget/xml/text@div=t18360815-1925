                  </hi>. I live in Penton-street, Hanover-square. A little after five o'clock, on the evening of the 6th of July, I left my house in care of Hannah Barrett—I had left in the tea-caddy, nine sovereigns, and I had 55 counters—when I returned, three of the sovereigns were gone, and seven of the counters—these are my counters—I have the box they were taken from, and the other counters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You know how many there were? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, fifty-four or fifty-five—they were kept on a small side-board in the room—my house is for the accommodation of the gentleman of the Oriental Club—I opened the caddy in case any gentlemen should come home to tea—I told my servant, "Don't let any one go into the parlour, I have left nine sovereigns in the caddy, and locked the parlour door"—my servant knew the caddy was open—I did not go to the caddy till eleven o'clock at night—I did not count the counters till the next morning when they were brought to me—when I found some of the money was gone, I immediately accused my servant of taking them—I was not aware any one else had been there—I knew the prisoner, and I thought her a respectable child—she had lived with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutrix's servant. The prisoner and Ann Deeley came to visit me—I showed them up-stairs, and then into the room where these sovereigns were—they then went away, and when my mistress came home, these sovereigns were missed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you looked into the caddy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, my mistress told me she had left some sovereigns there, and not to let any body in but those I knew—I went to the prisoner's lodgings, and found her in bed—I and her landlady went up-stairs together—upon searching her, we found nothing—I did not tell the policeman to stay down while I went up-stairs to the prisoner, but he did stay down.</p>

                  </hi>. I and the prisoner called on Hannah Barrett on this day—we went into the front parlour, and then into the bed-room—we came down again—while Barrett was absent I went up-stairs for my gloyes, and the pri<lb></lb>soner was left alone in the parlour—the prisoner and I left together—we parted at the corner of Bear-street—I was taken at half-past twelve o'clock that night, and in the morning the policeman came, and said the money was</p>

               <p>found at her lodgings—I said to her, "How could you think of keeping me all night and not own to it?"—when we were at Marlborough-street Office, she said she had taken seven counters.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did she say that before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I mentioned it, she said it to me when we were alone—I told the Magistrate of it—I am a servant at Mr. Marsh's, in St. Martin's-court.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner lodged at my house for four or five nights before this occurred—I remember her being taken to the station-house—I searched the room, and found two sovereigns and the counters and some silver wrapped up in an apron under a knife-box.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had Barrett been at your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, when she brought the policeman in the night—the policeman did not go up<lb></lb>stairs—we both searched about, but not in the cupboard—Barrett had not an opportunity of putting this money where it was found, if she has chosen—we were in the room from five to ten minutes—it would not have taken a minute scarcely to put it under that box—she stood against the table in the middle of the room—the prisoner sat up against the cupboard door, where I found the property—Barrett went down-stairs first—I did not direct the policeman not to come up-stairs—the prisoner came home that night at half-past ten o'clock, and went up to bed—I undressed myself with her—she had been out of service from the Tuesday before.</p>

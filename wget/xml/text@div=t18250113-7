               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you known him? A. Nearly twelve months. I am a widow. He lodged at my house in New Cut, Lambeth. We were married at St. Bride's because I was married there the first time. He came to me as a journeyman carpenter and a bachelor, and said it was useless for a man to be in business without a wife, and that he was forty years of age, and had come from Liverpool - that he had a mother, but no other relation. I lived with him till about two months ago, when he turned me out of doors at twelve o'clock at night. I did not hear of his having a wife till after I left him. I never told any one that I knew of his previous marriage; my son is nineteen years of age - he was not the cause of our separation.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did that son ever give you any uneasiness? A. Never. I have had three children by the prisoner - they are dead. He had 580 l. with me at our marriage. He referred me to his mother, as he called her, at Liverpool, to prove that he was single; I got an answer to my letter - he said he hoped I was now satisfied as to his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130007"></xptr>being single - I said I was. I have said to him since our marriage that it was strange he had no letters from his mother - he said she was offended at his marrying in London, and my having part of my property settled upon me - that she had never acted a mother's part by him, and he did not care for her. He has treated me very bad for the last year, and frequently stood over me with a quart pot, threatening to do for me. We both belong to the Westleyan Methodists.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She was well aware of my being married before we went to church; she said she would look over all that as I was steady. When I lodged with her she took unbecoming liberties with me. I was completely drawn into her snare.</p>

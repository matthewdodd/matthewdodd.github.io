On the 8th of August I came home about a quarter before one o'clock in the morning, with my son, I unlocked the door, and desired my son to lock it. I found a light in the parlour, and missed the articles stated in the indictment from off the sideboard. The servant fetched the watchman and patrol, Mr. Slack came in with them, and the prisoner came into the parlour with them; I asked him how he came there? he said he came in with the gentleman; I asked him which gentleman he came in with? he could not tell. He said he came to help. He at last pointed to Mr. Slack, and said he came in with him.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. When we came home we found every thing in confusion; I went into the shop with a rushlight, and there I saw a man. I immediately went into the parlour, and fastened myself in, and got out of the back window I gave the alarm. I came in again when I heard the watchman knock, and went into the parlour with them and Mr. Slack; the prisoner entered with us and sat down; I said he very much resembled the man I saw in the shop, but appeared rather taller; he said he heard the cry and entered with the gentleman, but he could not point the gentleman out; from the conversation he learnt that Mr. Slack had knocked at the door, he then said he came in with him. I had given the alarm in the yard, and desired the people to come round.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I made as much noise as I could; there was time for the man to escape out of the shop; my father asked him where he lived, and he gave us a true address.</p>
               <p>JOHN DONOHOE. I am a watchman. I heard the alarm. The patrol, Mr. Slack and myself came up to the prosecutor's door together there was no person near us at the time. I am certain nobody but we three went in the servant let us in; the prisoner came into the parlour with us, and was given into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I saw the patrol shut the door and watch it.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I went to the house with the watchman a man and woman were calling murder at the front of the next house. No person but Mr. Slack, the watchman, and myself went in; I shut the door after us, and remained there a few minutes, when Mr. Bulmer's brother knocked at the door, and I let him in. In about ten minutes I went into the parlour, and found the prisoner sitting there I had not seen him on the premises before; I had seen him talking to two girls within forty yards of the house, about half an hour before the alarm was given; he could not have got in after we were in, or with us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. They must have been sometime in the house, it was in great confusion.</p>
               <p>JAMES SLACK. I am a shoemaker, and live at the back of Mr. Bulmer's house. I heard the alarm, came out, and the servant let me in, there was nobody at the door when I first came up. I called the watch and patrol; they came up, and we all went in immediately-nobody but us entered. The prisoner entered the parlour with us, and seated himself. He did not enter the house at the same time as we did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been with two young women from half-past eleven o'clock I heard the cry of murder, and went in immediately after the gentleman. I believe the watchman and patrol followed me.</p>

            . I was walking with the prisoner from Waterloo Bridge at one o'clock, and I asked him for a glass of gin. We went into the Spotted Dog, and came out together. I heard the cry of murder, and said, "let us go and see what is the matter." I ran, and he followed me. He got to the door first. A person knocked twice at the door, and went in; the prisoner went in after him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you meet him A. Near the New Church-he was walking towards Temple-bar. There was a crowd round the door. The prisoner was close to the door when the gentleman was knocking.</p>

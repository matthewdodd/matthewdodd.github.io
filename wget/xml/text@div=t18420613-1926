                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Little Compton-street On the 10th of June I was in Lincoln's Inn-fields alone, about nine o'clock in the evening—it was on the same side that Turnstile is—I perceived two persons behind me—I had not proceeded far before I missed a weight from my pocket—I then turned and saw two persons so near me as almost to touch me, and the prisoner was next to me—I saw my purse in his hand, and saw him pass it to the other man who was with him—I went up to the prisoner, and told him he had robbed me—the instant I said that, the other man ran away—the prisoner said he had not robbed me—a mob collected round us, and the officer came up—I gave him in charge—I had in my purse six half-crowns and a sixpence—it was a brown silk purse—I am certain I had it safe when I turned into Lincoln's Inn-fields—I know by the weight of it.</p>

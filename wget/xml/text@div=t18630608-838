                  </hi>. I live at 3, Regent-street, Deptford—on Saturday night, 9th May, I was in High-street, Deptford, talking to a friend outside the Prince Regent public-house—at that time my wife came along, and said, "I want some money"—I said, "All right;" gave her some money, and put the bag in my right pocket, and in two minutes a hand was reached into my pocket, and the pocket and contents went out together—I caught the party by the arm and breast—he edged away a little, but I kept my hold—I called a constable and gave him in charge—the prisoner is the man.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you see my hand in your pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am sure I caught the arm to which the hand belonged—I did not see anything in your hand—several people came round, but I continued my hold—you tried to get away, and backed yourself into the bar.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 10). On 9th May, I was called to the Prince Regent, High-street, Deptford—the prosecutor gave the prisoner in custody, and I took him to the station—while I was searching him, the inspector asked Pink what his bag contained—he said, "Twelve or fourteen shillings, some half-crowns, and two shillings;" and he could not say whether there was any other silver or not—I found on the prisoner three half-crowns, a florin, three 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., two 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces, and 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—going to the station, I was holding him by the left arm with both hands, he pretended to take some tobacco out of his right trousers' pocket, and I saw him put something to his mouth.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was it tobacco I had? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—there was a great crowd following us, and you might have got rid of the bag without my seeing it—you had a little tobacco in your breeches-pocket, and a pipe.</p>

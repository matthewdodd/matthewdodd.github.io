On Monday, 18th Jan., I went to bed about 12 o'clock, leaving the house quite safe—I saw that the back part of the house was secure—I came down about 7 o'clock in the morning—I first proceeded to the parlour adjoining the shop—I there saw all my drawers open and quite empty—I found the back door open, which I had left barred the previous night—it was off its hinges—a court runs up by the side of my house, and there is a door leading into it from the yard—that door was wide open—I found a pane of glass broken in the back parlour window, and the fastening undone, and the window thrown up, but they could not gain an entrance there in consequence of a bar that goes across the shutters, so they had evidently gone then to the back door—I missed a black satin gown, five sheets, four pillow cases, one pair of leggings, two pairs of drawers, five chemises, one porte monnaie, six yards of print, one scarf, two pairs of gauntlets, one work-box, a thimble, a silver coin, and two half crowns and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the value of what I lost is about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., besides the money—some of the property that I missed was afterwards shown to me by the police—I know the prisoner Smith—I have known him about the neighbourhood for years, as a loiterer and an associate of bad characters—I have seen him loitering in the neighbourhood of Lambeth Walk—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some articles</hi>) these are my property—there is a mark on this chemise, by which I know it—this scarf is mine, and this pair of gauntlets—this is all that has been found.</p>

I was at the station when Burgess, Smith, and Hillier were locked up—they were in three different cells—they must speak loud to make each other hear—I heard Smith call out, "Burgess, Burgess"—nobody answered—he called "Burgess" again—Burgess said, "Yes"—Smith said, "<hi rend="italic">Chumpy</hi> is here"—Burgess said he did not believe it—Smithsaid, "So help me God, it is right"—then Burgess asked Smith what would be the best way to get out of the trouble—Smith said he did not know; then they had a few words which I do not exactly recollect—Burgess said to Smith, "What are you here for?"—Smith said, "Oh, you know, that job last night"—Hillier did not speak just at that time, she did afterwards; she spoke to Burgess about getting out of it—Burgess, she, and Smith had a consultation what would be the best thing to do—Burgess said he thought the best way would be for him and Hillier to plead guilty, and they agreed to do so—Smith said it would be the best way; but Burgess said they should do it on condition that Smith, if he got out, should murder the man that gave the information against them—Smith said he would do so, on that night, if he got out—Hillier said that she would stick to it that Smith knew nothing about it, and Burgess said he would do the same, provided Smith complied with their wishes, that was, to murder the man—Hillier said, "Don't <hi rend="italic">brown</hi> to it that I put the things away"—I suppose that means do not tell of it.</p>

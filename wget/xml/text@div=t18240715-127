On the 12th of July; I went down into the wine-cellar (where there was a pipe of port on draught) to watch. The prisoner came there and staid about ten minutes, when he returned; I looked before the cask, and saw some wine spilled: I mentioned this to

             and about five minutes before eight o'clock that evening, while I was outside the door, Boulogne made a motion to me, that the prisoner had got something, he was then coming from what is called the kitchen cellar. I said</p>

               <p>"It is not eight o'clock, and probably the foreman will be angry with you to-morrow for going so soon;" he went back and we communicated the circumstance to master: he was then searched, he had long pockets inside his trowsers large enough to contain a bottle, and a breast-pocket that would contain a bottle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is not uncommon to have some wine spilled - A. No, but we had not been at work in that cellar; he had a pocket inside the thigh of his trowsers - the men are not allowed to take it away; they may drink what they like.</p>

             I went into the left hand kitchen cellar, and concealed myself; I saw the prisoner come and put one bottle into his right, and one into his left hand pocket, he took them from some lumber on the side of the kitchen cellar - I gave Mr. Bell information of it - I saw the prisoner afterwards in the counting-house with Mr. Bell, who told him to take what wine he had from his pockets - he then took one bottle from his breast pocket, and said he had no more, but afterwards produced a bottle of wine from his right hand breeches pocket, after I had challenged him with having it there - I have not compared the wine with that in the cask, nor tasted it, but I saw it poured out, and judged from the deepness of the colour, and thickness of the body, that it was the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In this cellar where the lumber is, is any wine kept - A. No; the men help themselves to wine while they are at work - if I had seen the wine in these bottles ten miles off I could swear it come from that cask - the prisoner said it had been given him.</p>

            : I questioned the prisoner as to what he had in his pocket - he said nothing: I said</p>
               <p>"Are you quite certain you have nothing? he said</p>
               <p>"I am not": I said,</p>
               <p>"Produce what you have," and he pulled a bottle of wine from his side-pocket: I called Boulogne, who said</p>
               <p>"He has got another bottle in his breeches pocket" - it was then pulled out: he then said it was given to him by a man named Rider: I said I believed it was our property. Our corks are marked on the inside part that goes into the bottle, but in drawing the corks of these bottles at the Mansion-house, one of them had a piece cut off. and the other was broken off, both of them might have had our name on it - it was fresh-drawn wine, and the corks were not sealed: they seemed very slightly put in, and not in the regular way: I have seen the wine drawn from the cask and tasted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150053"></xptr>it, and that in the bottles, and have not the least doubt that it is the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was at the Mansion-house you tasted the wine - A. Yes, I had not broken the corks in drawing them - we have many casks of one flavour: I cannot tell the vintage of this wine, but wine of the same vintage will vary in quality in one hundred different particulars - if I went into a tavern one hundred miles off, and a bottle of wine was brought, I could swear to the taste of my own wine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I told my master where I got the wine - I had it of a man named Rider - I went out to carry a dozen of wine, and he said to me</p>
               <p>"Here is two bottles of wine" - I said</p>
               <p>"I do not know where to put them" - he said said</p>
               <p>"Put them in your lumber place" - I did so, and my master asked me about them, I said</p>

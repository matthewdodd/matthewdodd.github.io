                  </hi>. I am clerk to Robert William Kennard, iron<lb></lb>monger, No. 167, Upper Thames-street. The prisoner Ashley came to me on the 20th of Jan., and presented an order for three stoves, dated 18th Jan.—he was alone—this is the order—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"18th Jan. 1845. Please send three 18-inch pantheon stoves. J. <hi rend="smallCaps">BOLTING</hi>."—Bolting was a customer of ours—we inquired of Ashley whether it was intended to be stoves or metal unmanufactured, as Mr. Bolting always had metal, not stoves, fitted—he said he would go back and inquire—he did so, and in about three hours returned, saying they were to be stoves—at that time he said Bolting's lad would come and sign for the three stoves—I did not see the other prisoner outside—the stoves were delivered to Ashley—he did not sign the book himself, but said Bolting's lad would come in and sign for them—Allen came in while I was talking to Ashley—he signed the book in my presence, and both went away with the stoves in a truck—I have the book here—my fellow clerk wrote the body of the receipt in ray presence—it is signed "Wm. Davey."</p>

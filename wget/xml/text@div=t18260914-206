            . I was in Thomas French's shop on the 21st of July, and saw the prisoner there, who had selected some leather out of a drawer on the counter - I saw him put his hand twice into his left-hand coat-pocket, very quickly, and accused him of having leather here - he said he wondered how I dare to accuse him of such a thing - French then laid hold of his collar, and took five or six pieces out of his pocket - he asked forgiveness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Was he sober? A. He appeared so - I will not swear he was.</p>

The prisoner came to my shop; the witness drew my attention to him, and he was stated fairly what took place; I found these pieces of leather in his left-hand coat-pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known him? A. Three years and a half; I always thought him honest - it might be distress that drove him to it.</p>

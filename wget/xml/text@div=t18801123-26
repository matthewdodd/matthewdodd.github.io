                  </hi>. I am a sailor on board the Victor, of Tynemouth, lying by the Tower—on Sunday last, November 21, about 11.10 p.m., I passed the prisoners in St. George's Street—they wished me good-night, and Neil asked me to stand a pot of ale—I said that I had no money—they pushed me into the middle of the street, and said, "Let us have that pot of beer"—I turned down Pennington Street, and they ran after me, rushed on me, and one seized me by my throat and jammed me against some shutters—Neil put his hand in my left pocket, and Harnett' in my right—I told them if they would leave me alone I would freely give them what I had got—they said, "Let us see what he has got"—I pulled 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out, and Neil snatched it, and Harriett took 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from me—they knocked me down three times, and the people from a house came out—I said that if they did not leave me alone I would call for help—they both kicked me when I was down, on the side of my head and the side of my nose, and on my lip and about my loins—Bardell came to my assistance, and they knocked him down—I went to his assistance, and they knocked me down a third time—a policeman came up and caught Neil on top of me, and Harnett was caught running away—they were both taken to the station—the policeman showed me my knife And a box of matches, which were safe in my pocket when I was assaulted.</p>

I am the wife of James Bardell, of 97, Pennington Street, St. George's-in-the-East—about 11.15 last Sunday night I heard somebody banging against my shutters, and heard a voice say, "Give me some money"—another said, "I have no money"—the other said, "Give me 2<hi rend="italic">d".</hi>—he said, "I will give you 24. if you will let me go"—another voice said, "Give me 6<hi rend="italic">d".</hi>—I opened the door, and saw them holding a young man—one had his hand in his pocket, but I could not see which it was—they pushed him inside my street door—I said, "Go away, and leave the poor man alone; what do you want to rob him for?"—they said nothing, but tried to get something out of his pocket—my husband was in bed, but he came out and said, "Go away, and leave the poor man alone," and one of them struck him and knocked him down, and the other kicked him on the face after he was down—the prisoners then set on Freeman again, and knocked him down in the road and kicked him about the body—a female called "Police," and a con<lb></lb>stable ran and caught one of the prisoners close to the prosecutor—I did not see what became of the other.</p>

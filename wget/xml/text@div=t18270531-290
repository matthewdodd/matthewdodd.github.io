               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was he parish-clerk before the passing of the Act? A. No, after. Mr. Plimley, the vicar, appoints the parish-clerk. Nine trustees form a board - they have appointed a clerk for themselves, that is John Scarr; the prisoner was parish-clerk, but had 12l. a-year for receiving these fees. The church-wardens rendered their accounts when they were called upon, and their accounts are audited by the trustees at their audit committee; there is but one general audit in the year, that is about June; the account is sworn to, and signed by the trustees present; that account should include fees received by the clerk for the burial-ground. There was a struggle between the vicar and the parish about who was to appoint the parish-clerk; it ended in a law-suit giving the vicar the right; the prisoner has had the place ever since. I have not heard of a desire lately to appoint somebody else.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the bearer of a letter from the prisoner to the Board of Trustees after he was accused of dishonesty? A. Yes. I gave it to the chairman.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. The contest was about the parish-clerk? A. Yes - a man named Limming then received the parish fees, and then the prisoner did it. The Vicar always expected the clerk to receive the parish fees. I believe the prisoner attended with his books and vouchers in June, when the churchwardens' accounts were audited. I do not know whether he accounted on oath - the churchwarden did. The prisoner accounted to me once a month, when I was churchwarden - he rendered no other account.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he account every month for the receipt of burial fees? A. Yes, and for vaults and tombs - that was his duty, and he did so with me. I was churchwarden in 1819 and 1820. I was a trustee in August 1825.</p>

            . I am a trustee of Shoreditch parish, under the Act of Parliament, and was so the beginning of this year. I was appointed one of the committee to investigate the churchwardens' accounts for the last four years. We had a number of meetings - the business was exceedingly complicated, and took a great deal of time; we began the last week in December, or first in January. Mr. Lane's accounts were investigated - he had been churchwarden, and left off a few weeks after Easter, 1826 - he was churchwarden in 1825. A very long report was made from the committee to the Board, and it was resolved that the prisoner should be prosecuted. I knew nothing of any charge against him before; the investigation was gone into without any idea of a felonious charge. After various applications made to the prisoner, at length these books (looking at them) were produced, under an order from the churchwardens, other applications having failed; here is one containing an account from 1823, to June 1826, it professes to be an account of monies received on account of the churchwardens for graves, vaults, and burials - it contains an account of money received in August, 1825. I have examined it throughout - no credit is given for money received from Mr. Brown, for a grave - there is no account of money received for a grave for Miss Storey - if he received any sum for it, it ought to have appeared here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. I am at the head of a large establishment.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you not a teacher of a congregation? A. I am, of the independent denomination. I was elected trustee seven or eight years ago - I attended pretty regularly. I generally saw Mr. Westall there - I cannot say whether he is more active than myself. I never heard him called the King of the parish. I have no wish about who shall.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310111"></xptr>be parish clerk. I never said I would do all I could to get the prisoner moved out - it is very probable I may have said in conversation with the inquiries of the committee, that such a man ought to be turned out. I am ready to admit that; I have no recollection of saying I would do all I could to get him turned out - I never said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say "I should he glad to hear he had run away and fixed his bail?" A. I never did. I said it was more than probable that he would, having done so on a former occasion. I believe the Grand Jury threw out two bills.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, did you not say, "It matters not; I will have another bill, or I have not done with him yet?" A. I met Mr. Westall, the church warden, on his return from the Grand Jury. I used no such words to him, nor to Mr. Teal - I have frequently talked with Mr. Teal on the subject. I believe I was one of the first who went before the Magistrate - several of us went; I believe Mr. Searr attended as solicitor. Mr. Harmer was applied to - but, I believe, I and the other trustees thought he had neglected us - we attended on the Magistrate three or four times - there was an application to discharge the warrant when the bill was thrown out, we opposed that - Mr. Harmer attended us; we understood that certain links of evidence had not been gone into; and we merely stated, that the case on which the warrant was granted, had not been brough! before the Grand Jury. I think only one charge was investigated by the Magistrate - several were made. The board ordered hand-bills to be printed to cause the prisoner to be apprehended - I believe I gave the order to the printer, he was taken three or four weeks after. I did not send three or four paupers to take him - he was taken by some paupers.</p>
               <p>Q. Can any human being, by looking at this book, tell whether the money paid by Brown, for Miss Storey's grave was paid in or not? A. We looked through all the bills which the church warden rendered - no such entry appears either in the book or the bills, this book was obtained by a particular application from the Vicar. The prisoner afterwards applied for the book, to go over it, and give explanations. I believe his application was denied - I do not recollect having any conversation with Mr. Lane; something was said about a vindictive feeling, and I said if a fine of 1s. would answer the ends of justice, I should be satisfied.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Were the monthly accounts produced by the prisoner? A. No; by the churchwarden; I saw them - they were in the prisoner's hand-writing; there is no account in any of them for Miss Storey's grave - here are the accounts delivered at the time Mr. Lane was churchwarden, there is no such entry. I believe they are in the prisoner's hand-writing - the names are in ink, but in many instances the figures are in pencil, I only went before the Grand Jury on this bill; when Mr. Westall said the bill was thrown out, I said "The board will not allow the business to rest here - there are too many charges; other bills will be preferred.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is this the same charge as the other hills related to? A. No; we could not swear to particular pieces of money in the other cases - what I said about a fine of 1s., was merely to shew that no vindictive feeling actuated us.</p>

            . In 1825 I was a churchwarden. I allowed the prisoner 12l. that year for receiving the dues - he rendered me an account of them; but not regularly, every month - there was sometimes a delay; when they were delivered, they were called over with this book - there is no account of a grave for Miss Storey - it should he there, I presume; but previous to my being in office they were not so regularly kept. I received the sums, entered here, at various times, but not always when the book was given in - he balanced his account at the close of the year; there is no sum of five guineas entered.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Though there is no specific entry, can you take upon yourself to swear that neither him nor his wife ever accounted to you for it? A. I cannot tell what he might have paid it from (looking at a receipt for 35l.) - I do not know whose writing this is - here is written, on the back, ten guineas and five guineas. I would not swear this five guineas has never been paid.</p>
               <p>The Court ruled that there was no proof of the money coming to the hands of the prisoner, in the particular specie charged.</p>

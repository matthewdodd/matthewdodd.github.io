             sworn. - I am a constable, and took the prisoner into custody, who appeared to be intoxicated; I looked at the money he had in his hand, which was the bad half guinea and the rest of the change, and then I took him into the back room, where I expected to find the change still in his hand, but by some means he shifted the half guinea, and brought the good one forward; I then searched him, but could not find the bad one; it struck me that in pulling off his cloaths, he had thrown it into the fire; I looked there, and found it on the coals, just warm. (Produces it, which was proved to be counterfeit.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been in a public-house, and had asked change for a guinea; I could not get it, and two young men followed me out, and asked if I got change; I said, no; we then went into this house, and asked for change, and one of the men said to me, here, master, here is your change, you are in liquor; I said, very well, and was taking it up, when Mrs. Wisher said, stop, that is not the same half guinea I gave you; I laid the change down again, and said, I am sure it is; then she said, it was very surprizing it was her's, and then the two men run out, and I was stopped.</p>

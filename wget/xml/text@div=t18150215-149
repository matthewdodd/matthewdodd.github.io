In consequence of information, I left my house at Acton, and came to Turnham Green on Tuesday morning; I had been there at six o'clock on Monday night, I had seen my brockilow all safe on Monday night, it was dark then, we were obliged to watch all hours. When I returned on Tuesday morning, I found three parts of one piece of bockilow gone, in that part there were one hundred and sixty-nine heads gone; on the over night the heads were there; I had a man to watch all night, his name is Watson.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that man here - A. No.</p>

               <p>COURT. Gentlemen of the Jury; the indictment must be made out with satisfaction to you, that it was done in the night, at the time that Mr. Potts came to the ground there had been day light some time; by the evidence it is impossible for you to say when it was done; it is for you to determine.</p>

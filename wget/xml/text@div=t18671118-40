                  </hi>. I live at 36, Beech Street—on the evening of the 13th November, between half-past eight and a quarter to nine, I was going down stairs, and when I had got to the first floor, which opens out on to the leads, I saw a man stooping down by the sides of the water<lb></lb>pipes—I looked farther out, and saw him wrenching the pipe from between the water closet and the first butt—it is a pipe that leads into the water<lb></lb>closet—I am positive he was forcing it out—I said, "What are you doing there?"—he walked into the house, and I caught him by the collar—I said, "You shall not go from me"—he tried to throw me over the stair<lb></lb>case; he made a rush down stairs—he left his cap on the stairs—I left him in charge of three others and went and got a constable, and after<lb></lb>wards came back to see what damage was done—the supply taps, cocks, and pipes were gone—the damage done would amount to about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had seen it about an hour and a half before, all safe—the prisoner at first shammed intoxication, but was evidently not so—he must have got into the house 'first from the street-door, and then have gone on to the landing, and then on to the leads—he had no business there.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody on 13th November—I found the pipes produced, lying on the leads at the prosecutor's house—one had been cut off, and the other wrenched off—they exactly fit to the remaining pipes—I tried them—I afterward found these three other pipes—the prisoner resisted me very much—it took five or six to assist me in getting him to the station, and a large mob of roughs collected.</p>

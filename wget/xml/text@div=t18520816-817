                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 44, Holy well-street, Strand. On 3rd Aug., about 11 o'clock at night, I was coming down Snow-hill with my niece, and felt a tug at my pocket—I made an observation to my niece, put my hand in my pocket, and missed my purse, which contained about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have not seen it since—I turned round, saw the prisoner, and followed him into a public house at the corner of Newcastle-street, and collared him—the landlord sent for a policeman, and I gave him into custody—when he made the tug I saw his hand pass in pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and live at 88, Farringdon-street. I am the last witness's niece—I was with her on this night, coming down Snow-hill, and saw the prisoner and a man behind him at my side—my aunt told me she was robbed—the prisoner was then nearest to us, and the other man ran away—I followed the prisoner with my aunt into a public house, and he was given into custody.</p>

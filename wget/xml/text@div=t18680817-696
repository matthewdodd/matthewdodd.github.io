                  </hi>, I reside at Blacksmith's Place, St George's Road—on 1st August, about 4 a.m., I heard a person enter the passage and go up to the second floor and try the door, but could not get it open—he came down, and my wife sung out, "Who's that?"—he then tried my door—I jumped out of bed, ran down stairs, and he ran out of the passage—I saw his back, but not his face—I put on my trousers, and went to look for him—I did not see anyone—I looked through the window—he came back to my sister-in-law's house, and was trying the door there—he could not get it open, but went three or four steps up, and lay down—at the same time Mrs. Chalkwright came out, and asked me if I saw anyone passing—I went with her, and found him lying on the stairs—she gave him in custody—I believe the prisoner is the man I saw in the passage—I can recognise his clothes very well.</p>

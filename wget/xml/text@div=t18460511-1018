                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On Sunday, the 19th of April, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was on duty in Whitechapel—my attention was called <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the springing of a rattle in New-street, White<lb></lb>chapel—I ran there, and found the prisoner beating Powle, policeman H 185, in New-street—he was on his back, and the prisoner struck me with a police<lb></lb>man's staff—there was another man on the constable also—I drew my staff <hi rend="italic">to</hi> hit that person, as he was choking Fowle, I struck him across the arm—he was choking him by holding him by the throat—I struck the man (John White) across the arm, and made him let go—I immediately received a very severe cut on the right side of my head from behind, and had before that seen the prisoner with a policeman's staff in his hand, and supposed it came from him, the blow seemed to be given by some instrument, not with the fist—sup<lb></lb>posing it to be the prisoner that hit me, I turned round to hit him, and im<lb></lb>mediately received a blow on the forehead, a very severe cut—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner inflict that blow with a policeman's staff—I fell from the blow against some railings—I was senseless for a minute or two—then recovered—I heard the prisoner calling out <hi rend="italic">to</hi> fling the b—r over the railing—I saw him, and heard him calling that out—my hat had fallen off when I stooped down to hit White, who was on the policeman, and I received both these blows on my bare head—my head bled a good deal—I was taken to the station by some of the constables—the prisoner was taken—a surgeon dressed my wounds—I have been very unwell—I was exempted from my duty for three weeks.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 198.) On Sunday night, the 19th of April, about nine o'clock, I was on duty near Wentworth-street, Whitechapel—there was a disturbance and fighting going on in Sugar Loaf-court, Commercial-road, near Wentworth-street—I interfered to prevent it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184605110035"></xptr>
               <p>five or six different times io the course of the night—the prisoner was one of the persons engaged in the disturbance—there were four or five of them altogether—having left them tolerably quiet, at half-past eleven at night I heard a call of "Murder!"—I went up the court, and saw Dennis Ragan there fighting—ha knocked me down, he said some wicked words, and dared me to touch him—I believe he is the prisoner's brother—the prisoner was there, and when I endeavoured to take him into custody, four or five of them tried to pull him away from me—the prisoner caught hold of him, and tried to pull him away from me—there was a large lot of people round—I got assist<lb></lb>ance, and got Dennis Ragan as far as Commercial-street, and there an attack was made, and an endeavour to rescue him—a gentleman said he would run to the sta<lb></lb>tion-house, and get assistance for me—they got me down on the ground—Dennis Ragan went down with me, as I would not let him go—they kicked me on the back while I was down—the prisoner was there at that time—White came up—I was standing with Dennis Ragan at the corner of Fashion-street, and there was a struggle with a policeman going on—185 came to my assistance first, and tried to help me take Dennis Ragan to the station, but was pre<lb></lb>vented by the prisoner—I saw the prisoner knock him about—I did not see him down on the ground—I saw blows struck upon White by Sullivan with a policeman's truncheon—Sullivan had then got a flannel jacket on—after he struck White, I saw him throw the staff over the railing—I only saw him strike one blow—White's hat was off at that time—I saw the prisoner there at that time—I did not notice whether he had anything in his hand or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the H division. On the 19th of April, j about twelve o'clock at night, I was sent for to the station—the policeman, Francis White, was there—I found two very serious wounds on his head, one on the right side, and the other on the forehead, which was not quite so severe as j the other—it was a contused wound, about three inches long, and extended to the bone—it must have been a very violent blow done by a blunt instru<lb></lb>ment—he remained ill for three weeks—he was in considerable danger at first—a good deal of head-ache and symptoms of internal injury.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business in Tooley-street, Borough, as a shoemaker, in partnership with my brother, who does not attend to the business there. A lad was in our employ, named Holmes, in December—William Woodgate, my foreman, sells boots if I am not in the shop—the boy had been directed to call down Eggleton, or another person, to sell—the boy was not authorized to sell at all—after we have sold boots and shoes, we punch them, and then cut on them when they are sold, and at what price—these boots are my property—they were made by Murphy, whose name is inside—here is the maker's mark across the bottom, and I know they were not sold by not being punched by my punch—they were in my possession in December—I did not sell them—I do not find on them the mark that is made when things are sold—the prisoner's brother rents a shop next door to mine—there is a</p>

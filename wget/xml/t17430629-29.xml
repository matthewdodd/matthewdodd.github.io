He had a Wife lying in, she fell a crying, and said, she knew nothing of it, and said the Prisoner was her Husband; I said if he would give me my Bundle I would go away, and have nothing farther to do about it. - I never had my Bundle since.</p>

I will cut you across the Face with a Candlestick, which he had in his Hand, and said he would knock me down with it; and when the Gentlewoman came up, she charged him with the Robbery, and he said if they were at his House she should have them again.</p>

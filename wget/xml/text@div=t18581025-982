                  </hi>. I am a soldier's wife, and live in Providence-place—I was present at the dispute between the prosecutrix and young Mrs. Sweeney—the fight commenced at about half-past 8 with a soldier's wife and a civilian woman who does not live in the court; it was about a Spanish onion—I had only a petticoat on, as I was going up to bed at half-past 8—the two women had done their fight and Mrs. Sweeney stepped out and commenced to talk—I told her to go in and not interfere, as she had her husband to take her part and we had not—Mrs. Cragin came up and said, "What have you to say to the soldiers' wives?"—she said, "B—r the soldiers' wives"—Mrs. Cragin said, "Anything you have to say against the soldiers' wives, take it out of me,"—I do not know what happened, but I said to the prisoner, "Separate them"—he was standing by, while the daughter was beating her, and he hit me in the eye and said, "I will separate you, you b—y soldiers' whores"—after he struck me he went up and hit Mrs. Cragin on the forehead with a knife, and knocked her down—it was a short jack-knife which opens and shuts—her boy lifted her up, and she was all over blood which was running from the cut—a surgeon was sent for.</p>

Q.</hi> Were there between sixty and seventy people present? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the women that had the first fight were Conlin and Hillier and then Mrs. Cragin came up to support the reputation of soldiers' wives—Mrs. Sweeney is as tall as Mrs. Cragin—I first saw the prisoner not five perches off—I did not call him out of the house, he was standing by—he was standing there at the commencement of the fight—I do not know Mrs. Symes; I know a woman who lives opposite—she is not the wife of a sailor—after this had happened, I did not say to another woman, "We will say that the prisoner cut it with a knife," and I never heard it said—I did not speak to a woman after it was over, only to the woman that brought her to the house—I never went out of the court—I could not go till Mrs. Cragin was brought out of the police-station; that was not five minutes after—there are scrapers by the side of the houses, but she was not near the scraper—I never said to another woman, "We will go and swear against these three, and say that the old man cut her with a knife."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of 71, High-street, Whitechapel—I examined the prosecutrix's forehead, and found a wound extending three inches down to the eyebrow and under the brow to the other side—it was a clear incised wound about an inch deep, such as a sharp knife would make—it was a slanting cut and descended very nearly to the temporal artery—it was a very dangerous wound—I attended her for four days.</p>

               <p>is sometimes found against the doors of poor people? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—an old used scraper of that kind would inflict such a wound as far as the eyebrow, but would not continue it under the eyebrow—it came under the arch of the eyebrow—I do not think that in any possible position a scraper could cut the eye, supposing it was cut to a sufficient depth; because a knife coming from the forehead would soon cut where a scraper could not come—the hollow of the eye would prevent the scraper cutting there—the projection on a scraper would occasion a contusion, but it would cut if it was sharp.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Brunswick-place, Backchurch-lane, Com<lb></lb>mercial-road-east—that is on the opposite side of the way to the prisoner's house. On 16th September, about 9 o'clock, I heard some women quarrelling in Providence-place; I went there, and saw Mrs. Gill and Mrs. Carter fighting—I parted them—after that I saw Mrs. Cragin put her head out of the window and make use of bad language, wanting to know what the civilians had to say against the soldiers' wives and that she would soon come down and scatter them—she came down directly afterwards and said, "I will soon scatter half a dozen of them; take it out of the soldier's wife any one who can do it,"—she then flew on Mrs. Sweeney directly, and they were both fighting together—their hands were in each other's hair and remained there the whole time that the fighting went on—they both fell together; Mrs. Sweeney fell against the door, and Mrs. Cragin on the scraper; they had hold of each other's hair then and Mrs. Sweeney was getting up but could not extricate her hair, and then I saw that when Mrs. Cragin did get up she was pouring with blood—the prisoner was eight or ten yards off at the time the disturbance was going on—I saw the fight from beginning to end—the prisoner was not nearer than eight or ten yards from her and he did not strike her—I saw no knife in his hand, and I was sufficiently near to have seen it if he had anything in his hand—when it was over I heard them say, "We will say the old man did it with a knife"—I am only acquainted with Mrs. Cragin by living in the same place—she sent for me after this on the Tuesday, as the prisoner was to have his hearing on the Wednesday—Mrs. Shannon came first, and I told her I would not go unless she sent her own child for me—I did go—I saw Mrs. Cragin and talked with her—she said, "Mrs. Jessop, I have sent for you about the old man; I will not go against him, and no one shall make me go against him, not all the doctors or policemen shall make me go against my conscience"—I said, "Well Mrs. Cragin, it is a pity that poor old man should lay where he is, when you know he is innocent—she said, "I will not go against him, and no one shall make me go; and for God's sake, Mrs. Jessop, if you can, go and fetch the old man out; go and fetch him to-day, for I shall never be happy until I see him again,"—she did not say whether he did it or not, but she said that she did not know who did it, or how it was done.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's daughter-in-law, and am the per<lb></lb>son who was fighting with Mrs. Cragin on the evening of 19th September—she had hold of my hair, and I returned it—after a scuffle we fell—her head fell against the scraper, and I fell against the door—at the time I fell I had hold of her hair, and she was doing the same—when we got up, the blood flew from her on me; it was pouring down—I noticed the scraper next morning, and all round it was blood; it was a foggy misty morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is this scraper at her door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; at Mr. Cox's door, eight or twelve yards from the prosecutrix's door—there was nobody near us; nobody tried to part us; somebody came up, but my husband said, "There will not be half-a-dozen tackle her."</p>

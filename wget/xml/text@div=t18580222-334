                  </hi>. I live with my father, at Old Ford; he is a cabman. On Monday night, 1st Feb., I went to bed at 10 o'clock, having fastened the place up—I saw a dead goose on the kitchen dresser, and a piece of pork in a dish—between 12 and 1 o'clock I heard a noise as though a door was smashed in, and then heard plates and dishes rattling—I got out of bed and looked out at the window, and three <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> ran round when I spoke—the prisoners are two of them; I know them quite well—I said, "All right, Chappell, that will do for you in the morning"—he said that he would choke me—I stayed at the window and saw Chappell again; he pushed open a gate leading to the back door, which leads to the kitchen—I went down ten minutes afterwards and found the door lying in pieces, and the goose and pork were gone—the house is in the parish of Old Ford, Bow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, of Three Colt Street, Old Ford. On 2nd Feb., between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was near Mr. Brady's house, and saw both the prisoners, and another, who went away so quick that I could not see his face—the second one was Ridgway; he had a white flannel jacket on; but since the police have been after him he has altered his coat—they were run<lb></lb>ning from Brady's premises, jumping over the fence—I heard the crash first, and heard Brady talking to them out of the window as I came up to the gate, and Mrs. Brady was close behind me—I said, "Chappell, what have you been doing?" he ran a little way down the street and came back again—when Mrs. Brady came up we went to look, and the door was in pieces, and the goose and piece of pork were gone—we went round the neighbourhood to see if we could see any police, but could not—I was at the public house that night; there might be a dozen males and females there—it was a female's wedding day, Mrs. Hill; Mrs. Brady was with us, and the prisoners; we were all close together—the prisoners were quite sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you quite sober. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and so was Mrs. Brady—we went to the public house at 10 o'clock; it was the Three Colts—the prisoners were in their own company—we had a little ale; we had no spirits—Mrs. Brady did not propose that we should go home and have some coffee—I do not know <hi rend="italic">Piggey George</hi>; I know George Shaw as a neighbour—I have known the prisoners a considerable time; I knew them when they had a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> moving the water butts—my house is not opposite, it is in the next street—I did not blacken my face that night—I and the prisoners were not marching up and down the street, and singing—there was singing in the public house—I got home about half-past 1 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GENT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoners leave the public house before you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, we all came but together, and I and Mrs. Brady came round the middle street—I do not know whose face was blackened; it was none of our party, that I saw.</p>

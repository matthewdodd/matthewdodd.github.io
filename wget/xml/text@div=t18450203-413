                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 155.) I live at the station in Featherstone-street, St. Luke's. Between one and half-past one o'clock in the morning, the 28th of Dec., I was on duty in Chiswell-street, and saw two persons at Mr. Tarrant's shop there—the prisoner was one—they were close to the shutters—I heard some glass break, and said, "What is up?"—they both came towards where I was—I said, "What has been up now?"—they then saw me and ran away—I followed, and called, "Stop thief!"—they ran to the corner of Finsbury-place and there separated—the prisoner ran across the square—I pursued, and never lost sight of him till he was stopped by Green in the square—I took him back to the shop, found the shutters shifted, and a square of glass broken—I saw some cigars on the pavement, on the very spot where the men turned round and started from—they are in this basket, and are cigars and cheroots—it is a cigar shop—I aroused Mr. Tarrant—he came down—I took the prisoner into the passage of the house—he denied having done it—at the time the window broke there was nobody near enough to have done it but him and his companion.</p>

I was in Finsbury-square, going home, about half-past one o'clock—I heard a cry of "Stop thief! stop him!" across the square—I did not see the prisoner directly, but could hear him, and in a moment saw him come running across the road to the iron railing—I stopped him—he said, "Do let me go, do let me go"—I said, "What have you done?"—he made no answer, but said, "Do let me go" again—I said, "What have you done?"—he made no answer—Haynes the policeman came up, and I gave him to him.</p>

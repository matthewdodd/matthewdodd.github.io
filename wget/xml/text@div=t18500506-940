                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Noyes, of Grove-terrace, Maryle-bone. On 10th April the prisoner came and offered some lead for sale—I told him my husband was not at home—I left him in the passage—a few minutes after I was galled by one of the workmen; and in consequence of what he said, I went into the kitchen, and found the prisoner there—I insisted on knowing his business—he said he came to sell the old lead—I told him he had had his answer before—I insisted on knowing what he had about him, as I thought he had stolen something—he said he had not—I perceived he was concealing something, and I took the steel from his coat, and in the parlour up-stairs he produced a carving-knife—they were my husband's property.</p>

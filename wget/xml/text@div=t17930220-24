On the 13th of February at half past two o'clock, I went down to get a little mortar, the ladder was not there as used to be, and I got down to the mortar by means of some boards; while I was putting the second shovel full in I heard some lead fall down, one part fell on the wall and the other on the joist; I immediately looks up, and see this Mahonay coming down the ladder through the joist, he was coming down three pair of stairs from me; I saw him coming down the ladder in that direction where that fell, and I fills my board full of mortar, and he came down, and I see him get over the wall, a back way; I don't think but that he saw me, he must hear me; I immediately came up and I found this piece of lead, one part of the wall and the other part on the joist; I picked it up, I goes directly to his foreman and told him what had happened, and afterwards we found this long piece in the same building, one story above, they both dropped down but one story above another, and I took it up myself; I knew Mahonay before he was employed on the building, he was a bricklayer's labourer; we went after we found the lead to seek some officer to take him up; we could not find any, and we took him up; we took Mahonay to the place, he had left the place and went to the foreman, and afterwards we came back again to the place, and then we carried him to Worship-street; his employ was in the basement story; the ladder had been taken out of the area; I had been down twice before, about half after eleven o'clock in that day; as soon as we came back from Worship-street I went down to Mr. Rolfe, and he told me to try to match the lead any where; I did; this was before he was committed, and the small piece and the large piece were all taken from the same place, they were both taken from the attick story, one was taken from the wooden roof which was on the laundry; the whole that is missing is not here by a great deal, it was sixteen feet four inches that was missing; and in the large piece of lead this chiswell was found. (A chiswell produced.)</p>

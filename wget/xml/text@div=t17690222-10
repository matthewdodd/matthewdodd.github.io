I halloo'd out, Stop thief. He was going off as fast as he could. He dropped it about three yards from me when I halloo'd out. I took it up. He never was out of my sight: I ran and catched him at an alehouse door as he was going in; he went down on his knees and begged pardon for what he had done.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say he had done?</p>
               <p>Jackson. I believe he said he picked it up. I am certain I had felt it in my left hand pocket coming through Newgate.</p>

               <p>I had been to Honey-lane-market, and as I was running along to make haste, I saw this handkerchief lying on the ground. I picked it up, and was running with it in my hand when he called stop-thief; upon which I threw it away. I lodge on the top of Saffron-hill, and was going home.</p>

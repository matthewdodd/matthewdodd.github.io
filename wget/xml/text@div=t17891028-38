               <p>The indictment opened by Mr. Knapp: and the case by Mr. Garrow, as follows:</p>
               <p>May it please your lordship.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the jury; I cannot help wishing for your being permitted to hear what I have to state; because this is a prosecution which, whether you consider the effect to the prisoner, or the importance of it to the public; in all the views, I say, in which it can be considered, it is a prosecution that requires your best attention: I believe there will not be any great difficulty in it, when the circumstances come to be understood, and to be considered with that attention, and with that discretion, which it becomes you to exercise, and which you bring to all subjects, certainly to consider them with. The prisoners, one of them, Partington, was coachman to Mr. Anderson: and it will appear to you that this offence has been committed, by him, in the company of another coachman out of place, of the name of Cave; and the third person, Lasceter, who had lived in the capacity of postillion and groom; both these persons had quitted the service before this robbery was committed; but it will appear without any possibility of doubt, that while Partington was in service he had meditated this robbery, considered the mode by which it could best be effected, had examined the weak parts of the house; and that in short, that which has ended in taking from Mr. Anderson by burglary, a very large part of his property, was formed while this man was in the capacity of a servant: Gentlemen, upon the 21st of September the house was made secure, by a servant who will be called; on the next morning, when that servant came down she found that the house was broke open, that Mr. Anderson's own room had been entered, that his writing desk had been plundered, and that the drawers in the room, and every thing else where any thing of value had been contained, were all of them rifled: from some circumstances in the character of Partington, the alderman entertained suspicions, and also of Lasceter; in consequence of which that man was taken into custody: on the 26th of September a man of the name of Piddington, a constable, went to a house called the Two Chairmen, and to which I will beg you to keep your attention, in the course of what I have to say; and in bed he found the other prisoner Cave; he told him he must get up and dress himself, and go with him; he enquired on what occasion; the constable told him no matter, he must go with him, and that he wanted the key of the stable: the key of what stable? the constable, in consequence of the information he had received, said, why, of the stable in which Mr. Anderson's plate is hid; he at first gave no answer; but at last he said, well let us go back, and in a chair covered with some hair, he produced the key of a stable; he directed the constable to that stable, that it was the next stable to the pump, in a certain mews, which he described, and that in a particular part of that stable he would find the things he was in search of; in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280033"></xptr>consequence of which, he, with other assistance, went to the stable and found a great number of articles: on the person of Cave, he likewise found a silver watch, five guineas, two half guineas, a quantity of silver, and several other things, which he confessed he had received as his share of a fifty pound bank note, which had been stolen from Mr. Anderson; and he likewise, I think, I am not sure, stated that a draft of forty-two pound ten shillings, which had likewise been stolen, at the time these other things were taken, had been burned: Gentlemen this is abundant evidence, one would think, to connect Cave with this burglary: I avoid for the present stating to you the evidence of Lasceter, because I wish you to consider this case as you go along, always remembering that you are not to attend to any thing that is stated to you from the bar, unless it comes out upon proof; but I wish you to bear upon your minds the different degrees of guilt which attach to these prisoners, in the different stages, always remembering how much of that guilt has attached before the evidence of the accomplice comes to be considered. The evidence against Partington is this, after Lasceter was in custody, he of course had given information, which led to enquire into the transaction; and Partington was pursued into the country; Partington was gone down to Liverpool; he was taken at Preston; and upon his person there were found some things which are extremely material for your consideration and attention; and in the lining of his breeches, next to his skin, I believe, one of those things, which you have seen lately, probably, one of those phosphorous bottles, with matches, by which you may procure light without flint and steel; this will be an extremely important circumstance in the course of this enquiry; there was likewise found upon him two keys, which he acknowledged to be his property, and which he stated to belong to him; there was a pocket book, and in that a receipt from the book-keeper of the Axe inn, in Aldermanbury, for two boxes which had been delivered, as will be proved by the person who had that receipt: Gentlemen, these things the prisoner Partington stated to be his own; the key will be found to open one of the boxes at the inn in Aldermanbury; the receipt will be found to apply to both the boxes found in Aldermanbury, therefore it becomes extremely material for you to consider the contents of those boxes; they contained among many other things, articles of Mr. Anderson's, taken by the persons who committed the burglary in question: when Partington was brought to town he was shewn these different articles, and among the rest a brass ink stand was produced to him; it was not at that time stated where that had come from; but he said it was his property. Gentlemen, it will be proved to you that the brass ink-stand was taken out of the box at the Axe inn, in Aldermanbury; this is to shew you that these boxes were the property of Partington; that the contents of them therefore, are to be presumed to have been conveyed there by him, and therefore it becomes expedient for him to account to you how he came by such articles. Gentlemen, in addition to this it will be proved to you, that the two prisoners, together with Lasceter, had for some nights preceding the 21st of September passed their evenings, and slept at the Two Chairmen, in David's-street, Berkley-square, where I told you Cave had been found in bed: so far we connect the three: but it will be material for you to remember that upon the very night of the burglary neither of these persons, who had for some nights before slept at that house, slept there; where they slept perhaps they will inform you by witnesses; I am afraid I shall be able to give you a very satisfactory account, that they did not sleep at all, but that when the rest of mankind were enjoying that necessary refreshment they were employed in this robbery. Gentlemen, I might pause here, and ask you, whether in a question which is to be made up of circumstances; and where a Jury are to find their way by circumstances; I have not stated enough, if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280034"></xptr>can prove it, to intitle the crown to convict these two unfortunate men. Gentlemen, in all iniquities of this sort, at human tribunals, we are not to expect that men who set about to prey on their fellow subjects, and commit depredations on the publick, should call witnesses to their guilt. I cannot prove that such and such witnesses saw the fact committed. All that in general Juries can expect, is that by circumstances, they may be satisfied of the guilt of the persons accused. God forbid, that in such a case as this, I should press it one hair's breadth beyond its due bounds; it is not my duty, and I hope I am not disgraced by the inclination. Gentlemen, there is another circumstance which I proceed to state to you, before I open the evidence of the accomplice; I told you these people would be shewn to have had connections together, at the Two Chairmen, after Partington went out of town; and after Lasceter and Cave were in custody. It was expected, that probably there would be some correspondence between these two persons; and therefore, very properly, directions were given, that any letters coming to Cave, so suspected, might be carried to Sir Sampson Wright's. I shall read to you a letter, which I shall prove to be the hand-writing of the prisoner Partington; it is addressed to the other prisoner, Cave; and before I read it, I wish you to understand, that you are not to consider that as evidence against Cave, to whom it is addressed, further than as it may be a corrobation of the evidence of the accomplice; and strengthen the evidence of the crime imputed. If you, or any of you, can understand it to refer to any honest transaction; if you think it does not bear on the point; if you think it is too obscure, to conclude any thing against the prisoners from it, for God's sake, reject it totally: but if you think that from the phrase of it, it can relate to no other subject, than that on which I have had the misfortune (as far as these people are concerned) to address you, it will confirm the evidence of the accomplice: it is addressed to Cave, at the Two Chairmen.</p>

               <p>"Friend, I would have one of you to</p>
               <p>"come down to me; and set off from</p>
               <p>"London on Monday next, for I have</p>
               <p>"got all ready; and stop at the inn at</p>
               <p>"Liverpool; if not, leave word where I</p>
               <p>"shall find you." And this is addressed from Liverpool; it comes, manifestly, by the post mark, from that place. Gentlemen, the only circumstance I bring it for, is to shew that the accomplice is confirmed, when he says these two persons were concerned in the burglary, and partook of the guilt. Probably, in the course of this session, you may have learned from the highest authority, that the evidence of an accomplice, though such as a Jury receive with caution; and though by the law of this country, it is admissible and competent evidence; yet no Jury is advised by the Court, nor do they at all feel disposed, if so advised, to find a person guilty on his single evidence; because, he comes here, confessing himself to be a bad man; and it is not safe solely to rely upon him: but in a case where without an accomplice, there are circumstances, very strong circumstances, to go to a Jury, where the accomplice appears to have discovered his own guilt, and the guilt of those concerned with him, in the earliest instance; where he is confirmed even in the smallest circumstances, he is a fit witness, whose evidence is to be taken into consideration; and on whose evidence a Jury may safely rely. Gentlemen, this man, Lasceter, will be called; he will tell you he had been postillion to Mr. Anderson, and became acquainted with the coachman, Partington; that Partington had planned the robbery; and he carried the other two persons to the place; and that they perpetrated the robbery in the manner he will describe. Gentlemen, it is fitter, and more safe you should hear it for yourselves; so much of it as is not confirmed, you will not very much rely on; but if his main story should derive confirmation from witnesses of undoubted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280035"></xptr>credit; from intrinsic circumstances, certainly then you will receive his testimony, with allowance for his situation. Gentlemen, in circumstantial evidence, the smallest circumstances now and then turn out to be extremely strong; and there is one, which it is fit I should draw your attention to. There was an ink stand taken from the writing desk of Mr. Anderson; it will be stated to you by Lasceter, that when they got out into the stable of the Alderman's, to divide the property, Partington said, this d - d ink stand had spilt in his pocket, and had inked him; upon which, he took it out, and emptied the rest of the ink on the hay; now you would expect that confirmation, and you will have it; because, in the pocket of the coat he had on when he was taken into custody, there are the manifest marks of the ink, which had in some manner stained that pocket; it will be for you, therefore, to judge whether this, though a single circumstance, does not confirm the accomplice. Gentlemen, this is a case in which I took the liberty to say, the lives of the prisoners were concerned; and therefore, it calls for your attention. It is a case in which one servant has induced another servant, and another person, not connected in the service of the Alderman, to perpetrate a burglary in his house; and it aims at the best securities under which we live. If servants will betray their trust; if they will meditate while in our service, how to accomplish their depredations on the peaceful dwellings of their masters, God knows by what tenure any of us can hold things dear to us. Gentlemen, the atrocity of the crime ought not to induce you to form a wish for the conviction of the prisoners, without the fullest evidence of their guilt: but if I can satisfy you by a strong unanswerable and unanswered chain of circumstances; if I add the evidence of the accomplice, who comes to make the only retribution in his power, to the laws of his country, that these two men are the perpetrators of this guilt; it will be your duty to the publick; it will be your duty in that sacred character of Jurymen, on your oaths, to pronounce them guilty. If you should have any conscious doubt, I am sure the prosecutor who sends me here, is one of the first men in the court, who will desire you to pronounce them not guilty.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was servant to Mr. Alderman Anderson; on the 21st of September last, I locked up the house, and made it secure; I was the only person in the house; I got up in the morning of the 22d, between seven and eight.</p>
               <p>In the morning of the 22d, was the house in the same state of security, as it was on the 21st, when you went to bed at night? - No.</p>
               <p>Describe how you found the house, at coming down in the morning? - The first place that I came to, was my master's dressing room, which I had double locked, I found open, and the key on the outward side; I went down stairs, and there I found the back area door open, and the candle standing on the bench in the area, in a common kitchen candlestick, which I left on the mantle-piece in the kitchen; there was half, or more, of the candle left; in the morning, it was nearly burnt to the socket; it was standing then on the bench in the passage, leading to the area; then I saw the footman's pantry door open, with the lock hanging by one screw; then I went up stairs, and went into my master's dressing room; there I could see the papers all of a litter on the carpet; I threw open the window; there I found the desk cut across; the top part thrown back; the papers all in confusion; rings, cases, purses, likewise the wardrobe; there was every drawer, every door open.</p>
               <p>In short, every thing was rifled? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you see in the butler's pantry? - There I missed the plate, a considerable quantity of plate; all the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know Partington? - No, Sir, I do not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280036"></xptr>Prisoner's Counsel. It was between seven and eight, when you got up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Broad day light? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was the only person in the house? - Yes; the area door was wrenched; one of the bolts was off; the door was cut, and the purchases down it, which had wrenched the door; I likewise heard a noise in the night.</p>
               <p>What time do you think? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was it dark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN PIDDINGTON sworn.</p>
               <p>I was a constable at the time the prisoner was taken into custody; on Saturday, the 26th of September, I took the prisoner Cave into custody, at the house of one Clarke, the sign of the two Chairmen, in David-street, Berkley-square.</p>
               <p>Did you find the prisoner in bed, or up? - As to stand charged upon oath, it is rather hard to say; he was getting into bed partly, and partly up.</p>
               <p>Did you find this man in his bed room? - Yes, Sir, I did.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to you, to be a person who had slept in that room that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now tell us what passed between you and him, when you came into the room? - I asked him if his name was not John Cave? he said, yes; I told him if his name was Cave, he must put his clothes on, and go with me; he made very little, or no answer; he put on his clothes, and then he changed them, and put on cleaner clothes; there was but very trifling passed at that time, hardly worth observation; then he asked me where I was going to take him to; I told him to the watch-house at present; and I asked him for the key.</p>
               <p>How did you ask him for the key? - I asked him where the key was.</p>
               <p>What were your own words? - I asked him for the key where the things were; I asked him for the key of the stables, where the things were, that they had robbed from Mr. Anderson.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him, that you wanted him respecting that robbery? - Yes, Sir, I believe I did; I could not recollect at that time the examination was taken, so perfectly; and I have made a memorandum since.</p>
               <p>What did Cave say to you? - Why, he seemed to say but little about the key at first, till we came down stairs; and nearly about the bottom of the stairs, I seized him by the collar, and called Mr. Clarke to aid and assist in the king's name; and he desired me not to lead him; I told him the laws of my country protected me to lead him, and lead him I must; and I put him into the parlour; we had some words there; I think, that I would not shew him lenity, without he would behave well to me; he desired to go up stairs; when we came up stairs; I followed him up as sharp as I could; when he came up stairs, he went to a chair in the room I had found him in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. What had you said to him? now, before you went up stairs; had not you told him that it would be better for him? - I do not know but I might; very possibly I might.</p>
               <p>You told him it would be better for him to confess, and tell you where the key was? - Possibly I might.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you mean that you did say so? - Did say what.</p>
               <p>Why, what the gentleman asked you? - I do not know, as I stand charged upon oath, but I might.</p>
               <p>That nobody should hurt him? - No, not that.</p>
               <p>Then, after that, I do not ask what he said, I ask a fact? - He went up stairs, and went to the elbow chair, apparently; and the bottom of the canvas was broke; and in the horse hair of the seat of the chair, was this key hid; and when he brought the key out, he said, there is the key of the stable; and where is the stable? says I.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. What he said, is certainly not evidence, after this promise, only that he gave him the key.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you mean to say,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280037"></xptr>that upon your recollection, you said any thing to this man, that coaxed him? - No further, than it might be better for him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then, do not tell me any thing he said? - I went to some stables in Reeve's mews; the stable next to the cistern.</p>
               <p>Did you find that the key which the prisoner gave you, opened the stable door next the cistern? - Yes, it did; then I went to the upper end of the stable, under a manger; there I found first some loose straw, apparently to me, left at the bottom carelessly; then I found some bricks laid over, as if it was almost intirely paved; for even the chinks of the bricks were filled full of dirt and rubbish; I took up some bricks, and scratched a little, and there I found a bit of the plate first; and there I found four snuff boxes, some medals, a silver pint pot; I have not had the things; Mr. Hougham and the Alderman, I believe, took them away; they were sealed though; I searched his person at the watch-house, after I had been at the stable; there I found five guineas in gold, two half guineas, eleven shillings and six-pence, and a half crown piece.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing else? - A silver watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. You got at the key, by your promise that it might be better for him? - That might induce him; I am pretty confident I did say so.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I believe you went down somewhere in the country, to apprehend one of the prisoners? - I went by the request of Alderman Anderson together with Sir Sampson Wright, to apprehend Partington; I got down there on the Thursday morning; I think it was in this month; it was after Cave was taken into custody; there was a warrant sent down from the office, to the mayor of Liverpool, before I went off; and that got down there a day or two before I got there; I got down on the Thursday morning, and went to the mayor, to know if any thing had been done with respect to the warrant that was sent down; and I found that it was agreed by the constable and coachman, to have him in custody that very afternoon; and I waited about a mile and a half from Liverpool, where I found him in a coach; I conveyed him to the watch-house; in the watch-house I perceived something in his breeches; and I thought the coachman had not searched him very strictly; I searched him myself; and I found this phosphorous box; I found it in the inside of his breeches; we went the next day before the mayor; and in the mayor's presence, the money, forty-four guineas and a half, and a pocket book, were delivered up to me in the presence of the prisoner; and the mayor asked him in my presence, whether that pocket book, together with two keys, and the forty-four guineas and a half in a purse, were all his property? and he there, before the mayor, voluntarily said, they were all his; the pocket book was opened at Liverpool; I saw the contents; there was a card which was wrote upon; this is the pocket book; it is now in the state it was delivered to me; Mr. Hougham had it; I then brought him to London; and at the examination before Sir Sampson Wright -</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Were his examinations taken in writing? - I fancy not.</p>
               <p>Was that which was said before the magistrate at Liverpool, taken down in writing? - Certainly not; at the last examination before Sir Sampson, Sir Sampson ordered that the keys might be tried to the boxes; and I tried them; and these two keys that were found on the prisoner, one of them opens the box exactly; the blue box which was before the magistrate; I heard Partington confess it was his box; he was asked if it was his box? and he said it was his; and he said, with all the contents in it; that box is here with it's contents; the other box we could not open, because there was a key broke in the lock.</p>
               <p>Did you see his coat taken off at any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280038"></xptr>time? - I searched his coat; and I pulled out the very pocket where the ink was; that coat is here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Is the coachman here, that took the man? - No.</p>
               <p>Then all you know, is that you found Partington at Liverpool, in custody of a coachman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you found two keys upon him, one of which opened the box? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I went to the Axe inn, Aldermanbury, to examine the boxes, on the 26th of September; they were produced to me by the last witness; I opened them in his presence.</p>
               <p>Were the things that are now in them, all in them then? - Yes, and more things.</p>
               <p>What things were in them then, that are not in them now? - Several articles of wearing apparel, for the prisoner's own use.</p>
               <p>How came he to take those things? - He said he was in distress for them, and wished to have them, and I asked Sir Sampson Wright, and he desired by all means to let him have what he wanted; there were things in both the boxes, and he claimed both the boxes as his; they were delivered to him by me.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any brass ink stand, being found in any of these boxes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you got that? - Yes, I forgot to put it into its place, and the gentleman who was with me, said you have left this out; well, says I, I will keep this, and he shall have it; I shewed that ink stand to him, and he said it was his; in the blue box I found a parcel sealed up.</p>
               <p>Court. I think as these boxes were allowed to be his, it does not signify which of them? - In the blue box there is a ticket; the key was broke in this lock, and I took and broke it open by the hinges; at the bottom of this box, after going through all the wearing apparel, I found a pair of silver tea tongs, close to that was a pair of new silk stockings, and close to that was a pair of plain cotton stockings, rolled up, as if they came from a washer-woman; I undid them, and at the bottom of one of the feet of these stockings, I found a ring; I was told it was a diamond ring, it is in this bundle; this bundle is in the same state in which I delivered it; all the things in this bundle were found in the blue box.</p>
               <p>Was you present when the prisoner was examined, and when his coat was taken off? - Yes, I took it off myself; I saw the pocket with the ink mark; the coat is here.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Counsel. The prisoner Partington was not present when you searched the boxes? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was it ever stated in his hearing what things were found in the boxes? - Yes, he said he knew nothing at all about them.</p>

             and Partington were at my lodgings; then we went to the publick-house in Old-street, the Rodney's-head, they were both together, and one of them told me they had tried to get into the Alderman's house that night; Cave went down into the yard first, intending to get into the stable, and Mr. Lathwick disturbed him, and asked him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280040"></xptr>what he wanted there, and he told him he was doing his business, and Mr. Lathwick came out and shut the gate; then they asked me if I would do it the next night; I said I was going into the country, I was not willing; then the coachman pulled out of his pocket a little brown box with a candle and some matches, such a box as that; he pulled the cork out of the bottle, and blew into the bottle, and lighted the match, and then his candle: (the box shewn him) I believe this is the box; they asked me again to go with them; we drank together, and I agreed to go with them to rob the Alderman's house; and we parted from there that night; I do not know what time we parted; I was to meet Partington again next morning, at the first publick-house, the right hand side in Oxford-road; I went and met him, and we went from there to Clarke's house, to find Cave, and when we came there he was not there: we went to the stable; we knew where to find him; we went to the publick-house, and had two pints of beer; he came over to us; then we went to the cooks-shop and dined; and we went to another publick-house, and had some beer; and we were to meet at the Two Chairmen in David-street again in the evening; I am not sure what time it was; I think about five in the evening, there we met; we went to cards there some time, with a baker; then Partington went up stairs to the bed room, and took a plumbers hammer; and we came away from there between six and seven, right into Aldersgate-street; the hammer was to break open the doors; we went by the gates once or twice, and then Partington went in; the gates were shut to, they were not fastened, that is the gate of the yard; it belonged to some butchers and coachmen; that must be about eight in the evening; then he went down and broke a pane of glass of the window, and opened the stable window, put down the bar, and opened the window, and got in; and sometime afterwards he let us in at the Alderman's coach house door; then we went from there up into the hay loft, and we abided there till near one in the morning; then we went from there on the leads, a kind of summer house, and got the ladder, and got down off the leads into the garden, then we put down the ladder into the area, out of the garden, and they two got down and got a light from Partington's little box, then they screwed away with a chissel, where the bolt was, and a plumbers hammer into the area door, that was the door that comes out of the kitchen into the area, and got into the passage of the kitchen; I continued above at that time; then they opened the door, and I went down; then they went to the Alderman's dressing room, and shut the door, and told me to abide in the passage; they bought a candle before they went to the house, but I am not sure whether they used that, or whether they got one of the Alderman's candles; they left me in the passage and told me to abide there; when they got to the Alderman's dressing room, they continued there about an hour; then they came out again; then they went from there down into the butler's pantry and shut the door, and told me to abide in the passage again; and they were there near about an hour longer; then they came out and put out the candle, and I went-up the ladder first, and Cave came up afterwards, then Partington came up last, and gave me two candlesticks; we had some small beer in the house; I asked Partington what he had taken those two candlesticks for; and he said he had taken all he could find; I did not mean any thing by the question, only I asked him; I thought they were silver candlesticks; then we went from there; and Cave told me they had got a fifty pound bank note, and a ring, and he shewed me the ring; and I told him I believed it was my master's picture upon it; it was a gold ring, and stones round the edge of it; the picture was like a man's head.</p>

               <p>Look and see if this was the ring? - I really believe this was the ring, or some such a one; I never saw my master wear it. Then we went up the ladder again, Cave first, and Partington went up, and he let the great silver waiter tumble; and I took it up, and asked him what do you take this for, you had better take this back, I said; and he said no he would not, for that was worth all the rest; then we went into the hay loft, and they pulled some of the things out of their pockets, and Partington put his hand into his pocket, and said the ink was run out of the ink stand into his pocket; and he pulled out the ink stand and emptied it on some hay, and said it had run in his pocket; I did not see the ink stand; it was dark; then they told me to go to my lodging, and I was to call upon them the next morning, or else at five in the afternoon; I followed them, instead of going home; then I overtook them on Holborn Hill, and got along side of them; then they got into a hackney coach, somewhere by Holborn, and bid me a good night; and I went to my lodging; I did not take any thing with me; the next morning I went about eleven to the mews, and I asked for

               <p>Prisoners Counsel. Well, Mr. Lasceter, so having lived seventeen months with the Alderman, you was the person that committed this robbery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The coachman had not lived with him so long by a great deal, as you had? - No.</p>
               <p>So you made shift to make your escape, when you was apprehended? - Yes; I thought I was not wanted any more.</p>
               <p>You never thought of telling it, till you was apprehended? - No; I should have done it.</p>
               <p>You should have given evidence of it, without being apprehended at all? - Yes; they asked me about it, and then I told them.</p>
               <p>It is not usual for you to rob your masters in this manner? - It was not my fault.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a servant? - Six or seven years.</p>
               <p>You never saw the ring, before Partington shewed it to you? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. After you had been once taken, you was at large? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go voluntarily afterwards, and make the confession? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Not in custody, but voluntarily? - I was not in custody.</p>
               <p>- HOUGHAM sworn.</p>
               <p>This property was delivered to me; they are in the same state they were when delivered.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. It was your misfortune to have the witness Lasceter, and Partington, for servants? - It was.</p>
               <p>How long did the coachman live with you? - Fourteen months; the other, seventeen.</p>
               <p>In the course of Partington's service to you, did you become acquainted with the character of his hand writing? - I did; I have seen him write several times.</p>
               <p>Look at this letter, and tell me if it is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280044"></xptr>Partington's hand writing, from your knowledge of his writing? - I verily believe it to be the hand writing of

               <p>"Friend, I would have one of you</p>

               <p>"Liverpool."</p>
               <p>You have at some time, probably, heard these several articles which are in the indictment, enumerated? - I have.</p>
               <p>Did you lose all these articles at the time of the burglary? - All these, and more; that ring is mine; I am very positive to it; I have had it ten or twelve years.</p>
               <p>Have you the smallest doubt of its being yours? - None in the world; I cannot swear so positively to the tea-tongs; but a servant of mine can; this waiter is mine, and this toast rack; this large waiter has my arms upon it; all the things that are in that box are my property, and were lost at this time.</p>
               <p>Court. I will ask you Mr. Alderman, for form sake, the value of the whole? - Three hundred pounds, including the bank note, and the draft; there are a couple of gold boxes, which are very valuable; they cost, perhaps, a hundred and forty, or a hundred and thirty guineas.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Your coachman used to sign his bills? - Yes; and his receipt for his wages; and several weekly bills for brooms, and other things; he has written some of them in my presence; and added to them, he has signed a receipt for his wages.</p>
               <p>Because, in this letter, there is no name? - Oh, I do not go from the name, but from the hand writing, I believe it verily to be his.</p>
               <p>(The coat, with the pocket inked, produced by Townsend.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Alderman Anderson. Did you lose an ink stand from your writing table? - I did, and it is there.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. We leave it to our counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Partington called seven witnesses to his character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Cave called six witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

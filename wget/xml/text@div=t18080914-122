I let the lodging for five shillings a week to the prisoner and her husband; she came to the lodging on the 18th of June, she left it on the 11th of August; she paid the first four or five weeks as they came due, and after that they ran a fortnight; then they staid away two days; they having the key of the room, we got an officer, he broke open the room door; we found the sheets and candlestick gone; the bed had been opened and nineteen pound of feathers taken out of the bed; we got an officer and took her up.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not take up the husband - A. I could not find him till two or three days ago, I saw him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140063"></xptr>in the street; she was the first that I met; I was determined to take her up.</p>
               <p>Q. You was determined to take up the first you met - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He continued with her and slept in the lodgings to the last - A. He did; they were both together.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he pretend to be - A. A carpenter and sash maker.</p>
               <p>MRS. FIELD. This woman took a ready furnished room of me in the morning, and her husband came at night; they lived together, they paid very regular; he paid one time and she another for the course of a month; they owed me a fortnight's rent when they went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the husband since - A. I have seen him a few days back, since the bill was found; I saw him yesterday at a public house door; the moment he saw me he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you accuse her more than him - have you found any of the things - A. Yes, the sheets and the candlestick.</p>

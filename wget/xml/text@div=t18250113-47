The counting-house is at a short distance from the dwelling-house, which she inhabits, in the stable-yard, and is all in closed in the same wall with it; on Monday the 27th of December, in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130019"></xptr>evening, I had twenty-three sovereigns, and seven half-sovereigns, in a bag, and one hundred shillings, eight half-crowns, and six sixpences in another bag; they were locked up in a desk in the counting-house - I saw it safe about seven o'clock in the evening - the prisoner was a helper in the stables, and had been so for six months - it was his turn to be left in care of the yard that night - I went out about seven o'clock, and returned about nine, but did not go into the counting-house; the gates had been shut two hours before I went out - strangers come in by ringing the bell; it was his duty to open the gate - I had left the counting-house locked, and had the key in my pocket; about nine o'clock that night, Moody shewed me the desk; it had been broken open, and the money was all gone: I went to the counting-house, and there were marks of some instrument being used to open the door - I could not get an officer that night - I asked the prisoner if he knew any thing about it; he said he did not - I said it was strange, that any one should come in and break the desk open, without his knowledge; he said he might have been asleep in the stable; it was his duty to leave at ten o'clock - next morning I went and got Dew the officer; he is since dead; on the Wednesday, Dew and I searched the stables, and found the bags and money concealed under two bricks in the stable; it was the prisoner's duty to work in that stable; he was in the next stable when it was found - the officer told him of it - he said nothing to it; there were 27 s. in silver missing.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Walton.

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. I was with Dew on the 29th of December, at Walton's, the White Horse stables, King-street; the prisoner was called to me - I searched his lodgings, and finding no clothes there, I asked where he kept them; he said in the stable - I went to the stable, and in his box I found twenty shillings and four half-crowns; he said he had received 16 s. 6 d. from Dawson, on the Saturday night - I went over to the counting-house, and found the desk had been broken open; it had the impression of a shoe tip on it - I took off the prisoner's shoe, and the heel matched the mark exactly; it appeared to have been knocked in with his feet; I then searched the stable, and found the bags of money as Dawson has stated; Dawson gave me a pair of scissars, which I compared with the door-post, there was an impression which tallied with them.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DAWSON. There were some half-crowns among the silver; I know the bags and money; here is a memorandum of the money in one bag, in my own writing - I have known the prisoner seven or eight months; he was as good a servant as I ever knew, and never drunk.</p>

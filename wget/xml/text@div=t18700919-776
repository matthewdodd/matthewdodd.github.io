                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer</hi>). On 2nd September, I received information, and on the 3rd I watched 10, Cross Street, Battersea—I saw the prisoners leave together about mid<lb></lb>day—Ovinger and I followed them for a mile down the road—I then took the woman in custody, and told her it was for passing a counterfeit half-crown in the Wandsworth Road, and attempting to pass another on the 31st—she said "Nt me"—I received this bad half-crown (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Mrs. Scott, and the searcher gave me this other—the prisoner Julia said that Edward Hart was her husband, in his presence, but she afterwards said he was not, and they were only living together.</p>

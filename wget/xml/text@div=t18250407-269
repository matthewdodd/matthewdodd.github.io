On the 25th of March, I went to bed about eleven o'clock at night, and next morning I found three of the squares in the area window had been broken; a man could have put his arm in and unbolted the window; the prisoner had been in my employ for three years as an errand boy - but I had discharged him on the Saturday before.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PUGH. I am servant to Mr. Price; it is the warehouse window which was broken; it was safe after dusk; I was up stairs and heard the window broken; I came down and called the watch; I took two watchmen inside, and left one outside; we found the prisoner in the area, in a state of concealment; he must have lifted up a heavy grating to have got down; there were three squares broken quite out, and some more cracked; he could then have undone the fastenings.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on Snow-hill, and was called to Mr. Price's house; I found the prisoner in the area; the window was broken, and the frame of the window had been wrenched four or five inches - he did not appear to be at all in liquor or insensible.</p>

            . I was the constable of the night. The prisoner was brought to me; I found a piece of liver, and a phosphorous box on him; and in the area, we found a small iron crow, which they call a jemmy, and a knife.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence; stating that he had met two men, who made him intoxicated, and then gave him a crow-bar, and lifted up the area grating and persuaded him to go down, which he refused, but they forced him down, and in the scuffle the glass was broken.</p>

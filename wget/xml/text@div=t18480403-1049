On 9th March, about four o'clock, there were ten sacks of beans in a warehouse belonging to him—I assisted Ball with a sack on his shoulder—he went up our loft—I sent a porter named Allen up with a sack—I went to my master's with another—I did not see either of them come down—I was gone about a quarter of an hour—I left the ten sack safe—I came back, and began taking the market sack into loft, and missed a sack of bean from the loft—I told my master—I had not seen any one on the premises that day, except Ball—there was time to remove a sack from there to Harman's while I was away—I left the door unlocked.</p>

On the afternoon of 9th March I went to Harman's to show Barrett nine sacks of wheat—I counted them, and found there were ten—I fetched one away in the morning—I then went again, and found ten—the tenth contained beans—Harman then came to the stable—I told him there was a sack which I through was sack of peas, but I found it was beans, and not to let that go with Mr. Bradshaw's wheat—he said No, he would take care; he should be at home, that he kept the key of the place, no one else had access to it, he had come to lock it up—I pulled the sack down to show him the name of Trumper on it.</p>

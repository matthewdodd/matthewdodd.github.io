On 4th June the prisoner came there, and asked for two yards of calico—she paid me with a bad half crown—I told her it was bad—she said she did not know it, and if I would give it her back she would take it to where she got it from, and come back in a few minutes, and I was to keep the goods till she returned—I gave it her—she did not come back again—I am certain the shilling was bad—I tried it and bent it—on 18th June she came again for a pair of black stockings—she bought a pair at 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she paid with a bad half crown—I called the cashier, and gave it him—it was not out of my sight—it was a bad one—the prisoner was then given in charge—I gave the last half crown to the officer—I had seen the prisoner in the shop with bad money on 5th June, but I did not speak to her, as we were very busy; but I told the young men that that was the woman who had passed bad money—when she was given in custody for the last half crown I told her that she had been in the shop three times before—she said she had never been in the shop but once before—she said she lived at Peckham, but did not say where there.</p>

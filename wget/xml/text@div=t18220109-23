On the 1st of December, the prisoner came to my shop, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, and asked the price of a ream of gilt-edged writ-paper; I shewed him some, he asked the price, I told him 26 s. He asked for some at a lower price, I shewed him some at 24 s. the ream; he said that would do. I then looked out for him half a hundred of pens, at 12 s. a hundred, and asked if he would have a bill, he said Yes, and his name was Scott, No. 44, Bedford-square. I made out a bill for Mr. Scott, No. 44, Bedford-square; he gave me a 10 l. note, I took it, and suspected it; I held it up to the gas, and was satisfied in my mind it was bad. I told him I could not give change, I went out to Mr. White, next door, and shewed it to his shopman, who said he thought it bad; he gave me the same note back. I got the shopman to send for an officer, and I returned to my shop, I had left the prisoner in the care of my wife. Mr. White went with me and one of his partners; two young men came in, there were some persons round the door, but they did not appear to be concerned with the prisoner. I told the prisoner it was a forged note, he said it was not, that it were all right. I told him he should not leave the shop until I had ascertained the truth; Mr. White came in before I sent for the officer, he looked at the note, and said in the hearing of the prisoner, he was of opinion it was forged; he then left the shop. Plank and Wales came in, and the prisoner was searched; the note was examined by several persons, and the two young men looked at it, and White's partner looked at it, returned it me, and I gave it to Plank, after putting my initials upon it; (looking at it), this is the same note, there is R. W. on it.</p>

I returned to the office, and told the prisoner I could not find any such person as he described - I desired him to write the name and place; he began to write, but being flurried, he desired me to write it, and he would sign it.

I offered to go with him to where he lived, or else to the square, to Mr. Scott, he said,</p>

They walked into Oxford-street, and he directed him to go into Mr. Wedgwood's, and buy a ream of paper and half a hundred of pens, and say he came from Mr. Scott, Bedford-square; and that they were to divide the change, if they were successful in passing the note. That the man who gave it him, came into the shop, and Mr. Wedgwood turned him out; and that they lodged together, at No. 1, Bell-alley, Goswell-street, close to the Horseshoe, public-house. Early on Sunday morning, Wales and I went there, and found John in bed, he was examined, and finally discharged.</p>

I made him a bill, it came to 25 s., he was going out; he then turned back and said, he might as well pay for them, as perhaps he should not be at home when they came - he then tendered me a 10 s. note; I found I had not sufficient change by 3 l. I went to different neighbours, who could not change it. I asked Mr. Roberts for change, and gave the same note to him, he went to Mr. Shaw's, next door to get it changed. I stood at Mr. Robert's door, he returned, and gave me ten sovereigns. I went back and found the prisoner in the shop, I could then give him but 8 l. 12 s.; I told him I was still 3 s. short of change; he said</p>
               <p>"Never mind, tell the boy to give it to the servant, when you send the goods, and he will give it to me." I said I was much obliged to him, and went to the door with him. He turned towards Dr. Outram's and went away; I sent the goods to Dr. Outram's, half an hour after, with 3 s. wrapped in paper, and in a quarter of an hour after, the Drs. servant returned the goods to me - the prisoner never called for them. About a fortnight after, I heard what had happened at Wedgwood's, I went there, saw the prisoner in the shop, and knew him.</p>

            . I am a silversmith, and live in Angel-street, St. Martin's-le-grand. The prisoner came to my shop, on the 16th of March, 1821, about twelve o'clock; he gave me a written order from Mr. Adams, No. 32, Compton-street, Clerkenwell; he said he came from him; the order was for silver articles, which were looked out - they came to about 14 s., he tendered a 5 l. note; I examined it; he stood at the shop window, which was open. I told him to come into the shop for his change; I marked the note, (looks at one), this is it, it has Adams, Compton-street; I suspected the note, and told him that if two which I had returned to me before were bad, this was a bad one also; he said that was his master's, and where he lived it was written on the order, Adams, No. 32, Compton-street; he said he lived errand boy with him. I sent for an officer; he was searched and a few shillings found on him. I enquired at Compton-street, but no such person was to be found.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live in Windmill-street, Finsbury-square. On the 30th of January, 1821, the prisoner came to my shop, and bought two loaves, and paid me a 1 l. note - I asked where he came from; he said No. 4, Hill-court, Hill-street; he gave the name of Wilson, (looks at one), this is the note; I gave him his change, and I said I must go with him to see if his account was correct, and about half way down the street, on the side the court is on, he crossed over to the other side turned round, and said the woman was gone who gave him the note - I took him back to my house, and gave him in custody; he was afterwards discharged.</p>

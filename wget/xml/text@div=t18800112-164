                  </hi>. I am cashier to George Brittain Kent and another, Brushmaker, of Bonner's Road, Bow—I live in a house which is part of the factory—the premises are entered from Bonner's Road by an iron gate, and there is then a court or yard enclosed by a swing gate, which is fastened by bolts inside, and is about seven feet high; that shuts off the factory—formerly the safe in which the money was deposited was kept in the factory, in an office close to the door opening out of the courtyard—about 18 months ago a man named John Sparrow was a workman in the factory—he left in July, 1877—at the time the safe was kept in the office; it is now kept in my bedroom—the window of my bedroom overlooks the two yards where the gates are—on 11th July last, about 11 o'clock at night, I heard a noise in the yard, as though some one was getting over the gate—I heard a grating as though the bolt was being undone—I got got up and saw a man undoing the bottom bolt, and he stood up and undid the top bolt—the man was on the inside of the gate, on the premises—that man was Sparrow—he then opened the gate, and two men entered—the prisoner is one of those men—after they had entered the gate was shut, and bolted at the bottom by one of men—I then dressed, and went round some houses into Robin<lb></lb>son's Road where two of our men named Warren and Newman lived—I called Them Up—warren and I went through his garden back to the house—I Lighted a lantern, and we passed through my house to the inner yard—I There saw two men crouched down behind an iron tank—they were Sparrow and the third man—I asked what they were doing there—before I could receive any answer they jumped up and sprang out upon us, and the prisoner who was hiding in a urinal, struck Warren over the head with an iron instrument which he had in his hand, and instantly felled him to the ground—I could not exactly see what the instrument was; it looked like a long iron bar—he then rushed at me, and hit me over the head with the same instrument, and I reeled against the wall—the third man then ran up the yard and opened the gates and got through—the prisoner was getting through when I recovered myself, and by that time Sparrow had got to the iron gate—I rushed up to them—Sparrow struck at me with an instrument that he had in his hand, severely cutting my hand—I hit his over the head with a heavy lantern I had in my hand—he got through to the iron gate, and they all three ran down Bonner's Road towards Bishop's Road—I followed calling "Police"—there is a public-house at the corner of Bishop's Road, where they alwayshave a very bright light—as I came up to the public-house under the light the prisoner turned round to me, and said "If you come any farther I will murder you," and he threatened me with the instrument he had in his hand—he was then under the light, and I had an opportunity of seeing him very distinctly—he is the man—I still followed to the Waterloo Road, where I saw Tierman and Field, and spoke to them, and gave up the chase—I was overcome from loss of blood—I went to a doctor, and after that went to the Police-station the same night—I there found Sparrow in charge; he seemed</p>

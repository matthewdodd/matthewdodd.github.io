                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, B</hi> 55). I took the prisoner into custody on 30th Nov.—I told him I must apprehend him for obtaining goods under false pretences from Mr. Legg and Mr. Davis—he said, "I will pay them as soon as I get my pension, that will be on Wednesday"—I said, "What have you got to say to forging Captain Williams's name?"—he said, "I am very sorry that I ever saw him."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Lieutenant Williams wished to raise 100 recruits at his own expense, with a view to obtain his commission, and engaged me; it is customary to take the recruits to a coffee house; sometimes he would write the order, and when unable to get the money, he has authorised me, both verbally and in writing, to get a bed and supper; he knew I was without money, and during the week I took the usual order for bed and supper; on the Saturday he would come to no terms, and I had no alter<lb></lb>native but to request my creditors to wait till the following Wednesday, but in the interim he gave me in charge; I went to India in 1842, as orderly-room sergeant, and have served in the Gwalior campaign, in the Sutlej, and the Punjaub, and received one star and two medals, with clasps; what I did I did in ignorance, and without the most remote idea of doing wrong.</p>

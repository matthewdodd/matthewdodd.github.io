                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the money-order office, Chancery-lane—on Wednesday, 30th April, between 2 and 4 o'clock, the prisoner came and asked for three shilling's worth of postage stamps—he gave me a half-crown and two threepenny-pieces, and left—I directly took up the half-crown, and detected that it was counterfeit—I put it by itself, and next morning gave it to the policeman F 178—next day, Thursday, 1st May, the prisoner came again, about half-past 12, and asked for three shilling's worth of stamps—I recognised him immediately—I gave him the stamps, and he put down three shillings—I looked at them—one was counterfeit, two were good—I told him I had been anxiously waiting, and wanted to see him, for he gave me a bad half-crown last night—he said he had never been at the shop before—I detained him, and gave him in custody with the bad shilling.</p>

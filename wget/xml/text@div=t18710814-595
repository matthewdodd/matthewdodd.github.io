I am a captain in the Argyll and Bute Militia—I have a public appointment—my salary is now about 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I live with my parents at Blackheath—I am twenty-six years of age—I first saw the prisoner in January, 1870, in the Brompton Road; I met her by chance—I got into conversation with her, and went to her house, Ivy Lodge, North End, Fulham; she lived there—I went there that evening, about an hour and a half or two hours after I met her—an intimacy com<lb></lb>menced at that time; the same day that I first met her—I visited her, there, once or twice, up to September of that year—in December I took a house at St. Anne's Villas, Royal Crescent, Notting Hill—she removed her furniture there, and we lived there together—between September and De<lb></lb>cember my visits had become more frequent—I lived there with her for about five weeks—I discovered that she frequently indulged in stimulants—during that five weeks I left her once; I think more than once, but I am positive I left her once—before I left her I saw her with a table-knife in her hand one night; that was in January—it was after I had gone to bed—I had dropped off to sleep, and Mrs. Sadler was down stairs—when I awoke I found her at the side of the bed, on her knees, with the knife in her hand, looking at me—I got out of bed, and took it from her, and threw it under the bed—she then came to bed, and during the night I woke up and found she was outside, on her knees, groping under the bed, but the bed was only about half a foot from the ground, and she could not get more than her arm underneath, and when she found that I was noticing</p>

               <p>her she got into bed again—nothing was said about it that night, but next day she said she only did it to frighten me—in April, 1871, she removed from St. Anne's Villas to Harwood Road, Moor Park—I left her, and went into lodgings, at Chelsea, at the beginning of February, with Mr. Esse, a friend, of mine—I still continued to visit the prisoner at intervals, and she some<lb></lb>times came to my lodgings—she frequently made use of threats to me; she said that I should never leave her, except by force, and she threatened to go down to Blackheath, and expose all about me to my parents—there was no other threats whilst I was lodging at Chelsea—she was once taken to the Westminster Police Court for creating a disturbance at the lodgings, bat I was not present—in the Harwood Road she said she would kill me; that was about a week before this occurrence—I was alone with her; it was at her house—I told her that I was going to leave her, and* she frequently said during the day "You shall never leave me, I will kill you sooner"—she continually repeated that, at various times, whenever I mentioned that I should leave her—I told her that very often, and I asked her to talk quietly over it, and see if we could not leave quietly, and she constantly said I should never leave quietly, it must be force that would take me away, that I should never leave her; she said "You shall never leave me, except by force"—this occurred on more than one day, two or three days running, whenever I broached the subject—on one of those occasions I saw the same dagger that I was afterwards stabbed with, lying on the bed—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she went out of the room, one night, and brought it in; that was about four or five days before I was stabbed—she did not say anything then, she thought I was asleep—I was in bed; she was in bed, too—she got out of bed, went into another room, and brought that dagger back with her; she laid it on the bed, and then went to her wardrobe—I jumped out of bed, and took hold of it, and threw it on the top of the wardrobe, and asked her what she was doing—she made no answer, but got into bed again; and next day I took it from the wardrobe, with three others of the same sort that were in the back room, and threw them on the top of a cup-board, out of reach, unless you got on to a chair to take them—next day I asked her what she meant by it, and told her that I was never born to be killed by her—she made no reply—previous to the 24th of July I think she had nearly made up her mind to let me go—I had been discussing it with her frequently—on Monday, 24th July, I did not know of her inten<lb></lb>tion to go to Blackheath to my parents—I had not seen her since Friday, the 21st—on the 24th I was at the Charing Cross Station, about to go to Blackheath, about 9.45 at night—just as I was going on to the platform, to the train, I caught sight of the prisoner—I turned away; she came running after me—I asked what she was doing there—she said she had just come up from Blackheath—I asked what she had been down there for—she said she had been looking after me—I then went to go through the barrier, to go to the train, and she caught hold of me, and said that I must go back with her to Harwood Road—I refused to do so, and said that I would not leave the stations—she made me miss one train; it went off while we were talking—she then wanted me, as I had missed the train, to go back with her—I still refused, and she said she would not leave me unless I did go back with her—I persuaded her to go quietly by herself, and I put her into a cab, and promised that I would go the next night to Harwood Road—she then went away, and I went to Blackheath—next evening (Tuesday) I did go to her place, about 5.45—she was in bed when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187108140042"></xptr>
               <p>I arrived there—I told her that I was very angry with her for having gone down to Blackheath, as whatever our own disagreements might be, she had no business to go down to my parents' house, and I said I was very angry indeed, and I thought it was a great shame of her—I then went up stairs and began packing some things up—Mrs. Sadler then got up and put on a dress and a shawl—I went into the dressing-room to get some things out of a drawer, and she brought up some handker-chiefs and things from down stairs—I went up stairs again and left her in the bed-room—she called out to me "Fred, have you anything to say to me before your brother comes?"—I had told her that my brother was coming in half an hour—I said "Yes, I will come down stairs"—her bedroom was the front room, first floor—I was upon the second floor—I went down to her bedroom, the windows were open, and she went and shut the windows and door after I had gone into the room—I said "There is no occasion to do that, because the people outside can't hear what we have got to say"—I then went and sat down on the side of the bed, and asked her to come and sit by my side—she came and sat down on my right side—I then asked her if she was perfectly satisfied with the reason I had given her for leaving—she said yes, she was—I took her left hand, and said "When we part, let us part friends"—she made no reply at the time, and I felt a sudden blow on my left side—I jumped up and took from her this dagger, it was bent with the force of the blow, I concluded—I then went to the window and threw it open, and sat down on a chair at the side—I then felt something warm running down my leg, and I found that I was bleeding—I took a towel and stopped the bleeding as well as I could; a knock then came to the door, and Mrs. Sadler went down stairs to see what it was—as soon as I felt the blood trickling I said "You have hurt me"—I think I said "You have killed me"—when she caught sight of the blood, she said "What have I done?"—I don't recollect that she said anything else in particular; I was very much confused and agitated with the blow—when she went down stairs, I went down into the drawing-room, so that I could be near the door, and I called out to her not to let the little girl go, to send her for a doctor; I had seen the little girl coming across the road; however, she went away, and Mrs. Sadler came up into the drawing-room—I was then sitting in a chair, with my leg resting on another chair—I was afraid to move—I asked her again to send for a doctor; she did not for some time, and I asked her if she would let me stop there and bleed to death; at last she went to the door, and called a man who was passing, and I told her to tell the man to go for Dr. Rees, I think the name is, who lived opposite the Fulham police-station, and if he was not at home to fetch the first doctor he could; the man went away, and came back again and said Dr. Rees was not at home, but he had gone for another doctor, Mr. Lee, and he would be there in a short time—whilst he was gone for the doctor the prisoner was in and out of the room; she had not put on any more clothes; I told her to go up stairs and dress herself, she would not like to be caught as Mrs. Davey was—(I had seen it stated that Mrs. Davey only had part of her clothing on)—the blood was still flowing, and I had two towels then—she would not go up and dress herself—she came up to me about five minutes afterwards, and snatched away the first towel that I had, which was marked with blood, and took it away somewhere, I don't know where; soon afterwards the doctor came; at first she did not want to let him in—she opened the street door, but would not let him come in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187108140043"></xptr>
               <p>until I called out "Doctor, come in"—when the doctor came in, I asked her to leave the room—she did not—and I then opened my dress, and showed the doctor the wound, and pointed to Mrs. Sadler—she said "Yes, I have done it"—the doctor looked at the wound, and said he would not inlerfera with it, as he could not tell in what direction the cut lay—I asked him if he would wait for a short time until my brother came, as I did not like being left alone—Mrs. Sadler asked the doctor if he thought it was serious—he asked her to get some cold water and a handkerchief, or some linen—at first she refused—she said she was not going to carry things up for me, but after some time she went up stairs and brought up some water and a handkerchief—she then told the doctor, as he seemed to have done all he could he had better go—I asked him to stop till my brother came—he waited some time, I should fancy quite an hour, and as my brother did not come, he said he would go out and see if he was wanted at his own house, and come back again, and I gave him a card to give to a friend of Mrs. Sadler's, to ask her to come there—the doctor then went away, leaving the street door open, so that he might be able to come in again—I remained in the drawing-room on the same seat, I had not moved—Mrs. Sadler remained in the room—she kept saying to herself "I will kill you! I will kill you!" but beyond that she said nothing—after some time my brother came, the doctor returned just before him; the wind had shut the door, and when I heard the knock I went to open it; Mrs. Sadler tried to prevent my open<lb></lb>ing it—I opened the catch, and told whoever was outside to push the door and come in, and the doctor came hi, and soon afterwards my brother came in, and after about an hour's time I was removed—my brother remained in another room with Mrs. Sadler while I went out at the door; she refused to let me go, she said I should not leave the house—the doctor got a cab, and while she was in another room, he put me into the cab, and drove off with me; I then went back again to the house—I was more than half an hour in the cab, waiting at the corner of the street until they came—the reason I gave the prisoner for leaving her was, that my mother wished me to break off the connexion with her, as she had found it out, and that I had promised to do so—only a few seconds elapsed between my saying "Let us part friends" and my receiving the blow—I had not seen the weapon in her hand before I received the blow; it came upon me quite unawares—it was a very violent blow—I lost a good quantity of blood; I should fancy about a pint—I have here the trowsers, drawers, and shirt that I was wearing; the cut went through them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was while the doctor was away that she said "I will kill you! I will kill you!"—I don't think I stated that before the Magis<lb></lb>trate, or that she wanted to prevent the doctor getting into the house, or about the threats she made use of on former occasions: I was not asked—I am sure it was the first day that I met the prisoner that I went to her house; the game night, about two hours afterwards—she did not tell me at that time that her name was Mrs. Sadler—we went together to her house—we walked part of the way and then went and had some wine, and then bad a cab to North End—she told me to direct where to drive to—she did not tell me that I could not come in then, because she was afraid that her husband was at home—it was about 7.30 or 8 o'clock in the evening that I first met her, and it was about 9.15 or 9.30 that I went into the house—at that time I was living at Chelsea, with my parents—it was in the Brompton Road that I met her, about two miles and a half from her house—it was</p>

               <p>not a Hansom cab that we drove in, but a four-wheeler—we went to a public-house; I don't know the name of it, and remained there about five or six minutes—we drove up to North End, and then she asked me to go in and look at her house—I at first refused, but afterwards I went in, she showing me the way—I was in the house about five or ten minutes and then left; I did not go back again that night—I did not say that I had connexion with her at that time—I have not answered upon that point at all—I did not have connexion with her that night in her house—I did somewhere, before going with her into her house—I was with her for an hour and a half or two hours until I went to the house—we did not go to any other house than the public-house—it was three or four weeks afterwards before I visited Ivy Lodge again—I went by previous appointment with her; it was in the evening that I went—I did not sleep there that night—she had not written to me previously to that visit, she made the appointment to meet me at another time—I met her occasionally—she did not tell me it would not be safe to go to the house, for fear her husband should happen to be at home—she told me she was a kept woman—I did not know at the time that her name was Sadler, afterwards I did—I don't think I stated before the Magis<lb></lb>trate that she told me she was a kept woman; the question was not entered into there—I took the house at St. Anne's Villas, and paid the rent of it—at that time my salary was about 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in the same office—it was the prisoner's furniture that was removed to that house—I frequently con<lb></lb>tributed money towards the household expenses, not for her personal main<lb></lb>tenance—I had a banking account—I gave her a cheque once for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was for her to pay her landlord at Ivy Lodge, which she repaid me at once—that was simply lent, but otherwise I did not give her any cheques, I drew the money myself—I took out a policy of insurance on the furniture in my name, because the house was taken in my name, and I handed her the policy—I know now that she is a married woman; I did not know it for some time after I first met her—I knew it before I took the house at Notting Hill, about a month after I first met her, about February—when she moved from Ivy Lodge she asked me to go with her; I at first refused, but afterwards I said I would—she once lent me two rings, one I had for about three months, and the other about a week; I returned them both to her—I raised money upon them—we had several quarrels; they were not always lovers' quarrels, they were frequent quarrels; they were mainly quarrels arising from her use of stimulants—she professed very great devotion and affection towards me—I have heard her say that she would kill herself rather than be separated from me—I don't think I had been talking about leaving her on the occasion when I found her with the table knife; I had frequently said that I would leave her, and she frequently said "You shall never leave me except by force"—I once struck her a blow accidentally, I can explain that; it was not the result of a quarrel—the blow was near the eye, and she had a black eye; I don't know for how long—it happened during a struggle; she got up about 12 o'clock at night and was very violent, and wanted to get out of the bedroom, I locked the door and said she should not go out; she said if I did not let her out she would jump out of the window; I then let her out of the room, and she said she would go out—this was about 3 o'clock in the morning—she went out, and after a time came back, rushed up stairs and threw things at me, and begen hitting me with a boot; I restrained myself for some time, and at last struggled with her to put her into bed, and in the struggle this accidental</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187108140045"></xptr>
               <p>blow in the eye came—I did not hit her directly on the eye; she was fight<lb></lb>ing and struggling, and she is perhaps nearly as strong as I am—she was at that time under the care of Dr. Bannister, for excessive stimulants I believe—in cross-examination before the Magistrate I said I had blacked her eye—I don't think I called it an accident; but I did not go into details, I was simply asked the question and answered it—after one of our quarrels I took up a sword; I did not threaten to do anything with it—she was out<lb></lb>side the room, and I made a cut at the door—it was not with any intention to get the door open, simply that she should hear it; I put it away again instantly—we had had a quarrel, and she was rushing at me, and I went into the next room and struck the door with the sword—I thought it would frighten her if she heard it—I wished her to know that I had a sword in my hand—I did not on another occasion stand over her with a sword in my hand, I held an empty leather scabbard without a sword in it; that was in the night time, or rather in the early morning, while we were in bed—I don't know the exact object of it, except it was to frighten her into quietness—these swords and things were part of a lot that were hanging up on the wall, they were not mine; this took place in Harwood Road—the prisoner was, and I believe is, subject to fits, I don't know of what kind—I fancy of an epileptic tendency, but the doctor was not attending her for that at the time—she was frequently in an excited state from stimulants, wine, spirits, and beer; stimulants generally—on one occasion I charged her with an improper intimacy with a friend of mine—I could not prove anything—the Magistrate asked me whether I was perfectly satisfied that there was no foundation for it, and I said I concluded as I could not prove anything I must be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was the prisoner herself who told me that she was a married woman—I did not know it in any other way, and I did not believe her at first—I have seen her husband since, in the street; she pointed him out to me—I believe he was living with her at the place she first took me to; I found it out afterwards—I never saw him there—she told me at first he was the man that kept her—the first time I saw her she told me she was kept by a man, and afterwards she pointed him out to me as the man that did keep her; she never told me that he was her husband, but the afterwards told me she was married; and he was her husband—she said she had left him three or four times—she told me that before we went to St. Anne's Villas—I never spoke to the person she said was her husband—I believe he had left her and gone abroad, when we moved to St. Anne's Villas; she told me they had had a quarrel, and he had gone away—she first of all asked me to remove with her—I refused, but after a time I con<lb></lb>sented, because I thought it would get her away from bad companions that she had contracted there; I consented after she had told me that her husband had gone abroad and left her—I insured the furniture simply because the house was taken in my name—I gave her the policy, and when she moved to Harwood Road she gave it me back, as it was of no use, it was insured in the other house—it was when she was living at Netting Hill that Dr. Bannister attended her—I thought he was attending her for the excessive use of stimulants—I could distinguish when she was labouring under the influence of stimulants, and when she was in an epileptic fit; there was a great deal of difference in the two—in one she was insensible to a great extent, in the other she was anything but that—when this struggle took place she was, in my opinion, suffering from the excessive use of stimulants.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 27, Moor Park Road, Fulham—on the evening of 25th July I was called to No. 8, Harwood Road—on going to the house there was some difficulty in getting admission, bnt I did get admission—Mrs. Sadler came to the door—I don't think she knew me before—she said "You are the doctor?"—I said "Yes," and then she hesitated, and opened the door, and looked through—Captain Sills called out to me "Come in, doctor," and I had to push the door to get in—the prisoner either followed me, or went with me into the drawing-room, where I found Mr. Sills—he asked me to request Mrs. Sadler to leave the room—I did so once or twice, but she said no, she would remain—he then un<lb></lb>covered the towel from the lower part of his abdomen, and exposed this wound—she said "I have done it; yes, it was me; I have done it"—she repeated it several times—after I had looked at it she several times very anxiously inquired if it was dangerous, and got very excited as I told her I could not give a decisive answer then—I asked her to get some water,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187108140047"></xptr>
               <p>and some linen, or a handkerchief, which after some time she did, but she required a deal of persuasion to get her to do so—the wound was still bleeding slightly; it was on the lower part of the abdomen, on the left side near the groin, and in such a position that the point might have entered the abdominal cavity if it had been directed another way; I am inclined to think it was directed towards the bone, from the mesial line outwardly, towards the left side, but I could not speak with certainty about that; I did not probe it—I saw one towel—he had been losing blood in some quantity, in fact he was suffering rather from it at the time, and from the shock together—he was rather low—he was under my care until the Thursday—I saw him at the Harwood Road on the Tuesday night, and at the hotel to which we took him on the Wednesday and Thursday, and then being satisfied that no important or serious part was injured, I sanctioned his removal to his home—I did not see him afterwards—the prisoner was very much excited when I first saw her, I think partly from stimulants and partly from mental emotion—I had not known her before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Her appearance was consistent with that of a person who was overwhelmed with alarm at what had occurred; afterwards she had two or three hysterical attacks while T was there—they were not real epileptic attacks, they were more like hysterical attacks, such as would affect a woman overwhelmed by her feelings, and by agitation at what had occurred—her refusal to leave the room did not appear to be from anxiety as to Mr. Sills' condition, but more from temper; "No, I shan't go, it is my house;" something like that—I was there altogether two and a half or three hours—I was there an hour the first time, and then left and came back again—it was during the last quarter of an hour that she was in the excitable and hysterical state—when I was examining the wound she kept repeating "Doctor, is it serious, is it serious?"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I connect the hysteria with the use of stimulants, excite<lb></lb>ment generally might bring it on—she was more excited at the end of the two hours and a half than at first, she became insensible at the end of the time—she had what has been described as an epileptic fit, but it was not true epilepsy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the brother of Captain Sills, and live with my parents at Blackheath—I first saw the prisoner on Monday, 24th July, at Blackheath, she came to the house—she said she wished to see my brother, and asked if he had come home—I told her he had not come home yet, and I suggested, as I was going out, I would walk with her down the road—I told her that my brother had a great wish to leave her, and that he had frequently expressed his desire, and she had always placed impediments in the way; I hoped she was now convinced that it really was his wish to leave her, and I trusted that she would allow him to leave her quietly without any <hi rend="italic">exposé</hi>—she made a long rambling statement, about the unhappy way in which she lived; she said she was a very violent temper, but she always felt sorry the next day for what she had done—I told her I was surprised, as they lived on such terms, that she should wish him to continue to live with her—after some considerable conversation, all tending to the same point, she said "Well, he shall leave me quietly; of course I used to love him very much, but that has gone by now"—I said "There is no doubt ne will see you before he leaves you, and I hope you will let him leave you quietly," and we said she would—she then left by the train; I saw her into the train—next evening I had an appointment with my brother to go to her house;</p>

               <p>she had previously given me her address—I went there between 8 and 8.30—when I knocked at the door I heard someone say "He shall not come in;" eventually, after a very short interval, the door was opened, and I went into the drawing-room, and saw my brother sitting on a chair, holding a bandage to a wound which he had in his abdomen, and he said "She has stabbed me, she has done it at last"—she said "Yes, I have, and I will do it again, he shall not leave me, he shall not live if he does"—she made that statement repeatedly, that she would do it again if he attempted to leave her, that he should not leave the house, he should stay there—she said once, but did not repeat it, "I will do it again if it is in ten years' time, he shall not leave me, I will kill him"—she was in another room, the dining-room, with me, when my brother was actually removed from the house, and she said "Oh, what have I done?"—I said "Sit down quietly and I will tell you, you have probably killed my brother," she said "I don't care, I will do it again if he attempts to leave me"—she asked me to forgive her for what she had done—we had more conversation, but it was all a repetition of what I have said—we stayed in there a few minutes, when she suddenly jumped up and said "Oh, I daresay now he has left the drawing-room"—she rushed into the drawing-room, and found that my brother had been taken away—I wanted to leave at once, but she fastened the door, placed her back against it, and said I should not leave without her; she kept me there for more than half an hour—she went for her clothes, dressed herself, and eventually we left together—she insisted upon following me, to find out where he was; I did not know where he was—next morning I gave her into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know that she went to the police-station to give herself up, and remained there two hours, but there was nobody to charge her—she followed me to the police-station, and I wanted to give her in charge, first of all, for molesting me, but I did not—she was in a state of excitement.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She did not then wring her hands, and call him "My poor boy"—that was at the Police Court—hearing her say "My poor boy," I asked her if she had a son—she said she meant poor Fred—she was in a atate of very great excitement at the time I took her into custody—I can't say anything about her being at the Police Court two hours the previous evening, waiting for somebody to give her into custody; I was not there—I heard that she was there.</p>

On July 26th I went with Chinnery to take the prisoner into custody—I went to a bedroom, where I understood the prosecutor had been stabbed, and while searching it, the prisoner came into the room, followed by Chinnery—I was looking uoder the bed; she said "You are looking for the dagger;" she turned to a female who was in the room, and said "You know where it is, you have moved it, show him where it is;" the woman, who was a servant, I believe, went down stairs with me, opened a dresser drawer, and gave me this dagger—I then went up stairs, with the dagger in my hand, into the bedroom—the prisoner said "Yes, that is what I did it with, and I will do it again."</p>

I am a friend of Captain Sills—I have seen the prisoner on several occasions when Captain Sills has been in my company, at his lodging in the Royal Avenue, Chelsea, in the City, when he has been on duty with his regiment, and at his office at Chelsea—I remember on one occasion being at Harwood Road, at the end of March, or beginning of April, before he had been to Scotland—Captain Sills was very anxious to leave the house; she brought down a serpentine dagger and said "I will make you I stop"—I don't recollect anything further that passed except that the dagger was put into a corner of the room, and Captain Sills took it away—I have heard the prisoner say that he should come back and live with her, nothing more.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ, and had the principal management of a place in Seymour-place, Bryanstone-square, Mary-le-bone; he left me on Monday, the 27th of May; three lamps had been taken from a customers - two of which were sold by my consent, and one was taken into the shop or store-room in Seymour-place; I afterwards missed it; Grady, my apprentice, gave me information, and the lamp was found at Drummond's, who is an occasional helper to my men; I cannot identify it, as I had not seen it before - it was bought of Edwards, in Crawford-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ALLEY. Q. You are a watch-case-maker? A. Yes, but I have lately undertaken some gas-works. I am ignorant of the manner in which this business is conducted, and employed the prisoner to conduct it for two or three years. Mr. Edwards, of Crawford-street, wanted some lights, and a job was done for him to the amount of between 8 and 9l.; the prisoner told me he took three lights in part payment for the work, and I was not pleased that he did so without consulting me - he did not say he would take them himself, and make me the same allowance; he did not say he would get the other cleaned and lacquered, and I should sustain no loss.</p>

            . I was in the prosecutor's employ, but not when Cope gave me the lamp to get cleaned and lacquered; he gave it to me from the side of the wall, and told me it was his; I do not know whether he was in the prosecutor's employ at that time - he was about to leave him, but he had the keys.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then this passed honestly and fairly? A. Yes - he did not enjoin me to keep it secret. I believe the prisoner has since set up in business for himself.</p>

            . I was servant to Mr. Edwards. This lamp did belong to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is a kind of jealously between me and Mr. Clarke; I understood the business, and he does not. When I ordered the lamp to be taken I told the young man it belonged to me; I had agreed to fit up three lamps for Mr. Edwards, for 7l., and the old lamps - Mr. Clarke said the lamps were of no use to him; I said I could get 12s. for them at the next door, and he was to make me an allowance for them.</p>

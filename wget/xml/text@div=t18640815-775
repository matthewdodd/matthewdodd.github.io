I am a biscuit-baker, of 11, Philip-street, St. George's-in-the-East—on the night between 4th and 5th July, about ten minutes past 12 o'clock, I went with Mr. Bell to Mr. Jacobs' shop, 2, Cross-street, Back-road—he sells fish, and <hi rend="italic">taters</hi>, and ginger-beer—the prisoner was there with Mr. Toller—I saw a woman there, Mrs. Hamilton—she bought some fish—the prisoner said to her," I will buy you some fish, and put his arms round her neck—she said, "Do not interfere with me; I am a married woman"—she abused him, and used foul-mouthed language to him—she fetched her husband, who said, "Did you insult my wife?"—he said, "No"—Mr. Hamilton told him to stand on one side, and went to Mr. Toller—I then saw a scuffle outside the shop, and the prisoner walked behind Mr. Hamilton, and made a dig at his eye—he struck him in the eye, and I saw</p>

I am a labourer at Back-road, St. George's-in-the<lb></lb>East—on 4th July my wife fetched me out of bed, and I went down, and saw the prosecutor and prisoner together—the prisoner said, "I have not insulted your wife"—I said, "Nobody said you had"—he struck me on the eye, and it bled—I went to Voller, and turned, and saw the prisoner struggling with Price, who fell down in the road, and said, "I am stabbed." <hi rend="smallCaps">ISAAC PAWSEY</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 485). I was on duty in Cross-street between 12 and 1 o'clock, heard a disturbance, went to the spot, and found the prisoner and Hamilton and another man scuffing together—I separated them, turned round, and saw the prisoner strike at Price, who fell to the ground—the prisoner then ran—I ran after him—he got over some palings at the bottom of Johnson-street, and tore half of his coat off by some spikes—I took him behind the palings—he was perfectly sober, and so was Hamilton; but Mrs. Hamilton was not.</p>

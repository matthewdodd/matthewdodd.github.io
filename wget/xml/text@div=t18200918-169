On the 24th of July, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, I was at the Green Man and Still, rather the worse for liquor, but perfectly sensible; the prisoner and another man said they would assist me home; when I got to the door and was feeling for the key, they tried to get my ear-rings off. Instantly I opened the door they both rushed in and sat themselves down in the great arm-chair, and in a few minutes knocked the candle off the table; the other snatched the watch off the shelf, and ran off.

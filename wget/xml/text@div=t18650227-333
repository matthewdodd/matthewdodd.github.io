                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick Shaw, of the Golden Anchor, Saffron-hill—I recollect the evening of 26th December last, and the fatal occurrence of that evening—I recollect my husband being struck that evening—it was, I should think, as near as I can recollect, between 6 and 7 o'clock—he was struck by Gregorio, the prisoner—Michael Harrington wag not near at the time my husband was struck; I saw him it may be about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after—I saw Harrington and Gregorio to<lb></lb>gether, by the door leading from the bar into the taproom—Harrington was in the act of going into the taproom, and when he got to the taproom-door, Gregorio took hold of him, and he raised his hand as if to strike him—he was in the act of striking him, and by some means or other Harrington was got away from him, and he (Harrington) went into the bagatelle-room—I saw no more of Gregorio; I believe he was in the taproom still; I saw no more then—I saw nothing of the stabbing that evening; I heard of it—as far as I know three persons complained of being stabbed; I have heard of no more; Harrington, Rebbeck, and Bannister—I saw Harrington carried through the bar—I can't exactly tell how soon after that I saw Gregorio again; it may have been a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, I cannot tell—he came to the bar, and asked for his hat; his brother was with him; I knew the brother by the name of John—I saw blood on John's neck at that time—he was also without a cap—upon the prisoner asking for his hat, I opened the bagatelle-room-door, and asked if there were any hats there; Gregorio told me his cap was in the bagatelle-room—some one gave me two hats from the room, and I threw them over the bar to Gregorio and his brother—they took them, and went away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At that time, was the prisoner in the room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not see him there;. I did not see him at all—I have known Polioni for the last four or five years, if not longer—he ran at me twice;. he stabbed me first, and then he ran again, but he missed me the second time—I afterwards saw him <hi rend="italic">a-top</hi> of Harrington—I saw Harrington's body on the floor and Seraphim <hi rend="italic">a-top</hi> of Harrington—I am quite sure that at the time Polioni entered the room there were no other Italians there;. I will swear that there was not.</p>

SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been pot-boy at this house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have lived there only about eighteen months;. but I was born in the house;. my father kept it for twenty-two years—I don't know what the hole in the bagatelle-room had been used for, but I suppose it was to hand dinners up—it led out to the top of the kitchen-stairs, and then down into the kitchen—you can't get out from the kitchen unless you get through a piece of paneling into the next house—I handed up the sticks through this hole, because we heard there was going to be a row with the Italians with their knives—I told the English of it—I did not arm them—I said there was going to be a row, and they said, what were they to do if the Italians came in with their knives—when they asked me for the sticks, I gave them to them—there was no poker—there were blind-rollers, a copper-stick, and a broom-handle;. one broom-handle—there was but one copper-stick—that is what they stir up the copper with on washing-days—it is a thing about two feet long—I don't know the thickness, I never measured it;. it might be about the same thickness as the broom-handle—it did not occur to me that it would have been better to have gone for the police;. by that time there might have been more happen—there is dancing going on in the taproom—that is where they dance, girls and men—this happened on Boxing-night—there had been a good many persons there all that evening;. the Italians in one room and the English in the other, playing bagatelle—I don't know who it was struck Mrs. King, I daren't say—I can't say whether it was the prisoner;. I can't say whether it was or not—I don't know whether it was Polioni—I am not sure who it was—this is my deposition (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I will read you what you said there: "I saw one of the party knock Mrs. King down; it was not Seraphini that did that?' <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> So I say now, as I said before, I don't believe it was Seraphini;. I say so now—I am not sure whether it was or not—I did at first say it was not, when I was brought out of the hospital;. I believe I did say so;. I don't know—they told me so—I don't know whether it was so or not—when I was up here before Mr. Ribton said I did—he asked me the same question—I say now, I don't know whether it was Seraphini or not;. I don't know who it was—at the time I was stabbed I was at the door leading to the taproom, not in the passage, in the bagatelle-room—I came in with the pipe—it was not before Polioni had entered the room—he was in the passage, at the door—I fainted afterwards—I was on the top of Seraphini while he was a-top of Harrington—I last my senses—I was before the Magistrate, and have been bound over to come here—I have not seen the constables lately;. not any of them that I am aware of—I have seen them up here this week.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William King—I now reside at Hackney-wick—at the time of this occurrence I live in Leather lane—on the night of 26th December, I was with my husband at the Golden Anchor public-house—I was in the bagatelle-room, and my husband with me—Michael Harrington was there—before the door was opened there was not Italians in the room—I got up for the purpose of leaving the room; that was from about 6 to half-past—I opened the bagatelle-room door to go out, and as soon as I opened the door I was knocked down—it was Seraphini that knocked me down—I had not known him previously—I saw him here at his trial—he had not entered the room when he knocked me down—I do not know the prisoner's brother (<hi rend="italic">looking at him</hi>)—that was not the man that came in first; that was not the man that knocked down—Seraphini was the man that knocked me down when I opened the door—I did not see that man there—I did not see the prisoner there—I was knocked down by Seraphini's fist, and stunned—I saw nothing at all after that.</p>

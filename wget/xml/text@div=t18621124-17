                  </hi>. I was in Hyde-park on 5th October, between half-past 4 and 5 o'clock—there was a great crowd near the mound—I had been on the mound about an hour before, but I was at the bottom of it when this happened—there were shouts of "Down with Garibaldi, and up with the Pope," and others said, "Down with the Pope, and up with Garibaldi"—I found myself stabbed in my hip, and then saw the prisoner for the first time standing by my side, in a stooping position with a knife in his hand, attempting to stab another man, but whether he stabbed him or not, I do not know—I called out, "Knife, I am stabbed," and was carried to the hospital—I did not see the prisoner taken, but am sure he is the man—I saw him on the Monday week afterwards, at Marlborough-street police-court, and recognised him immediately—I was eleven days in the hospital, and am an out-patient still—the wound is not well yet.</p>

               <p>but not exactly the same—the mound was alternately held by one party and retaken by the other—I was for my own religion, I was for the Pope—I shouted pretty lustily, "Up with the Pope, and down with Garibaldi," but not at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Hyde-park on 5th October, and saw Murphy there, and the prisoner, who made a start into the crowd with a knife in his hand, six or seven inches long, like a shoemaker's knife—he was in a stooping position, and made a run like this—somebody called out "Knife," and then I saw him make a lunge, and heard somebody call out, "Oh, my God, I am stabbed!"—I then looked to my left, and saw him stooping down with the knife, with the point upwards—he was working his elbows to make room before he made the run—I received an injury on the outside of my left thigh, and kept my hand on the prisoner's shoulder till I gave him in charge—I am positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you an adherent of the Pope? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, for neither; and if Mr. Garibaldi ever comes to this country I will not go to see him—there was not a great deal of noise and fighting and confusion at that time; but a few minutes before there was a cry of "Up with Garibaldi, and down with the Pope"—it was all quiet at the time of the cry of knife, knife—the crowd was not very dense where the prosecutor was—there might have been three or four people in front of the mound, which was then in the possession of the Garibaldians, I suppose, because there were some soldiers upon it—this was not exactly at the foot of the mound, but between the middle and the near end of the Wellington statue—I cannot say whether I was between the contending parties—I was standing with both hands in my pockets—I was present when the prisoner was taken, and gave him in custody myself—I did not observe that he was bleeding.</p>

On 5th October I was in Hyde-park about 5 o'clock, and heard a cry of "Mind the knife"—I ran to the spot, and heard Wardle say, "Take this man in custody; I am stabbed," pointing to the prisoner, who was three or four feet from him—I took him—I did not see Murphy till next day—the prisoner was trying to force his way through the people—I caught hold of him from behind with both arms—he had a very slight cut on his left hand, but it was bleeding very much—he said that he did it in trying to take a knife away from a countryman—I took him to the station, and Murphy identified him a week afterwards—the broken knife was given to me next morning by a brother officer, and this other (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a similar knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you there during the hour previous? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; about a dozen yards from the spot whence the cry of knife proceeded—the pressure of the crowd was very great at the time I rushed up; it was not so noisy as it had been, but there was still great confusion—I did not see the knife in his hand—he said that he got the cut in taking a knife, which a countryman had in his hand, to prevent his using it.</p>

                  </hi>. On 5th October I was in Hyde-park; and after 4 o'clock, but rather before 5, I was on the mound among the fighting—I jumped off near to this knife, which I picked up, and showed to a man, who took it from me, but I would not lose sight of it, and saw him give it to a policeman—I believe this to be the handle of it—it was perfect then, and I have every reason to believe it was slightly smeared with blood—I returned to the mound, and in a few minutes I heard of persons being wounded.</p>

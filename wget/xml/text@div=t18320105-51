            . I live with my father and mother in Holywell-lane - my father is an umbrella-stick maker. I saw the two prisoners in Shoreditch on the 13th of December - there was a gentleman's chaise outside Mr. Rotherham's door; Keen went over from the cook's-shop, and said, "There is a chance - there is a coat and a cloak in the chaise;" he said, "There are two cloaks and an umbrella in the chaise;" Bowman said, "It is all right;" Keen then went and took the things; Bowman received them from him, and they both ran away - no one had charge of the horse at that time: I ran and told the gentleman - he told me to stand at the head of the horse; I had not seen the prisoners before, but I saw them the next day in Shoreditch - I am certain they took the things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What did Keen say? A. He said, "There are two cloaks and an umbrella in the chaise;" I said he said a coat and a cloak - it was a quarter-past five o'clock; it was light: he said "A coat, a cloak, and an umbrella" - I am nine years old; it was not light; it is about a week and a month ago - I was standing at the cook's-shop; I had seen Keen a year ago up in Hoxton - I had not spoken to him.</p>

            . I am eleven years old - I live at the Plough. I was at my grandfather's, in Three Cups-alley, opposite where the chaise was; I saw two boys watching the chaise - I went over, and there was a plaid cloak in it: I went again, and it was gone - the boys then ran across: I ran, and cried Stop thief! after one, and Bowman struck me on the back of my neck; I am sure of him, but I am not certain of the person of Keen - they ran towards Bishopsgate: there was a gas light near the shop, but it was not light where the gig stood - the day was cloudy; it was dusk.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then it was not light where the gig was? A. No, rather darkish; it was about half-past five o'clock on Tuesday, the 13th of December.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Lack, a poulterer, in Shoreditch. On the 13th of December I was near Three Cups-alley - I saw Keen and another person with him, lurking about the chaise, and I told my cousin to go and see if there was any thing in the chaise; he said he saw a plaid cloak - I then saw Keen go and stand by the lamp-post - the other one went and stood behind the chaise; he then came to me, went back, and stood behind the chaise - he looked about him, took the article, and ran across the road; I looked after him - Keen came up, and heard what we had to say for about five minutes; I then lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then they did not run off together? A. No - I did not see either of them give a blow on the neck to any body; I am quite sure it was not Keen who took the things; there is not a word of truth in that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean that West is mistaken as to the one who took the things from the chaise? A. Yes; I only saw the plaid cloak taken - that was the last thing taken.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to THOMAS WEST. Q. I think you said you saw Keen go to the chaise, and take some things out? A. Yes, coats; I saw him take something, and I knew it was coats, after he took them - they both ran away as fast as they could; Keen did not stand for five minutes after the things were taken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see a person go to the gig once or twice? A. I only saw him once; I was about thirty yards off.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. After the articles were taken did the two persons run away? A. No - I am certain that it was not while one stood at the lamp that the other took the things; I do not know where the other was while one stood at the lamp; yes, he was at the chaise - I saw the things taken from the chaise while one stood at the lamp; I did not see them run away - I went to work directly; the man at the lamp-post ran away after the things were taken - it was rather dark at the chaise.</p>

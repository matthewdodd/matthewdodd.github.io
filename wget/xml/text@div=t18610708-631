I am the wife of John Mead, eating-house keeper, 28, Russell-street, Rotherhithe—on Monday, 17th June, the prisoner came here a little after 9 o'clock in the evening and asked for half a pound of roast pork—I cut it and weighed it on the scales—he threw down a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—I took it between my fingers, and said, "What a strange looking 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece"—he said, I am sure it is a good one; if you don't like it give</p>

                  </hi>. I keep an eating-house at 28, Russell-street, Rotherhithe—on Monday, 17th June, the prisoner came—I heard him ask for some roast pork, and saw my wife cutting it—I then went outside and talked to the neighbours—in about a minute or so my wife spoke to me and I saw the prisoner come out of my door and run up the street—my wife gave me the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece and I ran after the prisoner and captured him—I saw him before t hat speak to another man, an accomplice of his—I passed them and then returned—they walked together about twenty or thirty yards—the prisoner went across on one side of the road and the other man on the other—I followed the other; I knew he had something to do with the prisoner, and as soon as the other one saw the policeman, he ran past me as hard as he could, and then he called out to the prisoner, but I do not know what it was; and then he ran away—the prisoner walked along the road and I kept my eye on him—I then took him and gave him into custody when the constable came—he was brought back to my house and charged with uttering a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—he said he had never been at my house from the time he had knocked off work—I gave the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece to the constable.</p>

I believe, fell from the prisoner to the floor, but I did not see it—I afterwards stooped down to pick up my hat which somebody knocked off, and the prisoner struck me three times on the head with a pint pewter pot, and stabbed me in the head with a knife which be took out of his pocket—he had some drink in him, but was not drunk.</p>

I am a surgeon of the East-india-road—I found Dixon suffering from an incised wound on the head, down to the bone—an artery was divided, and he had lost a good deal of blood—a knife like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) would produce the wound—I hardly think it could have been done with a pint pot, it was more incised than lacerated; but if the edge of the pot was very sharp it might have done it—it was not dangerous to life—he is quite well now.</p>

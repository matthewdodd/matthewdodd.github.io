                  </hi>. I live at 23, Severn-street, St. George's-road, and am fore-man to Thomas Fairchild, of Christian-street—on 3d May, I was going across Tower-hill, about 4 in the afternoon, and saw the prisoner there—he had a pair-horse van, loaded with casks of butter—he was lying down in the front of the van with a cask of butter by his side—the head of the cask was out, and he was digging out the butter with a piece of stick—another man was standing behind the van, and directly he saw me he ran up to the prisoner—he got up on the wheel and hit the prisoner, who said something I could not hear—the other man then get down and walked away—I watched the prisoner—he got out of the van, and drove the horses across Tower-hill to George-street—he stopped there, a constable came up and I told him what I had seen, and I went and fetched the prisoner's master—he came, and I told him I had seen the prisoner taking some butter out of a cask, and the prisoner said he had not been doing it—I turned the cask over to the tail part of the van, and showed it to the prisoner, and he said it was so when he received it—I found the butter, which had been taken out of the cask, in the nose-bag under the van, wrapped up in a piece of linen rag—I gave him into custody—Mr. Priestley said he should leave it entirely to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is Mr. Priestley here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He is not—I was formerly in the police, and left it six years ago—I left because I was convicted at this Court for an assault—I was discharged because of that conviction—I was in the force about two years—I could not find the stick with which the butter was taken out—a portion of the head of the cask was out—I know a man of the name of Webb—he said the casks were properly coopered up—I say one had been removed—I have been twice to Mr. Priestley to come here, but he could not leave his business—he did not say he did not want to prosecute—I do not know that the prisoner has been five or six years in his service, but I believe he has not—my duty is to go about looking after our own men—we have some forty or fifty—I am an "amateur detective," if you like to put it as such—men are not in the habit of waiting where I saw the prisoner's van—the prisoner loaded some hops after that—there were not a great number of other waggons there.</p>

Joseph Barber and Co., of Lower Thames-street—Mr. Priestley is our head carman—he does most of the carrying work—on the afternoon of the 3d May, I delivered fifty-three casks of butter to the prisoner as carman—when they left the warehouse they were in good condi<lb></lb>tion, and all sound—the heads were all nailed down, and all well coopered.</p>

On the 14th of July I sent him with a van to fetch some rags, four bags, and one small one, that is, four bags and three quarters, from a person named Slater—he was to take them to a person named Dillamore, and leave them in exchange for linen ones, but as Dillamore had sold his linen ones, he could not take what I sent, and the pri<lb></lb>soner ought to have brought home the four and three quarters, but he only brought four—he had no business to sell any to Dillamore.</p>

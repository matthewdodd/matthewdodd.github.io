I am the wife of John Townley, a blacksmith at Woolwich—I have a little girl eighteen months old—on 13th April, about half-past 12 o'clock in the day, she was standing at my front door—she had a coral necklace on—I saw Isabella Stuart there—I had not known her before—she spoke to my child, and remained there about a quarter of an hour—she took her up in her arms, and then put her down—I heard the child cry, and went, and missed the necklace off her neck—I then went after the prisoner, but did not see her—she was afterwards taken to the police station—she then said she lived in St. Mary's-street—first she said No. 25, and afterwards No. 27—I went there, but found nobody belonging to her.</p>

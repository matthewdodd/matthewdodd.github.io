On the 2d of August, I sent eighteen sheep and a lamb to my sheep-house, in Neal's-yard, Seven Dials; next morning I missed sixteen sheep, and a lamb. I went that day to a cottage near the Old Cricket-ground, Regency Park, and found six of them just skinned; the skins laid under them. I found the other ten and the lamb in a field about two hundred yards off; I knew them all by the marks on the skins. As we were bringing the sheep away, we met the prisoner coming towards the cottage, about two or three hundred yards from the cottage. A boy, who we had in the cart pointed to him; he immediately turned, and ran off. Plank pursued, and took him.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 3d of August, about two o'clock, I went and found six sheep in a cottage, which was locked; I forced the door open. I found ten sheep and a lamb near the house, in a field; the prisoner was pointed out to me about thirty yards from the cottage; he turned round, and ran away. I followed, and saw him running; he was at least one hundred yards from me when I first saw him. The boy in the cart said something, but the prisoner could not hear it; he was stopped about a mile off. I found a box in the cottage with his name on it - it was not in the same room as the sheep.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. The cottage was divided into three apartments - A. Yes; they communicated with each other.</p>

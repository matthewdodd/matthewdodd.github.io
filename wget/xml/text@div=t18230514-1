            . On the 14th of February, I was servant to the prosecutrixs. I was not the last person up that night, and did not fasten up the house - I got up about five o'clock next morning, and found it all quite safe. I missed two bottles of wine from the shop, and 2 lbs. of candles from the cellar; they were safe the night before. I do not know how the persons got in. There is an iron grating before the cellar, if that was lifted up persons could get in.</p>

            . I lived with Mr. Bone at Tottenham; but am now out of place. I know the prisoners. On the night of the 14th of February, I saw them coming from Mrs. Haggars's, about midnight - it was either on a Thursday or a Friday night, I cannot say which: I saw them come out of the cellar grating; they had something with them. I said nothing to them - I saw them again a few days after, and told them I saw them coming from Mrs. Haggars - they bid me hold my tongue, and say nothing about it; this is all that passed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. How do you get your living at this time. - A. I am supported by my mother. I told nobody what I had seen. I was coming from London at the time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you say nothing more to them - A. Nothing more. I am certain I said nothing more to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you afterwards at Mrs. Haggars yourself - A. Yes; I went there with two others, and went again on the 2d of March, between three and four o'clock in the morning - we got in at the grating - we were disturbed, and did not stay. I first told of this when I was apprehended, which was about a fortnight after the 2d of March. I have known the prisoners seven or eight years.</p>

             re-examined. I saw the grating the last thing over night; it was safe, and so it was when I got up in the morning. A person could get in there. I bolted the street door before I went to bed.</p>

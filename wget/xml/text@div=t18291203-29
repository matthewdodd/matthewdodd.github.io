               <p>MR. DAVID SOLOMONS. I live in York-buildings, Regent's-park. On the 19th of November my footman requesting a morning's holyday, I desired the coachman to get a man togo with the carriage into the City; he got the prisoner, and he went with the carriage into the city - Mrs. Solomons went into the City, and made a purchase at some shop in going along; I did not go with the carriage, and Mrs. Solomons is not here, but when she returned I heard the purse had been lost, and there was reason to suspect the prisoner - I asked him about it; he denied it: I urged him to give it up, and save further trouble - he still denied it - I sent for a Police-constable, and it was found on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He asked if I had the purse, and said if I would confess he would forgive me - I said I would speak to him in another room; he said, "I will speak to you here." Witness. There was nothing passed like what he has stated; I merely asked if he had the purse - he denied having it.</p>
               <p>JOHN MARTIN. I am a Police-constable. I was on duty, and was called in; the prosecutor accused the prisoner of stealing the purse - he denied it several times to him, and to me; I was going to search him, and he said to the prosecutor, "If you will step into the parlour I will speak to you;" I said he should not go out of my sight - he then said, "Have mercy - I have the purse," and gave it up - he had it in his boot; the money was out of the purse; he gave that into my hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been out of employ eight months, and have been very much embarrassed - I picked up the purse on the ground, and did not know it belonged to Mrs. Solomons; when I had denied it once, I certainly did deny it till Mr. Solomons said he would forgive me.</p>

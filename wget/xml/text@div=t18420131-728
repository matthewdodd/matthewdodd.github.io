                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Woodstock-street. On the 24th of January I went into a public-house in Holborn, with my wife and uncle, between six and seven o'clock—I found the prisoner near the bar—she got into conversation with my wife—I left the public-house, and my wife got into a wagon to go into the country—I and my uncle stood talking together at the door of the public-house—the prisoner stood by us, but not in conversation—we all three walked up Hoi born together, and my uncle left me—the prisoner continued walking with me, and then she fell down and began crying—I did not offer to help her up, and some people round said I ought to be ashamed of myself—I then gave her my hand, and lifted her up—she said she knew her thigh was bleeding, and I ought to take her to a doctor—I said I bad no doctor's money—she then asked me to take her to a public-house, and she would treat me to a pint of half-and-half, and she could examine her thigh there—we went into the parlour of a public-house—there were three children and a servant there,—she called for half-and-half—the servant brought it—she told the chil<lb></lb>dren and servant to go out of the room—I stood by the fire—in about three minutes she pushed me into a chair, and put her hand into my side<lb></lb>pocket—she let go of the chair, and took her hand out—I got up, and said, "By G—you have robbed me, and I will fetch a policeman"—she said, "You may fetch a policeman, and be d—d"—I went out of the door—a boy stood there—I said I would give him a penny to fetch a con<lb></lb>stable—I went into the room again—she held the money up in her hand, and said, "Look here"—she put it into her mouth—I put my arm round her neck, rammed my hand to her throat, and two shillings came out of her mouth, and fell into the ashes—the policeman came in, put his arm round her neck, and tried to choke up the other money, but it did not come</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 145.) I was sent for to the Bell public-house, in Newton-street, and found the prisoner in the parlour, and the prosecutor holding her by the back of her throat—I saw two shillings fall from her mouth—I took them up—she appeared to be choking—I felt her throat, and felt something very hard in her throat—she begged me to let her sit down a few minutes—she appeared quite exhausted—I took her to the station, and on the way she began laughing, and said she had robbed him because he wanted to take liberties with her, and would not pay.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 22, Sloane-terrace, Chelsea. On 18th Oct., about 7 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came for a quartern loaf, and some other things, and she paid for two loaves she had had before—she gave me a florin and one shilling; I gave her 10 1/2 two change—I put the florin and the shilling in the till—there was other silver there, but no other florin—when she was gone, I examined the florin, and found it was bad—I marked it and gave it to the constable the same evening—on 22nd Oct., I looked in the copper part of the till, and found a bad shilling, it was the only shilling there—I took it out and put it under the thermometer in the parlour, where there was no other shilling—I marked it and put the date on it—I kept it till 3rd Nov., when I gave it to the officer—on Tuesday, 28th Oct., between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came for a quartern loaf; it came to 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I served her, and she gave me a shilling; I gave her change, and she left—the moment she left I found the shilling was bad, I called her back, and said, "Mrs. Matthews, this is a bad shilling, you must give me a good one—she said, "I wonder where I got it from"—she gave me a good shilling, and I let her go—I gave the bad shilling to the officer on the same evening.</p>

I received from him this shilling, and this other shilling I received from him on 3rd Nov.—I was in the shop on the 18th, when the prisoner tendered the florin, and it was in consequence of my cautioning Mr. Cuthbertson that he examined it, and I received it then—the shilling which he received on the 22nd he retained, because his wife was in a delicate state of health, and he thought she might not be examined.</p>

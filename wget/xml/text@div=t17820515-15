               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the woman? - I am. We had a pint of wine at the Hotel; when we had drank a glass of wine apiece, she said she had a friend below, and asked if it would be agreeable to me to let her come up; I said, With all my heart. We were joking together, till at last I was to be engaged with the woman that came up. When I came to be engaged with the other woman, the prisoner said my watch would hurt the other woman; she took the watch out of my pocket, with my consent, and put it behind the sofa till I got up; when I came to get up from the sofa, my watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Was you in liquor? - Rather, or I should not have been guilty of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, this does not in point of law amount to felony; he had intrusted his watch to her.</p>

                  </hi>. On the night of 7th June I was waiting at the corner of Princes Street, opposite the Mansion House, with my wife to put her into the omnibus—I felt the prisoner in front of me and I felt his hand at my pocket, and I caught hold of him directly—I said "I have lost my watch, you have got it"—he said "I have not got your watch, what do I want with your watch 1" and he was going away—I said "No you don't go away," and stopped him, and kept hold of him till we got to the first house in Princes Street by the private door of the Union Bank—I only had one hand, as I had an umbrella in the other—he got away—I called "Stop thief" directly—his hat fell off as he ran away—I picked up his hat and found he was stopped a few doors further up, and in the custody of a private clothes policeman without his hat—I said "That is the man," and I was going to lay hold of him again—he said "It is quite right, sir, I am an officer"—I handed his hat to the policeman—I have not the least doubt about the prisoner—I have not recovered my watch.</p>

On the night of the 7th June, about 11.30, I was in Princes Street in plain clothes—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I looked round and saw the prisoner running without his hat, and several people following him crying "Stop thief!"—I caught hold of him and asked him why he was running, what was the matter—he said "A man has stolen my watch"—I said that can't be, for it is safe in your pocket"—he struggled violently to get away—I told him I was a police officer, and I should not allow him to go till I was satisfied—he was wearing a watch—I took it from him when I searched him afterwards—the prosecutor came up with the prisoner's hat in his hand, and said "That is the man who has stolen my watch"—he took his hat and wore it to the station.</p>

I told him not to let any thing go off the premises on any account, as I would prosecute the first person I found taking any thing, having been a loser before. I had occasion to take the prisoner before a Justice, for leaving his work (I think on the 1st of September) and after that some discoveries were made. I had had no suspicion of him before. I had had things hinted to me, but I did not know the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had not the young man been some time in your employ? A. Yes - he employed a person under him, whom he turned away, but I did not oblige him to do so; I believe he did so by keeping part of his money back - he told me he turned him away because he was not able to earn the money he charged me for him. I had not requested two men to take the prisoner's place, and said I would turn him away before I had him before a Magistrate - I there charged him with leaving his work; the case was heard by the Magistrate - I believe it was not dismissed. Mr. Twyford asked me, when I went again, whether I would go into the higher charge. I swear I never heard the Magistrate say "I don't like your turning round in this manner, and preferring another charge when you find the first won't do." I saw Mr. Harmer there. The prisoner went to Clerkenwell for some days, and was then admitted to bail. When I went to make the first charge against him I did not know of this. I think he left my service on the 29th of August, and I think I made the charge on the 2d of September, but I cannot be certain, unless I had my book here. John Provan had left my service about three weeks before Russell did. I did not state at the office that Provan had told me Russell had robbed me - I said he had hinted that some one was robbing me, and I thought it was Russell.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you employ Provan, or did Russell? A. He did; I had nothing to do with him at all, but to pay him his bills. I had no distinct information as to carry conviction home to the prisoner, before I took him to the Magistrate. I gave directions to have my property better watched, and it was after that I received this information. Kearney is the person I set to watch.</p>

            . I was employed at Mr. Trott's building by the prisoner, to do task work for him, and when my master and he fell out, master set me to work after he left him. I saw the prisoner and the apprentice take away fifteen or sixteen of the mitre strings of the stair-case, at breakfast time, one day in August last, but I cannot recollect when. I sat on the bench, eating my breakfast at the time, but I did not say any thing, as I thought they were fire wood. On the next day, which was a Wednesday, Mr. Trott sent me to work in Aldermanbury. I did not tell what I saw till the prisoner was in custody.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You are a carpenter - did you ever know an instance in which the carpenter was prevented from taking such pieces away as chips? A. No - I have done it myself hundreds of times, and never was denied. I come here to tell the truth.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you ever do so when you had received an express order not to do it? A. No, of course I did not.</p>

To take care of every thing, and work up all the stuff, and not let a chip be taken away, as I would prosecute any one who did. I told him I meant that nothing should be taken away, and I would prosecute him as well as another who took it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to JOSEPH CLIMPSON. Q. Were these little bits of any use but as fire-wood? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were they not of use to Mr. Trott? A. Yes, as fire-wood. I would not give a halfpenny for three of them. I never saw the prisoner do it but once; there was no person present but him and me.</p>

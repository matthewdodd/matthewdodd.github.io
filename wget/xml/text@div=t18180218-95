On the 28th of January, I went into the City; I left home about half-past three o'clock, and returned at half-past ten o'clock at night. My sister asked me about my trunk; I said I had not taken it - I went up to my bedroom closet and missed it-it was an hair trunk, about three-fourths of a yard long. I have recovered the trunk, and all the property-the trunk contained my cash-box, which contained the monies stated in the indictment; the whole amount is 1100l. I received information that the prisoner had been seen at, No. 12, Eaden-street, Hampstead-road The next morning I applied at Marlborough-street, got a search-warrant, and went there, with Foy. The outer door was open; I tried the latch of the left-hand parlour door, on the ground floor, and found it open. The first thing I saw, was the hair trunk under the bed; I told Foy, it was mine - I unlocked it, and found every thing safe, as it was when I left it in my room. Foy lifted up the bed, and found the prisoner concealed under it, close to the wall - I took her to Marlborough-street.</p>

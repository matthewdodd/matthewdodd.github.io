                  </hi>. I live in Northampton-street, Clerkenwell—the prisoner is my husband—on Saturday, 14th March, he came home quite tipsy—we had words about it, and I smacked his face and pulled his hair—he was eating his supper—he had a knife and fork in his hand—he kept asking me to desist pulling his hair, but I would not; the more he asked me the more I did it—I can solemnly swear that what happened was an accident—the knife went through my arm in the struggle between us—we were in bed—he wanted to tie up the wound, but I was in that boiling temper I would not let him—I called up the landlady.</p>

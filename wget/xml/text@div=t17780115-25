On Friday the 30th or 31st of October, I cannot say which, the prisoner came in with two other men, and asked me what cordials we sold; I repeated them, and they chose shrub; while I was serving them I observed a little man, whom I did not see before, stand up in the corner; the prisoner asked me if I would change a guinea; I told him we never changed of a Friday, because we wanted silver to serve shops on Saturday; then he said to a man that was with him that he could not pay him if I could not give him change; and asked him how much money it was, the man said 8 s. I had eleven guineas and a good deal of silver in a bag; I thought I would give him change for the sake of the poor man's being paid; I took the money out of the bag; he came in and said, d - n it and there is a 77 guinea and took up a handful and rubbed his hand with the money in it; he laid that down, and took up another handful, and said here is one; they went away; they had not been gone a minute before I missed three guineas; this was between twelve and one at noon; nobody had access to the drawer but myself. I saw no more of the prisoner till my husband took him up about two months after.</p>

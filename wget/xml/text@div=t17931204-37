               <p>Q. Was you robbed by one or more persons? - There were four of five; I lost a metal gold watch, a stop watch with three gold seals.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing besides the watch? - There was a small piece of a chain.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it of the same metal? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this about, how much time did it take up? - Two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen before any of those persons that robbed you? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say either of the prisoners at the bar were concerned in this business? - I never did. When the watch was stopped at the pawnbroker's they sent to me, I am sure I don't know his name, he is a witness; I saw the watch, it was my property.</p>
               <p>Mr. knapp. This robbery was committed to long ago as the latter end of February, or beginning of March, which do you think it was most certain? - I think it was the latter end of February, because the hand-bills expressed it.</p>
               <p>Q. The persons who committed this robbery on you in the piazzas committed it so late at night or so early in the morning? - It was between twelve and one in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost your watch at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was so long distance as from March to November before you found it again? it might have got into a variety of hands since? - I cannot say, I dare say it might.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, I was sent for to take the prisoners into custody, on the 23d of November; I took them into custody on the charge of Simpson, the pawnbroker, of having stole this watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Who delivered that watch to you? - Simpson, the pawnbroker, his master lives in Walker's-court, Soho, I have had it in my custody ever since, in the same condition as when I receive it, with the mark of Simpson on it; this hand bill was put into my hand at the same time, which is a description of the watch, it bears date in February.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the watch, when compared with that hand bill, correspond to the description? - Exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any chain to it? - No, only this ribbon.</p>
               <p>Belchamber. It is my watch, I know it by the stud, stop, and number; I am sure it is the watch that was taken from me at the time I have been speaking of.</p>

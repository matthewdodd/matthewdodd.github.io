               <p>What is he? - He has sometimes commissions for Dutch goods, which is a good reputable way of life, in a middling way.</p>

               <p>What made you think he meant to steal this? - Because he did not stay to drink.</p>

               <p>When did you see him afterwards? - On the Friday, this was on the Wednesday.</p>

               <p>Why he did not go away from his house or from his business, do you think he meant to steal it? - It did not look well in him to do it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowles, Prisoner's Counsel. Now, Mr. Harris, did not you give the man this piece of gold, and ask him whether he would not buy it of you? - I laid it on the counter before him, and asked him the value of it.</p>

               <p>Do not you know he could have disposed of it for you? - No doubt of it.</p>

               <p>How long have you known him? - Seven years.</p>

               <p>Have not you known him fourteen years? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Recollect yourself, did not you meet him the next day and ask him for this? - No, it was done on the Wednesday, and I took him on the Friday.</p>

               <p>Will you swear it was not full six days before you took him up? - I took him on the Friday after.</p>

               <p>Will you swear it was not six days after? Good God! Sir, I have sworn it was but two days.</p>

               <p>Have not you said, before more people than one, that if he would give you the value of this piece of gold coin, you would not find the bill against him? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>

               <p>In the presence of your own wife? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Had not you an information against you two or three years ago, for smuggling? - Yes, I was not in trade, I was then sick in bed.</p>

               <p>Have not you said to Mrs. Harris, that you believed Jonas was the man that gave the information, and you would punish him for it? - I have not.</p>

               <p>Do you know the prisoner's sister, Mrs. Barlin, did you never say before her, that if the prisoner would pay you the money, you would not find the bill against him? - I never said so, to her, but I wished I had had nothing to do with the prosecution.</p>

               <p>Did you never tell her that if he had not given that information, you would not have set on foot this prosecution? - No.</p>

               <p>Did you never tell this gentleman here, or any other person, that if he would execute a mutual release, that there should be no prosecution against you for smuggling, you would not carry on this prosecution? - O dear, Sir, there was a proposal made, but I said I would go to the Court.</p>

               <p>Answer my question directly? - I never said such a thing in my life.</p>

               <p>I am servant to the prosecutor, I served the prisoner with an ounce of tea, and half a pound of sugar.</p>

               <p>Did you see him take this piece of gold? - I saw my master take silver out of his pocket, and this piece of gold in his hand; and the prisoner took it up in my master's presence, and he looked upon it in his hand, and then he asked my master to give him something to drink, and while my master went to get some rum, he went out.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowles. Do you know of the prisoner's frequenting your shop for a long time? - No, I never saw the man in my life.</p>

               <p>- BARLIN sworn.</p>

               <p>My husband is a tobacconist, I called on the prosecutor about this business two or three days after Lazarus Jonas was taken up, to know the reason; he then told me that he came into his shop for some tea and sugar, and he shewed him a piece of gold, and he asked him what it was, and he asked him to drink something, and he went backwards, and Lazarus went out; and that he met him on Friday morning, and said, Jonas, why do not you bring me the gold, or the value of it; and Jonas then called him a smuggler, and an infamous fellow, and told him he left the gold on the counter; he then said, he advised with his wife, who said, he had better take out a warrant, for he had very ill used him, and now he would be even with him for something; Lazarus Jonas had ill used him, and now it would be a recompence to him; he then said, now I will be even with him; I begged of him to consider that the prisoner had a wife and children, and I did not hear that he had been guilty of any thing before, and that he should take the value, and not find the bill; he said, he would not, and he told me, some years ago he had five hundred weight of coffee in the house, and Jonas gave information against him, he said, he was pretty sure it was him, for nobody else knew of it; Mrs. Harris says she was obliged to swear herself a whore to Harris, though his lawful wife; and Harris then said, hush my dear; I then intreated him again not to consider all this, for very likely it was not Jonas, he then said, if I chose to pay the expences, and the piece of gold, and give him an indemnification, that Jonas never would inform against him, he would not find a bill against him.</p>

               <p>Did he say how long it was after, before he took out the warrant? - He said three days after.</p>

               <p>Court to Harris. You have heard what the witness has said? - I have.</p>

               <p>Is that true? - Not a word of it, I have a certificate of my marriage.</p>

               <p>Had you any such conversation? - I never heard of it.</p>

               <p>Had you any conversation? - She came in once or twice, to beg for Lazarus, I never saw her before.</p>

               <p>But had you such conversation? - Not me, I know nothing of it.</p>

               <p>LAURANCE JONES sworn.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to the New York Volunteers, in the regiment that is now reduced to half pay.</p>

               <p>Did you call on Mr. Harris, and what passed? - Jonas formerly used to brush my clothes and go of errands, he staid away five or six days, and did not come as usual; last Friday I wanted him, and was informed he was in Newgate; as I had frequently entrusted him with forty or fifty pounds, I was rather surprised, I called on Harris at his shop, there was a woman present which I afterwards understood to be the wife of Harris; I asked Harris to inform me, what was the reason for taking up Jonas, he told me the same story as Mr. Barlin has related, namely, that he had given him a foreign piece of gold to look at, and ascertain the value of, and to know if he would purchase it or not, the prisoner asked him for a glass of gin, he went to fetch the bottle, and desired the shopman to get the glass, and while they went they found the prisoner Jonas gone out of the shop; he met him the Friday morning, this I understand was three or four days previous to his missing him. or two days, I cannot be positive to the day, he asked him what he meant by taking money from him, without returning it to him, or giving him the value for it, and that the prisoner had told him that he had not taken a piece of gold out of his shop, that he had left it with him in his shop, and gave him abusive language, which was the means of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110163"></xptr> inducing him to take out a warrant for him, he said he should not have taken him for this trifling cause, having known him for a number of years, had not it been for his ill treatment some years since; I asked him what ill treatment it was, he told me about three or four years past, he had laid an information against him, as he had a quantity of raw coffee, in his house; I asked him which way he knew the prisoner had done it, and the reason he gave for it was, that he, a day or two before the officers entered his house, offered to sell this Jonas four hundred pounds weight of raw coffee, but they could not agree for price; the wife who is present in Court, and by my advice has been subpoened, for I am disinterested in the affair, she said, that she was obliged to swear herself a common whore in the Court, to prevent Harris being ruined.</p>



               <p>What character has the prisoner borne so far as you know? - I have known him several years, he behaved to me very honest, never heard any thing else of him, or else I should not have trusted him.</p>

               <p>Court to Harris. You have heard what this witness has said, is it true? - Not a word about the coffee is true, I never spoke a word about it not a word passed or ever thought about it.</p>

               <p>Ivory. I saw him with it in his hand, when he went out of the door.</p>

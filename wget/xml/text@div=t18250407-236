            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden; in consequence of directions from the Mint, I employed John Elledge to discover sellers of counterfeit coin. On the 14th of March, I had given him some money to make a purchase; I do not remember what; but I had searched him before he went out, and he had nothing more about him than what I gave him. He brought me, to my own house in the afternoon, forty bad shillings; they were packed in separate papers; I bade him mark them, which he did in my presence, and I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he tell you where he was going? A. No. not particularly; but I had information that there were some at Westminster; I have known him twenty-five years. He had never been in any scrape, or difficulty, to my knowledge - I left him entirely to himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a relation of yours? A. Yes, he is; I gave him all the information I could to direct him in his search, but I had not named any particular person. I had given him money on several occasions - I cannot tell the amount of what I gave him that day.</p>
               <p>JOHN ELLEDGE. I am a shoemaker, and live in Elder-walk. On the 14th of March I went to the sign of the Ship, public-house, in Duck-lane, Westminster; I saw a person there with whom I had made an appointment, but I could not then get any thing from him - the prisoner was present - we were all in one box together; that person and the prisoner conversed together; the prisoner afterwards asked what I wanted; I told him two-score of bobs, (I meant shillings). The prisoner went out, and returned in a very short time; he then came and sat down by my side: he said,</p>
               <p>"Here are the things;" he gave me two paper parcels, and I paid him 15 s. - I paid him one crown, one half-crown, seven shillings, and a sixpence. I received this money in change for a sovereign which I had received from Limbrick. I delivered the papers to Mr. Limbrick, and made a mark upon each of the pieces of money - I had not opened the papers before I delivered them to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How often before have you been out upon such expeditions? A. Several times, but I never was examined before to day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Limbrick ask if you had any other money? A. Yes, and I said No. He did not search me - he has upon other occasions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mark the money he gave you? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you learn that pretty phrase, two-score of bobs? A. I have learnt it some time, perhaps, some years.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you change the sovereign? A. At the Three Elms, public-house, St. Ann's-street, Orchard-street, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been before a Magistrate before? A. Yes, in a case of felony, for stealing some cheese. I have been before a Justice on other occasions, but I do not know how many - it may be two or three years ago since I first went; the first time was the case of an assault. On one occasion, a night-constable took up a felon, and I attended as a witness; but I never attended a case in which Limbrick was concerned.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Was the prisoner a stranger to you? Yes, but the man who was with him was not. I had seen him on the Saturday before; I went there by appointment - I had been employed on a similar business on the Saturday preceding; I have seen the landlord of the public-house here to day.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I apprehended the prisoner from the information of the last witness, at the Ship, in Duck-lane, on Saturday, the 26th of March, about a quarter past eleven o'clock at night. I was in company with Pace; the prisoner took us to a house in a court, which we searched, but found nothing; the next morning we searched a stable, of which he gave us the key, but found nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was this court to which he took you? A. I do not know the name of it; his wife was there washing; no one opposed our going in. I had been in search of him before for a day or two; I did not know where he lived before that night.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the Mint; these are counterfeit shillings; they do not appear to have been in circulation; there is a preparation on them, which they put on before they circulate them - they are covered with a slight muriate of silver; I suppose 1 oz. of silver would cover some thousands of them - they are all from the same die.</p>

            , my man, in the house; I had given Blackgrove leave to go out; I afterwards missed a cream-ewer, a china sugar-basin, worth 5s., and six table-cloths; I also missed some copper money - it must have been halfpence and penny pieces; I pay the rent and taxes of the house; a person named William Melford lived with me about two years and a half ago- I recollect the name, but not the person - I can only say a William Melford lived in my service - whether it was the prisoner or not, I cannot say; he left me two years and a half ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do not you know that that William Melford was another person? A. The prisoner William does not appear like the same person; I have not the least recollection of him; I rent the whole house; I do not know when my maid-servant went out - she returned about half-past eight o'clock; I have no Christian name besides Mary Ann; I had seen three of the spoons on the table that day, and three in the closet; I do not know how many tea-spoons I had - I may have two dozen; I am sure the spoons I lost are the same I saw that day - they have my initials on them.</p>
               <p>SARAH BLACKGROVE. On the 11th of December I was in the service of Mrs. Norbury; she gave me leave to go out - I went out at a quarter before twelve o'clock, and returned at a quarter-past eight; I left the plate and every thing safe, and when I came back it was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you been in all the rooms that day? A. Yes I had, to dust them; I left Tibbs at home - no one had been in the house before I went out; I had been in my own room; if any one came while I was up there, I could not tell; my mistress went out a quarter before eleven o'clock, and I a quarter before twelve.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. While you were there, did you hear any knock at the door, or ring at the bell? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Are you sure you went into all the rooms? A. Yes; my mistress locked them, but I went into them; we both came out together; she locked the doors after me.</p>
               <p>HENRY TIBBS. I was in the service of Mrs. Norbury<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100041"></xptr>on the 11th of November; she went out between eleven and twelve o'clock that day, leaving me and the servant in the house; the servant afterwards went out, leaving me alone; no one, except the milk-woman, came to the house from that time till half-past five o'clock; about half-past five I heard a kind of rustling at the shop door (the shop door is a street door); I went up stairs from the kitchen, opened the door, and the prisoner Charles Melford stood at the door; he asked if I would let him have a few oysters; I said Yes: he came in; I shut the door after him, and went behind the counter to serve him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is it a spring lock, so that any body could come in without your assistance? A. Yes. He asked me how Mrs. Norbury did - I said she was quite well; he said, "I suppose she is at her father's, at dinner. to-day;" I said, Yes; I then opened some oysters for him; he said he had some more friends outside, who would take some; when he had eaten three or four, he went and opened the door, and spoke to somebody, but what he said I do not know - the prisoner William Melford then came in; his face was as it is now, without any disguise; he ate one oyster, and said he did not like them: one of them said, "You do not open them fast enough;" there were only two persons in the shop then; he asked if I had not got any body to help me - I said No; I am not certain which that was; one must have heard whatever the other said: he then asked if there was nobody in the house but me - I said, No, there was not; one of them went out - I am not certain which; he brought in a third man, who was Sullivan; I am certain of his person - (pointing him out;) one of them asked if he would not take any oysters - he said he would not, or No, I am not certain which; they then asked him if he would have a bottle of ginger-beer - he said No: Charles Melford then said, "That will do - that is enough," and asked what there was to pay; I said 8d. - he gave me half-a-crown: I said I had no change, and asked if he had no smaller change; he took up the half-crown, and put down a shilling; I said if he would give me the halfpence I would give him a sixpence - he asked William Melford if he had any - he said No: I gave Charles 6d., and said I would trust him for the 2d.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time did William Melford do any thing? A. He shut the door, and locked it; he then pulled a pistol out of his trousers pocket, I think, but am not certain which pocket it came from; it was a small pistol - he presented it to me across the counter, and said, "Do not you say a word - I won't hurt you;" Charles then said, "We don't want any thing of you - we only want your master's money;" he (Charles) pulled a sword out of his stick; and Sullivan pulled a pistol out of his pocket; one of them asked me to come down stairs: they asked me to show them where my mistress' money was - I said I did not know any more than a stranger that was never in the house - one of them asked me to go down stairs; I said No; one of them said, "Go round, and lay hold of him by the collar;" I do not know which that was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you quite free from alarm, with two pistols and a sword presented to you? A. I was quite collected.</p>
               <p>MR. QUIN. Q. Well, what happened? A. Charles Melford came round the counter - he laid hold of me by the collar, and desired me to come down stairs, and at the same time put the sword against my breast, saying, if I did not come down he would run me through - I said I did not care if he did: one of the other men said to him,"Never mind, go down yourself;" Charles let me go, and went down stairs into the kitchen without me - he returned almost directly, and brought up a lighted candle; it was there, lighted, before.</p>
               <p>Q. While he was gone down stairs you were in the shop - what passed? A. Sullivan was holding the pistol across the counter to me at the time, I being behind the counter; when Charles Melford returned up stairs, William said to Sullivan, "If he makes the least noise, blow his brains out directly;" that frightened me - Charles and William Melford then went up stairs, and I saw no more of William afterwards. Sullivan stood at the same place, holding the pistol across the counter, directed towards me, and he (Sullivan) said if I squeeked, or made the least noise, he would have me down directly; while they were up stairs I heard them breaking open doors and places: they remained up stairs about a quarter of an hour, as near as I can judge, and at the end of that time Charles Melford came down, and asked me for another candle - I gave him one out of the cupboard at the back of the shop - I do not know which of them lighted it; he went up stairs again with the candle, Sullivan still remaining below - I then heard them come down stairs, to the first floor; the first noise I had heard was higher up: I heard them say something about the kitchen, but what I do not know. Charles Melford then came down stairs a second time - William remained above: Charles said, "Follow me," and Sullivan said, "Go on," and he followed me; I went half way down the stairs, and saw Charles Melford take something out of his coat pocket - he was at the bottom of the stairs - I did not care to go any further down then, and I stood still; Charles then said, "Come on - we won't hurt you;" I then went down to the bottom of the stairs; Charles then took a cord, and tied my hands behind my back, and tied the cord, at the same time, round my body - he had another string, and fastened my legs with it - he then dared me never to know either of them, if I saw them again; he said, "Mind, you never know us again if you ever meet us in the street;" they then went up stairs, and I saw no more of them; they left the street door ajar. I gave an alarm, and got assistance; when I got up stairs I found the things all thrown about the rooms - I got up stairs by cutting the cords, in about two minutes; I got across the kitchen, got a knife, and cut them; when I got up stairs I found the things thrown about the rooms, and the doors broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect going to the Saracen's Head at any time? A. Yes, the day after, or two or three days after - I think it was the next day; a person passed me, who attracted my attention, and I charged him with this - I believed it to be William Melford, and I gave him in charge - he was not the man, but I took it to be him; there was something the matter with his nose, which induced me to take him for the man.</p>
               <p>Q. That having been the case, do you still swear positively or not to William? A. Yes; I am quite sure of him. I went to Worship-street five or six weeks afterwards, and the prisoner Charles Melford was shown to me by Hanley - he was under examination; I was not in the office two minutes before; I said he was the man. I have left<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100042"></xptr>Mrs. Norbury's since, in consequence of the robbery - I believe I was partly suspected of it, because I did not fasten the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Part of the cause was your having left the door unfastened? A. Yes; the suspicion was mostly through my leaving the door unfastened. I had been in her service about twelve months; before that I lived with the persons whom I now live with, Messrs. Stapleton and Biddle, fishmongers, Holborn-hill. I should think the prisoners were in the house about half an hour; we have gas-lights in the shop, and they were burning; the shop shutters were up, and the door was shut and locked. I gave the cord which I was fastened with, to Mr. Smith, the beadle of the parish.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you fix on the man at the Saracen's Head? A. By his looking very hard at me, and having lost his nose, but I did not swear to that man; I said I could not swear to him - that was before the Lord Mayor.</p>

               <p>Q. After that man was discharged, did you not still say you believed he was the man? A. I said I still thought he was the man, but could not swear to him; it was proved before the Lord Mayor, that that man had been discharged from the hospital the day before; I saw Charles five or six weeks after that, and said I knew him before I was in the room two minutes - I have always said that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was not twenty minutes or half an hour? A. I mentioned it in twenty minutes, or half an hour also; I mentioned it in two minutes as well; I saw him in a private room, not in the Justice-room; he stood against a table - another person, named Moss, stood by his side - Moss was a person taken on suspicion of a robbery in the City-road; he had no connexion with this case; he is a shortish person, and looks a little like a Jew.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long after you saw the man you suspected at the Saracen's Head, did you see the prisoner William Melford? A. About five weeks - I was quite certain of him. I saw Sullivan the day after Christmas day; he was at Worship-street - he was taken after the Melfords were committed; I was quite certain of him. I speak with certainly to his being one of the three.</p>

            . I am in the the employ of Mr. Rowley, ham and beef merchant, of Whitechapel. I have known the prisoner William Melford about five years; I knew him in the service of Mrs. Norbury, of Birchin-lane; the appearance of his face has been altered since he left her service; I called on him on two different occasions while he lived with her, once on a Sunday, to borrow a coat, and again on another occasion.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not mean to swear positively to the identity of William? A. I do; I cannot swear to his countenance, but to his person generally; he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not, that you only believe he is the person? A. I know him to be the same person, from his general appearance, but I cannot speak to his countenance, as I have not seen him for two years previous to his being taken, and his countenance has been altered since I last saw him - his nose is altered.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You say you do not know his countenance, but know him generally - do you know his voice? A. Yes - his voice is not altered, and I know his build, and the structure of his person - I have no doubt whatever of his being the same man; nothing is altered except his nose.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer of Worship-street. I apprehended the prisoner Charles Melford, on the 10th of December, at No. 24, Henrietta-street, Hackney-road; there was a woman in the house, whom I heard him call mother, and a young woman, whom I am not certain, that he called sister, in the house, but he spoke of her afterwards to me as being his sister; after taking him to Worship-street, I returned again with Wilmot, to assist in searching the house; there are two sleeping rooms; the mother and sister sleep in the front, and I understood from the mother, that Charles and William slept in the back, but that was not said in their hearing; there are two rooms below, but no bed-room, except the two up stairs - I found hanging on the door of the back bed-room, a blue coat, which Charles Melford owned - I also found in a box near the foot of the bed, in that room, six pistol bullets, two small vials of gunpowder, and several flints, and, on the mantel-piece, were two other pistol bullets in a watch-stand - in another box, I found this bullet-mould, which fits the bullets, and in the same box I found two masks, which I did not take away at the time, but have them here now; there was a box on the landing-place, within a yard of the room door; I could not get the key of it, and broke it open with a chisel - I found a large loaded pistol at the top of that box - I have drawn the charge; it was loaded with small shot, and primed; in the same box I found a cut glass creamewer, wrapped in brown paper - I did not bring that away at first, but am certain it is the same - I saw Wilmot find two pistol keys; he took them up in the room, and showed them to me - I believe he took them from one of the boxes - I found nothing more that day - I produced these things at the Police-office; only Charles was in custody then - I produced these things before him - I do not recollect whether I had any conversation with him, expect before the Magistrate; the mother was present when I found them - I apprehended him before ten o'clock in the morning - I went back and found the things about eleven; the bed was unmade - I did not notice whether one or two persons had slept in it - I apprehended William on Monday the 17th, at the Olive Branch public-house, Maze, Borough.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask William Melford where he lived? A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100043"></xptr>We took him for another affair - Mrs. Norbury's robbery was mentioned to him, but not particularly; he said nothing particular about it - I went on the 18th, to the house in Henrietta-street, with Garton and Brown, and in a cupboard in the back room, ground-floor, I found this sword stick; it is a sword for thrusting; it was in the room under that in which I found the things in the box, and up stairs, in the back room, where I had searched before, I found the duplicate of a fish-knife, pawned for 18s., at Lawton's, No. 151, Bishopsgate-street - I went there with that duplicate, and the fish-knife was produced to me; there was a screw-driver, which I produced; Garton has that; we found a tooth-pick in William's pocket, when we took him, and Brown found a pencil-case. On Christmas day, between five and six o'clock, I went in company with my brother officer to the Ship and Shovel public-house, in a court behind Guy's Hospital - I went up stairs, and found the prisoner Sullivan lying on a bed, with his clothes on; he was lying outside - I told him to get up, that I might look at him; he had a different coat on to what he wears now; he got off the bed - I told him I was a Police-officer, and from his description, I suspected he had been concerned in a robbery, and asked him how he got his bread; he said,"Not in that way, master" - I asked him, "What way then?" he said he had been a licensed hawker - I asked him to show me his goods; he said he had no goods, they had been stolen from him - I asked him to show me his box; he said he had no box - I asked how long he had known Bill Melford, and whether Bill had not slept in that room with him about a week ago; he said Yes, he had a short time before, and that he got acquainted with him in Guy's Hospital - I looked near the head of his bed, and found a bawker's bag, with "Jeremiah Sullivan, licensed hawker" on it; the landlady was in the room, and said, in his hearing, that it belonged to him - I took these cords out of that bag; they are what are called nettles, I believe; they belong to a hammock I believe; he said so, and I found a sort of ring with them - I found a duplicate on him, which does not relate to this business, and half a crown in money - I found a small pistol flint in the bag, a common flint - I asked what he did with those cords; he said they belonged to his hammock, when he was in the Preventive Service - I took him to the watch-house. I should have stated, that I put these cords into his hat, and he took them to the watch-house. I found them in his hat afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Charles was taken first? A. Yes - I went to the mother's house three or four times, in order to take William - I found some things the first time; the mother knew I found them. William was not then in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went the second time, you found other things? A. I found all the articles, except the duplicate and sword-stick at the first search, but did not bring them all away.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I accompanied Hanley to the Olive Branch, and took William Melford; I searched him, and found four duplicates in the fob of his trousers pocket - I produce them - three of them relate to this robbery; one is from Harris, and two from Martin; the other was a duplicate for a pair of spectacles, pawned for 5s. I went to No. 24, Henrietta-street, the day after I took William, and, on searching the boxes in the back room, up stairs, I found this silver pencil-case. I went to Mrs. Norbury's, in Birchin-lane, and examined her premises - I think it was on the 18th - Garton was with me, and he had a screw-driver, which I saw found at Henrietta-street, in the same room; I applied that screw-driver myself to two room doors, three closet doors, and a chest of drawers, all of which had been forced; I compared it with the impressions made on the wood, and it corresponded exactly with all of them.</p>

            . I am an assistant to Mr. Lawton's pawnbroker, No. 151, Bishopsgate-street. I gave this duplicate (looking at one), on the 26th of November, for this fish-knife, which was pawned in the name of John Smith, by the prisoner Charles Melford - I am quite certain of his person; I asked him if it was his own property; he said Yes, to be sure it was - whose did I suppose it was; he gave me his name and address, "John Smith, No. 14, Brunswick-street."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. That was seven weeks ago nearly? - A. Yes; I am certain of his person - I advanced 18s. on it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The duplicate appears to describe the person pawning as a housekeeper? A. Yes; he said he was a housekeeper, so I gave him a duplicate with the letter H. on it.</p>
               <p>JAMES BROWN re-examined. I produce a rope, which I received from Tibbs.</p>
               <p>HENRY TIBBS. That is the rope which my hands and feet were bound with.</p>

               <p>GEORGE WILMOT re-examined. I have worked as a rope-maker on board ship, though I am not a rope-maker; this is a sort of rope called nettles - it is used to tie up hammocks with; this is a particularly fine one, and is termed a three-yarn nettle.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at those pieces found in Sullivan's bag - are they the same in every particular? A. This piece is not - it is a two-yarn nettle, nor is this piece, but this one is exactly the same kind of stuff; these nettles are generally<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100044"></xptr>used for slinging a hammock; one piece, I swear, is the same manufacture as that produced by Tibbs - it is very fine, unusually fine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The first piece is cut clean at the ends? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you untwist the piece you compared? A. To ascertain the quality of the yarn - the rest are coarser, and quite different,</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is there any particular yarn in the composition of these two that you say tally? A. Yes; it is particularly fine yarn, which is not common.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SULLIVAN. Q. Is there hardly a sailor in London without such ropes as those? A. No; not one in five hundred has rope of this quality to his hammock - it is considerably uncommon; it is particularly fine, very choice - I do not mean to say there is none of this sort, but it is uncommon.</p>

            . I keep the Ship and Shovel public-house. I know all the prisoners; Sullivan lodged with me for four months, up to the time he was taken up; the other prisoners very frequently visited him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they visit him before, or near the 11th of December? A. Yes; William Melford slept with Sullivan on the 11th of December - that was the first night he slept with him; they visited him often.</p>

               <p>Prisoner SULLIVAN. Q. Did you see me more with the Melfords than other men? A. The Melfords were more acquainted with him than with any other person.</p>
               <p>MRS. NORBURY. This fish-slice is mine, and these six silver tea-spoons have my initials on them; the six table-cloths are mine - they are not marked, but I gave the officer one, which was cut from the same piece - they are of a particular shape and make; they are made small, narrow, and long, for the tables in my business - they correspond in pattern with what I have at home; I know this glass cream-jug; I have a sugar-basin corresponding with it; the sugar-tongs are mine, and have my initials on them(M. A. N.) - the spoons are marked the same. I know this pencil-case - it is an old one, which I have had for years - it was in a box, with the seal, which is not found; nothing more of mine is here - I am certain they were safe in the house before the robbery; I had used the spoons the day before.</p>

               <p>SULLIVAN's Defence. I am innocent.</p>
               <p>JURY to HENRY TIBBS. Q. You have said you were fastened hand and foot - how did you get liberated in two minutes? A. I was at the bottom of the stairs; my hands were fastened with a cord, and tied round my body, but I managed to get my hands out. I noticed Sullivan's voice - his voice to-day corresponds exactly; Sullivan might be twenty-five minutes, or half an hour, with me; while they were going over the house, he was holding the pistols across the counter; we were face to face - I was under no alarm at first.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. These persons' lives are concerned in this charge; can you, on your oath, conscientiously and seriously, before God, declare you are certain of each of the three prisoners? A. I am certain of all of them; I should know the coat Sullivan had on if it was produced.</p>

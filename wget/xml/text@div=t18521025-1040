                  </hi>. I am a toy-dealer, at 15, Little York-street, Whit-more-road, Hoxton. On Sunday evening, 3rd October, I went to the prisoner's; he carries on the business of a firework maker, at 30, Rose and Crown-court, and occupies the whole house—the manufacture is carried on in the first floor back room—there is a shop to the house—I knew John Howes,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185210250055"></xptr>
               <p>one of the deceased lads,—he was in the prisoner's employ—I have seen him come into the shop when I have been there—I cannot say that I have seen him engaged in making fireworks, but I have seen him bringing them down stairs—I got to the prisoner's about a quarter to eight on this evening—I found the prisoner, his wife, and two young girls, in the back parlour, I passed through the shop to go there—the prisoner left the room two or three times while I was there—I heard a loud lumbering noise overhead, and said, "Have not the boys left off work?"—I addressed that generally; the prisoner was in the room—his wife said, "No, they have not yet"—I observed that I did not like Sunday work, I thought no good came of it—the prisoner was present, but did not say anything; he left the room after that, but I cannot say where he went to—the room opens into the passage where there is a staircase leading to the top room—after he left the room I immediately heard a noise as if a person was walking upstairs—he did not remain away many minutes—I am not certain whether he went up two or three times, but after he came down the last time, he said to his wife, "The boys may as well leave off now"—that was about a quarter or half past 8—his wife then left the room, I heard a person go up, and when she came into the room again, she said, Jack had got a few more to finish, and be would stop and finish them—I do not think the prisoner made any reply to that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner direct his wife to tell the boys to leave off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He merely said the boys might as well leave off.</p>

CAARTEEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After the wife came down did the prisoner remain in the room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and about five, seven, or ten minutes after that an explosion took place like the report of a cannon—upon that I rushed out of the house through the shop—about five minutes after, I returned, and met Mrs. Holyhead at the shop door with her apron full of fireworks—I looked through the window and saw the prisoner in the shop by the side of some<lb></lb>thing that was burned—it was outside the counter on the floor—I cannot tell what it was, but it appeared like a bundle of some<lb></lb>thing burning—I went into the shop and assisted the wife to pack up the fireworks—soon after the explo<lb></lb>sion I saw the boys out in the court—they were very much burned all over; the flames were out, but their clothes were still burning when I first saw them—they were taken away on shutters—I afterwards went upstairs to the back room, the window frame was blown out, and the shutters burned and shattered—the table which stood by the partition dividing the room from the passage, was very much burned, and there were remains of firework cases which seemed to have exploded, on the floor—I did not see any candle—I saw the prisoner afterwards, he said it was his total ruin—he said the room was lighted with a flat candlestick with a common tallow candle in it, and a glass globe round it—I cannot tell now what conversation led to his men<lb></lb>tioning that—I may have asked him what sort of a candle he used, but I cannot say whether I did or not.</p>

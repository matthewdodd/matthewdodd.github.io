               <p>ANN SEACOMBE. On the 18th of March, the prisoner opened the door and took the cotton in question off the shelf close by the door. I was in an adjoining room and ran out. I seized the prisoner, and he hurt my arm considerable in trying to get out; I told the girl to call somebody; and she called two men in out of the street, while I was struggling with the prisoner. He would not put the print down, and one of the witnesses took it from under his coat.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BULMER. On the 18th of March, the prosecutor's servant said to me, pray sir come to my mistress's assistance. She said a man was ill-using her mistress. I went into the shop and the prisoner had his back towards the door. I seized him, and took the print from under his coat.</p>

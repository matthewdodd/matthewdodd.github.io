I am the prisoner's wife—we live at 10, Francis Street, Westminster Bridge Road—ou 27th November, between 11 and 12 o'clock at night, I was in bed, my three children were sleeping at the foot of the bed—my husband came to bed, and afterwards said "I cannot sleep, I shall get up and light my pipe"—I took no further notice but dozed off to sleep—presently I felt him at my throat—I thought the bed-clothes were off</p>

               <p>and that he was putting them on—I then felt a knife going to the bone, and blood trickling down my chest—I laid hold of the blade of the knife, and he had it by the handle—I stood straight up in the bed, and halloaed to my son "Your father has cut my throat"—I saw the prisoner—there was a light in the room, because my boys were out, and I always leave a light—I said to the prisoner "What are you up to?"—he made me no answer—I was cut across my throat, and he gave me two stabs on my right chest, which went to the bone—one of my hands was cut because I had hold of the blade of the knife—my son Patrick came and took the knife out of both our hands—he then got me out on the stairs, threw me my petti<lb></lb>coats and boots, and I went out of doors, and met a constable, who went back with me, and I gave the prisoner in custody—the prisoner had been in and out all day, and was very good-tempered—he is a shoemaker—he had had a little drop of drink, not very much—I know that because I was with him about an hour and a half at the "Peacock," and he only had a half-quartern of rum, and a pint of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale—that was between 12 and 1 o'clock in the day—we had supper together between 9 and 10 o'clock—we had a pint of ale with it, 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth—the children were present at supper—we were on very good terms during the day and at night, and directly I had done my supper, he said "Come up to Mr. Coppin's, in the West<lb></lb>minster Road, and have the tooth out," as I had the toothache; and I did go, and he paid for it—this is the knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—sometimes there used to be a few words between us—he threatened me <hi rend="italic">all through the piece</hi> that I should never eat my Christmas dinner in this world—I mean for three or four months—we were not disagreeing, but sitting friendly when he would say that—I do not think he is at all affected in his mind—he was very fond of the children—he used to say that day after day—he was very odd, but I did not think he would do such a thing—he last said it a day or two before he did this.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 109, Blackfriars Road—I examined Mrs. Mead at the station, about 12.30—she was sober—she had an incised wound on her throat, about three inches long and one-eighth of an inch deep—it was very superficial, but dangerous, from its situation; she might have had erysipelas—she lost a good deal of blood, which would leave her weak for a considerable time—I sewed it up—no large vessels were severed—the trachea was cut into, and she could scarcely speak before the Magistrate—there were also two incised wounds on the right side of her chest, about two inches deep, going to the ribs—the larger one was deeper and nearer the breast—I had to put in two stitches—that went to the ribs also—there was a good deal of blood from them—the little finger of her left hand was nearly cut off above the second joint; not through the bone—they were all done with a very sharp instrument, and all clean cut—such a knife as this would produce them—she is out of danger now, but very weak through loss of blood—there must have been four distinct blows.</p>

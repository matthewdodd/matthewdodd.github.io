               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. Do you mean to say all these things are cast in your house? - A. Some of them I can prove are cast in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You cast a great many? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. About how many in the course of a year? - A. I cannot pretend to calculate, about a hundred weight in the course of a week; they are finished up in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived at these premises? - A. About fifteen years.</p>

               <p>Q. The prisoner at the bar was employed in this warehouse; - he was particularly employed in packing up goods in the rough room, and to look over the rough room? - A. Never to pack up; he had to take care of the ware-rooms when the clerks were out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has the prisoner lived on the premises? - A. About two years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have a wife and five children; I was persuaded by a friend that I should not be called till Friday; there are many that would come forward then; I leave it entirely to your mercy.</p>

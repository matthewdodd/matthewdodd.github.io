On the morning of the 21st of September I opened the windows of the chamber, and saw the desk in its usual place - I went into the ajoining room, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I looked out of the window, and saw a crowd of people running; I then went into the square, and saw the people at No. 6 - they came on to our chambers, and asked if I had lost anything: I said No; they said I had better go in and see. I went in, and missed the desk. The window had been pulled down so low that I could not pull it up again; it pulls down, but will not go up; there were footmarks upon it.</p>

            . I was at the door of the fruit shop in Lincoln's Inn-passage, and saw the prisoner with a desk under his arm - I followed him, and saw him put it into the passage: I went after him - a man came up and collared him; they scuffled, and I believe the prisoner struck him - he then ran away, and was caught by another person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This occurence did not take up more than a moment - A. No; he stopped in an instant to put down the desk, and I lost sight of him while he turned the corner of Serle-street.</p>

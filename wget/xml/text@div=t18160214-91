Between nine and ten the next morning, he came down stairs, and walked out of the house quickly. I told the servant to look into the room in which he had slept, to see if all was right; in consequence of what she told me after examining, I pursued the prisoner, and overtook him at the bottom of Little Minories; he objected to coming back, and stated that he had paid for his lodgings, and what he had had. I brought him back, and my attention being called to some company, he ran off again. I pursued him, and brought him back, and sent for an officer. Being pressed hard for an account of what he had done with the sheets, after denying all knowledge of them many times, he said he had thrown them into the corner of the room from which he had made his escape, and there was found one.</p>

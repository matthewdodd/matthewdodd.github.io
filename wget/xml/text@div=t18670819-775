                  </hi> I reside at 10, Vine Street, Holborn—about six o'clock on the night of 15th June I was coming down Mount Pleasant, leaning against the railings—I had some bread and Cheese in my hand, and was talking to a cripple, who was leaning his hand on my shoulder—I the prisoner came up and upset my bread and cheese out of my hand—I then pushed him and said, "Where are you coming to, you fool? "—I then stooped to pick up my bread and cheese; as I was stooping I felt some<lb></lb>thing</p>

                  </hi> I live in the Hornsey Road, and am a commercial traveller—about six o'clock on the evening of the 10th July I was driving down Mount Pleasant, and saw the prosecutor, with some bread and cheese in his hand, coming in an opposite direction—I saw prisoner knock the bread and cheese out of prosecutor's hand—prisoner was then knocked down, but no injury was inflicted, as he stood for some minutes—he took out a knife—the prosecutor was being led away by his friends, when prisoner made some remarks in his own language, which aggravated the prosecutor so much that he broke away from his friends to strike the prisoner, who in the meantime had opened the knife—I called out to keep prosecutor back, as prisoner had a knife, but the prosecutor got away and was stabbed by the prisoner, who ran away, followed by the prosecutor, who knocked him down—prisoner then shut the knife up, and hid it in his trousers—the constable then secured him—it was the big blade of the knife that was opened.</p>

                  </hi> I am house surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital—I examined the prosecutor at about half-past six, and found he had a lacerated wound on the back of the hand, about three-quarters of an inch in length, and extending from the soft parts down to the bone—I also found a small wound in the back, which penetrated among the muscles ly<lb></lb>ing near the spine—this wound was not more than a quarter of an inch, but was an oblique wound, and extended inwards about an inch and a quarter—there was not much bleeding from it—it was not a dangerous wound—it would be physically impossible to inflict such a wound as the one in the back, with this knife—it might have caused the wound in the hand—the other blade of the knife might have caused the wound in the back.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You saw the prosecutor and prisoner too? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the prosecutor's wounds are healed—the prisoner's was the more serious injury of the two, as the cartilage of his nose was broken—it must have been a severe blow to cause that—the prosecutor's fist might have done it—the blood which came from prisoner came from the back of the throat, but was caused by the blow on the nose—he has the scar still—there was no injury to the mouth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Surgeons, and the Apothecaries Company. I have been in practice about fifteen years—Wanstall, the husband of the witness, met me in the street on 17th July last, and asked me to come and look at a child that was dying in his house—I went, and it was just dead—I had seen the child about six weeks before—it appeared quite idiotic—I examined the body on the Sunday afternoon, after the death—externally there were no appearances; internally, the chest on the left side was filled with fluid, and the left lung was compressed—there was also a considerable layer of coagulated lymph around the walls of the chest—at the right side there were old adhesions, the result of former inflammation—in the stomach I found a small quantity of dark fluid of a gruelly appearance—that was merely the contents of the stomach—it might have been something he had taken—the stomach was inflamed, and the whole track of the intestines—I removed them from the body—I found the lower portion, particularly the rectum and that part, highly inflamed, and the mucous membrane was softened—in removing the intestines a quantity of dark fluid escaped from the cavity of the abdomen—some water also escaped between the rectum and the bladder—I gave my evidence before the Coroner, and by his order, on a subsequent examination, I removed the stomach and intestines, and conveyed them to Dr. Letheby—I also, by order of the Coroner, examined the head of the deceased—that was on the second examination—I found no appearances about the brain to account for death—I have had some experience of the composition-powder since this occurrence—I had no experience of it before—Bayberry and hemlock bark are not English herbs—they are said to be astringent—I can give no opinion about them—if an enema of a quarter of an ounce composed of valerian, lobelia, and composition powder were administered to this child, it would have the effect of a powerful stimulant—I have no means of judging whether they are irritants on the human subject—it would stimulate the part to which it was applied—it would stimulate the finger.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose it was applied to a person labouring under diarrhoea, would it stimulate so as to increase that or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is a difficult question to answer—it is likely to increase the quantity of blood to the part, whether it would relieve the diarrhoea or not is another question—what is meant by stimulating is increasing the action of the part, and bringing more blood to it.</p>

               <p>object of opening medicine is to irritate the coats of the intestines, and by that means expel the feces—I cannot say whether the habit of taking aperient medicine constantly would affect the coats of the stomach, and render them liable to inflammation—I know that this injection is a powerful stimulus from my experience—I have had experience of it—I have applied it, the composition-powder, the lobelia, and valerian—I consider it dangerous—I have tried it on dogs—I found it to be a very powerful stimulus—it acted very powerfully on the bowels—I got the lobelia from Mr. Stephens—it is in the Pharmacopeia—it is used by doctors, but not generally—I know of no quarrel between myself and the prisoner—I heard of a meeting at which Dr. Coffin gave a lecture—I was not present—I remember the period when the cholera was raging in my neighbourhood—I do not know that this person's medicines were very generally taken.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you not know that there was a question before the vestry as to whether they should not be administered parochially? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard of vestry-meeting being called—I was present—I am not aware that there was a question raised as to whether these medicines should be used or not—I do not recollect speaking against their being used—I cannot say what I said—when I went on the Sunday to open the body of the child, I do not recollect whether I gave notice of my intention to the prisoner—I had the order of the Coroner—an inquest had not been summoned at that time—I got the order through the constable—I did not apply for it—he gave it me—that wit before the inquest was held—I examined the lungs—the left lung was com<lb></lb>pressed, and wholly useless—I did not say at the time I examined the lungs that I wondered how the boy bad drawn his breath at all, and that we need go no further, for that was enough—I said, "Here is disease"—I did not say we need go no further—I did not say the left lung was literally rotten; I said it was wholly useless—I did not say I wondered he could draw his breath at all—nothing of the kind—when I was before the Coroner, I recollect Mr. Stephens wishing me to be examined at once—I was not examined until the second examination—I had then had a talk with Dr. Letheby, and gave him the contents of the stomach.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a doctor of medicine, a graduate of the University, and have been lecturer at the London Hospital many years I have more particularly directed my attention to the subject of poisons, and their effects on the human frame. I received from Mr. Garrett the intestines and stomach of a child—I examined them, and found them violently inflamed from one end to the other—I have heard the evidence in this case, and have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185108180103"></xptr>
               <p>heard the physical character of the child described—it would require greater care in administering medicines to such a child as that, because it would not be likely to complain of injury so readily—I believe the inflammation was the cause of death—I have heard that the left lung was compressed—persons live for years with one lung—there might have been no disease of that lung at all; I did not see it—such a position of lung exists, but it might depend upon the manner in which the body was opened—I am not clear that there was that disease of the lung of which Mr. Garrett speaks; it might not have been—I bad a small package of composition-powder brought to me by Overton—I analysed it—that which I detected chiefly was ginger and cayenne pepper; the other parts were not capable of being recognised by chemical means—if that composition-powder were introduced into the body, it would tend to stimulate the intestines; and, if repeated, to irritate—I have not examined anything similar to the enema that was administered; but I examined the lower part of the gut, and there I found part of the composition-powder, and what I suspected to be part of the enema, lobelia—I am not able to say that it was lobelia—there is no positive test for lobelia; but as far as the micro<lb></lb>scope would guide me, I believe it to have been lobelia—the lower intestines, which lie between the rectum and the bladder, were very much more inflamed than the others; so much so, that they were nearly disorganised, nearly in a pulpy state, in the highest state of inflammation—lobelia, valerian, and com<lb></lb>position-powder mixed, however it was applied to an inflamed bowel, would increase the inflammation, and it would be the very worst thing that could possibly be applied—I am not prepared to say that it would produce the ex<lb></lb>treme inflammation I observed—a repetition of the composition-powder would no doubt produce inflammation—I do not think a single dose would produce it.</p>

               <p>how did you try it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Alone; I have tried it with spirit as well—I have never heard that the persons who apply it say that spirit, is the last thing it ought to be mixed with—I did not hear that at the Inquest—lobelia is a medicine that may be used under certain circumstances—it is spoken very highly of by medical men of great authority—it is mentioned in medial works.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What quantity did you put on your tongue? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three grains; I weighed it—I found that a tea-spoonful was exactly one drachm—I was very careful in ascertaining exactly what quantity it weighed—I used an ordinary teaspoon—I put fifteen grains on the back of my hand, that was not mixed with spirit—it is always stated that lobelia should be administered with great caution, and on the best of evidence, that many deaths have arisen from its operation in America and in this country from the indiscriminate use of it.</p>

I lost these halfpence on the 13th of December; I was sitting in the tap-room, I heard the rattle of halfpence; I got up and went to see what it was; I saw the prisoner with a five shilling paper in her hands; I asked her what business she had in the bar, she said that my daughter was drawing her a pint of beer, and I have the money in my hand; I said that is my five shilling paper of halfpence; the prisoner said she had the halfpence of Mrs. Fitzpatrick. The prisoner and I went there, Mrs. Fitzpatrick said she had no halfpence of her. Mr. Hancock came and took her to the watch-house. I believe this would not have happened if she had not been in liquor.</p>

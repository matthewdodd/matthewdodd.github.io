               <p>SAMUEL SHEARMAN sworn. - I live at Mr. May's: On the 20th of June, between six and seven in the evening, I was looking out at the window, and saw the prisoner come in with a child in her arms; I had no suspicion, and about five minutes after that I saw her go out without the child, and something in her lap, and in about five minutes after that the last witness came up, and asked me if one of my children was crying; I came down, and saw the child stripped, except its shirt, bonnet, and shoes; I then went to the first pawnbroker's I came to at the corner of Wood-street, from whence, according to the description I had of her, she had been gune about two minutes; I then went in search of the parents in Bishopsgate-street, I heard that a child had been lost; I found the nurse crying; I took her with me, and she claimed the child; I am sure it was the prisoner that came in with the child.</p>

             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker,(produces the property); I took them in on Saturday, the 20th of June, about eight o'clock in the evening, of a woman, but I cannot swear to the woman, it was a person of the stature of the prisoner, but having a shop full of people, and it being just before candle-light, I cannot speak to her person.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL HARPER sworn. - I am an officer; I took charge of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Tritton. These are the things the child had on.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Shearman). Do you know what his christian name is? - A.Thomas; he keeps a coalshed and chandler's-shop.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, which was read as follows:</p>
               <p>My Lord. As your prisoner has been drawn away from her parents by a wicked and base woman, and as your unfortunate prisoner has not arrived at the age of fifteen, and not knowing the consequences of so diabolical a deed, not having the fear of God before her eyes, and not having sufficiently withstood the devices of that wicked being, hope your Lordship will commiserate your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010053"></xptr>prisoner in mollifying her offence, as your petitioner has become sensible of her horrid crime, and truly penitent, and your petitioner hopes to be a comfort to her parent, and an ornament to society in future.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character. GUILTY, aged 14.</p>

On the 18th of November I saw the prisoner lurking about the window - I watched, and in two or three minutes saw a handkerchief snatched down from the door; I ran round the counter, and caught him with it, not a yard from the house - I could tell by his looks that he wanted to steal it, and not buy it; it was within the threshold - he tried to throw it down when I caught him; I had a hard matter to bring him into the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was looking into the shop, and the handkerchief was on the ground; I never touched it - I did not struggle with him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CLAMP. I caught it in his hand; I cannot say I saw him take it - there were two of them concerned.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was he running from the door? A. He had not time to move; I was round the door upon him immediately. <rs id="t18291203-73-verdict400" type="verdictDescription">

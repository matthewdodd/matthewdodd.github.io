                  </hi> I am the wife of Edward Harris, of No. 27, Artillery-row Westminster. The prisoner was in my service—I left her in my house on the 24th of March, and missed her on my return—I afterwards missed a shawl—I found the prisoner the next day in a house in Kelso-place—I took an officer with me, and found the shawl on the prisoner's back—this is it—she said I had lent it her—I said, "No, I never did, I was not in at the time."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic"> Prisoner.</hi> You lent it me on the Saturday night; I went out with it, and you go a letter for me to go to the hospital; You said my cloak was too shabby to go out. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, I lent her an apron, not the shawl—she had been with me before, and I turned her away for sleeping out at nights—I took her again for pity—she had only been a week with me.</p>

The prisoner came down stairs, and tried to make her escape by me—she appeared to be going away—she had this shawl on, and Mr. Harris claimed it—I took the prisoner to the station—she said the shawl was lent to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic"> Prisoner.</hi> I said it was my mistress's—I gave it you—my mistress took me back again, and I said I would take care of her place—she lent me the shawl to go out—I went back with it.</p>

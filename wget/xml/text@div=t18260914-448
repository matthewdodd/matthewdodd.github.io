               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had he been with you? A. Ten months; on the Monday after he was apprehended, Cape, who is in my employ, said he had a sum of Stevens and Wood's to offer me; he is the prisoner's brother-in-law; I have looked into his book; this sum is not entered; he has several small sums to collect - perhaps 2000l. a year.</p>

               <p>Mr. PEARCE. This receipt is the prisoner's writing. I swear he never paid me the money; I cannot say whether he paid me any money on the 22d of July.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. (Written.) The truth is, that having accidentally omitted to enter this sum, I did not like to acknowledge my inattention, and as Cape was going out to collect, I got him to pay the amount, as if he had received it.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Pearce's employ. On the evening the prisoner was taken, he gave me 2l. 17s. 6d. to take care of; he afterwards told me he had received it for Stevens - he gave it me after he was in custody; he never told me why he gave it me - I gave it to his sister; I told Mr. Pearce I had some money of Hartley's, and asked what I was to do with it - he had not told me not to give it him - I was in the room, he put it into my hands, and said, "Take care of it."</p>
               <p>Mr. PEARCE. I gave the prisoner 30s. a week; I find, by my cash-book that he paid me no money on the 22d; I never made an error in my entries; Cape occasionally collected for me.</p>

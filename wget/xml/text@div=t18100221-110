            . Q. You serve in the shop of Brown and Ingham - A. Yes. The prisoner came in alone, she asked to look at some black muslins for handkerchiefs; she bought one for one shilling and nine-pence. After she had paid for this she asked to look at another sort of black muslin, rather larger, I opened her another piece, she took hold of it with one hand, and put her other hand under it, and pulled out another piece from under it, and put it up her petticoats, between her knees; she then sat down on a stool and ordered me to cut another handkerchief off, it came to three shillings and a penny halfpenny; she paid two shillings and a halfpenny; it was to be put bye, she was to bring the rest of the money the next day. She then spread her handkerchief over her knee, and put the handkerchief that she had paid for in it, it was wrapped up in paper; she folded all together. I took the handkerchief out of her hand, and the other piece of black muslin was in it, it contained six yards, just ten shillings the prime cost. When I asked her what she had in her handkerchief, she said nothing but what she had bought, and when I took the handkerchief out of her hand, and discovered the piece of black muslin in it; she then said she did not know it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was very much troubled in mind; I had an affectionate brother laid dead at home. When the young man said, what have you got in the handkerchief, I said nothing but what I bought; he said you did not buy this; I said, I beg your pardon, I did not intend to thieve it. It has almost broke my honest husband's heart.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

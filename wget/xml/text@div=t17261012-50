               <p>The Prosecutor thus depos'd. Coming home between 12 and 1 in the Morning, I met the Prisoner who stopt me; and after I had had 3 or 4 Minutes Conversation with her, I mist my Watch; upon which I called a Constable and delivered her over to his Care, but had not Sense to search her my self, but left it all to him, for he told me that he'd wheedle her out of it before Day-light, but I never got it again.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner thus made her Defence. My Eyes were dazzled just as I came under a Lamp, and so I ran against the Prosecutor; he took hold of me and said he would go with me, or I should go with him; but I refusing both, he began to call me Bitch, and swore I had stoln his Watch. <rs id="t17261012-50-verdict213" type="verdictDescription">

            . I am prime warden of the Goldsmith's Company; in consequence of something I heard, I went to the shop of Mr. Savory; in Cornhill, on Wednesday, the 21st of August; I asked for six tea spoons, stating that I wished to buy six plain tea spoons - I was furnished with them; (I now hold them in my hand) I looked at the marks and thought they were forged - I asked to see some more spoons - I did not specify any number; I asked if their spoons of other patterns, but the same quality, were a higher price - and asked to see some; the shopman told me he had none, but I might see some in the afternoon - there were three shopman in the shop; I examined the marks openly on the counter, and asked if they were the proper marks - the shopman told me they were all manufactured at their manufactury, pointing to a board with golden letters, written on it,"Manufactory, Myrtle-street, Hoxton;" the board was at the top of the shop, just above the counter - and he added if these marks were not put on at Goldsmith's Hall, they were subject to a penalty of £50, for every article they sold without it; I paid £2 for them - there are the regular officers here from the hall, to prove the marks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by SIR JAMES SCARLETT. Q. How long have you been warden of the Company? A. Nearly four years; I am not in the trade, nor connected with it in any way - we had made no discovery respecting a man named Treen when I went to Mr. Savory's; he was also under suspicion at that time - at the same time I received a communication regarding one party, I received it regarding the other party.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Treen was not then apprehended? A. No.</p>

            . Q. Had you any knowledge or information at the time, that Treen had been working for Mr. Savory? A. I really don't recollect; when I bought the spoons I did not ask whether Mr. Savory was at home or not; I did not know him - I afterwards sent Mr. Prideaux on the same day to buy six more spoons; he brought me six spoons - I have not got them - I don't recollect making any inquiry for Treen's workmanship - I am not certain that Treen was in my mind at all, for the spoons I bought had

The marks on these spoons are forged - the whole of them; the leopard's head, the lion passant, and the king's head - the assay marks are the leopard's head, the lion passant, and the letter S; the letter S denotes the letter of the year; the present year commencing the 29th of May - that is the time at which the wardens are elected - the initials of the maker's name here are W.

            . Q. How long have you been engraver to the Company? A. Since 1807 - the Company are authorised to impress stamps of their own when they assay silver - the Stamp Office have the management of the King's duty - the stamp is made by me, by the authority of the Stamp Office - the stamp is put on the plate by the Company at the hall - they have the stamp of the king's head to denote the duty is paid; and their own stamps, the lion passant, the leopard's head, and the letter of the year, are all put on at the hall at the same time - all those stamps are forged - I am not in the habit of attending at the hall when the stamps are put on; I know how it is done - the plate is sent in a bag to be stamped; there is a ticket with the bag containing the weight of silver - the duty is 1s. 6d.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170069"></xptr>an ounce; I don't know whether 3d. an ounce is allowed for discount.</p>
               <p>Q. Now; did you go on the search at Mr. Savory's shop? A. I did - I did not know Mr. Savory - we went to search on the 24th of August - Mr. Fuller accompanied me; Mr. Miles went also, but left immediately, he was going to Bow-street - Mr. Miles is assayer - we went with Forrester, a city officer, between eleven and twelve o'clock I think - I think the question was asked, whether Mr. Savory was at home - he was out; I don't recollect where they said he was - one of the shopmen asked to write a letter to Mr. Savory; I did not look at it - I went out of the shop to get a bun at the pastrycook's - nothing was said about the letter afterwards in my presence - I should not think we staid more than an hour there searching, for we took the plate away to the Goldsmiths' Company - we took the whole plate that they gave us up; which they said was the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Treen's work asked for? A. It was not that I am aware of - when I was present six hundred and fifty-five ounces were taken.</p>

            . Q. I know you took the whole afterwards; was the whole taken at that time; did you go twice? A. I merely went into the shop I think a second time; but I don't recollect stopping there - I was only present at one general search - the day I went with the officer we took the whole plate that was delivered up to us - I was not present when there was any contest about an officer being left in the house, and it was agreed a padlock should be put on the door - the first time I was present was when six hundred and fifty-five ounces were brought away - there had been a search before; I was not present at the first search - Mr. Miles went to the first search I believe - he brought some plate to me to be examined; I don't know how many ounces; I did not take any account of the weight - I don't know what he took away - I examined all Miles shewed me; I am not aware that Miles shewed me anything till after I made that seizure - I examined some, but not what was brought me by Miles - Mr. Bedell brought some from the prime warden - that was one spoon.</p>

            . Q. Then you don't know that Miles took thirty-six ounces? A. No; I took six hundred and fifty-five ounces - only sixteen ounces nine penny-weights were kept, and I believe the rest of the six hundred and fifty-five ounces were returned - I was four or five hours examining it at Goldsmiths' Hall; I had a glass - the plate was full of dirt with the polishing powder; it took some time to clean it out.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any of that cleaned out by the shopman while you were searching? A. They cleaned out two or three, but I said we had better take it to the hall, where we could do it more effectually - I do not remember Miles thinking some was forged that I thought not.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you remember Miles, or somebody saying,"It is all forged," and your saying, "Oh! you know nothing about it?" A. I never said such a thing; I don't call it to my mind - there was no difference of opinion on the subject of forged marks being on some of it - I did not consult with them upon it - I have no recollection of any difference of opinion about it - every piece was examined to the best of my knowledge; I don't think I missed any - I did not examine the whole with a glass, where I did not see it required a glass.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could any person commonly conversant with the company's mark be able to discover it was not the company's mark? A. It was very well done, a portion of it; the public would be deceived, but silversmiths would be able to detect it.</p>

Between four and five o'clock; I found four young men in the shop; I went with a warrant accompanied by the City Marshall, and one of the City officers; I cannot say whether I asked for Mr. Savory - I heard that Mr. Savory was either at Hastings or Brighton - I recollect one of the young men writing him a letter, Mr. Cope read it - two officers were there, Cope and Forrester - Mr. Lane was not there, nor Mr. Prideaus - there was somebody else there, who I don't know - I did not hear the letter read - we did not look at all the plate in the shop, for we came home, the shop was so extremely small, and it was dusk - customers constantly coming in kept the shop in confusion - I did not ask for the work of Treen - I don't recollect it - nobody asked for it in my hearing that I remember - I looked over one or two articles of plate - we looked over a very small portion of plate that evening - the young men in the shop assisted to clean out the marks in the shop - I did not take the plate to another shop which was more light - the plate was taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170070"></xptr>on Saturday - we went over to another shop on the second day, to see if the plate could be examined there, but it was taken to the hall - I was there about an hour the first day.</p>

If there was any mark I had a doubt upon, I should refer it to the engraver - I cannot say why I was sent - I was ordered by the warden to accompany Mr. Cope - I have been examined here before on this question, and called to give evidence about stamps - I have no recollection of making any mistake about about any - this is my signature in this book, I signed it on the 23rd of August - it is a true entry of the articles we took away - (reads) - "four shell deserts, six fiddle sauce, six teas, two mustards, one salt,"(that means salt spoon) and here is something about another salt, with K. P. before it - I don't know what it means.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it mean king's pattern? A. Yes, that is it - they make altogether twenty-seven ounces - I took them away on inspection that night suspecting these marks to be all forged - they were shown to the engraver next day - I was confident part were forged, of the other part I was not certain - I produce six sauce, and four tea now, as forged - I took altogether twenty articles - I took six teas- I said in the shop that I was not certain about them, but I should take them - I expressed that opinion in the shop - we could not take the whole there was such an immense quantity - I found it quite impossible to go through it myself, and proposed to Cope to secure the shop, so that nothing could be removed, and next morning I would send somebody down - I don't know that a padlock was put on the door - I left that to Mr. Cope - I have not returned the two teas, &amp;c., they are at the hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that neither at the first or second search any inquiry was made about Treen's workmanship? A. I don't remember it; I remember seeing some of Treen's work.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did you know it was Treen's unless his name was mentioned, you would only see that by the initials? A. That was what I knew it by, they corresponded with some spoons I have before seen from Savory's - I have no recollection of asking for Treen's workmanship.</p>

            . Q. Were you never there with Mr. Lane? A. Never; nor any of his clerks - Mr. Prideaux was never there with me - I went next day, I think, between nine and ten o'clock; I think I had shewn the twenty-seven ounces to Mr. Smith, in the mean time; the whole of them - when I went next day, I still found it was too dark in the shop - I found the shop extremely small, and we could not go over the stock - I took the engraver; we had not time to take him the first day.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went next day was any proposal made by persons in the shop, to go to another shop, as there would be better light to examine? A. Yes: we went over to see the shop, and there were so many workmen there; we thought it best to go to Goldsmiths' Hall, and the plate was taken there - we only took the spoons; we did not take the other articles of plate at all, at that time - I had looked at two or three articles the day before; the spoons were the only things I suspected - I did not know Treen at that time; it was not in consequence of information that I received about Treen, that I suspected the spoons - I never heard Treen's name till after I made the search - The practice is for plate to be carried to the hall and examined, and stamped, and returned to the workmen to finish - it is brought to me before it is finished and the duties are paid.</p>
               <p>Q. When you put the stamp on, if the plate is rather thin it sometimes puts it out of shape, does it not? A. Not much in spoons; it puts it out of shape a little, and they must be beat again to get the shape back, and that is after the duty is paid - the duty is paid by the workman he sends the plate with two notes; the duty and the price of marking - the money is received by the clerks in the office; it is put into the bag with the work - it is always the practice to put the money into the bag - the plate is first weighed and ascertained to be correct, then the duty is taken out of the bag; then the plate is tied up again in the bag after it is marked - it is not sealed - that is the invariable rule - if you sent a bag of large table spoons, and a bag of small tea spoons in a separate bag, with your mark on it, they would both he returned on the same day, if they are both sent at the same time - the bag must be brought before nine o'clock; the office is open from eight to nine o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I put the case of a man sending a large bag and a small bag, before nine o'clock, he receives them back the same day? A. Yes; if a man sent two bags of large work, we should not take it in; we only take in one bag with large work.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If the same man sends two bags of the same kind of work, you do not take them in? A. No; we should compel him to put them into one bag, as it would occasion so much confusion in the office - they may bring half a dozen bags so that they send a note of them all in one weight; if there are three or four bags, if those bags are all included in one weight; they must send one note with the whole weight.</p>

            . Q. Did you examine the mass of plate which was taken the second day to Goldsmiths' Hall? A. No; I was before the Lord Mayor; Mr. Savory came before the Lord Mayor - I have not stamped any plate myself for fourteen years - I have formerly stamped a good deal; I stamped it for about four years, at the Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your attention must be drawn to the stamp<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170071"></xptr>ing? A. Yes; It is my duty to assay - in stamping, a stamp may be made too light; never too strong - I have not known instances of it being sent to be marked over again generally when we discover it is marked too slightly, we mark it again without it being sent - I have known instances of workmen bringing the plate back to be marked properly - I have known instances of plate being imperfectly marked, and being sent back to be marked stronger - the initials of each workman of plate, are kept in a book - when he bring plate to be stamped; the quantity is entered, but not by me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The plate being stamped, is entered in a book? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>SIR JAMES SCARLETT. Q. That book is regularly kept from day to day? A. Yes; the man's name is entered, the weight of the work, and what he pays - after a man has entered his name, we can by reference to the books, find out the day that man came to have plate stamped - an allowance of 3d. an ounce is deducted from the 1s. 6d. duty - the money comes in the bag with the work - the workman sends the exact money, deducting the one-sixth - he sends but 1s. 3d. an ounce.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have been asked when the stamp is made on thin materials, whether it bulges on the other side, and you say it is hammered then? A. Yes, it is hammered; I am not a manufacturer and I cannot say whether it is filed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do I understand you, that after the stamp is put on, it is hammered to get it all right again, if imperfect? A. Yes; it is done by the manufacturer; not at the office.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have been asked if you examined principally spoons; your suspicion being directed to them - did you also examine some of the large massy articles of plate? A. I did; tea pots and sugar basins - I found no forged marks on the larger articles, (producing some spoons) - the initials on these articles are 
               <persName id="t18331017-125-person1186">R. H. </persName>
            (six forks, two butter knives and a salt spoon produced) these are also forged marks.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is this part of the general mass, or of the twenty-seven ounces? A. Part of the general mass.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have been asked about plate being brought in an unfinished state to receive the various marks, and then taken back to be finished; are those articles of plate brought to receive the genuine marks of the Company? A. Yes; it is completely finished, except polishing - If I found on plate produced by a manufacturer, marks at all resembling thesa, I certainly should not take it in.</p>
               <p>SIR JAMES SCARLETT. Q. Did you go to White-lion-court to make any search? A. Yes - not as one of the places Mr. Savory manufactured at - there was no manufactory there at all - I went to search a warehouse of his there on the 24th - I did not search there; I was there about a quarter of an hour; I left Mr. Smith there - nothing was brought from there that I know of - I did not go to his warehouse in Myrtle-street, Hoxton - I saw a board in his shop with Myrtle-street, Hoxton, written on it - I had no warrant to search that place, nor was that place entered in Mr. Savory's name - I always understood it to be entered in the name of Hillham - I supposed the warehouse in White-lion-court to be in the name of Hillham; our books don't enter the place of manufactory, but the place of abode - I have Richard Hillham entered - it was not known that Mr. Savory carried on a wholesale business under the firm of

               <p>JEREMIAH FULLER. I am one of the assayers of the Goldsmiths' Company. I have the book in which the entries are made of the different manufacturers, (produced) Savory has entered his name as "Thomas Cox Savory, plate-worker, 54, Cornhill" - I find no reference there to a place called Myrtle-street - there is no R. H. in my book to correspond with the R. H. on this fork - we have some R. H.'s in our books, but they don't correspond with that - there are smaller and larger letters, but none of this size - none with a punch which would produce this impression - when they enter their name they produce a punch, and we take the impression ourselves; and this R. H. does not correspond with any impression in our books.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q. Is that the book in which all the names of the persons are kept? A.

H. at the hall - the mark itself is not the genuine mark entered in my book - it is not part of my duty to know what plate is brought to the hall by different makers - Treen has brought plate to be marked between January and May this year.</p>

            . In August last I was in a situation in Mr. Savory's shop, No. 54, Cornhill, - I have served him from the 27th of April, in this year, to the present time; In April, Treen was one of the workmen - I did not know where Treen lived - Treen came occasionally for his work, and occasionally sent his man, Cook - I knew him by his coming, and knew Cook by his being sent - Treen continued to be employed, more or less, from April; he was discharged at the end of July - I heard of it - I did not know the cause of it - I remember Cook coming to claim a balance of 3l., about the middle of July; he received 2l. less than the money he asked for - he had brought in a bill - he was employed two or three days after that happened; I am not sure how he was finally discharged - when work came from Treen in his name, or by Cook, the bill was handed to Mr. Savory - when the work came home a bill was brought with it - to the best of my belief, in all the instances of plate being brought from Treen, that I know of, he was paid as usual, the duty, the price of manufacture, and had the weight of metal returned; Treen and Cook always brought an account to the shop when they brought work - other men worked for Mr. Savory - when Treen or Cook produced a bill, Warboys made an entry of it - he was paid according to Warboys' direction - he would be paid by a cheque, for the silver, on Sorrell, the refiner, and cash for the fashion of the goods and duty; the cheque would be for the quantity of silver to be returned; that was the constant course of business during the time I was there; it was so with Cook as well as Treen - Cook was considered a workman of Treen's - Treen's notes were chiefly preserved; I believe this to be one of Treen's notes for the month of April,(looking at it) - I know Treen's writing - I have always seen the man when he received the notes for silver, and money for duty, mark it on the bill which he brought; this one has

            's writing, there is a charge for duty in the bill - it was an invariable practice at Mr. Savory's, that in every ticket brought there was a charge for the duty, and, as far as I am able to judge, the amount of the charge both for duty and work was paid - between April and July I might have witnessed the mode of payment for work done once or twice a week - I never knew any instance to the contrary - I never knew a deduction of a farthing for the duty - it was sometimes Warboys' duty to keep the bills - four young men were employed in the shop - Mr. Savory was at Hastings at the time the search warrant came - the officers first came on Friday; I was there when they came in, about five o'clock, on the 23rd of August, it was twilight - I should say it is a darker shop then ordinary - Mr. Cope, the marshall, George Miles, Daniel Forrester, and, I rather think, a gentleman named Prideaux, came with the search warrant; Mr. Prideaux was a clerk of Mr. Lane, attached I believe to the Goldsmiths' Company; Mr. Cope said he had a warrant to search the premises, I answered for Mr. Savory; Treen's name was mentioned; either Mr. Miles or Prideaux introduced the name of Treen; I am quite certain Mr. Miles was present when Treen's name was mentioned; he said they were searching for Treen's work; Miles or Prideaux said that, one or the other, and I am sure in Miles's hearing; one of them said it was only Treen's work they were searching for; we collected what work we saw of Treen's, and it was handed to Miles I believe; I said it was better to collect it ourselves, and show it them; I collected what I believed to be Treen's work, and produced it; the only criterion by which I judged of Treen's work, was the mark of W. T. on it; Miles said to his own party I consider that it is forged - they went away and took 27 ounces of silver, that evening.</p>

Yes; it was by Mr. Prideaux, he mentioned Treen more particularly, I should say Treen more certainly; Mr. Prideaux asked where Treen lived, Warboys answered it was in Essex-street, Battle-bridge; they asked who worked for Treen, and was answered a person named Cook; it was described where he lived to Forrester, the officer, by Warboys - Warboys offered to go and point out the residence of Treen, and also his person that evening, after business was over; the same offer was made with regard to Cook - they accepted the offer - I believe Warboys went, but not to my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, at the time of the search, both the first day and the second, was every facility given to make it effective, and were all papers and books produced? A. Most certainly it was; I thought it most prudent so to do - the book containing Treen's account was examined on the Saturday - when Miles came on Saturday, and asked to see the books, I asked if his warrant would authorize him to see them, he said it authorized him to do anything; I said I doubted it, but produced them, and he took extracts from them, or a person with him did so<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170073"></xptr>- they did not then ask me about any place in White Lion-court - the first time they came I believe inquiry was made where Mr. Savory was, and I told them he was at Hastings, he went on the Saturday before; I said something about writing to him to apprize him of what was passing; they allowed it as a favour; Mr. Prideaux said he granted it as a favour, I shewed him the letter - I have not looked at the six spoons, the subject of this indictment, since the purchase,(looking at them) - I remember a gentleman coming on the 21st of August, and asking for six spoons, Warboys was in the shop, engaged with a customer, Hillham, and the clerk, Metcalf; I served Mr. Cox myself, for the shopman was engaged; Mr. Cox asked for some spoons, he mentioned no particular pattern, I served him with six spoons; I cannot swear that these are the six spoons - a gentleman came afterwards, and said he came from a gentleman who had bought six spoons in the morning, and paid 2l. for them; he wished six similar to them, they must be exactly to match; I supplied him with six; I don't know whether they were the same workman's make; I told him if he did not like them, as to pattern or anything, they would be changed; I had no reason whatever to believe the duty had not been paid on those spoons; I had not the least suspicion that the marks were forged - an invoice was made for the two lots that we sold in the morning and afternoon - when the marks were to be investigated, I assisted in cleaning them, to facilitate the detection of forgery, if there was any.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Mr. Savory was in the country? A. He was, and he left me there as assistant - Mr. Cox did not ask me for six more spoons when he bought the six, to my recollection; the duty is 1s. 6d. an ounce on spoons - we do not charge the duty separate from the rest; we charge so much an ounce - we sell tea spoons at 7s. 8d. an ounce, including all the shopkeeper's expences - 7s. 2d. was not paid for these; we have a paper in the window which intimates we sell spoons at 7s. 2d. - that only alludes to tables spoons and dessert spoons.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you sell these spoons for 7s. 8d.? A. I believe I did, if I did otherwise it must be a mistake.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Is that the price you usually charge for tea spoons? A. It is, and 7s. 2d. for dessert spoons, and table spoons, and forks.</p>
               <p>SIR JAMES SCARLETT. Q. Is this the paper which is put in your window? A. It is a printed paper like this; a paper of prices.</p>
               <p>This paper was here read, stating fiddle pattern spoons, dessert and table spoons at 7s. 2d. an ounce, and tea spoons at 7s. 8d., &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Witness. I gave an invoice in writing to the last lot, in which I included the first - according to my belief I charged 7s. 8d.</p>

            . I was in the service of Mr. Savory about three weeks since; I had been in his service about seven months - I came to him about February last; I had been in the same line of business before, about seven years, serving as shopman, more or less - I was in the habit of selling plate, and mostly receiving it from workmen - I knew a workman named Treen, employed by Mr. Savory.</p>
               <p>COURT to DURHAM. Q. Looking at those spoons, is there any thing about them that would strike you that they were forged marks? A. No, sir; on now looking at them and examining them, I should not be able to discover they were forged impressions - I do not consider myself a sufficient judge; I have been in the employment nearly four months.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Look at the W. T. on that, is there nothing remarkable on that? A. There is nothing to excite my suspicions; it is partially defaced in every instance - I have seen that often in other spoons with other marks.</p>

             re-examined. I have been nearly seven years in the trade with different persons - I know that Treen worked for Mr. Savory, who purchased plate of him - Treen was what is called a "Little Master;" that name is known among the trade as "Little Masters" who work themselves, and sell plate to silversmiths - I in general received Treen's work from Cook; I never knew him bring plate without a bill - (looking at some bills) - these are a mass of his bills of parcels - they were made out in general in the same form - the number of ounces are always specified, and the charge for duty and workmanship - we paid him with money for workmanship and duty, and gave him a cheque on the refiner for silver he brought, and the duty was paid with the workmanship - here is a bill of parcels, "8th July, six fiddle butter ladles" - (looking at some) - I cannot say these are the six; I can only say they are Treen's make - at the time we received the orders for these, we had no other in the house - I wrote a twopenny post letter to him for them - I ordered six; the charge in the bill of parcels, dated the 8th of July is, "Mr. Savory, to William Treen, six fiddle butter ladles, 8s. 6d. - weight twelve ounces, duty 18s. 7d., making 1l. 7s. 1d." the whole amount - the amount of silver is twelve ounces, and eight pennyweights - this is a cheque on Surrell the refiner, which was given to him for the silver - I did not see it written - it is Durham's writing, dated the 8th of July.</p>

             re-examined. I can undertake to say, that the duty was paid, as well as the making - I should say these tea-spoons which Mr. Cox bought, are Treen's make - I cannot say they are the spoons Mr. Cox bought - at the time they were bought, I was serving another customer; we have had a quantity of tea-spoons of Treen, several times; it was an invariable rule to pay him a cheque for the silver on the refiner - and cash, for the duty and make; I never knew of the least variation from that rule - I should not know any of those stamps to be forged; if Treen had brought these spoons to me, and I had no previous suspicion of the man, there is nothing to induce me to look at them narrowly, to suspect they were wrong - I do not know how long Mr. Savory has been in the trade; there are ten bills of parcels here, some in Cook's name, and some in Treen's; they are the bills we received from Treen - this one is Cook's writing; he mostly brought the work - Treen very rarely brought work; generally Cook - I cannot tell distinctly, what was the last date of any work paid to Treen, but it was about the latter end of July - (looking<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170074"></xptr>at a cheque) this cheque is in Mr. Savory's hand-writing - the invoice of this transaction is not here (looking at another paper) the writing below here, is by Mr. Savory, it is dated the 10th of July; (looking at two other cheques) one of these cheques is my own hand-writing, signed by Mr. Savory; the date of that is July, the 19th, and the other, July the 20th; I do not know of any transaction with Treen after that date - to the best of my recollection, that was the last - Treen was dismissed - a note was sent to him; I did not carry it; that was about the 21st or 22nd of July; I remember his coming afterwards, and Mr. Savory refused to deal with him; during the whole seven months I was with Mr. Savory, I have known of his paying the silver, the fashion, and duty, to Treen or Cook - in every transaction; this was done sometimes three times a week - he manufactured a great deal of plate for Mr. Savory - I never noticed the difference between what we had from Myrtle-street, and what we had from Treen - Treen made a good many spoons for Mr. Savory - Mr. Savory had a wholesale trade as well as retail; the wholesale trade was carried on in the name of Richard Hillham; the spoons were marked in that name, 
               <persName id="t18331017-125-person1200">R. H. </persName>
            - his own mark was 
               <persName id="t18331017-125-person1201">T. C. S. </persName>
            - we sometimes got goods from the wholesale manufactory for the retail shop; sometimes we have goods marked R. H. in the shop - goods for the wholesale shop were all marked R. H. to my knowledge - I recollect the circumstance of Treen's marking his own goods W. T.; several quantities were bought of him with his own mark on them - Treen had some in his possession at one time marked R. H.; I don't know how he got the mark; I don't know when he gave it up; he brought spoons in marked 
               <persName id="t18331017-125-person1202">R. H. </persName>
            - I recollect the circumstance of Cook bringing the mark, and giving it up to Mr. Savory, and after that the spoons were marked "W. T." - Mr. Savory carries on a considerable business; his country business was considerable, as well as his town, when I first lived with him - I cannot say how much he pays for duty in the course of a year, but it is to a very large amount; he has a very large stock of plate - the duty was paid on all the tea spoons that I know of; according to my belief, there was not one on which the duty was not paid - no deduction was made of the 3d.; all the little masters he dealt with were paid the full amount of duty, without deducting the 3d.; whatever they were paid for workmanship they had 3d. an ounce besides.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have been seven years in the trade? A. About seven years - I have not yet been able to discover a forgery from a genuine mark - I never said so to my knowledge; I never said to that gentleman that I could detect the forgery - I cannot say that I ever told him I knew that these spoons were wrong; not to my knowledge - I was not shewn them to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear this gentleman never shewed you any of the plate in question? A. I saw half a dozen spoons at the hall - I don't know the day, but it was last week to my knowledge - I went to the hall last week; they shewed me half a dozen table or dessert spoons; I think table spoons - the gentleman at the time, Mr. Prideaux I believe, said the hall did not intend to shew any plate, besides that the indictment was laid on, and he showed us half a dozen table spoons; not these six- I cannot say that this gentleman ever shewed me any plate at the hall, at any other time, nor in Mr. Savory's shop - I never told him that I knew there was something wrong about the spoons - it is about three weeks since I left Mr. Savory; I am still on terms of friendship with him; I have no reason to complain of his conduct; I was with him last Saturday evening; I staid perhaps three hours; I left home about a quarter after eight o'clock; it took about half an hour to go there, and I left Mr. Savory's it might be about half-past one o'clock- I was not in his company at all yesterday afternoon; I was in his company in the evening, about five minutes - I was before the Lord Mayor, but I was not called I don't think these invoices were produced before the Lord Mayor, in my presence.</p>

               <p>Q. Pray what was it you said about Treen; you say he was dismissed by Mr. Savory, had Mr. Savory and he several little misunderstandings, which they made up afterwards? A. The transaction I recollect was Treen had twenty-eight ounces of silver more then was due to him - Mr. Savory had given him some silver, and at the same time a cheque on the refiner, and about three days afterwards Cook called, and said Hawkins had ran away with the silver - there were only two misunderstandings to my knowledge - I have seen Cook here to-day; he brought Treen's work home - I saw Hillham last night, at Mr. Hargraves, Bishopsgate-street; there is nothing to prevent his being a witness - Mr. Savory had desired Treen to give up the stamp with 
               <persName id="t18331017-125-person1203">R. H. </persName>
            on it; I am not aware of the reason, I was not there at the time; I heard from Mr. Savory that he desired him to give it up; he did not state his reasons for desiring it - the only recollection I have of it is, Mr. Savory said, he thought for the future he would have Treen mark his own work in his own name, and give up the R. H. stamp - Mr. Savory is acquainted with Hillham.</p>
               <p>SIR JAMES SCARLETT. Q. Did you assist in keeping the books? A. I did; the wholesale trade was carried on in the name of Hillhan.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Hillhan to your knowledge is not very ill to day, is he? A. Not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>SIR JAMES SCARLETT. Q. Cook is the same man as the prosecutors examined on Saturday? A. He is; the two misunderstandings I alluded to were, Cook came one afternoon, or Treen, and there was nearly a new bag lying in the shop; he took that and left his own behind him; the person belonging to it came, and Mr. Savory said, he did not like the appearance of it, and sent one of our lads immediately down to Treen for it, and it was brought back again; that was one misunderstanding; I do not know when that happened; it was soon after I came - the next was, he brought some work, and it was about Mr. Savory's time to leave town for Peckham; Mr. Savory asked him what it was; he said, 3l., and it was only 1l.; that was Cook; Mr. Savory disapproved of that; those are the misunderstandings - I assisted in taking up Cook; Mr. Prideaux asked if I knew where Cook lived; I said, I knew where he used to live, and if he would meet me after I left the shop, and would go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170075"></xptr>with me, I would show him - Forrester asked me the name of the street; I said, "Edward or Edmund-street;" I went with him - there was a person named Bates apprehended; I apprehended that man likewise, he had been in Treen's service - Leadbetter the officer was present at the time; I was where Mr. Savory was some hours on Saturday night; it was not with him; I did not inquire whether he was gone to bed; I was called on to look over the accounts of Treen, to see what I knew of the transaction, in order that there might be instructions given to counsel - I do not think I saw Mr. Savory all the evening - Mr. Savory was very punctual and exact in business; he dealt mostly for ready money, and paid ready money in most transactions.</p>

            . I am a silversmith, and live in Castle-street, City-road. I have considerable transactions with silver articles; I have known Mr. Savory about ten years; six years in business for himself; he bears the character of a person of the strictest integrity - from my knowledge of him he would not for the sake of gain commit a fraud - I have found him strict in small matters, such as correcting errors made by our clerks - on looking at this plate with the naked eye I should not detect anything wrong here; I should say even looking at it with this magnifying glass it is almost impossible - the work is so battered it would have to be replaced in its original shape; the leopard's head is so stretched - I might take up a dozen articles coming from the hall, and there would be a visible difference - I should not be able to judge whether it is a genuine or forged impression - it is my business to manufacture the patent pencils; I employ about fifty men in the trade.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I think you say, it has been so battered to make the impression, that to bring the spoon back to its proper shape, the spoon becomes defaced. A. It is; the French do not cut so deep as we do here - you are obliged to beat it to get it back to the share; it is battered in receiving the stamps at Goldsmiths' Hall.</p>

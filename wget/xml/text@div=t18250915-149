               <p>THOMAS SMITH. On the 3d of July, when we came opposite to <placeName id="t18250915-149-crimeloc804">Hickman's gate</placeName>

I had my jacket taken from my back, my hat from my head, and 11 s. from my breeches' pocket - I was knocked down on the ground - I had seen both the prisoners before on that day, and am certain of them; I do not know who took my property, but only them were round me just at the time I missed it - I was not stunned - I felt them take my jacket off, and felt a hand in my pocket, which they turned inside out - there were several people about when I got up, but when my property was taken I only saw the prisoners - Ledger and Foster afterwards came to my assistance. Kelly was afterwards brought down to me to the Swan.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. When did you first go to the Swan? A. About half-past six o'clock in the morning, and left in about an hour - I went there afterwards about five or six o'clock and remained till half-past ten: it was Sunday, and we had not been hay-making that day. I remember seeing Kelly by the Swan that afternoon, - not in the house - I had no words with any body at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you would have the blood of an Irishman that night? A. No; I cannot swear who took my jacket - I do not know whether my hat fell off or not - I was sober. I saw Sullivan next morning, but did not say I had lost my jacket and hat, and wished I could find them - I said I had lost them, but did not tell him to go and find them - he did not tell me he had seen a strange man run away with my hat - there was no quarrel at the Swan while I was there - I sat in the garden having my porter - Sullivan offered to come as a witness for me, next morning, but as I did not want one he has come against me.</p>

            .

I do not know whether the prisoners were there. I found Smith laying on the grass bleeding - he had no jacket on; he asked me to go and look at James - we were taking him to the Swan, and met the patrol - it was dark.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to interfere? A. I was going home with Ledger, and heard persons quarrelling half a mile before we got up to them. Smith and James were laying on the field. I think seven men were taken that night on suspicion.</p>

            . I am a horse-patrol. On the 3d of July, I met Smith opposite the Swan; he desired me to go on, as he thought they had murdered his brother-in law. I went and found him laying by the road-side, took him to the Swan, and from information I received from Smith, I went to the out-buildings of Mr. Barnes' premises, and apprehended seven persons - Kelly was one of them; he came off the hay-rick, and I collared him; and seeing a scar on his face, I asked what he had done with the coat - he said he knew where it was; he would not tell me then, but would in the morning.</p>

When I got to the rick, the patrol asked Kelly where the coat was; he said he knew, and would tell in the morning - this was not Smith's jacket; he said there had been a quarrel in the road, and he was there, and after a little hesitation took us to where the coat was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose these men were gone to rest in the rick? A. No; Kelly was employed as a watchman to guard the rick. I had been at the Swan between five and six o'clock - Smith and Field were then outside the house, and the prisoners in the parlour - Smith was sober.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I was at the Swan on the 3d of July, and shaved the two prosecutors; they were both intoxicated; and in the afternoon Fitzgerald was in the parlour - two men and six women were in their company; the prosecutors sat outside - the window was lifted up, and Thomas Smith asked Fitzgerald for a light - he handed him one two or three times; he asked for another, and Fitzgerald said he would be his servant no longer; he then made a blow at Fitzgerald, who put up his hand and stopped it, and about seven o'clock Kelly came into the tap-room with two women, and were drinking a pot of beer; and between ten and eleven o'clock at night, on dispersing, about three or four hundred yards from the house - I was in the road - the two prosecutors went towards the fence, and got two pieces of pailing, crossed over the road, and both hit Fitzgerald; he hit Smith again. Several of my countrymen were near - Kelly wanted to make peace between them, and the prosecutors knocked him down. I called Kelly to me, and while we were in conversation Smith pulled off his coat, threw it into the road, and hit Fitzgerald, who struck him again. I told Kelly he was a man of family, and to have nothing to do with the row, which he accordingly did. Fitzgerald went towards his barn where he slept. A man named Callaghan seized a piece of fence, and knocked Smith down, and one Banks knocked Field down - there was then a general fight between them and the Irish. After the row Smith said he missed his coat, and told me to go and look for it.</p>

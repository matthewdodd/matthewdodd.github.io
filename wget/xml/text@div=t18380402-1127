                  </hi>. I am servant to Sarah Brownell, a widow, in Marlhorough-place, Kennington, in the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth. About the 2nd of February, a man, who I believe to be the prisoner, came and offered some fowls for sale—he asked me to show them to my mistress, who was in the parlour—I did so—I saw the watch on the table just before—mistress did not wish to buy the fowl—he asked 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and then half-a-crown—I disputed the fowl being young, and he said he would leave it and call for the money in a fortnight—he went away leaving it, and did not call for the money—I never saw him again till he was taken up—mistress's watch was missing when he was gone—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

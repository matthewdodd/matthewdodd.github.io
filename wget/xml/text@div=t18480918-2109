                  </hi>. I live at 5, Brown Bear-court. On this night I was at the Blue Anchor. I saw the prisoner strike the prosecutor—blood came from his eye—there were five or six people there—the prosecutor had not said anything to the prisoner—he had his back to him—the prisoner was drunk.</p>

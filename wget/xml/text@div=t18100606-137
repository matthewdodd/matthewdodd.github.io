            . I am a widow, I keep a chandler's shop in Chapel-street, Grub-street. On the 24th of February, between ten and eleven in the evening, the prisoners came to my shop, Dalton turned himself round and said, I think we shall have some bacon; I said, I do not sell bacon, he said, never mind, we will have some cheese; they had half a pound, it came to five-pence halfpenny; Dalton put a seven shilling piece on the counter, I weighed it and found it to be a good one; he said, you seem to scruple it, you had better weigh it again; he kept it in his fingers and put down the same again, as I thought, but it was not the same; I said, there is no necessity of weighing it again. I gave him the change. Williams took the cheese. When they were gone I discovered the seven shilling piece to be a bad one. I have had the seven shilling piece in my possession ever since.</p>

            . I live at Mrs. Taboran's, Fore-street, she is a pastry-cook. On the 24th of February, the prisoners came to our house, Dalton said he would buy a cake; I served him with a cake, he gave me a seven shilling piece; I gave the same seven shilling piece to Mrs. Taborah, she said it was a very good one; then Williams said, I will have a cake too; then there was a dispute who should pay for it; I gave

             the seven shilling piece again, as there was a dispute; Dalton took the seven shilling piece and gave me another; I put it into the till. At that time three or four people came in and said, it these persons have had any thing they have been passing bad money. I then rung the seven shilling piece, I found it was a very bad one. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060062"></xptr>am sure it was a different one from the first, it rung like a bit of lead. Mr. Pritchard the constable came and took him in custody.</p>

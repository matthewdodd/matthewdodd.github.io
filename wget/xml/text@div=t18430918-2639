                  </hi>. I am a locksmith and bell-hanger, and live in King-street, Seven-dials. Edward Newbury has lodged with me these fifteen or sixteen months—on the 28th of August, between half-past eight and half-past nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my house—she had called before to see Newbury—she inquired if Mr. Newbury was at home—I</p>

               <p>said I believed he was, I would call him down—I did so—I handed her a chair in my shop till he came down, and when he came down he recognised her as an acquaintance—he said something which I did not understand—I was going on with my work, and did not hear—they did not address themselves to me—they had some conversation, and immediately after Newbury turned round, and said to me, "Oh, Adams!"—he immediately turned to the prisoner without saying any more to me, and said, "Have you got it with you?"—she said, "Yes," and produced this cheque—I saw her pull it out of her purse—he asked me whether I could get it cashed over the way at the public-house—I said I did not like to make so much freedom with then, as I was not well acquainted with them, but I would ask my brother-in-law, who lived next door—she gave the cheque to Newbury, and he handed it to me—I took it next door, to my brother-in-law, and he came back into my shop, and gave the money to me across the counter—I handed the money to Newbury, and saw him hand it over to the prisoner—I did not know her name at that time—nothing was said as to who was the drawer of the cheque—it is dated the 29th of August—this happened on the 28th—the prisoners and Newbury went out together.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 62, King-street, Seven-dials, at the last witness's house—I am a surveyor by profession, and a bell-banger. I have known the prisoner between four and five years, I believe—I never knew her by any other name than Mrs. Smith till since this affair—I supposed she was a married woman—I knew her supposed husband—on the 28th of August Mr. Adams came up and called me—I went down and saw the prisoner—she pulled this cheque out of her purse, saying that she wanted it to pay the coun<lb></lb>sel's fees, as Mr. Smith's trial was coming on that morning, and asked if I could obtain her the money which she had spoken to me about on the prior evening—she had spoken to me on the prior evening on the same subject, at her own home—she had sent for me, saying that she wished to see me at eight o'clock in the evening, and I went accordingly—(that was on the Sunday evening—it was about eleven o'clock when the messenger met me to say that Mrs. Smith wished very particularly to see me at eight o'clock)—she appointed to come again that night, which I said was impossible—I said, if she came next morning, no doubt I could get it done, and when she came on the Monday morning she produced this cheque out of her purse—she said nothing more than, "There is the cheque, sir"—I gave it to Mr. Adams, who went to his next door neighbour, a relation, to obtain the money—this is the cheque—Mr. Adams gave me the money, and he saw me place it into her hands the moment he gave it to me—it was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she put it into her purse, and left—I had seen the cheque on the Sunday evening, and she asked me to cash it then, but I said I could not possibly get it done till the following morning—the</p>

               <p>said, "I must have it done by nine o'clock, to pay counsel's fees"—I asked her who Mr. Watkins was—she said a very respectable person in the City, and the money was as certain as though she had got it in her pocket—I do not know any such person as Mr. Watkins—the prisoner and I left Mr. Adams together—I then went to my trustee, in Goodge-street, Tottenham Court-road, to ask him if he would give me the cash for another cheque which she had—I did not succeed in getting that—I never saw the prisoner afterwards till she was in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who brought you the message on the Sunday morn<lb></lb>ing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A person who was always a messenger backwards and forwards from Mr. Smith to me, not always, but latterly—I am told his name is Bush, but I do not know it to be so—I did not see that person yesterday—I have never seen him since—I was not in Court yesterday—I did not see that person here last Sessions, that I know of—I have not seen Smith since—I saw Mr. Smith in this Court for a former transaction—I did not see hhn here last Sessions—I have never been a witness for him—I do not think anybody was present but the prisoner and myself, when I went to her on the Sunday even<lb></lb>ing, not when I first went, but I think I saw that gentleman, Mr. Ballard, there afterwards—I think he acted as Mr. Smith's attorney—the prisoner did not give me Mr. Watkins's address—I did not inquire it, the thing was done so momentarily, and knowing it was Sunday—I made no further inquiries about Mr. Watkins of anybody—I did not go to the banker's to ascertain whether any person of that name had an account there—the prisoner did not tell me who she received the cheque from—I understood that she received it from Mr. Watkins—I know that Mr. Smith was at that time in Newgate—I have beard that Bush has since then been charged with forgery—I have been ac<lb></lb>quainted with Mr. Smith between four and five years—I cannot say exactly the time, but I can say full four years—I have been in the habit of doing holiness in ray profession for him, surveying buildings—I used to survey his property, his houses—I did not build for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where were the houses that you were in the habit of surveying for Mr. Smith? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In Suffolk-street, Hackney-road, where he at that time dwelt—I was not intimate with him, more than 'as far as concerned my business—I do not suppose I saw him fifteen or twenty times in my life—I do not know that I ever knew Mr. Bush till the Sunday before this happened, but he has been backwards and forwards to my house, perhaps for a couple of months, or it might be three—he used to come up to me of a morning, before ten o'clock, with any message—I never lived with Bush, nor ever knew where he lived—I never lived in the same house with him—I have never been charged with any offence—I know the Court of Requests in Kingsgate-street—I never was charged with any offence, nor ever in custody, or locked up—something was said about giving me in charge for uttering this cheque—I believe Mr. Greenwood misunderstood it, in this way, this was prior to the prosecution, though on the same morning, and he considered it was an act done after the prosecution.</p>

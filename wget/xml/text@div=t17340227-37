So I and the twa Men ged wi'her tull a House; now, Sir, quo' she, an ye wull gi'me a Draim I wall be much obleeged tull ye; so she caw'd for hauf a pint o'Leequor, and the Landlady caw'd Betty to come tull us; and the Preesoner and I and Betty, and the twa Men ged up Stairs. But yen o' the Men dinna bide long, and in hauf an Oor his Companion and Batty get away to, and last no Saul the Room but she Preesoner and my sell. Then Sir she sate her sell o' my Knee, and said what wull ye gi us to Neet. I said I dinna maiter an I gi her anything, an I cud do any thing toll her, but at that preesent Time d'na care to be consairn'd wi' her. Then she laid herself on the Beed and said my Breeches hurted her, and so she put her Hand doon, and pulloot my Watch and knock'd, and Batty cam up tull her. Hanah quo 'I, what mean ye by sairving me so? Ye ha' tacken my Watch and it coast me five Punds. Haudyer Peace quo' she and be easy, be easy, canno' ye be easy - No I canno' be easy till I ha' my Watch again for it coast me five Punds.

Troath ha' ye, quo' I, for I felt ye, when ye tuck it awa, and I wonna' pairt wi' it so for it coast me five Punds. Then she said I might sairch her, but I thought she hanno' got it aboot her, and so I want to sairch the Beed, and upo' that she run away, and tumbled doon Stairs: And I ran a'ter her but she got up again, and run cross the wa, and knock'd at a Door. I follow'd her, she cry'd Murder, and I said she had roab'd me of my Watch, that coast me five Punds. Then she tuck me to an Alehouse the Hoarse-shoe and Rummer in Drury-Lane, where I told the Landloard that she had pack'd my Pocket. But I seed he and she Laughing togaither, whuch made me a leetle jeelous that he wau'd no' tack careo' my Watch, that coast me five Punds. Then in came a Man and said, what d'ye do wi'my Wife, ye Dug? Troath, Sir, quo, an she be yer Wife, she has Stole my Watch that coast me five Punds. Wi' that the Preesoner dinged a Pint of Beer in my Face, and run awa, and I wud a' run a'ter her, but the Man wunna lat me.

               <p>Prisoner. He gave me the Watch to lie with me, and because I would neither humour him that way, nor return the Watch, he said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173402270014"></xptr> would swear a Robbery! against me - Pray ask him if I took it without his knowledge.</p>

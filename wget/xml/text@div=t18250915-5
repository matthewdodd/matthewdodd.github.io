On the 22d of July, about half-past ten o'clock, the prisoners came into the shop - Godfrey asked if I had a silver watch to sell; I said Mr. Tupman would be down directly, and wished them to wait for him to serve them; he had gone up to shew the lodgings to a gentleman: they waited. I went on with my work at the end of the counter; they stood talking together. I heard a rustling over the glass-case, and turned round once or twice, and saw them leaning over the glass-case on the counter. I saw them both tapping on the counter, and saying, "This is a fine thing," and "That is pretty" - apparently to divert my attention. Mr. Tupman came down, and they asked him for a gold hunter - he said he had none to sell, and they went out of the shop, and before they passed the window I turned round, looked on the counter, and observed two brooches, which had been taken out of the glass-case - I made some remark to Mr. Tupman; he looked into the glass-case, and missed this property. The prisoners had not completely passed the window at that time. I ran out after them, and on looking down the first turning the street-keeper beckoned to me; I did not overtake them. I missed a gold snuffbox, worth twelve guineas, a gold engine-turned case and dial, and a gold French watch worth 5 l. or 6 l., which I had seen laying on the glass-case not half a minute before the prisoners came in. All of them being the largest articles I had observed them; I do not know the value of the case and dial: my eyes were occasionally off them when I was at work. I never saw them doing any thing, but the last time I looked at them I thought I heard something<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150007"></xptr>drop. The glass-case has no fastening, and can easily be lifted up</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. At what time did you breakfast? A. About eight o'clock - I have my breakfast at the back of the shop. I kept my eyes upon them after I heard something fall. I had never seen them before. I saw them in custody at Bow-street that evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The gentleman did not take the lodging? A. No. I saw the goods after he left the shop; no other person was in the shop while they were there. I had not left the shop all that morning, and do not recollect any other persons calling that morning. I am the only shopman.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The gentleman who looked at the lodgings had been in the shop? A. Yes, my Lord, but he did not come into the shop after going up stairs; I am certain that I saw them safe after he had left the shop. I saw the prisoners at the office that afternoon; they were then both in different dresses.</p>
               <p>JAMES JEREMIAH TUPMAN. I keep this shop, and occupy the house: it is in the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury. On the 22d of July I came down, and saw the prisoners in the shop - I never saw them before, but am certain of their persons; I had been shewing the upper part to a person, whom I let out at the private door, and then came into the shop at the front door. Godfrey asked if I had a second-hand gold hunter; I met him full in the face; I said, "No, I have not;" as they passed the window going out, my young man said something - I immediately saw two gold brooches laying on the counter, near the glass-case - I pushed away a book which I had left over the glass-case, and immediately missed this property, which cost me about 26 l. 16 s.; it was there two or three minutes before, when I left the shop. The gentleman who came about the lodging was not near the counter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. When you came down stairs you found two persons there? A. Yes. The counter runs along the shop. I am positive of their persons. I have recovered none of the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You never saw them before? A. Never. My house is three doors from George-street - I am rated in St. George's parish.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you take upon yourself to swear that your house is not in St. Giles's? A. Only that I am rated in the books of St. George's; I pay rates to St. George's. The collector receives for both parishes.</p>

            . I am street-keeper of Russell-street. I always understood the prosecutor's house to be in St. George's parish. On the 22d of July, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners coming in a direction from Mr. Tupman's shop, down George-street; they walked at first, and then started off running, as if they were racing together; they ran down George-street, and into Bainbridge-street. I am positive of them both.</p>

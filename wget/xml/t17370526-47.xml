               <p>John Ayres. Killcup was convicted last sessions for stealing this Lead; he inform'd me where it was sold, and went with me to Birch's House, and ask'd for it, Birch's Wife at first deny'd it, and told me her Husband should come to me about it In the Afternoon; but instead of coming himself, his Apprentice and a Woman came and perswaded me not to give him Trouble. When he was taken up, he confessed he bought it, and told me 'twas his Method, when he bought such Things, to cut them to Pieces and carry them away; then he inform'd me where he had sold this, and beg'd I would not prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he give for it?</p>
               <p>Ayres. A Penny a Pound.</p>
               <p>Juryman. That's pretty near the Market Price.</p>
               <p>Ayres. He begg'd I would not prosecute him, and said, he had but just got out of such another troublesome Affair.</p>
               <p>Spencer Burges. When the Prisoner was taken up, he own'd he had bought the Lead, and said, he was sorry he had done such a Thing, and begg'd he might not be prosecuted, and he told us further, that whenever he bought any Thing in this Way, he always got rid of it as soon as he could.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Ayres hir'd that Man for a Shilling to swear against me. My Wife bought the Lead, I know nothing at all of it.</p>

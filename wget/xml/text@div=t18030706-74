               <p>Q. Have you a father living? - A. Yes, and his name is Jeffery.</p>

               <p>Q. What have you to say against the prisoner? I lost my black mare on the 15th of June; I left her in my own stable, about ten o'clock at night, I missed her on Wednesday morning the 15th, about four o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q.Have you ever seen her since? - A. Yes; I have her at home now, at work, a neighbour of mine found her in Smithfield, for sale, on the Friday following.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the mare worth? - A.Five or six pounds to me, or rather more.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL STOCKWELL sworn. - Q. Where do you live? - A.At Walworth.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of East's mare? - A. Yes; I drove her for him, I worked for him then.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you find his mare? - A. I went on Friday to Smithfield, to buy a pig, and saw the mare tied alongside a horse for sale; I asked the price, the man said, five guineas and a half; I said, she is a stolen mare; he said, his master was down there; I went to him, and told him the same; he said, if she is stolen, I should be glad for the owner to have her, and said, he should be agreeable to send her home; I went to Sell directly, and said it was stolen; he said, he bought her on Saffron-hill; he gave me the mare and I sent her home; I knew her to be the same mare; the stable was broke open, and the mare stolen out.</p>

               <p>Q. You had no conversation with the prisoner? - A. No.</p>

               <p>HENRY SELL sworn. - Q. You were at Smithfield-market, and met Stockwell there? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You delivered him a black mare? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Who brought the mare to market? - A. The prisoner, I bought it of him.</p>

               <p>Q. What day of the month? - A. The 16th.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060052"></xptr>Q. Did he say where he brought her from? - A. He said, he bought her; he asked me three guineas for it; I said, it was too much for my use; I asked him to walk it along about twenty yards. I thought it might do a little work, and I gave him three pounds, about twelve o'clock on Thursday.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say where he had it from? - A.He said, he gave two pounds fifteen shillings for it, and said, he was incapable of keeping it; he said, he had just bought it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing more about it? - A. No, we had a glass a-piece to drink, and parted.</p>

               <p>Q.Where did you buy it of him? - A. On Saffron-hill, and paid the money at the Whitehorse public-house.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is that from Smithfield? - A. Hardly half a mile.</p>

               <p>Q.How came you to part with the mare so early, when Stockwell challenged it? - A. I bought it on Thursday, and sent my man to the market with it, and told him to ask four guineas and a-half for it; I went to the market, and the person was leading her about; I asked him what he was bid for it; he said, three guineas and a half.</p>

               <p>Q.Why did you sell it again? - A. To get half a guinea by it; I bought it for that purpose; I told him, if he could get four pounds for it, to let it go.</p>

               <p>Q.How came you to part with it so readily? - A. I have got four or five more; about half an hour afterwards, I was in the middle of the market, and my man came looking for me, and said, the mare was owned; owned, said I, that cannot be; yes, said he, it is, and Stockwell came up to me, and said, it is stolen; I said, I honestly bought it; I said, is it your's; no, he said, it is my neighbour's; a mob began stocking round; he said, he would not stop there; we went over to the Lock and Key public-house, and had some ale; he gave me his address, and the mare was taken home.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Stockwell.) Were you by when your master bought the horse? - A. No, I saw nothing of it till the Friday.</p>

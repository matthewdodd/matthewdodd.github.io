I rent half the house of the landlord, who does not live in it. - The room which was broken open is on the first floor - in which I heard a noise about half-past eight o'clock on the night of the 18th of January, - it was something like a chair falling in the room under me, as I was in the second floor. I took the light in my hand, and went down; I found the prisoner standing at the door of the first floor room, which was broken open; it was the door of the room where the noise came from; I asked what he wanted - he seemed flurried, and said, "Does Mr. Thompson live here?" seeing the door open I immediately collared him, and said, "I'll Thompson you." He then struck me a violent blow on the left eye, which was black for a fortnight; I struck him again, and we had a hard fight together on the stairs, from the landing to the bottom - when we got to the bottom some one opened the outer door - I did not see the man who opened it, for he escaped. I kept hold of the prisoner, got into the street, and called out Murder! when several people came to my assistance, and took him to the watch-house. I then went back with the officers to examine the premises, having left the street door on the latch. The prisoner must have entered through the front door. About half an hour before I heard the noise I went down to see if the children were asleep, and I put out the light and went up in the second floor again to work, leaving the two children fast asleep. I knew the street door was on the latch. I found the bed clothes and pillow had been removed from the bed, but I missed nothing from the place; the bed clothes were drawn aside, and part lay on the floor, and part remained on the bed. The counterpane and all together had been partly pulled off; the children were in another bed in the same room; I cannot exactly swear whether the pillow was on the floor or not. The prisoner had no right to be in my house.</p>

            . I heard the cry of Murder! about half-past eight o'clock, near the Fighting Cocks public-house, in St. John-street, and about one hundred yards from Curry's house; I saw the prosecutor laying on his back, and the prisoner punching him as hard as he could. I immediately took hold of him, and threw him on his back.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and took the prisoner to the watch-house - I was the officer of the night - I also conveyed him from one watch-house to another. I went to inspect the premises, when I found the lock of the room had been forced from its place, and part of the bed clothes were withdrawn from the bed; there was a hat found on the premises, and when I went the next morning I asked the prisoner whether it was his - he said, "Yes, that's mine" - he had no hat on when taken.</p>
               <p>ROBERT FOWLS. I am a special constable. I was sent for by Reid, to assist in removing the prisoner from the town watch-house to the green watch-house; after I had put him into the latter I went with Curry to examine the premises; upon examination I found the catch of the door had been forced - a small knife might have done it, it was so weak. I have had the hat in my possession ever since it was found.</p>

This is the way bill of the train No. 13—there was only one registered article of luggage by that train on 19th Jan.—this is the way bin that refers to that register—there was only one piece of luggage, No. 28—according to this way bill, it ought to have been No. 28—on this bug here is a "2" and an "8"—I delivered this ticket to the person who had the luggage registered—here is a red mark chalked on this bag; that is the mark usually pat on registered luggage—at that time of year we were five or six days exhausting the numbers from 1 to 80.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landing waiter and searcher at the Custom House, at Newhaven. I produce a book of the entry of two packages—this entry satisfies me that I examined two packages in the name of Lenden, on Sun<lb></lb>day morning, 20th Jan.—the packages were opened by some one for me, and I examined them—I have the name of Lenden, because the person who claims the packages gives his name—as soon as the luggage is examined, I have nothing more to do with it—I make no distinction of registered or unregistered luggage—after I have done with it, it is delivered to the person from me—he may take it from the counter if he pleases—after that, persons may take registered luggage in the railway themselves.</p>

               <p>letters; amongst the rest was this, which is Lenden's letter, dated Chester 6th Feb., stating the loss of his bag—this ticket was enclosed in it—I received other letters beside—this is a letter written by Mr. Slight, secre<lb></lb>tary to the Brighton Railway, dated 15th, 2nd, 1856—it was found at the prisoner's lodging, and on it is a copy of this letter—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated "Chester, Feb. 23, 1856: To London, Brighton, and South Cocast Railway," describing the carpet bag and contents; signed "Lenden</hi>")—every inquiry was made, and letters passed between us—I eventually received a list of the things, and the prices annexed—the sum he demanded of me was 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he demanded that in one of his letters—I afterwards saw the prisoner, and he demanded it personally—I had a conversation with him—I cannot recollect the first day I saw him—it was about the middle of March he came to me, and told me what his name was, and what his business was—he said, "My name is Lenden; I have received letters from you which I have replied to; I come to speak about them"—I unfolded the letters and the ticket, and he said, "That ticket was the ticket I enclosed, and those were the letters I sent"—these are the letters I showed him in my office, and he said, "These are my letters"—one is 6th Feb., another 23rd Feb., 3rd March, 6th March, 12th March, and 16th March—this one contains a list of the articles, and the amount—it is signed, "Lenden," and directed to Henry Pearson Maples, Esq.—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Sir, with reference to your letter of the 15th, I beg to send you the list of the contents of my carpet bag, with the value thereof.

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">police inspector, Brighton Railway</hi>). I was first spoken to about this matter on 15th March—I did not go into it till 15th or 16th March—I received some information, which induced me to go, on 17th April, to a beer shop in King William-street, where this bag was ultimately discovered—while I was there, a person came for Dr. Lenden's luggage—it was refused—the application was made the next morning, and the same application was made the next evening at 5 o'clock, and refused—I was in the house when the person came and made the application—he left, and went out when he got his answer, and I went out too—I went twenty or thirty yards, and saw the prisoner's head peeping round the wall of the steps leading down to Thames-street—the person who had applied for the bag went to him, and insisted on his going to give an order to the persons to have his luggage delivered—the prisoner stood for a minute, and the person said, "Come along," and he followed him into the beer shop, and told the landlord to let the gentleman have his goods—he was then going out, but I stopped him, and told him I wanted to speak to him up stairs in his room—I told him I was a police officer—he said, "Very well"—he went up into his room—I followed him, and told him I came respecting his having obtained 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the Brighton Railway Company, under pretence of his having lost this bag (<hi rend="italic">pointing to it</hi>)—I told him he need make no reply unless he chose, as I should most likely have to repeat it—he immediately said, "Oh, that is the way the railway people pay persons for the lose of their property"—I took the bag, turned it up, and showed him the bottom—I said, "This is the French ticket from Paris"—I pointed out to him the portions of the figures, which I told him were the remains of No. 28—he said, "That bag never was in Paris with me"—I also found this other little bag, with this strap t it—I said that he had passed through the Custom House at Newhaven, and there were entries there of his having passed through the Custom House with two bags—a gentleman who was there told him to say nothing—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am ten years old; I live with my father in Craven-street, Strand. I recollect the prisoner coming to our house in Jan.—it was on the day before we were to go to school—I do not remember the day—it was about the middle of Jan.—I have seen this paper before (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>), it was sent to my papa after I went to school—I came home from school before Christmas—we were to have six weeks' holidays—we were to go to school on a Wednesday—the day we were to go to school the prisoner came—he asked if I was going to school, and if not he asked if he should come and teach me private lessons in the house—he said if my mamma would give him a room he would teach me and my two sisters—that was agreed to by my mamma—he went down to Hoddesden on Tuesday—he said he was going to get his things, and he would come back on Wednes<lb></lb>day—I had known him before—he was the French master at Hoddesden—he came on the Wednesday—I saw this bag on the Thursday, the day he began to teach us—I was in the room every day, he used to keep this bag on the sofa in the room—it was a bag exactly like this—I have handled it, I used to take the things out of this bag, and put them on the table for him—he taught me in his room—I saw the bag a good while; while he was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you able to say positively whether this is the bag? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is exactly like it—he had a portmanteau with him—I did not see that he had a small bag with swaps—he brought his things in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he came about 9 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I am a German. The prisoner is not a German—I have known him since 1849, or 1850—I was in Paris on 18th, 19th, or 20th Jan. last—I saw the prisoner, and spoke to him—it was through me that he came to London—I had no particular business with him—I recollect the time at which he left Paris—I accompanied him to the railway station at Paris—I had heard him say the evening before that he wanted to buy himself a travelling pocket for his journey; by a travel<lb></lb>ling pocket I mean a carpet bag—I offered to lend him my travelling pocket—I lent it him—I call this (<hi rend="italic">looking at the carpet bay</hi>) a travelling pocket—this is not the one I lent him, it was a similar one to this—I took it to the railway station—I saw the prisoner had several of his packages in his dress<lb></lb>ing gown doubled up, clasped together—I helped him to put them into the bag—the bag was not quite fall; not over full—after the things were put into the carpet bag, he locked it, and the prisoner himself gave it to the <hi rend="italic">employé</hi> who received it at the railway—the prisoner had my bag, and another beside it, and a courier's bag round his neck—he registered only one bag, the bag</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140306"></xptr>
               <p>I had lent him—that is not the bag that I lent the prisoner—this is not mine—my bag was as large as this, or nearly so—it was in squares of a lighter colour—it had three pockets, and two divisions inside.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A distiller and farmer—I have distilled in France, Belgium, and Germany—I am not established in any business—I get money sent from home, at Stettin—it is one year and eight months since I was in Stettin—I have received money from home during that time—I received a letter from the son of the prisoner, and through that I knew he was in Paris—I was in Valenciennes when I received the letter through the prisoner—I wanted to come to London, in hopes of getting something to do in the distillery—I was living in Paris, in Rue d'Amsterdam, near the railway—I do not know the number, it was 20 or 30—I lived alone—I was a lodger—I do not know the name of the persons I lodged with—I lodged with them two days—the prisoner was lodging in the Rue de la Paix—I remained two days after 19th Jan.—I then went to Valenciennes—I do not know exactly when I arrived in London; either in March or April—the prisoner fetched me from the station when I arrived, and took me to the public house where the things were found—I could pay my lodging at the public house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear that the landlord did not detain what little you had for payment of the lodging in King William-street, and that he did not say that he would turn you out of the house unless you paid, and then the prisoner became security for you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the arrears that there was—the evening before the prisoner was taken, the landlord threatened to keep my things, to pay, the arrears—I was not the person who went twice to the house in King William-street to ask for the prisoner's things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear that you did not go to that house on 17th April, and demand Lenden's things, and were they not refused you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know the dates—on the day before the apprehension of the prisoner, I took a letter to the house and demanded London's things—I did not go again on the morniog of the 18th—the carpet bag I lent to the prisoner was the only one I had—I had a courier's pocket besides—I was before the Magistrate when the prisoner was examined—I have been to Newgate every day to see him—I am now living over Westminster-bridge—I do not know the name of the street—I do not know the name of the person I am living with.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When before the Magistrate, was any attorney appearing for the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I know of—I do not know that any one pot any questions to the witnesses for him—when the prisoner was at the rail<lb></lb>way he had one carpet bag registered—he took the other with him into the railway carriage, and also a pocket that he had on his shoulder—I hardly know what he had in the carpet bag that he took into the railway carriage, but he had some dirty linen, which he took out of my bag and put in his.</p>

               <p>He could prove—I heard the Magistrftte say he should send the prisoner for trial, and, not knowing what the witness could prove; I did not think it prudent to call him.</p>

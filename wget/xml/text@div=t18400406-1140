                  </hi>. I am a milk-man, and live in Elizabeth-street, Pimlico. The prisoner bad been in my employ for four or five years, to look after my cows, and to go out with milk—I had this tin box (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) in my parlour—it contained money, amongst which was four sovereigns, to my knowledge—he was in and out of the parlour and the shop, and could have access to this box—I lost it on the 1st of March, but I did not miss it till the policeman brought me some papers which had been in it—I had kept the box locked with a brass padlock—it was broken open, and all the money gone—the prisoner had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and his board, lodging, and washing—he left me without notice.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty in Hyde-park, about half-past eleven o'clock on the 1st of Match, and found this tin cash box concealed behind some fencing round a tree—I took it, and found some papers which enabled me to trace the prosecutor—there was no money in the box—I was in search of the prisoner, but did not find him till the 27th of March.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on the 27th of March, in the Broad-way, Westminster—I took him to his master, he then said he took the box from his roaster's, that he took it into the park, and wrenched the lock off, and had spent part of the money in baying clothes in Westminster—I took him to the place he described, and they identified the coat and boots he had' on as having been bought there.</p>

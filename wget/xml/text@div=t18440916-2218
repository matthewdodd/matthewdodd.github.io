                  </hi>. I am a broker, and live in James-street, Marl<lb></lb>borough-road, Chelsea. I had a warrant, which I produce, given to me by Mr. Colchester, with which, on the 6th of September, about eight o'clock in the morning, I went to the house where the prisoners lived, in Colchester-terrace, Old Brompton (I had been there a week before, to reason with them, to see if I could not persuade them to leave the house quietly without using other means—I was not able to do so, all I got from them was abusive lan<lb></lb>guage) a female was entering the house with some bread, and I went in after her—Johnson was with me—immediately the gate was open I went up to the street-door—Johnson stopped at the outer gate to prevent their locking it—there is a front garden to the house—the door was opened to let the female in, and I pushed in behind her—directly we got in the two prisoners came up from below with two very thick sticks, something like broom handles—I showed them my warrant, and told them I had a warrant to distrain upon their goods for Mr. Colchester, for rent—they said they knew that I had been about the premises a long time trying to get in, and now I had got in they</p>

               <p>would well pay me for getting in, or words to that effect—they imme<lb></lb>diately struck me on the head with a stick—they attempted to force me out first, but finding they could not do so, Johnson pushing me in behind, they then struck me several times—William struck me on the head with an iron bar—David was close behind him then—this is the bar and sticks—David had this stick—William had the iron, and their father came up behind them with this other stick—a warrant is out for the father, but he has not been taken—they told us if we did not go out immediately they would have our lives—I said it was no good their going on in this manner, I was only come there in the execution of my duty; they had much better let me take the in<lb></lb>ventory, and see what terms they could come to with Mr. Colchester, but they seemed quite outrageous, and struck me several times with one of these sticks, one of them struck Johnson a violent blow on the head, and he went away, and left me there—they then dragged me down in the passage by the hair of my head, and beat me several times about the body, ribs, and loins with these sticks—I could not get out—I was screaming, "Murder" as loud as I could—there was a mob round the door—they had fastened the door after Johnson went—I was left to their mercy—I begged of them not to ill-use me—they broke my hat all to pieces with striking me on the head—if it had not been for my hat I must have had my brains knocked out almost—after talking to them some time, one of them left to go down after the father, who had gone down for something—I got into the parlour, talking to the others—I got my inventory out, and they partly destroyed it—the father came up, and from what he said, induced them to be more violent than before—one of them hal<lb></lb>looed out, "Bring down the Turk's knife, and we will cut the b—'s throat"—I screamed out, "Murder" again as loud as I could—the father came up, hear<lb></lb>ing the cry for the knife—one of them brought it down—I think it was David—I begged and prayed them to let me be, and the father said, "No, that is going too far, such means as that; give me the knife"—they both let go of me, and struggled with the father to get the knife away from him—I went up stairs, threw up the window, and cried, "Murder" as loud as I could—some persons were outside—Johnson was gone for a policeman—he was gone something like half-an-hour—when I came down I was struck by William, at the foot of the kitchen stairs, and a blow on the top of the head on the left side, which rendered me insensible—when I came to my<lb></lb>self, in about a quarter of an hour, I was over in the garden of the next house—I did not consult any doctor—I bathed my loins with salt and cold water, and my head with warm water—I was cut in the head—the skin was broken considerably, and bled very much—I bled from the nose and mouth—I was in a very exhausted state all the week, and am now suffering severely from a pain across my loins, which I feel very much if I sit down—I can scarcely draw my breath at times.</p>

On Friday morning, the 6th of Sept., at ten minutes to eight o'clock, I went to answer our bell, and saw a man stand<lb></lb>ing at the end of our gate, about twelve feet from our house—my curiosity was rather excited—I walked to the gate, to ask him his business, and as I did so, he walked round the corner, crossed the road to No. 2, and shook the railing—as he did so, a smaller man appeared at No. 1—I should know them both again—(<hi rend="italic">looking at Spicer and Johnson</hi>)—they are the men—about a minute after Johnson's shaking the railing he got over, and at the same time Spicer got over No. 1, passed the kitchen window of No. 1, and <hi rend="italic">perched</hi> him<lb></lb>self up at No. 2—there is a party-wall and railing between the houses—I saw these men get over, and as they got over, the door of No. 2 opened about the space of a quarter of a yard—Spicer was then <hi rend="italic">perched</hi> up on the railings of No. 2—as soon as the door was opened, he jumped down on the threshold of No. 2, and endeavoured, with his back against the door and his right hand against the partition, to force his way in—his left hand and leg was inside the door—his foot and arm seemed to be inside—I do not know who had opened the door—I think there was a chain up, which prevented the door from opening any further, but I think there was sufficient room for Spicer to pass through, for he seemed to slip through—I saw Johnson on the threshold of the door, holding on by the knocker, and calling, "Murder"—he held the door, and completely jammed Spicer in it—I saw Spicer get in by some means, and Johnson pulled the door to—he took up a stick and his own hat, apparently, and came across the railing screaming "Murder" all the way—he asked some man to help him, but he would not, and he ran round Gloucester-grove West, screaming, "Murder"—the policeman came a different way,</p>

               <p>and in three or four minutes, (by the time I had shut my door, and got up to the drawing-room window,) William Rogers appeared on the steps, and said, "If you want your man, you will find him at No. 4"—and as he spoke the words, out came Spicer from No. 4—he did not stop for the landlady's opening the gate, but leaped across, and said, "I will give that man in charge"—he came over the back walls, and came running out, I should say in three minutes after he had got in—if I said four I should be on the outside—it excited great laughter, for he was no sooner in the house than he was out again at the back—Wil<lb></lb>liam Rogers sung out, "Don't come here again"—he threw the stick and hat over the railings, and said, "Put on your hat, or you will get cold; and if any man comes let Mr. Colchester come"—Johnson was not in the house at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see Mrs. Colchester? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she was there when the prisoner said, "You will find the man coming out of No. 4"—she came with a key to open the gate; but he would not stop for that—he came across—he did not stop and speak to Mrs. Colchester—William Rogers did not say to her, "If you want your man you will find him in the next yard, for we have put him over the wall"—I swear that—I am servant to Mr. Ma<lb></lb>lin, who is a clerk in the Secretary of State's office—I have lived there two or three months—I do not often see the prisoners—I never spoke to any of the family—I did not see William brandish a sword—I can swear he did not do so all day long—he never came to the door, nor yet to the window, from the time the house was shut—they kept the blinds down and shut the shutters up—at half-past five o'clock in the afternoon there were from fifteen to twenty men collected about the window, and about half-past six they opened it and asked what they wanted—they did not show the sword, or sharpen it, or any<lb></lb>thing of the kind—I did not know that the Rogers's were all at hide and seek—I never saw the eldest prisoner before this—there is no brick wall opposite our house—from the window I can see the front of Rogers's house—I am a ser<lb></lb>vant of all work—I am about my work in the day-time—there was no other disturbance—it was to Johnson that William Rogers said, "If you want your man you will find him coming out of No. 4"—Johnson ran and fetched a policeman—he called, "Police, murder," and the man on duty came up—I suppose the door was open enough for the little man to get in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a one-horse fly-master. On Friday morning, the 6th of Sept., just before the clock struck eight, I saw the prisoners, and saw a man go by my house, <hi rend="italic">singing</hi> out for a policeman—I cannot swear it was Johnson, but to the best of my opinion he is the man—I did not hear the prisoner say anything to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sister to the prisoners. I was at my father's house on Friday morning the 6th of Sept.—I saw Johnson come to the gate, and shake it—my mother went down to him, and he gave her a copy of a writ—I did not hear what took place between them, but I saw him give something to my mother at the gate—he was outside the gate—the door is about ten feet from the gate—he did not come up to the door—about five minutes afterwards Johnson came to the gate again—I was going up to tell my mother that he was come to the gate again, and when I got up I saw that the door was being pushed open—there was no woman at the door—my mother was in the passage—nobody had come in—there was nobody outside to come in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did the door get open then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My brother went up behind the door to open it—my brother opened it with the chain first, and then closed it again—no servant came in at that time—my brother closed the door again after he had opened it with the chain, and somebody outside forced it open again—no</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184409160012"></xptr>
               <p>one had got in before the door was closed—the man outside forced the door open again after it was closed—the lock was not broken—the first time the door was opened by the chain was to let my mother down, to go to speak to this man at the gate—she did not go outside at that time—as soon as my brother opened the door, he shut it again—the first time she went down, she came up again, and the door was closed—the men did not follow her in at that time—it was five minutes after that they came again to the gate—the men did not follow my mother in—the first time the men came to the gate, she came down stairs and showed this copy of the writ to my father—my father was there the first time—the second time, when the door was partly opened, and I heard the scuffle, my father came up, when the men were outside the door; but directly he heard the door open an inch, he was out of the house—he went out at the back door—I did not see where he went to—when Spicer got in he struck my brother—my father was not present during any part of the disturbance between Spicer and my brother—I was present all the time till my brother took Spicer out of the back yard door—my father was not present during any of that time—my brother led Spicer through the back door—he held his arms down—he did not appear to be senseless during that time—I did not see how he got over the wall—I went down stairs when they got as far as the yard door—the door was latched at the time it was forced in—I saw the latch catch—I was close behind the door at that time I suppose—it was lifted by Spicer forcing the door from outside—it was forced back, I suppose—the latch was not broken—it does not lift from the outside—the latch has not been used since we have been in the house—we have been there four years.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Colchester-terrace, Old Brompton, next door to Rogers'. On Friday morning, the 6th of Sept., shortly before eight o'clock, I saw Mr. Rogers in the back premises, passing from his house, across mine—it is a very easy matter to cross over—there is a hedge at the end of the garden—I was hurt to see him, and said, "Rogers, come in"—he said, "No, no"—there is a wall between the next house, six feet high, and he went over it—I was surprised to see a man of his age make the attempt—there was nothing on the top of that wall—it was even—I saw his hands very plain—I was close to him—prior to this I was in my front garden, and saw the witness Johnson come to the gate of No. 2—he looked round, and said, "Is this Mr. Rogers's?"—I said, "Yes, shake the gate"—he shook the gate, and Mrs. Rogers came out of the house, down her steps, to the outer gate—Johnson said, "I have a copy of a writ for Mr. Rogers"—he delivered it, and she said, "Very well"—I then went in doors, and in a few minutes after I heard a bustle in the passage next door, and it was then, in coming up the stairs, I saw Mr. Rogers come out and go over the wall—he never returned—he went clear away from the house—there was no glass on the wall he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184409160013"></xptr>
               <p>went over—I perceived him distinctly, and his hands were as clean as mine are—I did not observe any blood on them—on the second or third wall from this there is glass—I have seen it from my own window—if he went over two or three more walls he would come to the glass—he could not get clear away after getting over the six-foot wall—he must have got over three or four walls, but I did not see him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was there to prevent his getting into the road without going over so many walls? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If he had gone in front towards the road, he would have gone into the midst of a number of people who were assembled along the road—it appeared to me that he endeavoured to avoid them—there is a nursery-ground at the back—there are about a dozen houses in the row—my wall leads to Gloucester-cottage—if he had gone through a quickset hedge he could have got away—I thought he would have preferred that, but was surprised to see him take to the wall—I saw Spicer, about four or six minutes afterwards, come out of No. 4, which is an empty house—I did not see what had happened to him—I saw his hat on the steps of No. 2—I could not see in what state it was, or whether it was beaten through—it appeared like my own, not beaten, unless anybody had trodden on it—when the prisoner Wil<lb></lb>liam came out of his own door, he said, "Throw that man his hat"—it was thrown to him, and then it might have been knocked about—there was a dreadful crowd, and one of them remarked, "Poor fellow, he is showing his head, but he does not know which side has been beaten; he has absolutely shown the wrong side."</p>

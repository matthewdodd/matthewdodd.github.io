On 7th July, about 7 o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in company with two other men, in the Fairing<lb></lb>don Road—a mob had assembled there round a horse which had fallen down—I saw the prisoner take off his overcoat and place it over his arm, so as to cover his hand—he then went amongst the crowd—I saw Mrs. Coutts standing by the horse's head—I saw the prisoner place himself on the right hand side of Mrs. Coutts, and place his left arm in her dress pocket—the other men were by his side, covering him—Emery was with me—I saw him seize the prisoner, and I pursued another man, and took him—the prisoner was taken to the station—nothing was found on him—he gave an address, which I found to be incorrect.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect at any time seeing the prisoner - A. Yes; I saw him on Whitsunday night, between ten and eleven o'clock; I was going home; I had been to Stepney.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were you to your own door - A. I was just upon the steps, I was going to open the latch of the door to walk in; this man pushed me and took the watch out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he push you - was he walking along - A. That I do not know. I was just going in doors; he gave me a push and took the watch out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where he came from - A. He came of my side with one hand and pushed me on the left breast; I take it to be his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know what it was, only that there was something pushed you - A. Yes; and then took the watch out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel your watch go - A. Yes; it was in my watch pocket; he got hold of the chain, turned round and began to run.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you - A. No, he did not. I halloaed out stop thief, and ran behind him. The watchman as he came along fell down; he got away. Mr. Griffiths, the officer, took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. Yes; he has walked about my door many times in the day; I know him by sight. I have never seen my watch since. It was a silver watch; I had it three years; I gave four guineas and a half for it; there was a chain, seal, and a little hook to it.</p>
               <p>- GRIFFTHS. On Monday the 22nd of May, I received information of the prosecutor being robbed of his watch, and by the description I found the prisoner at the Star, in Mount-street, where he lodged; I told him I took him in custody for robbing a man in Wentworth-street. I took him to the office, and the prosecutor came and swore to him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the crime. I was at Epsom races; I was not in town that night till half after twelve; Mr. Griffiths took me out of the public house, he said for a highway robbery; I said I would go immediately, I was innocent of the robbery; the gentlemen has sworn falsely.</p>

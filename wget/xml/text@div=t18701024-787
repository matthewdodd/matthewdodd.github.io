                  </hi>. I live at 27, Tanley Hill, Wandsworth—in June last I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi> with reference to a business at Eagle Wharf, Wandsworth, in consequence of which I saw the prisoner at Eagle Wharf, on 21st June—he referred me to the books, as showing that he was doing a very good business there—Mr. Burt was present at the time, on my behalf—we met again on the following day—he showed us the plant and the stock—he said half of the wharf was leasehold sod half of it he represented as freehold—we called for the title deeds—he said he had none, that he had taken possession of it about four years ago, and that it had been held so previously by different parties, who had never paid any rent for it, and that no rent had been paid for it as long as the oldest man in Wandaworth could recollect, there had been no owner for it—he said the adjoining premises were held in a similar way—they were held by other persons—he said they paid no rent for theirs, and that he took possession of it in the same way—he said he had no liabilities what<lb></lb>ever, and he distinctly stated that Mr. Crossley, his late partner, had been settled with—this is the inventory which the prisoner gave me, made out and signed by him—(<hi rend="italic">This was an inventory of the stock, plant of property connected with the coal business at this wharf, amounting to</hi> 1360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—That was written out by the prisoner—I did not see him write it; it is signed by him—I know his signature—this is the deed of partnership which I entered into subsequently—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—I paid the prisoner 320<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before that was made out—after the inventory was signed, on the completion of the deed, I paid a further sum of 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 16th July, making 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., according to agree<lb></lb>ment—the prisoner said the waggon was at Smith's, the carriage builder;</p>

               <p>it was having the name painted on, and he would pay waggon hire while it was being done; it was such a small job, that Smith's, who were doing a large business, could not pay attention to such a small job as that—I made inquiries, and spoke to the prisoner; he promised to take me where the van was—he said there was 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due on the van, and it would not he delivered till that was paid—I have never found any van—the 170 ton of coals turned out to be only about thirty tons—the money in the bank was 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—if I had known all these things, and also that the land was not freehold, I would not have paid the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>under—a copy of the portion on the other side was shown to me before—I have not got it, I think my solicitor has, it was sent me in a letter by Mr. Bennett's agent, Mr. Sharp—it was after I had the inventory that I went over the wharf, and looked over the things mentioned in it—I found them all correct, except the waggon and the coals—170 tons is the quantity of coals mentioned in the inventory—it was prepared at the time Mr. Bennett was negotiating with me—it was given me as an inventory of what there was there at that time—I looked at the coals and said the quantity seemed small, and Mr. Bennett said, in answer, as the stock of coals decreased, the amount of outstanding accounts increased, and the amount at the bank would increase—I am not a judge as regards quantity—I could not tell how many tons there were there—I now there was not thirty tons, by the balance that has been made up since—we have since purchased so many tons, and sold so many, and the balance of the stock shows what quantity there was on the wharf at that time—since 4th July I have attended there every day—I did not solicit orders, Mr. Bennett did that—I attended to the business at the wharf—I was there July and August—I got very dissatisfied with the business—there were very few customers and very great complaints—my books are all here—Mr. Bennett reminded me that this was the very worst time of year for selling coals—I told him the business was not so flourishing as I expected, instead of selling 200 tons a week we were selling about twenty—one horse was sold, the other was let on hire—we got 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the one we sold—the money has not been paid by the buyer, a balance is owing—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been paid—Mr. Bennett let the other horse on hire previous to my coming there—I have not found any things on the wharf that are not mentioned in the inventory—there were some bricks there, not mentioned in it—they were then building the wall up, and putting up a pair of gates, on the piece of land of which he said he had possession—a portion of the wall has been finished, not completed altogether—the gates are up—he gave me a list of the outstanding accounts when I came up on 4th July—it was a separate list—I think I have a copy of it—I found a great many of them had been paid to him—I found that out from the parties themselves—I have not found that any' debts due to the firm were by mistake put into that account—this is the list—9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is represented as the amount—there are not half of those debts due—I have not heard of a Mr. Hayes who is not entered there—the Metropolitan Bank have paid nothing—Major de Rubini's name is down, but I can't hear anything of him—I was always there, and know every penny that has been paid in to our account—I got dissatisfied, and consulted Mr. Lewis, and then had the prisoner arrested on a warrant—he was taken that night, locked up all night, brought before the Lord Mayor, and has been in prison ever since—I have not been carrying on the business since—it was discontinued there and then—there was no coal to be sold—some of the accounts that were owing have been paid in; that is all that has been done—Mr. Bennett was to produce capital, 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to pay for stock, and he did not do it—there are no coals at the wharf now, nothing is done there—the stock was all disposed of previously—the plant is lying there now—the one horse is in a field—the barges and other things mentioned in the inventory are there—Mrs. Palmer has still got the piece of land; she has not taken possession of it—I have got the use of it—nobody attempts to disturb me—Mrs. Palmer applied for her rent—I referred her to Mr. Bennett—I have never been sued for the rent—Mr. Bennett is liable for it—there</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Messrs. Phillips &amp; Hill, iron merchants, Birmingham—as a friend of Mr. Phillips I saw the prisoner about this matter, before the partnership was commenced, on or about 21st June—I first saw Mr. Sharp, and after one or two interviews, we got to the prisoner—I made various inquiries, and asked to see the books—I was shown them—I looked round the place generally, and saw the principal items in the inventory, and was, on the whole, satisfied with the representa<lb></lb>tions that had been made—it looked like a <hi rend="italic">bonâ fide</hi> business—the first point upon which I had occasion to question Mr. Bennett was as to the ad<lb></lb>joining piece of land, which was represented as a very valuable asset—I asked whether it was leasehold or freehold, and to see the title-deeds—he said he had none—he explained that he held it under a possessory-right, and that he had held it so four years; it was no man's land, he held it under possession, and had not been disturbed for four years, and he also instanced the adjoining wharf, in the occupation of Mr. Ralph, a boat-builder—he said that was held in the same way—he further pointed to houses nearly opposite, which he said were so held, and the tenants had not paid any rent, and he felt so secure in his title, that he had refused an offer of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that piece of land; he further said that Mr. Ralph, his next door neighbour, also felt so secure in his holding, that he had directed expensive buildings upon it for the purposes of his trade—he also mentioned that he had offered the tenants of the premises nearly opposite small sums to go out, in order that he might enter into possession—those were the points of conversation, all tending to show that it was his absolute property, by possession—he was asked on another occasion, when Mr. Phillips was there, whether he had paid any rent, and he said he had never paid anything for it, neither had anyone else, that was the memory of the oldest inhabitant of Wandsworth, they never had any purchaser, they had lain for some years as a mere field, there was a sort of fence between his land and the next, and he had simply removed it—he said he had no liabilities—I presumed that to apply to himself, as he had no partner at the time, unless Mr. Fry was held a partner—it was mentioned previously that Mr. Crossley had been out—I wished to get at Mr. Crossley; but I was informed he had left Lon<lb></lb>don or gone into Some business; at all events he could not be found—</p>

                  </hi>. I am living at Bonner Road, Victoria Park—in December, 1869, in consequence of an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi> I went to a house in the Strand, and saw the prisoner there, in the presence of his agent—we had a conversation about the business at Eagle Wharf—he represented it as being capable of doing a good deal of business, and they gave some estimates, and so on, and I not knowing anything of the trade, naturally believed what was said—he said at that time they were doing a trade of sixty or seventy tons a week at present, and that it would be increased to 200 or 300 tons a week—he said the wharf was divided into two, one part of it was held at the low rent of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year for twenty-two or twenty-three years, and that the other was his own property; a piece of land valued at about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that should be taken as an asset; that he would assign me one-half of it on going into the business; that he would pay in 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as his share as well, if I would find the rest of the capital, 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received this letter of 23rd December (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "To Mr. Palmer. Dear sir,—in consideration of your paying into the partnership 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I hereby agree to hand to you an agreement, giving you a full share with me of the plot of ground, of which I hold possession, described as lying between Eagle Wharf and Mr. Ralph's, boat-builder, and to execute such agreement when called upon")—This is the agreement—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated 12th January,</hi> 1870, <hi rend="italic">and by it Bennett professed to assign to the witness an equal share in the property in question</hi>)—On entering into the articles of partnership I paid 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Fricker &amp; Davis, on the prisoner's behalf, and I afterwards paid in 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the Metropolitan Bank to the joint account—the prisoner gave 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I paid into the bank with mine—he said the piece of land was his own by possession—he said he had never paid any rent, or been asked for it—he said there was no owner for it but himself—I attempted to get out of the concern by sacrificing part of that which I had paid in, on purpose to get rid of him—I never got anything; I never received a shilling—the prisoner gave me two bills, which have never been paid—I made him a bankrupt—one bill was due on 11th June, and the other on 28th—they were both dishonoured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you quite sure he said, with reference to this land, that he had never paid any rent for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, quite sure—he said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187010240009"></xptr>
               <p>he bad rented the wharf, and there was a sort of broken down paling that was standing between the wharf and this piece of land, and there being no owner whatever for the piece of land he simply removed the fence, and took possession of it—we carried on anything but a flourishing business; I lost everything—something like 700 or 800 tons were sold between the beginning of January and the end of April—I don't consider that a good trade; it did not pay expenses—it was represented to me as a wonderful affair—I naturally expected at least 10 per cent, on the returns—I entered into negotiations with Mr. Sharp when I wanted to get out of it—I got thoroughly tired of it—I was not accustomed to the coal trade—I had been in the wholesale oil refining—I did not find that profitable—it fell off—I was in it about five or six years—I was also in the soap making trade from fifteen to twenty years—that was profitable—I did not leave the oil trade, it left me—I naturally took the first thing that offered—I would become a sweep if I could make money by it, or a solicitor if I could make money by it—before I paid the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I went over the wharf, and saw the plant—I only examined the books slightly at that time—I understand book-keeping—I did look into the books—I was not satisfied with him—I took their word for it—they showed me a statement of accounts drawn up by an accountant, and I, naturally thinking Bennett was the possessor of the land, and that he was about to pay in 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that would make his share almost equal to mine, I was disposed to believe that he said—at the time I left, at the end of March, I considered it might be made a profitable affair if more money was brought into it—I to represented to Mr. Sharp—I told him the available capital was 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said it was a promising place; if I was to deal in paving<lb></lb>stones, with plenty of capital, I could make it pay.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Brompton—I am an accountant, and have an office in the Strand—I formerly carried on business as a coal merchant with my brother, at this wharf; that was about three years ago—we did a very good business there—there are two strips of land running up from the river—one is a wharf—I had the piece of land, at that time, from a person named Shaw, and he had no power to grant a lease—I did not pay him any rent for it—Shaw was in possession of it, and he was our manager—I did not pay any rent because he would not grant me a lease—I never knew any rent paid for it—I have known the prisoner eight or nine years—I never knew anything against his character—I have always found him perfectly straightforward.</p>

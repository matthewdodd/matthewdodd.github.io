On the night of the 23d of July last, about a quarter past three in the morning, I heard the spring of a watchman's rattle, I got out of bed and went to the front window, I slid the window up and looked out, I saw the prisoner at the bar between two watchmen at the adjoining steps. No. 13; the watchman informed me they saw her come up from my area, with a large pan of salt beef; knowing I had such a thing in the house the night before, I desired them to keep the woman till I came down and examined the bottom part of the house; when I came down to the bottom part of the house I found the entrance of the area window to the house had been broke open, and two squares of glass had been broke into one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the wood work broke. - A. Yes, the centre piece of the wood that parts the two squares were broken.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any outside shutters to it. - A.None.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see that last on the evening before. - A. About eight or nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it perfectly secure, or a rotten frame. - A. It was a very good frame, and perfectly found the night before; I found likewise five pair of silk stockings gone, which laid in a bason in a pink dye, three pair of boys worsted stockings, a pair of boys shoes, a blacking brush, and a bottle in which blacking had been in, a saw, and the rims of an umbrella, all these things were below stairs in the lobby; there was a door to the kitchen, but that was not fastened.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose they could have got up stairs. - A. Yes, they might have gone to any part of the house whatever; about eight o'clock the next morning we found there was a flannel petticoat missing belonging to my wife, I went to the watchhouse and the constable found it on her.</p>
               <p>Q. When the watchman took the woman did you go to her. - A. Yes, I went to the watchman, and saw the woman with his property on her, except the petticoat, which was afterwards found at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of the prisoner before. - A. I saw her on a step of a gentleman's door in the same street, a week or a few days before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I want to know what you found upon me. - A. There were six pair of silk stockings we out of the dye, tied up under your petticoats.</p>

Yes, past three o'clock in the morning on the 24th of July, I saw the prisoner at the bar stand at the area gate No. 12, Parliament street, she was outside the railing when I first saw her, I saw her afterwards go down in that area, and she came up again almost directly; after she came up she removed something from the grating of the steps to the door No. 13, I directly went to see what she was doing of; when she saw me coming she ran away and left the things, I ran and laid hold of her and brought her back; when I came up to the door I saw this pan stand on the steps full of salt beef, with a white wash hand bason with three pair of silk stockings, three pair of worsted stockings, I blacking brush, and a pair of boys' shoes, an old umbrella frame and a saw she had got in her hand; I then sprang my rattle, which assembled several more watchmen and patrols, I called to Mr. Winsor, he came down and owned the things.</p>

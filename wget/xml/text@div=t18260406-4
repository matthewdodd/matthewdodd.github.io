On Thursday, the 30th of March, the prisoner came to the shop alone, and asked to see some lace edging - I shewed her some - she did not approve of it - I shewed her some more - she did not approve of them; and wanted to see some still broader, and while I was getting them I saw her take this card of lace from about half a dozen pieces, and put it under her shawl; I said nothing to her then; she took another card in her hand off the counter, and asked me the price, which I told her - she did not approve of it, and wanted to look at some which were in the window; I asked her to walk up the shop towards the window, and I would get it her if she would shew me what she wanted - she was about four yards from the door before she went to the window; I came from behind the counter, and went with her towards the window; the door was open; I could not understand which lace she wanted, and she was going out at the door - I then stopped her, closed the door, and told her she had a card of lace under her shawl - she said she had not; I drew her shawl back, shewed it to her, and told her to let it remain there till Mr. Orme, jun. came - he came, and I took it from her in his presence - he was in another part of the shop. Duke, the officer, came, and took her in charge, with the lace.</p>

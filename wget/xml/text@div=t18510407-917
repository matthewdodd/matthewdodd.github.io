Mr. Cohen, the Chaplain of the Compter—he was received for one month, and at the end of that time, I was to report his conduct, to see if he would be kept any longer—we have a shoemaker's shop, and on Saturday, 8th April, one of the inmates had finished three pairs of boots—the prisoner asked him to let him look at one pair—he gave them to him—the prisoner stepped into the next</p>

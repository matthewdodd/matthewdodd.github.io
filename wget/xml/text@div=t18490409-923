                  </hi>. I am errand-boy to Mr. Williams, a blacking-maker, in Newcastle-street, Farringdon-street. On 14th Marsh the prisoner I came to my master's for half a gross of two-ounce, and half a gross of three-ounce blacking—the prisoner gave his address, "Mr. Jones, Whitecross street"—my master gave me a bill and the goods—I was to go with the goods, and not to leave them without the money—when we got to King street, Smithfield, the prisoner said he saw his mistress, and she said I was to go to my master's for some pots—he wanted me to go back—I said I should wait—he said, "You sit down on the basket"—he went away, and I came again in about ten minutes, and said, "I have been to your master's, I and he says you may go for the pots; I will mind the basket"—I went to my master's, and he said no one had been there—I went back to where I left the prisoner, and he and the basket were gone—I saw him again about I three weeks afterwards—I asked him about it—he said he knew nothing I about it—he ran away; I got him again—he said he would walk quietly I with me, but I would not let him go.</p>

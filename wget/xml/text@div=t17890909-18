               <p>I saw the prisoner come out of our shop, I was standing at the door with my father, between the two houses; I was not so near the door the prisoner ran out of, as I was to the other; I was between four and five yards from the door.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner go into the house? - No, but I saw him come out tho'; the door was bolted when he came in, and when he was come out, I saw the door unbolted.</p>
               <p>How could he get in? - Because I had not my head that way, I told my father, and he went after the prisoner, and brought him back, I saw the breeches hanging on the back of a chair, before the prisoner ran out; I missed them afterwards, these are the breeches.</p>

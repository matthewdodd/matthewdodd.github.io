               <p>I am a servant to this gentleman, Mr. Davis; that young man had been watching me half an hour about the stall. I am of Italy, he watched me, I was in the stall; I thought in my head that Gentleman wants to steal something; afterwards I see him take sixteen dishes, and away he went: they were standing on the board, he took them off the board, and then ran away, and I followed, just where you cross the market to the bridge, I followed, but did not lose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150093"></xptr>sight of him; he put down the dishes in the open bridge, on the corner of the market; the Gentleman crossed the road, and I collared him, I took the dishes myself, and carried them back to the shop; and master did hold the man the mean time; there are the same dishes, they are my master's property.</p>
               <p>Jury. How far from your stall did he put down the dishes? - About six or seven yards, more or less, I did not measure it at all</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When he took hold of me at first, I had no more than I have at present in my hands, he came behind me and said I was a thief; there might be a dozen people about me. (The dishes deposed to.)</p>


               <p>Prisoner. I was going down the market to get a basket to go to Billingsgate, to earn a shilling please God; going down, and by the side of the market, he rushed from the middle of the market by Mr. Davis's stall, he seized hold of me, and tore my coat; he said I was a thief; and called master, master; and he dragged me the same as I am now; Mr. Davis says ay you are an old porter, ay you villain; I will make an example of you, if it lays in my power; I will either hang you or transport you.</p>

            . My husband is a Chelsea pensioner; we live at Edmonton On the 25th of April, the prisoners came to my house about seven o'clock in the morning, and asked if I bought horse hair; I said I did, but I had neither money to buy it nor scales to weigh it - they said they wanted to get some breakfast, and I gave them 1 s. After they were gone I took a handful of it to Mr. Booker - Mahon came again in about an hour for the money - I said I was not to give him the money nor hair, for Mr. Booker had ordered me not - he went away; I never saw him again. I gave the hair to Mr. Booker.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever see them before - A. Yes, many times. They live in the neighbourhood.</p>

Candy came to me - I went with her, and examined the bag of horse hair, and saw it had come from cushions or chaise backs. I found two worsted tufts in it, which made me believe they came from some coachmaker's linings; I examined our carriages, and found four or five chaise linings cut, and the hair taken out; and several cushions in the lost cut open and the hair taken out. I compared the tufts with two of the cushions, and found they matched. I produce a tuft I found in the hair, and one of our cushions. Mahon worked as a bricklayer at our factory.</p>

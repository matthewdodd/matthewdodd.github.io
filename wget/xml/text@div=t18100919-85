            . Q. The prisoner was your clerk, did he ever account to you for any fee from Mr. Cogeny - A. I have the book here; this book was kept by himself; the fee is entered April 24th in the prisoners hand writing five guineas, there is no entry of the payment, he never accounted for any part of the fee.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that he left your service, how much money was due to him - A. A guinea and eight or nine shillings, he never told me that he was in embarrassed circumstances, he had no claim upon me for fees.</p>

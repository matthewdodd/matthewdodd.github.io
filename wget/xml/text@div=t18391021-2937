On Sunday evening, the 29th of September, I was on duty in New King-street, Deptford—shortly before six o'clock Mrs. Hubble spoke to me—I refused to go into the house, and went up the street—when I was some distance from her house I heard a shouting noise—it sounded behind me, towards the Dock-yard gates—I went towards the place, and saw the prisoner John Pine wrestling with a man named Carey, opposite the Dock-yard gate, near the Navy Arms—there were several other persons there, but none connected with the disturbance—I went and asked them to go home—I addressed both of them—John Pine said he would see me d----first—I said if they did not go home I should be under the necessity of taking them to the station-house—they then commenced wrestling again, and shouting, and creating a great disturbance—Carey and Pine shouted—I did not hear any body else—they went on wrestling along the New-row—as they went along the number of people increased very much—when they got to Mr. Ody's railing there were about a hundred persons present—I went and asked them to go away quietly; if they would not I must take them to the station-house, but if they would I would not interfere with them—John Pine immediately struck me on the eye, and knocked off my hat—I immediately collared him—I said nothing to him when I did so—I had collared him about five minutes, when the deceased William Aldridge came to my assistance—during that five minutes I was attempting to get John Pine towards the station-house—I did not draw my staff at that time—Aldridge and myself both drew our staves together when he came to my assistance—John Pine was very violent, and trying to getaway from us—the persons round were very violent against me, trying to rescue the prisoner from roe, and struck John Pine twice on the arm with my staff—I did it in my own protection, in consequence of his violence towards me—he was striking and kicking me—I saw a man named Carey pull a rail off Mr. Ody's fence—Aldridge and I still continued to endeavour to get Pine towards the station-house—we got him as far as the toll-gate—the mob was increasing very rapid, and when we got to the toll-gate they were very violent indeed, throwing stones, and striking both me and Aldridge—at that time Buckmaster, another</p>

I went out of my house on the Sunday evening, when the mob was collected at the toll-gate—two policemen had John Pine in charge—the mob were pushing and calling the police a great many bad names—Pine called them" B----b----several of the mob called them the same, and some of them said "Give it to the b----"—they did not do any thing—at that time there were only two policemen there—two others came to their assistance afterwards, and they went to take him towards the toll-house to try to get him in—somebody in the toll-house shut the door, and somebody behind the toll-house put the shutters up to prevent the windows being broken—when they found they could not get him in they took him towards the station-house, up Broom fields—I followed them about two hundred yards, and saw a man fling a stone at one of the police—I do not know who that man was—it was before they got to the Telegraph public-house—I left the crowd before they reached the Telegraph public-house—the conduct of the mob was very bad, flinging stones at the police, and calling them every thing they could lay their tongues to—the police had great difficulty in getting their prisoner forward—he would not go, and if it had not been for the mob he would have gone better—I do not know which policeman it was the stone struck—it hit him on the left side of his head—John Pine conducted himself very badly—he would not go along—they told him it would be better for him if he would go quietly—he said he would see them b----first before he would go—the conduct of the police was very good towards him—I never saw either of them strike him all the time.</p>

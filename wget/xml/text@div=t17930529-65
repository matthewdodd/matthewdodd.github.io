            . In the first place I asked my landlord for the key on Saturday last, to go to bed; he gave me the key; so I went up and I saw a pannel of Anston's room broke open, and a man inside looking through where the pannel was broke through; the door was padlocked; I called to him and I asked him if he lodged along with that young man in that room, and he never spoke; I asked him again, but he never spoke, but got out of sight; then I went down and I told my landlord, and my landlord took the key of that room, and Anston and me, and him all went up together; he opened the door, and the person was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a hole big enough in this pannel to let a person out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you think the person must have gone out of this pannel? - He went out of the window; my landlord went out of the window to look after him; we found the window open; my landlord went out at the window on the top of the house, and there he found him; I saw him find him; my landlord took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner the man? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing on him? - The watchman found some keys and a knife; the watchman is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Now in regard to this pannel, was there always a hole in it? - No, it had just been broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Might the man have come in at the window? - No, he could not, for that house is ten feet higher than any other house; he was taken on my landlord's house. It was a garret window he got out at.</p>
               <p>Court to Anston. Was you at home at this time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go up on the alarm? - I did</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last been in the room? - I came home from shop about six o'clock; I was in then.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the window? - Open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any ladder near, or any way by which a man might get in at the window? - No, my lord, it is full ten feet higher than the houses of either side.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left the room did you lock the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q Was the pannel safe? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up on the alarm; how did you find the pannel? - The boards quite open, with a hole big enough for any man whatever. I did not see the prisoner till I saw him on the top of the house, and my landlord had got him, and I knew him when I first saw him; it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290136"></xptr>a little after eight, as near as I can say, it was very day light.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there day light enough to see a man's face? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q Had you lighted candles below? - Yes, and we brought a candle lighted up with us; I knew the prisoner before, no acquaintance before, but I knew his person perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into the room did you find the things in the same state as when you left them? - No, the box was removed.</p>
               <p>Q Were all the articles in the indictment in the box? - I did not look then; I had put all the things in the box the Monday before, and I don't recollect opening the box after.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this box removed from? - From the floor on to the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing missing out of it? - No, nothing; the lock was forced.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left it locked before? - Yes. I am sure when I went in before the box was not on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the house at this time? - Mr. Folkstone,

               <p>Q. During the time they were in your room did you go out any where. - A. Yes, the prisoner told me to go out and buy a glass of cherry brandy, she gave me three pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether at that time your chest was locked, or the key with it - A. The key was in the lock, I was not gone a quarter of an hour; when I came in the room I found the prisoner and the others in the room, I took the key out of the chest and put it in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been to that chest a short time before. - A. Yes, after dinner when I dressed myself, and I saw the money there at one o'clock, and the note.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you discover that the money was gone. - A. On Monday morning at nine o'clock I missed the money, I went to my chest to put in my clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine it to see how much you had lost. - A. I did. I missed three guineas and a half and a one pound note, I had eight guineas and a half and a one pound note in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner continue to lodge in your house. - A. She had not lodged with me but three days before, she came on a Saturday and went away on a Wednesday, and took a lodging in King-street, Seven Dials; she came to my house to see me on the Sunday.</p>

               <p>TIMOTHY LEARY sworn. I am a labouring man, I was working out in the country all the week, I came home on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the room on the Sunday when the prisoner and Mrs. Dee were there. - A. I was. The prisoner desired her to dress herself to go out a walking, after she had dressed herself, then the prisoner said she could not go out because she was sick at her stomach; go out said she, to Mrs. Dee, for a glass of cherry brandy for me, Mrs. Dee went out, and left the prisoner and me and three or four men in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. While Mrs. Dee was gone, did you see the prisoner do any thing. - A. Yes, I saw the key in the box, she took the clothes that lay on the top of the box and laid them on the bed, and then put down the box lid again; after that she went to the box again, she did so three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether she took any thing out. A.- No her back was towards me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to her. - A. I did not, I did not think that she would do any such thing, nor any one else; Mrs. Dee came in and took the key out of the box as soon as she gave the cherry brandy to the lady.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her what you had seen. - A. I did not think in my life that she would do any such thing, the prisoner staid in the house till nine o'clock at night. This lady here (pointing to the prisoner) said will you have a pipe of tobacco, she went out and brought in seven pennyworth of tobacco.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you told the woman of the house that you had seen the prisoner go to her chest. - A. On the Monday morning when she searched her box, I told her the prisoner had searched her box two times.</p>

             sworn. I live at a chandler's-shop facing Mr. Dee's. On the same Sunday about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came in and bought seven pennyworth of tobacco, I changed her half a guinea, I saw she had plenty of silver in her purse, she said the silver was not hers, she wanted change particularly for the half guinea.</p>

             sworn. I took the prisoner in custody on the fourteenth of July, I searched and found upon her three guineas and eleven shillings, I produce them, she said they were her own.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Prosecutor) Look at these guineas, is there any one of these guineas that has got any thing particular about it. - A. This is a remarkable guinea, I had it for two years and a half, the head is a different way from the others.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had sent my box on in the waggon, I went to look for creditable lodgings, I asked a woman that I met in the street, to recommend me to creditable lodgings, I found myself mistaken, she recommended me to Mrs. Dee's, Broad-street, St. Giles's, when I went there, Mrs. Dee took off the sheets from her own bed and she laid on the blankets, I left them on Wednesday, and on Sunday I went to her house, I took out my purse in which I had four guineas and nineteen shillings in silver; on Monday morning when I came there again, they swore I had robbed them, she gave me liberty to go to her box, there was nothing in it, and I believe all in the house was not worth ten shillings; she took the advantage of a poor stranger; I hope the gentlemen of the jury will take pity on me, that is my purse and my money. I gave her a new skirt, two silver spoons, three white handkerchiefs, six new knives and forks, and an apron. I think it is hard to loose that money, when my poor husband is in the army at Brighton.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutrix) Upon your oath did she give you these articles. - A. She exchanged a skirt, for a shawl, and she gave me a couple of old handkerchiefs and six knives and forks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of two silver spoons. - A. There were two bits of a mustard spoon, they are not worth a sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she give them to you. - A. Two or three days after she came to me, I believe they are in my place.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they silver. - A. I do not know, they look like silver.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep an eating-house in High-street, Wapping. On the 26th of August the prisoner came to lodge at my house—I never knew him before—he represented himself as a ship-chandler, that he had taken a warehouse, and said he should be a permanent lodger for many years, he hoped—he was to pay me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for board and lodging—he has not paid me one farthing, and he is my debtor for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as a loan—I had a Spanish certificate from a debtor named Newton, who bad been engaged in the Spanish war—I got another certificate from Mr. Clark, of the Spanish Commission, in exchange for it—the one I got from Mr. Newton was for 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was a transfer similar to one I hold in my hand—I was in September last showing the document to a friend—the prisoner was at my house at the time my friend called—there was something stirring respecting this certificate—he thought there would be some interest likely to be paid—the prisoner said, "Have you got a Spanish bond, Mr. Smith?"—I said, "I have a transfer, or certificate, as they call it"—he said, "I should like to see it"—I said, "I can let you see it"—after my friend was gone I showed it to the prisoner—he said, (giving it me back again,) "If you like I will take it to my banker's to ascertain the value of it for you, as it may be useful to you at any time"—he said Messrs. Coutts in the Strand were his bankers—I told him I did not want money just then, nor want to part with it, but I said, "Whatever you do, do not take any thing on it"—I gave it to him again, and cautioned him not to make any thing on it—I would not take 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound, because it would be paid some day, but he might inquire the day price on it if he liked—he took it, and said he should be going up to his banker's in the course of the day, and he would inquire—he afterwards said that if I liked, if I doubted it, he would give me cash for it—I said, "No, my own document is what I want"—he said, any time I wanted 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should have it, that he had 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. standing at his banker's—I was out when he came home—I did not come home till the evening, and did not see him that night—I believed him to be a respectable person—I never asked him for his board and lodging up to that time, but I have latterly—two or three days after I gave him the certificate I said, "Respecting that transfer that I gave you to ascertain the value of, you have not given it me again"—he said, "Oh dear, I did not see my banker, he was not within, but at any time you shall have it"—we were to go to his banker's, but we could not go then—he said, "If you are afraid I will give you the cash"—I said, no, I wanted my own pro<lb></lb>perty—he said, "I will go and inquire about it"—(I have never had it since)—I went with him to Coutts's about a month after the transaction—he said he was going up Leadenhetll-street, and asked me to take a walk with him—I went, and he went up and spoke to one of the clerks at Coutts's—I thought it was on business—that made me contented, thinking my document was safe at Coutts's—he was not apprehended on my pre<lb></lb>mises—he was taken on another charge.</p>

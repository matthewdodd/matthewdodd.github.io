I am a labourer, at Edmonton—I was in the field when this happened—George pushed a boy named Baker down on the wheat for flinging stones at a man named Cousins—when the prisoner came back with the beer, Barker wanted to have a row with George, and the prisoner got up took up the bagging hook and struck him over the shoulder with it, saying, "You b—, I meant it for you when I came back," and when he was running to his father and mother in the other field, the prisoner said to Barker, "I have given one at last, Joe"—he was a little the worse for liquor, but not so bad but he knew what he was after.</p>

I am a surgeon and apothecary, and assistant to Mr. Morris—on Monday afternoon, 27th July, I was sent for to Church Lane, and saw the prosecutor lying on his stomach on the grass by the side of the footpath—he had dropped down from exhaustion from loss of blood—there was a great deal of blood on his clothes, and also on the grass—I lifted his clothes and saw a wound on the edge of the blade-bone, on the right side, about seven inches long, and very deep, dividing several large vessels and deep muscles at the back, it reached the ribs—it was a very dangerous wound—I dressed it, and sent him to the infirmary—he was in danger for a fortnight, and is under my care now—I see no danger now—the wound must have been caused by such an instrument as this.</p>

               <p>I was the wife of the deceased; on the 25th of April, I went to the Three Compasses for my husband; between nine and ten in the evening; he had not been there long.</p>
               <p>How long might he have been there? - I cannot say; a neighbour called for him, and I went to fetch him home; and he said he would come immediately; upon that I left the house; about two doors off, the two prisoners stopped me; the prisoner Thomas put his hand round me; they came after me; then Thomas put his hands round my waist and quite confined me; I called out, and my husband came out; the other man was with him at that time; they were close together; the other man did nothing till my husband came; upon my husband coming they unloosed me, and Thomas and Roberts immediately struck my husband as soon as ever he came up; Thomas was the first that struck him; he struck him a violent blow on each side of his face; he had a sad black eye and his jaw was broke; they gave him more blows than one.</p>
               <p>Did he return any of the blows? - He could not, I caught hold of my husband.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he did not return any blows at all? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>What was the immediate effect of the blows on your husband, did he fall? - That I cannot say; I run away and called White; he did not fall while I staid, I was gone but a very short time; White run directly, and when White was coming up the men run away, and when I saw them again, they were at the Red Lyon door; that was not above five minutes after; I am sure these are the very men that so accosted my husband; I did not know them, nor I never heard from him that he knew them; my husband was taken to Mr. Oldroyd's; he continued ill till he died.</p>
               <p>When did he die? - On the Thursday, the 3d of May.</p>
               <p>Was he in good health before this? - In very good health.</p>
               <p>How long before his death did he apprehend he was dying? - On the Tuesday the 1st of May, he told me he had got his death blow, and that if he died, he hoped I would see justice done.</p>
               <p>After that time that he declared he was sensible he was dying, did he give you any account of what passed at this time? - No, he did not.</p>

               <p>Was this poor man brought to your house after he had received the injury? - He came to me about eleven in the evening on the 25th of April; his jaw was luxated and broke; it was dislocated and broke; I reduced his jaw, and immediately he was in a violent hurry and in high spirits; he jumped up and wanted to run out; stop, says I, you must have something to rub your face for your teeth are loose; he said, they were so before; he said he was perfectly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230070"></xptr>easy; and, to make use of his own expression, he said he could crack a brick; I then was to see him the next morning, and as he did not call on me before I went out, I called at his house, and he was out; on the Friday morning I called again upon him, and he was out likewise; on the Friday in the afternoon I saw him, and his face was very much swelled on both sides; on the Saturday evening I called upon him, and found him at home, he said he was much better, and his face easier, but that he had some little pain in his side, which when he coughed, it gave him much pain; I asked him if he had had any blow or kick, or fall against any thing.</p>
               <p>By that you meant any blow on the side I suppose? - Yes; he answered, I had no blows but on my face, nor any fall by which my side was hurt, for I only staggered against the house; he went further, he said he had had a pain in his side sometime; I sent him an emulsion for his cough, and he seemed better the next morning, though he had a restless night.</p>
               <p>Had he a considerable degree of cough at that time? - No, by no means violent.</p>
               <p>You understand he had a restless night? - Yes; on the Monday I saw him again, and he was feverish; I think it was the first time I observed any fever.</p>
               <p>State a little particularly what he complained of on the Monday morning? - Nothing but his side, he complained of nothing else; he made no complaint of his face at all; on the Monday in the afternoon, his pain of his side increased so much, that he was bled on Tuesday morning; Doctor

             of Hatton-garden was sent for to see him, they had sent for me, and let me know that he would attend there at three o'clock, I endeavoured to meet him, but could not; I saw the deceased a little after three; between three and four I went down to see him, and bound up his face, and he pulled off the bandages and plaisters two or three different times that afternoon; he was delirious in the evening.</p>
               <p>Was he then capable of giving any account of his complaints? - Not that afternoon; on Wednesday morning between ten and eleven, I was called to see him, and was told he had had a very bad night, and I found him exceedingly delirious, and he would not suffer me to touch his face; Doctor Smith was expected to see him again in the morning, and I desired them to continue the medicines, and take care of him till I saw him again, and I saw him no more; about twelve o'clock on Wednesday, I had a message sent me, that I need not trouble myself to attend any more; he died the next day.</p>
               <p>Court. You saw this man for a week, from the time of the accident? - Yes.</p>
               <p>From your judgement of the progress of his complaint, and from what you saw when you last saw him, what was the cause of his death? - There seemed to be two complaints, an original one, and the accident; but the accident was of such a nature, that I hardly think it could occasion his death.</p>
               <p>Was that original complaint, in your opinion, independant of the accident? - There seemed to be an original complaint, independant of the accident; the pain in the side appeared to be inflammatory, there was no fracture on the head, and I scarcely think the fracture of the jaw could occasion his death; so long as he complained of the pain in his jaw, he never had the least fever.</p>
               <p>Jury. You say, before this accident, this man had a pain in his side? - So he told me.</p>
               <p>Had he not been beat about the head as he was, do you think that pain of his side would have brought on the fever? - It certainly would, I think the fever was more likely to be occasioned by the pain in the side, than by the broken jaw; I just saw the man after death, he was not opened.</p>
               <p>You did not observe any external appearance on the side after death? - There was none; I observed that twenty-four hours after he had been dead, that the part where the inflammation was, was extremely warm, and no other part.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230071"></xptr>What reason do you give for that? - The violent inflammation of the part.</p>
               <p>Why did not you open him? - There was an objection made on the part of the wife, and not a strong requisition on the part of the Coroner.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday the 2d of May, I attended the deceased, and found him in a high fever, and delirious, and his jaw fractured; no dressing, nor any thing of the kind on it, which they told me he had taken off in the night in his delirium; I bled him, and saw him again in the afternoon, I did not find him better; the next morning I saw him again, he had a very bad night, he had no sleep, I repeated the bleeding, the next night he died; he was never in his senses, it was necessary for three or four people to sit on the side of the bed, I heard nothing from him; I saw him after death, when Mr. Oldroyd made the observation on his side; the man certainly died of a fever, but whether it proceeded from the injury he received from the prisoners, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Taking it to be true that this man had complained for some time of a pain in his side, which had increased considerably, should you rather have treated it as proceeding from the pain in the side, or from the fracture? - From the pain in the side, I agreed with Mr. Oldroyd.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I beg to go further for the sake of the prisoners; your Lordship knows there is another way of proceeding, which is by appeal, which will be pursued.</p>
               <p>Court to Smith. You could not form a judgement what occasioned the fever, from your own observation? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Now supposing the fact to be as stated, that the fever did not come on till the inflammation of the jaw had greatly subsided, and that previous to the coming on of the fever, the man had complained of a pain in his side, which he had had some time; under these circumstances, was it most likely the fever should be occasioned by the pain in the side, or by some other subsisting cause? - The deceased had been guilty, as I understand, of some irregularity, such as walking abroad, and eating and drinking, which might have contributed with the bruises.</p>
               <p>But when a fever arises by an accident from exernal injury, whether the inflammation<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230072"></xptr>attending that injury, is not the cause that produces that fever? - No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Then if the inflammation fails to produce a fever when it is at it's heighth, does it usually come on when it is subsided? - Very seldom; if any cause tends to bring on, and renew that second inflammation, it may be as likely to introduce a fever as the first.</p>
               <p>But is the fever produced without the introduction of the inflammation? - No, certainly not; my judgement is the same as Mr. Oldroyd's.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, from the course this prosecution has taken, rather than from any thing in the evidence that has been given, I think it necessary to take up a little more of your time in stating distinctly to you the substance and effect of that evidence; because it is highly necessary and proper, in this case, that whatever verdict you think fit to give should be satisfactory to the public, though there is no great reason to expect that it will be satisfactory to the parties concerned in this prosecution; and I am sorry to be obliged to make some observations on that part of the evidence, in a prosecution where it is carried on by a wife, for whose feelings great allowance should be made; but there appears to be a degree of zeal, that after making all the allowances that ought to be made for the feelings of a wife on this occasion, seems to go a little beyond a zeal for justice; for it is impossible but to observe, that not a single syllable has ever been said at any time, or by any witness, till after the evidence of the surgeons was read, that the complaint of the deceased's side was the probable cause of his death; in all the depositions, not a single word or hint was given, that this man ever received any violence on his side; so that the idea of his having received a kick on his side is clearly adopted (whether true or false, you are to judge) but it is clearly adopted and brought forward, after the surgeons had been examined before the Coroner, and had declared their opinions, similar to that which they have declared now; unquestionably, therefore, in such a situation, and under such circumstances, you are to receive such evidence with extreme caution indeed; for it is extremely<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230075"></xptr>singular, that when the impression is strongest on the witness, that not one syllable should be suggested of that nature, till they found it material; then under all these circumstances, and with all this caution, there is but one witness that has brought himself to venture to swear that he saw or knew of any violence done by these men on his side, that is

            , he having heard what passed before the Coroner, for he was examined as a witness there; he having heard the distinct evidence given by the surgeons, he now, for the first time, swears that he saw the prisoner Thomas kick the deceased on the side; if that fact be true, there is a strong probability that that kick was the cause of his death; but it not only comes out in this very suspicious manner, but with this further circumstance, that the very witness that swears to it now, did not swear to it before the Coroner, but on the contrary, swore that he did not know any such thing; he swore to his kicking at him, whether at his legs or his side he did not know; he was repeatedly asked, before the Coroner, whether he had or no; he said he did not know; therefore not much credit is to be given to that part of his testimony; then that is attempted to be confirmed by declarations of the deceased; and I am extremely sorry to say, that the evidence of the mother is directly, fully, and pointedly contradicted, not only by the evidence of the two gentlemen, Oldroyd and Smith; but what is still more, this woman has ventured to swear that this man was never out of his senses, from the time she saw him to his death, though both the surgeons have positively sworn that he was delirious in a high degree; and though the fact sworn is beyond a possibility of doubt, because, it is impossible to assign a reason to common sense, why a man in that rank of life should have four men called in to attend him in his illness, unless he was in a high delirium; therefore the evidence of the mother cannot be true; she has sworn he was sensible to the last, and has added to the declarations and confirmed the testimony of White, by saying that he declared that he had had a kick in the side; Oldroyd distinctly swore he put the question to him, and that he repeatedly told him that he had not, and that it was an old complaint; so that to be sure, unless you disbelieve the evidence of the other witnesses, it is impossible that you can believe the evidence of the mother to be true.</p>

            Was there light enough to distinguish the colour - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the moon up - A. The moon I believe was near upon rising. I am positive the red jackets were turned up with green. They asked me how far it was to Bedfont; I told them I thought about a mile. They then said one to the other, they would go back from whence they came. I walked on fast: they walked on after me; they met me; I was coming from Bedfont; they came as if from Staines: they turned after me. I thought what they wanted was to rob me; I ran. They ran after me; they ran about an hundred yards before they came to me; I fell: one of them caught me before I got up. They said they wanted my money; the others came up. As soon as I was up, they dragged me through the hedge, out of the turnpike road, across the field, the distance of about forty yards, into a pit; they then demanded my money; I gave it them, and my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you give them - A. A ten-pound country bank note of Ashby's, the Staines Bank, and a silver watch; no other cash.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your silver watch worth - A. Five guineas. They stripped me of all my clothes from my person; they took my coat, waistcoat, breeches, stockings, gaiters, and shoes; they stripped me entirely naked of everything. I then asked them, if they would be so good as to let me have some of their old clothes to put on; I thought I should catch my death of cold. They gave me the prisoner's old trowsers, and a thin waistcoat; in that condition they left me. After they had got my things, they tied my hands together behind me, laid me down in the hedge, and then tied my legs. Two of them left, and told the other to stop until they came back again; near half an hour this man stood centry over me. When they returned, they examined my hands and feet, to see whether my hands and feet were fast, I suppose; they left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they use any violence towards you before this - A. No; they never struck me at all. They left me at ten o'clock. I heard a clock strike ten at Stamwell, a church clock, and Sir

               <p>Q. Did you attempt to cry out - A. Yes, I did, at about an hour and a half after they left me. I then endeavoured to make myself heard; I laid still for about an hour and a half, I was afraid of making a noise.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not you get any body to come to your assistance until six o'clock - A. No; I was heard by a great many people, but nobody came to my assistance till six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, they were three persons in soldiers clothes, were you able to distinguish the persons of either of them - A. I cannot possibly say; I believe their coats were turned up with green; I will swear to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to believe you have seen either of these persons since - A. Yes; I believe the prisoner at the bar is one; he was the person that changed clothes with me; I believe he put my clothes on.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think he was left over your person - A. About half an hour; he was not the person that was left centry with me; the prisoner was close to me near half an hour, as near as I can guess. I firmly believe him to be one of the three.</p>

            Have you ever seen your property again - A. Yes; on the Tuesday following; this was on Wednesday, the 7th. On Tuesday following, the 13th, I came to Bow-street, I enquired if they had heard any thing of the man; I saw the prisoner; that Tuesday I went with the officer, he took me with him to the Piazzas, Covent Garden; there I saw a bundle, with my gaiters, shoes, and umbrella.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sure the shoes, gaiters, and umbrella, were your property - A. Yes; that were taken from me that night I was robbed; I am positive that they are mine. The officer then said, he thought he was not far off. We went up James-street, and found the prisoner at the Nag's Head, in James-street; the prisoner had a black coat on, a black waistcoat, and light coloured breeches, and other things; I did not notice much. The coat, the waistcoat, and one handkerchief, he had on, was mine; I was quite certain they were my property; the handkerchief round his neck, I am sure was mine. They were the property of which I was stripped of that night. He was then taken to Bow-street by the officer, and committed.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you saw him, had you any recollection of his person at the time you saw him - A. No; I cannot say I had.</p>
               <p>Q. What, you can be more certain now, than you were then - A. I believed the prisoner to be the person that took my clothes, and put them on. When I saw him in James-street, I thought him to be one of the persons that robbed me; I cannot speak positively, I believed him to be one of them then. After the officer took the prisoner into the room, he said, he bought the clothes of two soldiers, the morning after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he describe the morning - A. He said the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told him what day the robbery was committed - A. Not to him, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Under the Piazzas you found your shoes, gaiters, and umbrella; was the prisoner shewn that bundle - A. Not then, I believe he was not; I do not recollect he was shewed that bundle. I never heard the prisoner claim the shoes and gaiters. My watch has never been found.</p>
               <p>MARY GRIGG. I keep a pastry-cook's shop, under the Paizzas, Covent Garden, and sell breakfasts for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140060"></xptr>the market people. On Tuesday morning, after the robbery, three men come into my shop, between five and six in the morning, they were two soldiers, and the prisoner was dressed in a black coat and waistcoat; they were taken up on the Tuesday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of them a bundle with them - A. No; they came into breakfast. The prisoner wanted change of a ten-pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shew you the note - A. No; he only asked if I could give change; I could not give change. He went out, and came in again, and paid for all the three breakfasts. I changed a shilling cash.</p>
               <p>Q. to Longhurst. Do you recollect you were robbed on Wednesday, the 7th of September - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Grigg. It was on Thursday, the 8th, that they breakfasted at the Piazzas.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me, it was Tuesday, the next day after the robbery; how came you to say it was the 8th of the month - A. I recollect the 8th, by being market morning, the market mornings are Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.</p>
               <p>

            Had you heard that this robbery had been committed at Staines before these person breakfasted with you - A. No. Afterwards I heard of the robbery at Staines.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the officer come to you on the same day that these people breakfasted with you - A. No; on the Tuesday after the robbery.</p>

            How came you to say the first time, they first came to breakfast with you on a Tuesday - A. I think it was on a Tuesday; I may be mistaken.</p>
               <p>Q. Give me any reason why you thing it was the 8th - A. I cannot rightly say. On the Tuesday after they had breakfasts, the prisoner came alone, about eight o'clock in the morning as high as I can guess, and after breakfast, he asked me whether I would be so good as to take care of that parcel, he would call again. I took care of the parcel for him. That is the parcel, contained the shoes, gaiters, and umbrella, claimed by Longhurst.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did Longhurst come - A. I think between three and four in the afternoon. The officer and Longhurst took the prisoner together. Nobody was with the prisoner when he left the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, the prisoner breakfasted with two soldiers, what was their uniform - A. A person in the shop said it was red turned up with green. I cannot say any thing.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. The first information I received was from Longhurst, I think on the 8th; I patrol that road. It was in the day time he came to me; he said, he had been robbed the night before. I sent him to the office to give information there; during the time after he was gone, I received another information; in consequence of that, I went to London myself; I was then given to understand, that they had been to Covent Garden, and breakfasted. I went to Mrs. Grigg on the 9th, I examined her.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure it was not the same day that you first received information from Longhurst - A. I am not certain; I think it was the 9th, the day after Longhurst had been with me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Grigg. Do you recollect Bacon coming to your shop about the robbery - A. Yes: I think it was the day after the men breakfasted with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you recollect the soldiers that were with me, having the bundle, and leaving it there the morning they breakfasted with me - A. No, they did not. It was left the second breakfasting time, you breakfasted there by yourself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. to Bacon. You went to this woman's shop and made enquiry - A. I did. On Tuesday, the 13th, I got another information, I came to London again; when I came to the office, I saw the prosecutor again. I took the prosecutor with myself; I said, come along with me; I took him to Mrs. Grigg's, and shewed him the shoes, gaiters, and umbrella; he said, they were all his property, as soon as he saw them. After that, I said, come along with me, he is not far off; at last, we found him at the Nag's Head; the prosecutor saw the clothes at the Nag's Head, and claimed them. I asked the prisoner how he came by them; he said, he bought them of two soldiers. At that time, the prisoner did not know that we had got the the bundle at Mrs. Grigg's. He said, he had bought them of two soldiers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who the two soldiers were, or where he bought them - A. I asked him if they did not belong to the 45th.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the uniform of the 45th scarlet turned up with green - A. It is. He said, the two soldiers were of the 45th. I said, you are a deserter as well as them; he acknowledged that he was a deserter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came from Exeter with two of these men, there was a third man, he was dressed in regimentals, his name was Brown; they said, we had better go on; they walked on before me; about four miles from Salisbury, we went into a public-house; when we went out, I walked on before them. The third man had some coloured clothes, he shewed me a black coat and waistcoat. I have not seen the other man since, until I came into London. I gave the third man, six shillings and an old brown coat for the black coat and waistcoat, that the officer took from me. They told me when I saw them again in London, they wanted me to buy some clothes for one of them; I told them I would do it, but at that time it was too early, there were no shops open. They then said, they would go and have something to drink, and the two soldiers had this bundle with the shoes, gaiters, and the umbrella. We went to a public-house, and asked the landlord for change of the ten-pound note; he could not. They had no money; one of them gave me his watch to get some money until he got change for the ten-pound note; he gave me the watch to get three shillings on it, that they might get something to eat; I went with it. I then asked the landlord where we might get something to eat; the landlord directed me to this house. We breakfasted there; she charged three shillings and sixpence for the three. I went back for sixpence of the man where I had left the watch; I then came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140061"></xptr>back, and paid the sixpence; we all came out together, and one of the men that had the bundle left it there: we all then went to where I had left the watch, from there to the public-house: there I left them, and went and bought clothes for one of the men. I brought the clothes back, and the change of the ten-pound note. I paid for what they had, and three shillings and sixpence for the watch. I then put the clothes on; I took a handkerchief out of the bundle, and put it on my neck; the shoes and gaiters I never wore. I put the coat and waistcoat on; the waistcoat I exchanged for a linen one; the black waistcoat belonging to the black coat being too short for me, I paid two shillings for the linen waistcoat and the black one. On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, I slept at Mr. Salter's house; Monday was the first day I came into London.</p>

In a few minutes, I saw her return with my linen on her arm; I went into the wash-house, and missed the linen out of the clothes-basket; I followed her, and stopped her on Saffron-hill; I asked her where she was going; she said, she was going home; I told her that was not the way home; I knew her immediately, I mangle for people in the house where she lived, I had known her by sight some months; I told her they were my property, and she said she would shew me where she took them from; she came back with me. I wanted to take her into the Coach and Horses, but she refused; a person in Court then took her to the Hat and Tun, and gave her up to an officer; she said, she had fetched them from the mangle, that she had sent them in the morning by a boy, and not being done, she fetched them away.</p>

               <p>Q. Had she sent them to you? - A. No, I never had any thing from her, to my knowledge; part of these things were my own, and part belonging to other other people, that I had to wash.</p>

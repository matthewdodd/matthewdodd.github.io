I placed the men in a semicircle round the fire - about eight men were ordered into the house; I do not know whether he was one or not. About half-past four o'clock we left the fire - all the men, except one named Oliver, were present, and he joined us directly we got back - there were sixty-two in all. About an hour and a half after, the roll was called over; four or five men were absent, the prisoner was one of them. I did not see him again until he was in custody at Bow-street on the Wednesday following.</p>

            . I am a sergeant in the Coldstream Guards. On Friday evening, about a quarter before ten o'clock, I met the prisoner at a public-house near the Mint - I sent for Fox, and we secured him with four others. As soon as we got out of the house the other four ran away; we took the prisoner to the main guard at the Tower. He was very resolute, used bad language, and resisted being searched - he threatened to knock any one down who offered to touch him. We searched him by force, and found 9 s. 2 d. in his trowsers pocket, and five 1 l. notes between his gaiters and his legs, buttoned up; a white pocket handkerchief fell out of his trowsers. He would not satisfy the officer how he came by them - he said a gentleman in Dover-street gave him some money to drink for assisting at the fire, and that he had 60 l. more, which he offered to lend the Captain. The officer asked him how he came by it? he said that was nothing to him. He said the patrols had taken a piece of gold out of his pocket, which a gentleman in Dover-street gave him - the officer asked the gentleman's name? he said it was Ferguson.</p>

I took it up to them, and asked them if they had silver. The prisoner stood up and produced a 5 l. and a 10 l. note. I still refused giving change for a large note, and asked him if he had got another 1 l. note instead of that he first sent down, as I scrupled about its being good - he gave me another 1 l. note; I gave him the change, and returned the first note to him.</p>

He said several times that he had made a haul of 50 l. at the fire in Dover-street, and a piece of gold which he had been offered 25 l. for. He was in liquor.</p>

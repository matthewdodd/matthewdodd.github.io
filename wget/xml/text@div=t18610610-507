                  </hi>. I am one of the ledger-keepers of the Commercial Bank at the Henrietta-street Branch, and was so at the latter part of 185<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—the prisoner Durdin was ledger-keeper—it was his duty to keep the two ledgers from D to J or K at that period—those ledgers would contain the current accounts—Besides those he would keep the calendars; that would be the summary of the ledgers from D to K, corresponding with the ledgers—in February last, it was the practice of one of the clerks of the Bank to stay till 9 o'clock at night—there were six of us—I remember the Saturday night when it was my turn to stay—I am not quite sure whether that was the Saturday before the fraud was discovered; I think it was the Saturday week previous—at that time Durdin had been absent from illness for about two days or two days and a half—I think he left on the Thursday afternoon in the middle of the day—while I was at the Bank on that Saturday, Durdin sent a ca B for me, stating that he should very much like to see me—that was about half-past 6 or 7 o'clock—when 1 remained of a night I should, in the ordinary course, have access to the ledgers and calendars kept by Durdin, if I had liked to examine them—when the ca B was sent, I went to Durdin's house—he was in Bed—he merely put a few questions to me regarding the Business of the Bank; how we were getting on, and so forth—I should think I was there fully an hour—I wished to go two or three times, but he rather persuaded me to stop—it was about half-past 8 when I got back to the Bank—I had just time to finish my portion of the ledgers—on the Monday or Tuesday following, the prisoner was again absent—he came to the Bank about the middle of the day on Wednesday—he had then lost the use of his left side or very nearly so—there was no particular remark made on the Wednesday; he commenced casting his calendars, trying the Balances of his ledgers, to see if they were correctly posted, and he continued at that for two or three days; but I found that he was not getting on very satisfactorily, and I said, "I have been thinking of coming o£ an evening to assist you in getting your work up close again"—he said, "You see I cannot do anything else, and I shall soon have them up close again if I continue at this"—I merely remarked, "Very well, I shall see how you get on"—on Friday, 14th February, about 2 o'clock, I went into the room at the Bank where Durdin was, and spoke to him—I rather think he spoke to me first—he told me that Mr. Beatle, the senior ledger, had been telling him that I was coming in the evening to get his workup close,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186106100072"></xptr>
               <p>and he said he would not have anyone touch his work for anything—I told him that I had told the manager I was coming in the evening to endeavour to get his work up close, for I wished to commence perfectly straight next day, as we were going to have a new clerk, and I thought I could keep the work up close myself—he was very irritated and put out about it, and he said if I was coming in he should remain, and stop as long as I stopped—I returned to the Bank on Friday evening about 7 o'clock, for the purpose of working up Durdin's Books—when I got to the Bank, I found Durdin there at his usual place—he said, "If you will take the ledgers, I will take the calendar, and I will tell you which of the accounts are entered," to see that the Balances were carried out correctly—he had previously made the castings—I remained there till 9 o'clock—he made some memorandums upon the papers and castings—he then said he should go and lock up his papers—I said he could do so if he pleased—that would throw a difficulty in the way of casting the calendars, until he came in the morning—on the following morning, before he came, I thought it right to examine the calendars, and found that the summary had been mis-cast about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>placed on a piece of paper, which I now produce, the amount of the fraud, I asked him how it had been committed—he wrote down on the paper "66,992<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have the original here—I asked him how he had done it—he explained that it had been perpetrated by two accounts; first of all his own, and secondly that of Mr. Holcroft—I asked him by what method, and he told me that sums which had been paid into certain accounts had not only been credited to those accounts, but also to the account of Mr. Holcroft.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been the manager? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was nominally manager on 31st July, 1854—I was actually manager on 14th February, 1860—a gentleman named Cadogan preceded me as manager in 1851—I do not know anything of him—I had nothing whatever to do with the Bank before I Became manager in 1854—I think the prisoner received 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year when he first commenced, and 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at last—it was not 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for several years after 1 was there—there are entries in the Books which can Be seen—I am sure it was more than 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had he sometimes to act as cashier in the absence of the other cashier? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think, during my management, that he ever, acted as cashier—he might have done ao for a single afternoon, or something of that kind—I will not Be positive, but I do not think he ever did—he may have received money across the counter accidentally, but not as cashier—he would have to give it to another cashier to account for—I do not know that he constantly received money across the counter.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So that if he received money at the counter, he might enter it in the cash-Book himself, enter it into the ledger himself, check it himself, enter it into the calendar himself, and into the total summary himself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No doubt; there would be no check whatever upon him, from the time he received it and entered it in the cash-Book, until it got into the summary.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you say there would be no check? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not if he received it as cash; but I think it will Be found upon an examination of the</p>

               <p>Books, that he very seldom received as cashier—there may Be entries in the cash-Book which represent credits in the cash, but upon which there was no cash received; simply transfers—I think it will Be found if the cash-Books are examined, which I have not done, that whatever entries of his are made, are principally of that class, and not actual cash received.</p>

Etches, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid with two 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes"—Etches was a customer of tie Bank at that time—I have Joel's account before me in the ledger in Durdin's writing—there is no entry whatever of the payment of that 580<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Joel on 28th July—By the ticks to the different items, the account appears have been checked—in checking Durdin would have the ledger, and somebody else would call over the pay-Book—I have Etches' account here—the whole of it is in Durdin's handwriting—there is no entry there of 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on, 30th July; that account appears to have been checked—that would be done the same as the other; Durdin would have the ledger and somebody else would call over the pay-Book.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been a Bill-Broker and discounter—in 1851 I had an account at the Henrietta-street Branch of the Commercial Bank—on 30th July, 1851,1 drew a cheque for 580<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I do not find that debited to me in my pass-Book—the pass-Book correctly represents my account.</p>

                  </hi>. In 1851 I kept an account at the Henrietta-street Branch of the Commercial Bank—I cannot ill whether, on 30th July, 1851, I drew a cheque for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or received 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the Commercial Bank, for I have not got my pass-Book—I have looked for the pass-Book, but have only found the cover—I have looked for the interior of that cover, but have not been able to find it—I remember once an error oocurring in that pass-Book; of my having drawn a cheque, and not being de bitted with it—it was about that time, but I can't say the day—that was a cheque for about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I believe to the Best of my recollection—I cannot under take to say whether there was an error to the amount of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or not; but my impression is it was only 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant—I was employed to investigate the Books of this Bank—I am aware of the different sums which are the subject of complaint in this indictment—I have gone through the calendars and ledgers to see whether those sums are included in the mis-castings—they are included.</p>

               <p>for the total of the mis-castings, these sums cannot Be taken into account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We took it from three weeks to three weeks; and we have ascertained that the error in addition was increased by certain amounts in which these were included—with regard to the 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I find that, on that particular day, there is an additional mis-casting to the amount necessary to conceal it—there is an additional mis-casting of the 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which is increased by a sum of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to make it even to the sum additionally charged, not debited to Durdin's account; which makes an even 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

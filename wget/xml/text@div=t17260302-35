Millington, to which the Prisoner answer'd, Yes. Why then you are a Scrub, says the Deceas'd - A Scrub? For what? - I'll tell you for what. Don't ye remember that about 12 Years ago, I fought with your Friend Bond, a Carpenter, at the Castle in Angel-street in St: Martin's - Well and what then? - And don't ye remember that you parted us by taking me off. - Suppose I did? - Why then, I say you are a Scrub, and a Scoundrel for your Pains, for if you had let us alone, I should have beat him. - You' a' beat him! No, that's a great Mistake of yours! he would have beat you, and therefore instead of calling me Scrub, you ought to give me a Bottle. - A Mistake of mine! Why I could have beat him or you either at that Time of Day, and I can still, for all I am grown so fat. I'll fight you for a Guinea, and here it is. - You're not in earnest sure? - By G - d but I am. - I shan't believe it, till I see you pull off your Hat and Wig. - Why then there's my Hat, and there's my Wig. Now cover the Guinea. The Prisoner taking off his own Hat and Wig, answer'd no, if I fight it shall be for no more than a Bottle, tho' I had rather give you a Bottle and let it alone. But since you will needs sight, there's the first Blow, and in so saying, he in a jocular Manner gave the Deceas'd a gentle Tap or Stroke upon the Cheek. D - ye for a Cowardly Dog. (says the Deceas'd) don't stroke me, but strike as hard as you can. I wont take the Law of ye. After this, as Mr. Burleigh made Oath the first Blow was given by the Deceas'd, who struck the Prisoner on the Stomach, and tore his Shirt; but most of the other Witnesses depos'd that they did not see that, but did believe that the Prisoner struck first. However they both fell to fighting. The Deceas'd endeavour'd to strike the Prisoner, but the Prisoner knockt the Deceas'd down three Times. He rose again, and before his third Rising, somebody pusht open the Door, and in shutting it again, his Heel was catch'd betwixt the Door, and the Door-case, and he hastily endeavouring to get up, gave his Leg such a Wrench as dislocated his Ancle, upon which they sent for a Surgeon.</p>

             the Surgeon thus depos'd. Being sent for, to set the broken Leg of the Deceas'd, I saw the Tibia (or great Bone of his Leg) forced quite thro' the Skin, and hung over his Shoe. He being of a very ill Habit of Body, his Leg presently morrify'd, upon which, after advising with other Surgeons, I cut it off. He fell into a Fever and dy'd delirious.</p>

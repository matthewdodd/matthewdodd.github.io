               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a baker whom I knew, he was arguing with another man about the quality of the bread; the stranger said he left his basket in Bond-street; he said his bread was the best. In Bond-street I saw a basket, supposing it was the same basket I took up the bread and looked at it. I did not mean to go away with the bread. I put the bread in the basket before the prosecutor came up.</p>

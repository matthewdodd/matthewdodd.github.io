On Saturday night, the 18th of January, I opened my shop after our Sabbath was over, and there I hung up my stockings, there were about ten dozen of stockings there, dirty and clean, I had hung them up for sale, on two lines inside of the window, I put a gimblet in the window, to fasten it down, and I went over the water to see my father, and I left my wife alone in the place.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you leave your wife at home? - About seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you come back? - About ten in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know any thing that they were missing till you came home? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen them since? - Yes, the prisoner offered some to sell to me the Wednesday following, she offered me first one pair, and then another pair, and then two pair; I asked her if she had any more? she said she had not; says I then, good woman I must stop you with these, because these are my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it this woman offered them to you to sell? - In Rosemary-lane, in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any other goods to sell besides these stockings? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she a dealer in goods there? - I suppose she is, but I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. She offered them to you as such? - Yes. When I told her that I must stop her; she says if you will go with me to Petticoat-lane, I will shew you the person that I bought them of. As we were going along, she said, she did not know the person rightly, but if I would go with her to her father's in Winfield-street, he knew the person; I went with her down to her father's, in Winfield-street, into a back place, and when I came there I again asked her if she had got any more? she said she had not; at the time I spoke to her she had her apron tied up, as all these women have; as soon as we got into the door she whispered something to her father, and I had some suspicion, and I saw her throw seven pair down into the kitchen. I told her what a wicked woman she must be to tell me she had no more, and yet had more concealed; I went down the stairs and picked them up, and I went with her and them into Petticoat-lane, and I gave them to the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the articles that you gave to the constable the same you took from the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your wife here? - No, she is very big with child, she could not come here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see that woman in your house yourself? - No, not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Samuel. I can swear to this pair, this dark brown pair, they are such a remarkable pair, they had been mended so in the leg; these are not the whole of what I lost, I lost nine dozen and a half, some new and some old stockings,</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had them old pair that you speak to? - A fortnight or three weeks, it is a remarkable ribbed stocking, and mended with yellow silk in the leg.</p>
               <p>Box. This woman deals in the fair with stockings. I asked the prosecutor what I was to do with this poor woman, She said she thought she could find the person that she bought them of, by the next day, and by the prosecutor's agreement I took her word, till next day eleven o'clock, when she came and delivered herself up according to her word.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish my witnesses to be called in that see me buy the stockings.</p>

On 29th April I was on duty at Woolwich Dock-yard at the main gate—at five minutes before six o'clock in the evening, the bell rang—the prisoner came towards the gate—the inspector touched him and desired me to search him—I found these two pieces of lead, one in each of his trowsers pockets—I took him into the office—he said, "I am a foolish fellow, it cannot be helped."</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police. I touched the prisoner and desired him to be searched—Fisher was getting out the lead when I went in the office—the prisoner said it was not Government property; that he got it from the other end of the yard—he said something about a boiler-maker or breaker who had given it him—I said, "Do you know the man?" he said, "Yes"—I said, "You will be able to point him out then?"—he then said he did not know him—I went with the sergeant to the shop where the prisoner was employed, and some other things were found in a box there—I brought up an unfinished plane; I walked into the office with it—the prisoner said, "You did not find that in the box?"—I said, "No, I found it behind the box."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had the box the Crown lock on it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe not; it has the man's name on it—the other men have boxes in which they put their tools—I do not know that he knew he was in custody when he said a man gave it him, neither did I then—the sergeant got the key from him to open his box.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the store-keeper's office in Woolwich Dock-yard. I know the prisoner by sight—he has been employed there about eight years as a wheelwright—on 29th April there was lead of this descrip<lb></lb>tion in the Dock-yard—there is no mark on it.</p>

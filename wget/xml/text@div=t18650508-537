                  </hi>. I am solicitor to the London Bankers' Association—on 8th April, I was sent for to Messrs. Robarts, and found the prisoner in a private room—I had the third cheque in my hand, and asked her if she was the person who presented it—she said, "Yes"—I asked her from whom she received it—she said, "From Mr. Edward Jackson"—I showed her the other two cheques, and said that Mr. Jackson had declared that they were for<lb></lb>geries, and that the third appeared to me to be in the same writing—she said that she knew nothing about them, but she had received the third cheque from Mr. Jackson's own hand—either then or at a second interview I said, "I believe he is your brother-in-law, "and asked whether she was willing to go to him—she said, "Certainly"—I left the room in order to get some one to go with her—Sergeant Webb shortly afterwards arrived,"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186505080044"></xptr>
               <p>and then she asked to speak with me alone, and said that it was of no use her going to Mr. Jackson, as she had not received the cheque from him, but had written it herself; that she had been in great distress, which had driven her to do it, and she had hoped that Mr. Jackson, for his brother's sake, would honour the cheques, and wished to assure me that her husband knew nothing at all about it—Webb was called in, and in his presence I told her that she would be charged with forging and uttering a cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she said that it was quite true; she had done it herself, and her husband knew nothing about it—she was taken in custody, and I attended the examination at the Mansion-house, on 13th April, when Mr. Edward Jackson was examined—I did not see him sign his depositions—the prisoner was asked if she had any question to put, and she made a statement in answer to part of the depositions—the cheques were produced.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, living in Bennett's-gardens, Bell-street, Hackney—the prisoner lived at the back of my house. On Tuesday, the 12th of April, between seven and eight o'clock at night, I saw him in my front garden, lurking about outside the washhouse—when he saw me, he walked away—I said nothing to him—I had a copper fixed in brick-work inside the washhouse—I saw it safe at six o'clock at night—there were two gallons of water in the copper, and a glass bottle—the washhouse was covered with lead—the next morning, I got up about six o'clock, and saw part of the lead was gone from the top of the washhouse, and missed the copper—I have never seen the copper or lead again—this is my bottle that was in the copper—I know it by a mark inside, caused by some oil stand<lb></lb>ing in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's daughter, and live with him in Bennett's-yard. On Wednesday, the 13th of April, I saw some lead in the washhouse between eleven and twelve o'clock my father told me to carry it away—he put it into a basket—I took it past Lady Frampton's house, which is a little way from my father's—my father came after me, took the basket from me, and told me to go home—I did not, but followed him as far as Cambridge Heath-gate—I then missed him, and went home—I had been in my father's washhouse the night before, and saw no piece of lead there then—I found this glass bottle in the washhouse—my father saw it, and told me to carry it up stairs.</p>

On Wednesday morning, the 13th of April, I examined the prosecutor's premises—I found the copper gone from the washhouse, and some lead from the roof—I had some information on the 16th—in consequence of which I took the prisoner about 150 yards from his house—I told him what it was for—he made no answer—I took him to the station, and searched him—I found a knife on him—I searched his house afterwards, and found this glass bottle up stairs—I took it to the prosecutor.</p>

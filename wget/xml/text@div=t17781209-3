               <p>We received a letter from a gentleman in the Borough, informing us that some leather had been offered for sale at a reduced price, which leather, he knew by the cut to be our property; I went into the Borough, and asked the gentleman, if he had not bought some buff leather; he turned to the books, and said Woodroofe was the name of the person he had bought it of; the prisoner was our servant; I charged a constable with him, and we went with the constable and one of my servants to his lodgings; there I found some of our leather; he said it was his own property, and that he dealt in leather as large as we did; that leather I know to be our property; it was delivered over to the constable.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I searched Woodroofe's house; Mr. Esdaile delivered to me some leather he claimed as belonging to him.</p>
               <p>(The leather was produced in court, and deposed to by Mr. Esdaile.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Esdaile. The prisoner was <rs id="t17781209-3-deflabel26" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, This is the only time I have been charged with a crime of a criminal nature; I am innocent of the charge; the leather found in my possession is my own property, and has been in my possession almost four years; when I was in business as a tanner and currier, I manufactured a large quantity of that leather; I am sure no man could have dared to have sworn to that leather but Mr. Esdaile, it being a property numbers of people have as well as himself. It is customary when skins or hides are cut out, to throw the offal aside till somebody comes to purchase it without any mark thereon, and it is impossible to tell one piece from another. I could go further, that there was a man that purchased the same kind of leather of Sir James four years ago, with some of the army bands. I dare say, Mr. Esdaile, you sold some at that time?</p>
               <p>Mr. Esdaile. I do not recollect.</p>


               <p>Prisoner. Your clerk does not make bills when he sells leather; he frequently sells<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177812090006"></xptr> leather without making bills, as he sells it for ready money . I am at a loss at present, as my evidence is not here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Esdaile. Here is a piece of leather which is very remarkable. Some gentlemen in the city associated themselves in order to defend their king and country, and learned the military exercise; we made their belts; there was an alteration afterwards in the manner of wearing the belts, on which account a large piece was cut off; here is one of the pieces. The prisoner fully confessed the fact after he was taken into custody; and there is a great deal of this buff leather which is manufactured abroad.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, my witnesses are not come, though the court indulged me with putting off my trial; I was fearful of being troublesome again; I expected them momently almost; there was a man would have proved my buying the leather.</p>

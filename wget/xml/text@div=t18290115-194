At half-past twelve o'clock, after the performances were over, as I came out of the pit, under the Piazza, a man came right opposite me, pulled out my watch, and ran away; I ran after him, seized him, and threw him on the ground with the watch in his hand - the watchman came up, and took it out of his hand; the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BODKIN. Q. It was dark, I suppose? A.There were plenty of gas-lights - a great many persons were about; he had not gone three steps before I took him; the force of the pull knocked the watch against the wall, and broke the glass.</p>

               <p>Did you see them again that day? - Yes, I told my husband, when he came in, they went away, and my husband was coming down the gateway; one of the prisoners beckoned him, with that I was in a great fright; I did not like the looks of the men.</p>
               <p>Did they return to your house after that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What time of day might this be? - About twenty minutes, or half past four; they then came again, and I called my husband; he came out of the parlour, and said what do you want with me; says they, what do not you know us; he said no, and if they did not go about their business, he would send for somebody that should make them; the prisoner Watts said, he had borrowed a shilling of him; I was inside the shop; I did not see where the other stood; I had seen them peeping backwards and forwards before the other came in; my husband declared to me in their hearing, that he had never seen them in his life.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure these are the men? - I am positive sure they are the two men that came to our house on that occasion, that I am positive clear in.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130005"></xptr>Mr. Scott, Prisoners Counsel. What is your husband now by profession? - A milk-man, and green-grocer for seven years.</p>
               <p>He was obliged to retire from his business a little while, I believe? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>What was the cause of that? - A little misdemeanor between him and me.</p>
               <p>Has not he been at Bethnall-green? - Yes, he was in the private mad-house a little while, and I wish I never had done it; he staid three weeks under the care of Mr. Bowman.</p>
               <p>You recollect his going to the play on the 26th of October last? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. How long is it since he came out of that private mad-house at Bethnall-green? - I will shew you Sir. (Produces a receipt, the 12th of September, 1785.) He was going on the 27th of October last to the play, to see the same he had seen the night before.</p>
               <p>What company was he in that night at the play? - A Gentleman, a clerk to the Custom-house, whose name is Dell.</p>
               <p>Is Mr. Dell here? - No; but if you will give me time I will have him sent for.</p>
               <p>Did not your husband mention any other company? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>What time did he come home? - About eleven, on the 26th of October.</p>
               <p>What particular observation did you make as to the persons of these people, you say, you seemed a good deal surprised at the time? - I was Sir, because my husband never drank.</p>
               <p>Were they dressed as they are now? - Yes; with dirty shirts.</p>
               <p>Was you present at the examination of your husband in Bow-street? - No, Sir; I was sent for.</p>
               <p>Was you there when he gave his testimony? - I was only sent for by Sir Sampson to know whether he was in Bedlam, I said, no; he asked me no farther questions or else I should have told him; I put the receipt in my pocket on purpose.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You have never paid any thing to Bethnal-green since the 20th of September, 1785? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Have you any reason to believe since that, that your husband has been disordered in his mind? - No, Sir; not in the least; he went out about eight to the play with Mr. Dell, and the next night he was to go, and see it all full; he came home about eleven.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hardy. At the time that you say Watts came to your house, what distance might I be at that time? - I cannot say; at no great distance; you was down the arch way.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts did I stand when you first saw me? - Not quite two doors off my house.</p>
               <p>Was it to the right or left of your house? - To the left.</p>
               <p>When you was fetched to Bow-street, who fetched you? - Mr. Tallboy the constable.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - Sir Sampson wanted to see me about Bedlam.</p>
               <p>When Sir Sampson asked you whether your husband was or was not charged with insanity, did not you say he never was in any mad-house, or in Bedlam? - No; the word mad-house was never mentioned.</p>
               <p>Did not you say it was his two brothers and not him? - I did say he had two brothers in Bedlam through drink; but they are well now.</p>
               <p>Did you hear us ask your husband whether it was not perfect day-light at five o'clock on the 27th of September, and whether he did not know our persons? - I did not hear any such question asked; I was not there.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect Mr. Bond saying to your husband, come forth as a man and deny what you have sworn against these two men? - I was not there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She was in the room at the time.</p>

               <p>Look at these two men at the bar, when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130006"></xptr> did you first see these two men? - On the 27th of October.</p>
               <p>Upon what business did you first see, them? - I had been out with my carrier and came home about twenty minutes after four, and found my wife in doors; says I, what is the matter? says she, we have had two ill looking men here; says I, do not be frightened; in about ten minutes Watts came in, says he, is Mr. Austen within? says I, what do you want with me; says he, Mr. Austen, you know you owe me a shilling; for what? says I; says he, you know you borrowed a shilling; says I, I never did, I should like to be informed better; says I, you seem to be a couple of blackguard fellows, and if you do not go along, I will send for a constable; the other man, Hardy, stood at the door; whether he heard I do not know; but he certainly must if he had a pair of ears on.</p>
               <p>He was within such a distance he must have heard? - I should have thought so; then they went immediately after I said they were a couple of blackguard fellows, and if they did not go I would send for a constable; and with my speaking a little sharp they went away.</p>
               <p>I ask you on your oath, whether you had ever been in company with these men? - Never.</p>
               <p>That you are clear and positive of? - That I am clear and positive of; I staid and drank two or three cups of tea; I was going with the intention of going to the play, and at the top of Butcher-row, I saw these two men peeping through an eating-house window.</p>
               <p>Did you speak to them at that time? - No, they saw me pass them, and I turned my head and looked at them; and just at the end of the dark passage, going into <placeName id="t17861213-2-crimeloc9">St. Clement's church-yard</placeName>

               <p>Did you see them go into the house? - No, only into the yard before the house.</p>
               <p>Are there two houses then in this yard? - No, no more than one.</p>
               <p>Describe to us what sort of a yard this is? - It is about a yard and a half square; there is a vault there I saw afterwards; it is made for the convenience of keeping the house private; upon this I went back immediately to

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130007"></xptr>When did you next see the persons that had robbed you? - On Sunday morning:</p>
               <p>Court. When you heard the dog bark in the one pair of stairs, did you attempt to open the door? - No farther than there was a thing that turned round, and we tried to open it, and it did not open; and then we left it; I went up to Sir Sampson's that very night, with the constable and the butcher, and I gave the descriptions of them; on Sunday or Monday I heard they were taken; I went to the house where this woman had denied having any lodgers; I went up stairs, and there was Mr. Macmanus in the room; says he, now, Mr. Austen, be on your guard, if you know these men, say so; if you do not, say to the contrary.</p>

               <p>In what room was this? - In the one pair of stairs; in the same house where we had been before; when I entered the room, Hardy was in the outer room; the other was dressing himself in the inner room; says I, this is one; and then the other came out, and I said, this is the other; then one said, we know you very well, Mr. Austen, you have been here several times; the landlady of the house knows you very well: they were both in the room when that was said; I do not know which it was that said it; says I, Mr. Macmanus, these fellows may be rogues, the woman below will not dare say she has not seen me here; let us go down and speak to her; and we all five went down together; when we went down in the passage, we all five stood in a rank together; now, says Macmanus, pray Madam, who do you know amongst us? I know, says she, Watts and Hardy to be my lodgers, and says she, I know Mr. Talboy, the constable, very well.</p>
               <p>Was she asked at that time whether she knew you? - Says Macmanus, what nobody else, do not you know this gentleman? that was meaning me; no, says she, I never saw him in my life, to my knowledge; Hardy says, recollect yourself, Madam, did not you light this man up here one night, exceedingly drunk? no, says she, never in my life; from that we all went up to Bow-street, to the Brown Bear, into the back parlour; this was on the Sunday morning; and the prisoner Hardy wanted to go out, and Talboy took him out and left me in the room with Watts; Watts says to me, you would not go to take our lives away for seven shillings and sixpence; says I, it is out of my power to take your lives away; but the law shall have its course; he made answer, and said, we have enough to swear where we were at that time that you say; no doubt on it, says I, such company as you keep, I dare say, you have; says he, if please God, we ever get over this here, if you do not do we, we will do you; what they meant by the word, I cannot tell; then we went over to Sir Sampson; they made no charge against me; they believed me to be a very worthy honest man, they said, they had known me about a month.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the prisoners before? - To say about seeing people it is impossible.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see them to know them? - Never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott, Prisoners Counsel. Have you a perfect memory at this time, is your memory good? - I think it is.</p>
               <p>Then will it furnish you to remember what day you went to the play with Vaughan your servant? - I never went with him.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - I never went with him; I had a servant of that name; I suppose he must have left me about two years and a half; but I cannot say the exact time.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you was not in company with Vaughan at Covent Garden playhouse a fortnight or three weeks before the robbery in the one shilling gallery? - I do not mean to swear that.</p>
               <p>Do not you recollect going to the public house when you came from the playhouse? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect being at the playhouse at all? - I have been there several times;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130008"></xptr> I have never been there to see a whole play this season; I believe once I may have gone in at half price.</p>
               <p>Who was in company with you? - A Mr. Dell, a young gentleman that lodges and boards at my house; he never introduced me into any company; we went from our house together, and came back together; I never stopped at any public house; I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Was that the first time you ever saw this man at your own door? - I cannot say that; it might be the first time I ever saw them; for I might see you in the street; it was the first time I ever spoke to them; I recollect I never borrowed a shilling of no man in the world of that kind.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by that? - By bearing such a character; I never borrowed a shilling at all not of these men.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect borrowing a shilling the night you came from the play-house? - No, I do not; I positively mean to swear it.</p>
               <p>When was the first time that you think you saw these two men? - The first time that I ever saw them to the best of my knowledge, was the 27th of October; it was that further man, his name is Watts.</p>
               <p>What might he say to you? - When he came to me, he says Mr. Austen, you owe me a shilling; says I, what for; he accosted me in a very civil way; I said, I owe you a shilling! I should be glad to be informed a little about it; I cannot swear whether he might not say he would summon me to the Court of Conscience; when I got into St. Clement's churchyard, they were just lighting up candles; it was the 27th of October; it is a passage of considerable thoroughfare; sometimes there is fifty or sixty, and sometimes not one; it was done in less than a minute, all of it.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the account you gave of that robbery at Bow-street? - I do, and I believe it concurs with this.</p>
               <p>What colour was the back of your coat then? - All white, tumbling against the wall; the wall is all white, and the intermixture of the bricks; I know very well that wall is brick and mortar, and the mortar coloured my coat; I am sure I never was at this man's lodgings.</p>

            ? - I certainly know him very well.</p>
               <p>What was he? - He was my milkboy.</p>
               <p>What is he now? - How do I know?</p>
               <p>Did you never in your life go in company with him and me to Mrs. Sorrell's in James-street, Govent-garden, and treat us with a glass of brandy? - Never.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect yourself? - I recollect the truth.</p>
               <p>Then I shall ask you a few more questions what time of night was it? - The candles was alight.</p>
               <p>Was it a wet evening or a dry one? - It was very foggy.</p>
               <p>Was it moon-light? - I do not know whether it was moon-light or star-light.</p>
               <p>Do you know what time it is dark at that time of year? - No, I do not, the candles were brought in.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect Mr. Justice Bond putting his hand on your coat, and saying, speak the truth like a man? - He said, if you are an honest man, if you have said wrong, now declare it; says I, I have spoke nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you, you could not make him believe it, and you could not make the Court believe it; and did not he say again, he would have no objection to taking bail for these two men; and then did not you make use a of subterfuge? - When they heard you stood prosecuted here for extorting money from a banker's clerk, they committed you.</p>
               <p>Hardy. My Lord, I defy malice itself to impeach my character, and I hope to make it clear to your Lordship and the Jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott. How long ago is it since<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130009"></xptr> you were discharged from the mad-house? - I believe it is eighteen months ago.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Watts. I beg to remind him of one particular night, whether he was not up in our apartment at Mr. Hardy's lodgings; and it was a very wet night, and he came up with his umbrella, and began to spout?</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hardy. Did not you say you could play tragedy and comedy? - I dare say I did; I never was at their lodgings before we went to search after them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Watts. Did you know a Miss Gale in your neighbourhood? - I do know her; and I believe there are a great many gentlemen in this Court know Miss Gale as well as me.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the time that you swore that she took a hat from a man's head? - I never did any such thing.</p>
               <p>Nor she never brought any action against you in the Court King's-bench for perjury? - If she did, all that I have said shall go for nothing; this man pretended to swear before Sir Sampson, that I defrauded Mr. West, my cow-keeper, out of a seventy pound bank-note; and would have sworn it.</p>
               <p>Court. You say when you came home, your wife was alarmed at these two people having been there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you seen them before you got into the house? - I do not know whether they were not at the bottom of the street, and they waved their hands, but I did not know it was at me, so I took no notice of them.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I was applied to by Mr. Austen, the 27th of October, near upon six o'clock; I cannot say to ten minutes; Mr. Walker, a butcher, in Butcher-row, brought Mr. Austen to me; the man seemed to be very much in agitation, very distressed in his mind, and was exceedingly sick; he puked prodigiously; he had received a blow on one side of his eye; he said he had been robbed in St. Clement's church-yard; he described their persons, and some part of their dress; says he, I watched them into a house in Milford-lane; he said there was nobody passing just at that time; one of them seized me, and grasped me down behind, and the other gave me a violent blow in my body, which rendered me as unable of speech, as if I had been a corpse: I went where he directed me; I went down this lane; there are three houses all alike; and the others fall in six or seven feet, and have little yards before them; he shewed me the house which he thought was the right one; I saw a woman coming down this yard, where there was water in a tub, and I asked her if they had a couple of young men lodged in the house, she said yes; I went gently up stairs, and looked through the keyhole, but there was no light at all; the woman came up stairs presently; says she, I suppose there is nobody at home, so I went down stairs, and asked the woman of the house, if the young men that lodged up stairs were at home; says she, I have no young men, I have nobody but Hooper, who lodges up stairs, and a young fellow that has been with him lately, a gentleman's servant that was gone to place in the Temple; she said, she had nobody else but an old waterman or fireman; knowing this Hooper, we went down to him; and he said he lodged in the garret, and from something that he said, I made further enquiry what kind of people lodged in the house; I went again on the Saturday, and saw Macmanus, and I communicated the business to him; says he, I will call on you to-morrow morning; and he and I and Townsend went to the house; the woman of the house was then in bed; I said, are these young men that you chuse to deny to me at home now? yes, says she, but I beg your pardon, I recollect myself, I thought you was come to take down names for the militia; this was my excuse, says she; they belong to the play house, and very honest young men they are indeed; I went up stairs, and knocked at the door; one of them was just got up; he opened the door to me; I then opened my commission, and told them I was come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130010"></xptr> to take them about a robbery; then I fetched Mr. Austen, and the minute he came up, he pointed to the two men; there, says he, are the two men that robbed me, one pinioned me; they then said, why Mr. Austen you know us very well; you do not mean to swear our lives away, and the landlady will prove it; when we came down stairs, the woman said, she knew the two prisoners to be her lodgers, but did not know the prosecutor: good God, Mrs. Mercer! says one of the prisoners, do not you remember his coming with his boots and umbrella under his arm; did not you light him up? When we came to the office, Hardy called me out several times, and wanted to send me of an errand, and wanted to shuffle to go to the necessary, and seemed a good deal upon the fidget, and I did much like it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott. Was Austen perfectly sober the night you first saw him? - Yes, he stood close to me, and if he had any liquor, I must have known it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hardy. What kind of latch did you find at my door? - I found no latch.</p>
               <p>Did you hear a little dog bark? - I cannot say; I will not say.</p>
               <p>Do you think there is no latch to my door? - No.</p>
               <p>When you took us, did not you ask us, can you prove where you were at that time? - You said you could prove it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did these men tell you, when you took them on the Sunday morning, where they had been on the Friday night? - I do not recollect that they did; their discourse was to Macmanus.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. Did not we tell you where we were on Friday night as we were going up Bridges-street? - I do not upon my oath recollect.</p>
               <p>How many beds were there in the room? - One bed; it is a little room separate from the main room; a little dark room with no window; there was but one bedstead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hardy. Was I in bed or up when you came in? - You was in bed, and when I fetched Austen, you was up.</p>

               <p>Did they in the presence of Austen, charge him with any offence? - Yes, they did, and said he had been there, and brought a boy with him; they said he had been there several times; I searched them; one of them had no money at all, the other had fourteen or fifteen shillings; there was a crown piece, and the rest in silver; I shewed the money to Austen; he knew nothing of the money.</p>

               <p>Did not you say yourself, after the man had sworn to us, that you was of opinion we were innocent men? - No, I do not think I did; I said, I did not like to have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130011"></xptr> any thing to do with the business, and if I had known of it, I would not have gone after you at all.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect immediately on these men being charged by Austen the prosecutor; their declaring where they were at the time of t he robbery? - I do not know that they did then, but they did in an hour afterwards, or something less.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the place that they mentioned? - They mentioned several places; I cannot say I can charge my memory with any of them, except that they mentioned drinking with a servant near Old-street-road; some brewer's servant, I think, but I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hardy. Was any body suffered to come near us till the Monday morning? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. When they had mentioned where they had been, was the prosecutor Austen present? - I do not know indeed, I should rather think he might be there; if I was to say any thing, I would say to that, I do not know for certainty.</p>

I owe you none; yes, says I, you do, and if you do not pay us, I will summons you for it; this was about fifteen minutes after four; Hardy was waiting the corner of Gough-square; we went immediately from there to Old street; I went to enquire for

My Lord, we are innocent men, and here are persons in Court who will prove to you where we were at the time; and I am sorry to add, that the prosecutor has only done this through wilfulness, he could not say it was a mistake, because he knew us, and could not be mistaken; that I am very sorry to inform your Lordship is the case.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Coker, the brewer; I have been in the family twelve years; I know the prisoner Watts; I knew him a boy.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect his calling upon you on the 27th of October? - I do, perfectly well.</p>
               <p>What time of the evening was it? - About half after four; he called at our house, and I spoke to him, and asked him to walk in; he said, he had a person waiting at the gate; I went to the gate with him, and we walked on talking to Golden-lane; I was without a hat; I said, I would not go any farther, and I asked him to drink; we went into a house and had a pot of beer, and during the time we sat there, he said, he had been out of employ sometime, and would be very much obliged to me to lend him half a guinea; I went home and brought a crown piece, and five shillings and sixpence; there was an old gentleman, my mistress's uncle; and the maid servant said, he had had his tea; I looked at the clock, and it wanted a quarter of six; I am perfectly sure of the time, because I took the candle and looked at the clock in the kitchen; they sent to me on the Monday morning following to speak to me at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Who was that other person who was at the gate? - It is the man that stands here; I am perfect of it; he went into the public<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130013"></xptr> house with us; the two men at the bar were the two men that drank with us.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You are intimate with Watts now I presume? - I never saw him since I saw him in Bow-street; I knew him from a boy; I was first acquainted with him at Ipswich in Suffolk; I was only acquainted with him by seeing him by chance; I have heard since he has been in trouble now, that he has been in difficulties before, but I do not know it to a certainty.</p>
               <p>Then it is only by chance that they met with you? - Not lately.</p>
               <p>It was perfectly an accidental visit? - It was.</p>
               <p>I suppose he did not know where you lived? - Yes, he did, for about a month before, I met him in the street and told him.</p>
               <p>What are you now? - A servant to Mr. Croker of Old-street.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the day of the week that you was drinking at this ale-house? - Friday; it is the Goat, the corner of Cherry-tree-alley.</p>
               <p>Who keeps this house? - I do not know; I never was in the house before nor since.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been paid this half guinea which he borrowed of you? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you ask him for it at Bow-street? - No Sir; I could not think of asking a man in trouble for half a guinea.</p>
               <p>You had no acquaintance with Hardy before? - Never.</p>
               <p>Court. Having no acquaintance with Hardy before, you are sure it was not Hardy, but Watts you lent the half-guinea to? - It was Watts I gave it to.</p>
               <p>Hardy did not ask you for it? - I do not recollect that he did.</p>
               <p>Would you have lent it to Hardy, a perfect stranger, if he had asked you for it; - I do not think I should.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott. Are you sure of the man that you lent the half-guinea to? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How came you to know them both? - I know them by sight; by acquaintance; by speaking to them.</p>
               <p>Do you remember seeing them on the 27th of October? - I met them; I met Mr. Hardy and that young man; we went and drank a dram together, and we bid good night; as near as I can guess it might be about six in the evening; I am sure of the time; and his wife came to me on the Sunday night following, and informed me her husband was in trouble, and desired me to come and speak for him, which I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then Hardy is a married man? - Yes, I knew him before he was married.</p>

               <p>Do you remember every body that used to call at Mrs. Mercer's? - It was not my business particularly, but being in the passage cleaning my knives, I took notice of him because he was coming to the house.</p>
               <p>Do you take notice of every person that comes? - Our business lays by the sight; by taking notice of people.</p>
               <p>You did not observe when this person went into the house? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>In what state of mind was he? - Sir, he seemed to be very much disordered at his first coming, but he had got rather better of that, but he was not well when he came away from me; I acquainted his wife with it when he went away; he came one evening in a coach to our door, and demanded a man and maid to go with him to fetch his wife; he was told we should not; he got a man and maid at the next door.</p>

               <p>I live No. 1, Milford-lane; I have known the two prisoners since the 23d of August; they were very regular; they used to go out in the evening; they left their candle with me, and lighted it and went up stairs; they came home sometimes at eleven, and sometimes later; I did not know that they followed any business; I had a good character of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. They both lodged in your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They followed no business? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>How did they live? - I do not know; I always enquire their character, so far that they were sober honest people; and that they would pay me; I was told that they were very honest men.</p>
               <p>What business did they tell you they followed? - They were gardeners by trade; Mrs. Hardy came backwards and forwards every week of her life; she did not constantly live there; Hardy told me she was attending a person that was sick at Hoxton; I let every body in and out.</p>
               <p>And they came in and out constantly every night? - Always; they never slept out of the house a night; they first came to the house on the 23d of August.</p>
               <p>When were they taken up for this offence? - That I cannot justly say the day.</p>
               <p>I will tell you, the 29th of October? - They never were taken up before at my house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130016"></xptr>Were they taken up in September? - Not in my house; they slept in my house regularly every night, from August till October.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that the man was in custody in September? - No.</p>
               <p>Then that could not have happened without your knowing it as you let him in every night? - Mr. James and his wife were in, if Hardy was not; they took the candle of me, and always left the candle in the morning, till the morning they were taken; they went out about eleven; they went out sometimes sooner and sometimes later.</p>
               <p>What hour did they in general go out? - Sometimes by ten o'clock; sometimes they did not go out till after dinner.</p>
               <p>Now these two honest men used to go out about ten, then at what time did you use to shut up your doors to go to bed? - About eleven, or half after eleven.</p>
               <p>Did not it strike you as very odd that gardeners should lay in bed till ten o'clock in the morning? - I knew they were out of business.</p>
               <p>What business were they in? - Why kept a shop in Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Of what kind? - Green grocers and other business too, that is what Mrs. Hardy told me; that was not since I knew them.</p>
               <p>How came you to deny them to Talboy? - I never did deny them to Talboy.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - Yes, I can safely swear it; my mangle was making a noise, I told Talboy I had a Mr. Hooper in the garret, and a young man that had not slept in the house some time; he was in the country; he is with me now.</p>
               <p>How came you to forget these two friends of yours in the one pair of stairs? - I did not think of them; he did not ask me, he only asked me for the others; says I, he has never asked me of the one pair of stairs; but if he had I could not tell their Christian names.</p>
               <p>How many beds were in this room? - When they came they had two beds and one bedstead; they had but one bedstead; I saw the things come, they came in a cart.</p>
               <p>When did you first learn their Christian names? - He was always called James in the house; I could not have told his Christian name when Talboy came; I have learned since Mr. Hardy always called him Jem.</p>
               <p>Then you knew his Christian name? - I say I did not know Hardy's Christian name.</p>
               <p>Hardy's wife had no apartments at your house? - She never did lay there that I know on; the wife was with a lady in the country.</p>
               <p>Court. There was but one bedstead then? - No, one bedstead and two beds; I never was in the room once, since he has been in the house; I never was in Hardy's room at all, when he was in it, only once with his wife.</p>
               <p>Did not you know how the rooms in your house were furnished? - They had their own furniture; I saw the bedstead conveyed out of the yard into the cart; and there was was only one bedstead and two beds; I do not know how they laid in the beds.</p>
               <p>Then one might be in one room and one in the other? - They might move them one into each room, because one is a dark room and one a light one.</p>
               <p>When you was in Mr. Hardy's room how was it then, was there a bed in that room? - No, not in the fore room.</p>
               <p>Have not you been in the fore room more than once? - Never but once, only since Mr. Hardy has been confined; I never was in the back room at all; the way into the back room is through the fore room.</p>
               <p>When you was in the fore room there was no bed in it? - No, no bed.</p>
               <p>Did you know Austen? - I knew him by serving me with milk and garden stuff, when I lived in the Bolt and Ton passage, that is about a year and a half ago; when I heard who he was, I recollected his face again; but when he came down stairs following Mr. Hardy, I could no more have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130017"></xptr> known him than a person I never saw; I did not then recollect that I had ever seen him before.</p>
               <p>Had you lately seen him before in your house? - No, I had not, my servant had; I once saw him go out of doors; I think he was the same man, but I cannot be sure; I saw his side face, and I said, to my girl, there is that tall gentleman that goes up to Mr. Hardy; she has a deal more opportunity of seeing people that come to my lodgers than I have.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose it would have been impossible for Hardy's wife to have slept with him night after night without your knowing it? - Yes, I think it would.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. How long have you lived there? - Since Michaelmas; I did live before that at No. 31, Stanhope-street.</p>
               <p>Why do you say it was an assault? I will read it to you. (Reads)</p>

               <p>I live in Brick-lane; I know the prisoner Hardy; I have known him this fourteen years; I have known Watts these two years; they have both very good characters for what I know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Where have they lived all this time, in London? - No Sir, in the country, and his wife; I knew him in Hoxton, and in Drury-lane; and I never heard any thing bad of them before in my life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Perry. Do you know how long he was in custody on that charge that you bailed him for? - As nigh as I can guess about two nights.</p>
               <p>Do you know for a certainty? - I believe it was two nights.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. (After summing up the evidence.) Gentlemen, the fact of the robbery rests on the positive testimony of the prosecutor; and there is no other positive<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130018"></xptr> proof of that fact. One extraordinary circumstance is, that at that time of the evening when Butcher-row is so full, they should commit the robbery; another extraordinary circumstance is, that they should go directly to their own lodgings. It rests with you to consider which side you will believe, for it is certainly impossible to reconcile the evidence; it is so contradictory; and there must be perjury on the one side or on the other. It is for you, considering all the circumstances I have stated to you, to say on which side in your opinion the truth lies; whether the story which is told by Austen, confirmed in the circumstances in which it is capable of being confirmed, as you have heard it, liable to the objection from the nature of the robbery itself, in a frequented street at that time of night; or whether the story of their witnesses is true; that they were at another part of the town till eight that night, before which time, if at all, this robbery must have been committed. You will weigh the matter well, for you will consider that a great deal depends on your determining this matter right; for it would be a very shocking thing that two innocent men should be convicted on that evidence, which was not true, and which was known to be not true by the prosecutor at the time. On the other hand, it is a very great aggravation of their offence, to attempt now to blind the eyes of a Jury by false witnesses. You have the whole of the evidence before you; you will consider all the circumstances, and pronounce whether the prisoners are guilty or not.</p>

               <p>Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. Justice WILSON.</p>
               <p>N. B. When sentence of death was pronounced on the capital convicts, the prisoner Hardy addressed the Court as follows: My Lord, we are innocent men, and our prosecutor knows it, though he has sworn our lives away; he knows he was our acquaintance before: there never was so deliberate a piece of villainy brought before a Court of Justice; we have prepared a letter to send to the prosecutor, and we are endeavouring to make our peace with God; but we are really innocent men if we seal it with our bloods.</p>
               <p>Court. Having now been convicted, it rests wholly with your Sovereign; the Court has no power.</p>

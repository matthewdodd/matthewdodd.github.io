On the 12th of March about a quarter before six in the evening, I and another young man was in the warehouse, we perceived a man lurking about the street and looking through the window two or three times; as there had been several robberies committed in that neighbourhood about that time of the evening, we suspected that he had a design, in consequence of that suspicion I went into a place myself on a stair case, which is situated exactly opposite the door, so likewife the other man secreted himself in another part of the warehouse, and we staid there a little time, when the prisoner at the bar came into the passage; he opened the door, which occasioned the bell ringing, (I am certain it was him) hearing of the bell he withdrew for the space of a minute or two, and finding that nobody attended to the bell he came forward again in a minute or two, and the door being before opened, he went to the counter, where there stood some goods, and took hold of a piece of linen, and was in the act of taking it away, when Mr. Walton, who is the other witness, came forward, the prisoner, when he heard him coming forward, he turned back and placed the piece of goods in the same place from where he took it; I saw him coming forward also, and pursued him; he had taken them up from the counter, and turned his back on the counter going off; the goods were in his hand, going out with it, and in going out Mr. Walton had come to the door and rather jammed to the door, which detained him. but having gone so far that we could not stop him there, I opened the door and rushed on them, and took him about two paces from the threshold in the street; I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Davis lives there, it is his house? - It is. This is the piece of goods which he took up, and which I marked before the alderman.</p>
               <p>Q.Was Mr. Davis at home at the time? - He was up stairs; he don't know any thing of the transaction.</p>

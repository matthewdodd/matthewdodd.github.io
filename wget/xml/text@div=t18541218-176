                  </hi>. I live in Red Cow-lane, Mile End-road. Last Saturday week I was in Stratford—I know Mr. Barnes's shop—I saw some cheeses on the board outside his shop—I saw the prisoner take one cheese—he walked about five or six yards, and then crossed the road, and walked back on the opposite side of the way, past the shop—I went to the shop, and went with the shopman about 200 yards past the shop—I saw the prisoner cross the road, and put the cheese in a gateway—the shopman collared him—he tried to get away—another young man came up, and lent a hand, and the prisoner was taken—I took the cheese, and carried it back to the owner's.</p>

On Saturday week he had five cheeses on the board—I was not in the shop when the last witness came—I went after him by my master's direction—I overtook him, and saw the prisoner coming out of the gateway where the cheese was found—this is my master's cheese—it is worth about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

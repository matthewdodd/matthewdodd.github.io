Upon getting to the bottom of the court under a dark archway, the prisoner came towards me, and ran violently against my chest with his head and shoulders, at the same time he gave a violent tug at my watch - nobody<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182012060015"></xptr>else was near. I felt and found the seals were gone, but the watch remained - he ran away; I pursued calling Stop thief! and caught him before he got five steps from me. Somebody then seized me behind by the shoulders, and he got away. Upon getting from the man who held me, I again caught him about eight yards off, and a man rushed up and rescued him. I received a violent blow on my neck - he struck me again, and got off down Clement's-lane. I got from the other and pursued him again, calling Stop thief! Mr. Wall put out his hands, and he surrendered without my losing sight of him. I collared him, several people came up, and the other man then came up and said I had no business to take the law into my own hands; I said he was one of them - he left immediately. I have not recovered my seals - Bowden was with me,</p>

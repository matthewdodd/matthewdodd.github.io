               <p>MR. A. PHILLIPS conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>MR. RICHARD GALLOWAY. I am the son of Mr. Alexander Galloway, and assist him in his business; the prisoner Davidson was employed by my father as a <rs id="t18271206-44-deflabel216" type="occupation">clerk</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18271206-44-defend351 t18271206-44-deflabel216"></join>; it was part of his duty to receive all materials which came to the premises, weigh them, see that they corresponded with the delivery notes, and enter them in the book; Coleman was our <rs id="t18271206-44-deflabel217" type="occupation">carman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18271206-44-defend349 t18271206-44-deflabel217"></join>; I have no share in the business - my father has no partner. On the 25th of October, Coleman was employed to fetch some iron from Crawshaw's yard, in Upper Thames-street, and bring it to our manufactory in West-street, Smithfield; in consequence of information, I went to Mr. Llewellyn's premises, the Waterloo Foundry, Cow-cross, near St. John's-street - I believe it is in the City: I saw some Langley-field pig-iron there - it is the same sort of iron as was to be brought from Crawshaw's; we had never sold any of it to Llewellyn, nor any kind of iron; he was not a customer of ours; in consequence of this, I had some conversation with Davidson; I did not hold out either threat or promise to him; I taxed him with having sold to Mr. Llewellyn two tons weight of this Langley-field pig-iron; he admitted it; he said he had sold it to Mr. Llewellyn, and it was in consequence of his being involved in difficult circumstances; that he had sold it for, I think, 6l. a ton - the market price was about 8l.; he said he had received 4l. from Llewellyn on account. Coleman's cart was employed all day, on the 25th of October, in bringing iron from Crawshaw's wharf; I gave him the order myself - it is necessary I should say, that when we have a lot of iron at a wharf, I merely order it to be fetched up till it is all removed; a two-horse cartload would be two tons. or two tons and a half; he had two horses that day; I know Davidson's hand-writing -(looking at a book) - this is his hand-writing; here is an entry of iron, on the 25th of October, from Crawshaw's - it is 19 tons, 7 cwt., 2 qrs., and 12 lbs. - that is the total quantity he has entered as brought on the 24th.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you conversed with Davidson, did you say, "Why, Sir, here is something awkward, and it will be better for you to tell the truth?" A. I do not recollect having said so; I think I can swear I did not; I certainly did not hold him out any inducement - it was quite unnecessary; I say I held him out no promise or threat whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say he was in a bad scrape, and had better tell the truth? A. I really do not think I said any thing af the sort; I will swear to neither one nor the other, but, to the best of my recollection, I did not say it would be better for him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you tell us all that passed between you? A. The moment the information was communicated to me, and I had made the necessary inquiries, the cart(which was then employed to bring iron from another wharf,) was entering the yard; I called Davidson into the counting-house; I desired him to bring his book, and show me how many loads of iron had been brought into the yard by Coleman that morning; he brought his book, and stated that only two had been brought in; I then asked him whether he meant the one in the yard to be the second or third, and he admitted that to be the second; I then asked him whether he had not given Coleman orders to take a load into St. John's-street, and he admitted that he had; I asked him by whose authority, and he admitted that he had received no instructions from myself, my father, or brothers, to that effect; I then asked him whether he and Coleman had agreed together, why the iron should be left at Dobell's yard, or whether he was to give him any thing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. This relates to another indictment? A. Yes; he then said he had given him orders to take two tons odd to Dobell's yard, on the previous week, of this Langley-field iron and that he had given Coleman 2l. as a share of the plunder.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you told us all you said to him before he told you this? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You said before, that you would not swear you had not said it would be better for him to tell the whole truth - have you still a doubt whether you held him out any inducement? A. I will undertake to swear I held him out no threat or promises previous to the conversation I have now stated.</p>
               <p>MR. C. PHILLIPS. Q. Will you undertake to swear that, at any time during the conversation, you did not say something to this effect, that he was in trouble, and it would be better for him to tell all about it? A. I really believe I said nothing of the sort - I swear positively I did not say any thing to that effect, previous to the conversation I have just stated.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell at what period of the conversation you might have said it? A. I do not admit that it occurred at all; I will not undertake to swear on so trivial a thing, because it might have been said by me, though, to the best of my recollection, I did not say it at all - I will swear I did not say it previous to the conversation I have stated; if I did say it, it must have been after the facts were before him in such a way, that nothing but downright lies would have excused him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you say that before he said any thing about the entries in his book, you did not say it would be better for him to tell the truth about it? A. I will.</p>
               <p>MR. A. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he say any thing of the entries of the quantity brought on the 25th? A. He admitted that two tons had been sold to Llewellyn; I said to him you have ordered Coleman to leave a load of iron at Dobell's yard, by whose authority did you do so; he admitted it was by no authority; I asked if he had not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060040"></xptr>ordered Coleman to leave two tons odd of Langley-field iron last week; he admitted that he had, and by nobodys authority; and he admitted that the two tons odd formed part of the nineteen tons which he had entered in the book, as having arrived in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. A short time after this, I believe, you saw Coleman? A. Yes; in a minute afterwards, I asked if he had left a load of iron that morning at Dobell's yard; he said he had, and by Mr. Davidson's order: I asked if had received any thing for delivering that iron at Dobell's; he at first said Mr. Davidson had lent him 1l.; I asked if Davidson had not given him the 1l.; he said No, and equivocated very much; he said at last that he had received 2l. from Davidson; I then asked whether he had not delivered, in the previous week, a load of iron at Dobell's - that was the iron in question - he then said he had delivered a load of Langley-field iron on the previous week at Dobell's, and by Davidson's order - I then asked why he had not mentioned it to me that he had delivered it, as he must know there was something wrong in it, and if he had any delivery note from Mr. Davidson - he said No, and that he was going to mention it to me - I asked why he allowed such a length of time to pass without mentioning it, it being upwards of ten days - he did not answer, and the conversation ended.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it usual for the carmen to deliver goods before they came to the premises, with or without an order? A. Never without a delivery note and a receipt - we never sent iron out without its being previously weighed, and in two instances this was not weighed, as it was drawn away from the wharf; it should be weighed at the wharf, if taken from there, and if from our place it should be weighed there; Coleman had been our carter eighteen months, or near two years, and understood the business perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. C. PHILLIPS. Q. Had not Davidson a superior situation to that of Coleman? A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you ask if he had given him orders, if he had not power to order him? A. If I am engaged I cannot go out to give the carmen orders, and Davidson sometimes did; I did not ask Coleman whether he had delivered iron at Dobell's, but if had not delivered it, it was for him to deny it; he said at once that he had.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When does the iron become your property? A. When it is invoiced to us - it is ours when it is at the wharf; this iron was bought by us from Crawshaw's yard; I believe I was present at the purchase; the party who sold it put the order into my hands, for Crawshaw's to deliver it to us; it was my father's property when it lay at the wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. Then had not Davidson a power to direct the carmen to take it away? A. After I had issued orders to that effect; I myself ordered Coleman to bring it all from Crawshaw's to our yard; if contrary directions had been afterwards given, there would have been a written order delivered to the carman.</p>
               <p>Q. How long, in the common way of business, would the iron have been removing from the yard? A. That depends upon how we are engaged.</p>

               <p>Q. Should you expect to see it there in less than a week or ten days? A. No, if the carts were otherwise employed - if Davidson ordered it elsewhere in that time, the carman had no authority to take it without a written order.</p>
               <p>Q. Davidson had power to order him to move it? A. He had the power of seducing the carman; he had the power to order; I do not say he had a right.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Dobell, a publican, of St. John's-street, the corner of Peter's-lane; he has a yard in Peter's-lane, for killing cattle, and stable room, which he lets out; in October I saw a cart load of iron brought to master's yard, by the prisoner Coleman, and shot down - it was Mr. Galloway's cart - I asked Coleman why he brought it there, as there was never any there before; he said a gentleman would be there presently who belonged to it; he put it into the middle part of the yard; it remained there nearly a week; nobody came about it, till Mr. Llewellyn called with his carman, and took it away in a cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. C. PHILLIPS. Q. Coleman brought the iron in Mr. Galloway's cart? A. Yes; I saw the name on it; it came about eleven o'clock in the day; every body coming to the yard must have seen it - there was no concealment about it.</p>

St. John's-street, Smithfield, my yard is in Peter's-lane, which is in Middlesex; one morning, about the middle of October, I saw several pigs of iron in the middle of the yard; Davidson and Llewellyn were at my house between seven and eight o'clock on the morning, after I saw the iron there; Llewellyn said, in Davidson presence, that he had been up my yard, and bought some iron; I said I could not think whose iron it was, I could not think who took the liberty of putting it there; Davidson said, "It is my iron - I thought you would have no objection to my putting it there, as you have plenty of room;" I never had iron there before; I have beasts and bacon, and carts kept there.</p>

            . I live at No. 13, Greenhill's-rents, and am an iron-founder; my foundery is in Cow-cross - I know Davidson - I met him in Cow-cross, on Wednesday, the 31st of October; he said, "Llewellyn, do you want any iron?" I said, "What, do you deal in pig-iron?" he said he had got some pig-iron, which he had taken for a bad debt - I asked where it was; he said,"Up in Dobell's yard" - I said I would go and look at it; he went with me, and pointed it out; it is what we call No. 2 iron, and marked "Langley-field" - I asked what he wanted for it; he said, 6l. a ton - I said, "I have got iron at 6l. a ton, which will answer my purpose, at six months' credit" - I agreed to give him 5l. 10s., and to pay him next week; he asked if I could not give him a part then, as he was very short of money, and was fitting up a shop - I gave him two sovereigns, and on the Saturday following, he called, and I gave him two more - I have used some of the iron - Mr. Galloway has seen what was left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long before you bought it had you this conversation? A. We went straight to the yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Flying Horse public-house, in Oxford-street. The prisoner was in my service for a month—I missed a dram-glass while she was with me, and I suspected brandy was gone—I com<lb></lb>plained to the prisoner of missing the glass, and said I thought it was up stairs, if she would go and look she might find it—I noticed the brandy-cock in the bar dripping, so as to be convinced somebody had used it—that was on Sunday morning, and I had no customers that morning—I told the prisoner I thought she had been doing something wrong—she said she did not know that she had—I said, "I suspect you have been drawing the brandy"—she said she had not—I insisted on seeing her box opened, saying, "There is also a dram-glass missing; I suspect you have that"—she walked up stairs with me—she did not give me the key at first—she dared me to unlock it except in the presence of the police—I said, "Allow me to unlock it, and you shall open it," which she did, and the first thing I saw was the glass, a soda-water bottle with some brandy in it, a port-bottle, a sherry-bottle, and some cheroots—I can identify the glass, because I have half-a-dozen of this pattern, and this cor<lb></lb>responds with them—the brandy I know to be mine by trying it by an instrument, and it is the same sort as that I have—I believe it is part of my brandy—I would not swear to the cheroots, but I believe them to be mine—I believe the empty bottles are mine, I had such.</p>

PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose you missed the glass? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; my wife told me she missed it—we both missed it—I told the Magistrate so—I have no mark on the glass—I should not have known it if I had seen it any where else—the prisoner said I might see her box, for she had nothing in it belonging to me—she tried to open it, and I said, "Give me the key"—it was then that she said I dared not open it without a policeman—she said she had had the brandy some time; she had it when she had the fever—it is the same strength as the brandy I had down stairs—there is nothing very peculiar in it—it was rather strong—I will not swear to it, but I verily believe it is mine—I dare say there is a great deal of the same strength in London—there was a label on the bottle, and here</p>

               <p>is a mark on it where it was—I would not swear to the empty bottles—I can swear to this eye-glass from its being broken right across—I have had it two years—it is starred, and a small bit is broken out of the centre—it is of no value—I had property of value in my house—the policeman searched her trunk all over in my presence, bat found nothing but these things—the prisoner had no opportunity of going to her trunk before I examined her—she complained that my wife had been at her box a few days before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I opened the box with a key which Mr. Flagg gave me, and found these articles—the prisoner said they were her own, that Mr. Flagg dared not do any thing to her, and he ought to have had me in before he looked into her box—this eye-glass was found on her at the station-house—she said she had picked it up.</p>

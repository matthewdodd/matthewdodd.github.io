                  </hi>. I keep an ironmonger's shop in Hungerford-street, Strand. About six o'clock in the evening, on the 24th of Jan., a witness came to my shop—I missed a tea-pot and four candlesticks, which I had seen safe at two o'clock in the afternoon—I accompanied Pocock to a marine-store dealer's in Newport-market, kept by Freegrove—the officer asked her if she had bought any candlesticks—she denied that she had—he then questioned her very closely, and she admitted she had bought two, but had sent them out of the house, and she wished me to go with her to fetch them—the officer went with her, and brought two candlesticks, which I swear to as mine.</p>

I was under the arches of the Adelphi on Saturday, the 24th of Jan.—Claxton and another boy came to me with a pair of candlesticks—they got a boy named King to mind them—they went away for about five minutes, and then brought another pair of candlesticks—they then went to Newport-market—I went with them to Freegrove's shop—I did not go in—I saw her come out to look at the boys—they were then going on, and they, sent me back—I am sure Claxton was one—he said to the other boy, "You did not fetch them out of the shop; I fetched them out of the shop; you only took them of me."</p>

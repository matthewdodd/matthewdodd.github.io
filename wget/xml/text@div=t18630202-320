On the morning of 23d January, about 9 o'clock, I examined the prosecutor's premises, and found the shutter-bars sprung, and a pane of glass broken—on the same day I found two odd boots, pawned at Mr. Wood's, and from the description I had received from the prosecutor, I fetched him, and he identified them—I saw the prisoner on the 8th at King David—lane station, and asked him how long he had had the pawn ticket—he said, "About a fortnight"—I asked him where he got it—he said that he bought it of a man dressed like a sailor—I asked where he lived—he said, "Charles-street, Drury—lane"—I asked him the number, as I should have to go there—he said, "It is no use telling a lie, I have no fixed abode; sometimes one place and sometimes another."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, Waterloo-terrace, Commercial-road, Ratcliff—on the night of 1st January, my shop was broken into, and some boots were stolen—from a noise which was heard, and which we conjectured was the wind, I believe it was about 4 in the morning—I found the shutters shifted one over the other—these two boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are part of my stock—I missed six pairs and two odd ones, worth between 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had fastened the shop the night before—the shutter was all right when I went to bed.</p>

I am in the service of my father, George Frederick Wood, a pawnbroker, of 90, St. George's street—these boots were pawned there on 2d January, by a woman, in the name of Ann Rogers—on 8th January the prisoner came there with the duplicate, and asked to release them—I sent for a constable and gave him in custody—he said that he bought the ticket of a sailor.</p>

               <p>JAMES ALPIN. On the 1st of April, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I met the prisoner on Snowhill; she accosted me, and told me there was a person at her lodgings who wanted to speak to me. I went to a house in <placeName id="t18170416-12-crimeloc68">George-alley, Fleet-market</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18170416-12-crimeloc68" type="placeName" value="George-alley, Fleet-market"></interp>

She was stopped at a house in St. Martin's-le-Grand, and five 1l. notes found upon her. I am sure the prisoner is the woman. I had a watch about me, but I did not lose that.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TAYLOR. On the 2d of April I was called to a house in Angel-alley, St. Martin's-le-Grand; I found the prosecutor there, he charged the prisoner with robbing him of seven 1l. notes; I found five 1l. notes upon her, the prosecutor claimed them, and said he was sure she was the woman; she said she had them from a friend in the country, but would not tell me his name. I produce the notes.</p>

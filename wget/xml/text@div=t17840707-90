               <p>Court. Is this Bob here? - No, I do not see him; I went contentedly with him to the watch-house, and remained till the morni ng, and in the morning I was brought before the magistrate, with my hands cuffed in this manner across, a thing I never had before; when I came before the magistrate they said I had beat them; the Justice told me to go over the way and make it up, and they put me into the lock-up house, I remained there about half an hour, when one of the men brought me into a room where this woman was sitting at a long table, and the prisoner Lefevre proposed two guineas to make it up, I told them I had no money; I told them I was nakedless and friendless; then two men came again, and handcuffed me again, and put me into a coach, and carried me to Clerkenwell Bridewell; I remained there for three days, the vessel being gone down without me, I thought it right to write to my friends, to inform them of the matter, and of the unjustified cause that I had suffered; they took consideration of me, and found I was clearly right, and bailed me out; and now it is before you, my Lord.</p>
               <p>So there was no prosecution set on foot against you? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester, Prisoner Lefevre's Counsel. So they are all leagued against you, the watchman, Justice, and every body; do not you remember offering half a guinea to make up the assault? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Then you went to the watch-house and behaved perfectly quiet all night? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not you break the watch-house? - Yes, I paid five shillings.</p>
               <p>Did you charge either of these women with a robbery that night? - I did not know the meaning of it, I told the watchman I was robbed, and the Justice.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself? - Very clearly so.</p>
               <p>And he committed you? - I was sent to gaol.</p>
               <p>Did not you offer to make it up for five guineas? - No, never in my life, I have sworn to the truth, so help me God I never did.</p>
               <p>I give you fair warning, here are people here that were present, the watchman is here; will you swear you gave the watchman a charge of these women for the robbery? - I will swear I told the watchman these women robbed me.</p>

               <p>Now, you swear positively you told the watchman and the watch-house keeper that you had been robbed? - I told the watchman, I do not know that I told the watch-house keeper.</p>

               <p>Was you sober? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why, was not you very drunk? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know the landlady of the Dundee Arms? - I cannot say I do, I was there that night, I made no disturbance there.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to the Justice, I was present at the first examination on the 2d of June, before the justice, he never in the least hinted any charge against the prisoners of robbery.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, now we have heard the evidence on both sides, and to be sure, in regard to Lefevre, at all events she could not have been convicted on this indictment, because the charge against her was for stealing; whereas, by the evidence of the prosecutor, she was below stairs at the time, therefore the whole that she could have been found guilty of was for receiving and comforting. But upon the evidence itself, you see the story is the strangest that ever was in the world; to suppose a man had been robbed, and that he should suffer himself to come before the Justice as an accused person, and never make any charged the man would naturally have said, I am injured, I have been robbed. This is positively sworn by the Justice's clerk and others.</p>

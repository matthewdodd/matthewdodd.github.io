            . I am a constable employed by the London dock company. The prisoner was a <rs id="t18101205-66-deflabel402" type="occupation">forman</rs>

On the 6th of November, about half past three, I went into the warehouse, No. 2, situated by <placeName id="t18101205-66-crimeloc403">Brewer's-lane, St. John's, Wapping</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18101205-66-crimeloc403" type="placeName" value="Brewer's-lane, St. John's, Wapping"></interp>

In going into the warehouse I saw the prisoner in the act of delivering something out of his hand between two casks, as my appearing he catched his hand away very sharp. I went immediately to the place, I put my hand in there, found a bladder containing three pints of foreign brandy; I asked him what he thought of himself, and what he knew of it, he looked confused and made no answer; I took off his hat, there I found another bladder, containing three pints more of brandy, he begged I would forgive him. I took him in custody. These four bottles contain all the brandy I found in the two bladders.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep a toy-shop at Hounslow. On the 25th of Nov. the prisoner came, and looked at several different articles—she said she had been a few days before with Mrs. Woodbridge's little girl, and said her name was Elizabeth Woodbridge, and on that account I showed her some things—I let her have an accordion and a doll—she was to pay on Saturday evening, or the first thing on Monday morning—I then made inquiries, saw a policeman, and gave him information—we went where she lodged, and saw the accordion on a box—these things, which I know are some of my property, were beside the accordion—she was there, and some of them fell from her person—I am sure these three brooches, ring, and buckle are mine—I have since missed them—she had an opportunity of taking them while in my shop, as I went into the parlour.</p>

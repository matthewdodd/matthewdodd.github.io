               <p>Q.Did you hear what he said before the Magistrate? - A. Yes; it was taken down in writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any mark upon that found at the prisoner's lodgings? - A. No; only upon that found at Johnson's; the person who took the examination before the Magistrate not being in Court, the prisoners were found</p>

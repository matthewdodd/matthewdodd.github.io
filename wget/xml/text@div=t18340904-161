I am surgeon to the parish of St. Luke's - I was requested to open the body of the deceased - there was an external mark near the collar-bone, and I found the vessels were overcharged, and there was an effusion on the lungs, which was the effect of some violence - there was some discolouration, which possibly might have arisen from cupping - the injury on the collar-bone would, no doubt, have produced the effects which I saw - there was extravasation of blood sufficient to cause death, no doubt.</p>

            . I live in White Cross-street, and am a surgeon. I attended the deceased five days after he received the injury - he was suffering from a severe attack of erysipelas, attended with a great deal of fever and delirium - I found a great tumefaction over the collar-bone - I inquired if he had received a blow, and was told he had in a scuffle - I applied the proper remedies to arrest the inflammation, which produced no effect - I have every reason to believe he died from the effect of the blow - he was about the same size as the prisoner, but rather a weakly man - the blow was the exciting cause of his death - the immediate cause was the inflammation - he was a very bad subject for any thing of that kind - if he had had attention earlier, he might have recovered.</p>

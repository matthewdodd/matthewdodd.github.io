                  </hi>. I am a collector, and live in the Clapham Road—on 2nd September, about 12. 10 at night, I was passing along Blackman Street, Borough—Connor ran across my path, and made a snatch at my watch<lb></lb>chain—the chain broke, and he got the watch—he ran away down a court—I was about to follow when Cleary ran across my path, got down the court before me, and placed himself across the court, preventing me securing Connor—I endeavoured to push on one side, and eventually succeeded—I pushed past him, and when I got to the end of the court I found it was dark, and I came back—I saw Cleary standing at the top of the court—I ran towards him—he pulled the gate and ran off in the direction of Mint Street—I called out "Police!"—12 <hi rend="italic">M</hi> came up and I gave him information—I saw both the prisoners at 4.30 the same morning, at the police-station, and picked them out from five or six others—I am quite certain they are the men—I have not seen my watch since.</p>

I was on duty in Trinity Street and Blackman Street about 12. 10, and heard cries of "Police!" and I ran down to the court and saw the prosecutor—I went down the court into Mint Street, and while standing there a man came by—the prosecutor looked at him and said "I think that is the man"—I took the man to the station, and the prosecutor said then he was not the man at all—he gave a description of the two, and I went back again to the Mint and saw Connor in a shop—I put my hand on his shoulder, and said "Connor, I want you—he said "What for?"—I said "For stealing a watch in Blackman Street"—he said "Very well, I will go, I know nothing about it"—on the way to the station he said "How came you to know me?"—I said "I have known you some time"—he said "Do you think if I had the watch I should have been here now?"—I went again to the Mint with 175, and saw Cleary standing there—I had known him some time, but not in that name—we</p>

               <p>went to a lodging-house and looked round, and then we went to Williams lodging-house and saw Cleary in bed; 175 told him the charge—he said he wished he had a gold watch—at first he said he was in bed at 9 o'clock, and afterwards at 12 o'clock—I saw him myself after 12 o'clock—I was present when the prosecutor picked them out—they were put with three more—two out of the cells and one man came out of the street—he went in front of Cleary and then at the back, and he saw the white on his coat and picked him out—the man I took first was like Connor—there is a gate at the end of the court; it is generally open.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came on board my ship, the St. Mary's Planter, to work; he came on board I think on Wednesday was a fortnight in the morning, he came to discharge a cargo; we lost a small quantity of old rope of no great value; we missed it that morning; I was down in my cabin, and the boy came and told me the prisoner had taken some rope from the ship; the prisoner was in the boat; I called him to come back, and he would not; either he or the waterman made answer, that the rope did not come out of my ship, and they pulled on shore, and took the rope with them; the rope has never been seen since, I saw it the day before, it was a piece of old buoy rope, about four or five fathom long; the prisoner was taken up the next day.</p>

               <p>Can you say you are sure it was your buoy-rope that was in the boat? - Yes.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday fortnight the prisoner was drinking at a public house between nine and ten, he employed me to row him on board the St. Mary Planter; he returned down the ship's gangway with a piece of rope; he laid it down in the boat; I heard a noise in the ship; he said, it is none of their rope, row me to Shadwell-dock; but before the boat got to the stairs, he sprung into another boat, and run up the stairs; I asked him for my fare, and he damned my eyes; whether he threw the rope into the water or took it with him, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jury to Sidney. Why did not you row back to the ship? - I did not see the boat after me; when I saw the boat after me the prisoner sprung out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He heard them call, and he answered, damn your eyes, if they want me let them come after me.</p>

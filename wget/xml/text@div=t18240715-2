I collared him, and took twelve pairs of stockings from his hand; I asked how he came by them - he said he picked them up. I took him into the shop. They belonged to Mr. Vaughan - I had put them into the window myself, about a week before. I know them by a private mark on one pair; they were tied in one parcel. He was given in charge. Seaton saw him in the shop. Mr. Vaughan took the stockings to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Vaughan. I heard the window crack, and immediately ran out to the front window, which had been broken, but seeing nothing I went in. I afterwards recollected the window in Theobald's-road; I went there, and missed a dozen of stockings, and a dozen of caps. I went outside, looked about, came in, and presently I saw a man's hand inside the window, taking this dozen of stockings out - I immediately told Hunt to run - I followed, got up to him in a moment, and the prisoner was then in his custody. I saw nobody else in the street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What became of the stockings - A. They were given to us on the following morning, at Hatton-garden. The window had been cracked a little before, but was not broken. I heard him say he had picked them up.</p>

            . On the morning of the 7th of September, about three o'clock, I was called up by the watchman, who told me that my warehouse and printing office doors were both open. The property was missing both from my warehouse and the printing office.</p>
               <p>Q. How are they connected with the house, be so good as to describe the situation of your dwelling house - A. The dwelling house is connected with the printing office; the back door goes into the yard, and then you ascend a small flight of steps into the printing office; they are distinct buildings, but in the same yard, we go from one to the other without going into the street. On searching the premises with the watchman I discovered that the robbers, by removing a pane of glass in the warehouse window, where the paper was, had opened a window and got in; they forced the warehouse door open and got into the printing office. I did not at the moment discover what was gone. On the next day I received information that some paper had been stopped in a coach and the property taken to St. James's watchhouse. On my going to the watch-house I found that it was part of the property that had been stolen from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you, prior to your going to the watchhouse, discovered what paper you had lost - A. Yes. The robbery was on Thursday morning; on Monday I had forty reams of royal printing paper from Messrs. Fourdrinier, nineteen of which I discovered were stolen; it was not paper much in use; it was of particular quality and make; Messrs. Fourdrinier have a patent for it; it is made by a machine; the marks of the wrapper are F Y R. On looking at the paper at the watch-house I compared it with the paper left behind, it is completely the same.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the quantity of reams shewed you - A. Six reams. Since which I learned that the remaining part were sold to Mr. Denham in Broad-street, the day after the robbery; I lost nineteen reams, and we have recovered above eighteen reams.</p>
               <p>Q. What means have you of knowing that paper was there the night before - when had you the last view of the paper or any body else, so as to know the paper was there - A. I had no view of the paper. On the Monday the prisoner Bracken was the warehouseman, he had the key of the warehouse; I knew the paper was there, it came in late on the Monday evening; I saw Bracken bringing it up from the cart to be put into the warehouse; I certainly saw it in the warehouse the day after, or else I asked him. Out of these forty there were nineteen taken away and twenty one were left behind in that warehouse.</p>

            . I was a watchman that night. On the morning of the 7th of September, a coach, No. 177, came up to me where I stood in Hopkins-street, the coachman turned short into another street, he jammed his coach against a post; he alighted from his coach box and called to me; the lamplighter stood along with me; while we were endeavouring to get the coach off the post there came two watchmen from Wardour-street, one of them told the coachman he believed he was the man that was lurking about his beat. Some of the watchmen opened the coach door, the lamp lighter having the light with him perceived the paper, upon which they said he and the coach should go to the watchhouse; I called the coachman to assist in getting off the coach from the post, he went as if to go round to do it, and made his escape, I led the horses to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010010"></xptr>watchhouse door of St. James's, and deposited the paper in the watchhouse; there were eight reams of paper. six of one kind and two of another.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember being desired by the prisoner to assist in getting the coach off, together with Fisher - A. Yes; and we desired him to go round to the back part of the coach, he went as if to do it and run away, and left the coach and paper to our care; I went with the coach to the watchhouse. There were six reams of one and two of the other. After the paper was delivered at the watchhouse, we were going to take the coach to the Greenyard, going along Piccadilly two coachmen halloed out where are you going with that coach, 177, it belongs to Mrs. Storey. We took the coach to Mrs. Storey, in Coal-yard, Drury-lane; we called Mrs. Storey, she was up and dressed; she said good God, my coach is come home; my man has been here and said he had lost the coach. When we came back to the watchhouse this man had been enquiring for his coach, they told him to come in, and kept him till we came back; then they asked us whether we knew him; I said I thought he was the man. He was very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be in liquor at the time you were searching his coach - A. No; whether he made himself appear so I cannot say, but he appeared very drunk when we came back.</p>

            . I am a watchman. At half past one o'clock I saw a hackney coach standing at the end of Tyler's court, one end of Tyler's court comes into Wardour-street and the other end into Berwick-street; I did not observe the number; I went my round, the coach was there when I returned; I made a stop opposite of the coach, I saw one or two persons come into the coach; the coachman said is all in, all right, I shall drive to St. Ann's watering house and have some gin; five shillings you say you will give me; I want money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the countenance of the coachman so as to know it was the prisoner at the bar - A Not at that time. I did not observe the number of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not afterwards know it was the same person as you saw before - A. I was not certain it was the same person, his dress was like it; I did not observe his face. The coachman mounted his box, he said five shillings three times; I shall drive to St. Ann's watering house and have some gin; he drove off. About three quarters of an hour afterwards I heard the coach coming up Princess-street the same way it went down it came very gently up; I thought it might be the same coach returning again; I went into the gateway opposite of Tyler's-court; the coach got opposite of the court; he cried wo'ee very softly; he said make haste, look sharp, in a very low tone of voice.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he appear to be speaking to - A. I could not see any body; I imagined him to be speaking to somebody up the court; I went and took the number of the coach, 177.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your view of the coach and coachman at that time, did it appear to you to be the same coach and coachman that you had seen before in the same place - A. It did, and when he spoke it appeared to me to be the same voice; when I took the number he said to his horses, it is time for us to go home my boy; he drove off then. I went to Calahan, another watchman, I said come out, here is something going on that should not be, on your beat; he went up Wardour-street and I round Berwick-street, to see it we could meet any body in Tyler's-court, I heard a rumbling of a coach by Hopkins-street, we went there, and there was the coach, No. 177, upon a post; we saw the watchman, Fisher, and the lamplighter, and this coachman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see there that the coachman of No. 177 was the same coachman that you saw before - A. I was not certain that it was the coachman before that time; I had no doubt but it was the same person I had before seen with the coach; I seized the coachman by the collar; I am sure the prisoner Williams is the person I seized by the collar; the lamplighter held up his burner at the time. When I loosened his collar for him to endeavour to get his coach off the post he made his escape unperceived. I am quite sure the prisoner Williams is the man, and whom I had seen on the two former occasions.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Wilks. I had a letter written by Mr. Wilks to take to Mrs. Goodman; I enquired of Mrs. Goodman for this man, she said he boarded there but did not lodge there.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. At the examination I mentioned the circumstance that he had told me a wrong place; the prisoner said it was a mistake, or that he did it in an hurry. And when he came back on the Thursday I openly told him I suspected he had been concerned in stealing the paper; I asked him where he placed the forty reams of paper that came from Fourdrinier's, he said in the long warehouse; I told him to shew it me;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010011"></xptr>he unlocked the warehouse door and said there is the paper; he counted it and said there is only twenty one; I said where is the remainder; he said they must have wetted it, that is, used it, while he was absent. I had told him when that paper came in that the work for which that paper was to be used had not come in. We always wet the over night, and then we wet two or three reams; never so many as nineteen.</p>
               <p>MR. DENHAM. I am a printer and stationer. On the 7th of September I purchased twelve reams of royal paper of a stranger, between the hours of one and two o'clock; he left one quire with me; he called on the day following about the same hour, to know whether I would purchase it; he brought the paper on the evening of the 7th in a cart; I agreed to give six guineas for eleven good reams.</p>
               <p>Q. What would eleven good reams be worth - A. Twenty six or twenty seven guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you think he came honestly by it - A. I did not know the worth of it then.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I gave fifty-five shillings a ream for the paper.</p>
               <p>Williams's Defence. On that night I lost the coach and horses in Temple bar rank about eleven o'clock at night; in the mean while I went into the wine vaults the coach was taken away. I went in search of the coach all over the city, and at Smithfield, I came there about twelve, and searched there; from there I went up Holborn, then it was going on for one o'clock in the morning, then I went up to my employer, Mrs. Storey; I told her I had lost the coach, that was about one, she said I must find it; another man went out with me to look for it again; we went to St. Giles's, and up Tottenham-court road, up Oxford-road, and made enquiry, and up one of the little streets by Wardour-street; one of the watchmen told me that he heard of a coach being taken to the watchhouse with goods in it; that is the first I heard of it; when I went to the watchhouse the coach was taken home. From eleven o'clock at night I never was in possession of the coach, not have I seen it since. When I went to the watch-house they asked me who I was, I told them I was the coachman; they asked me whether I was the driver of that coach, I said I was; then they detained me; they said they thought I was the coachman by the colour of my coat.</p>

               <p>Bracken's Defence. My lord, the night the paper was taken out when I had done my work in the evening I resigned up the keys at Mr. Wilks's dwelling house into the possession of the servant maid, which I always was in the habit of doing when I was in his house, at dinner time and at night. I delivered my keys that night before the robbery, then I went to Mrs. Goodman's, where I generally have my victuals, and went along with a young man to the fair, the young man is here; we stopped at the fair till nigh four o'clock in the morning, and that young man with me; then I went with a girl in George-alley, she kept me along with her. Mr. Wilks said I denied where I lodged; I did not; I told him I lodged at No. 7. Change-court, in the Strand. I have lodged with Mrs. Goodman many years, but I did not at that time, I did some time before that.</p>

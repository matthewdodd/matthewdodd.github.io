                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Clark, who keeps a coffee shop in High-street, Woolwich. On Thursday night, 28th July, the prisoners came to our house between 11 and 12 o'clock; after they had been there a little time, Tracey asked me if I would buy a handkerchief—he pulled one out of his breast—I said, "No," it was of no use to me—he came again, and asked me to buy it; he said that I should have it for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that he would give me the same for it another time—I bought that one, and then he produced five more—the other prisoners each had a bundle, and they took some out of their bundles—I saw the bundles, there were three bundles—I asked them where they got it from, and if it was theirs—they said, "Yes," they had taken it up from the purser, they had taken twelve yards each from him—I bought six altogether, and gave Tracey the money—one of them, I think it was Shandley, then pulled some out of another bundle, and threw it on the sofa, and said it was no consequence, if I had not got money to pay him to day, he would send Mrs. James to me for the money next day—I said, "Very well," and they all three went away—I had not arranged to purchase more than the six—I do not know what he meant by saying he would send Mrs. James for the money—he wanted me at first to buy twelve yards—I said it was no use to me, and declined to purchase it—I kept the handkerchiefs and thought it strange that they did not call or send next day for the money, and I sent over to Mrs. James, but she was out—I after<lb></lb>wards gave the handkerchiefs up to the policeman—these (<hi rend="italic">produced by the policeman</hi>) are them.</p>

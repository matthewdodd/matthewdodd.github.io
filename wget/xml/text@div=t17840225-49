               <p>Court to Mitchell. What time was it you lost it? - Within ten minutes of six.</p>
               <p>Lee. I was in the parlour when he came into the shop, I asked him what he wanted, he asked me whether I wanted to buy some onion seed, I asked him how much he had, he said it was there, he bought it for six shillings, it was a sack; then I looked at it, and bought it, I did not know whether it was onion seed or leek seed; I asked him what he must have for it; he said, he gave six shillings for it; I said, will seven shillings satisfy you, I said I do not know any thing about it, you must leave it till morning; he said, he wanted a little money, I told him I could give him a little trifle of money if he wanted, but he must leave it till morning; I gave him four shillings, as my master was not at home; he called in the morning before my master was up, and I gave him three shillings more, and told him he must call again, for my master had not looked at it, and I did not know any thing about it, nor what it was worth; as soon as my master got up, I gave him some of the seed to look at, he immediately told me it was stolen; I then shewed him the sack, he said the sack was Mr. Field's sack, or had been so; the prisoner called again at night, and before that a hand bill came in; when he came again I stopped him; he said he bought it of a man, but he did not know him; my master told me it was worth ten or eleven pounds; in the morning I carried down the sack to Mr. Field's, I delivered it to one of the gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Who saw you deliver it? - I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>William Swain. I am a watchman in Holborn; on the 28th of Aug. about 2 in the morning, I saw the prisoner go by with a bundle under her arm; I stopped her, and took her before the constable of the night. He ask'd her where she came from; she said from Chelsea. I ask'd her where she was going; she said, to Newtoner's-Lane, but could not get in. After that, she said, she was going to an acquaintance in White-Friars. When before the justice, she said, she came from Holloway. These were the things mentioned in the indictment in her bundle, mentioning them by name. She was asked how she came by them, she said; she was walking in the highway, and tumbled over them.</p>

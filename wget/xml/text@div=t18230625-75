The prisoner did not sleep in the house, but used always to go and <rs id="t18230625-75-deflabel433" type="occupation">milk the cows</rs>

I returned about half-past six o'clock, and found him in the front room, on the ground floor - the door being forced open, and he had the articles stated in the indictment in his hand, tied up in a table cloth. I laid hold of him, and asked what he had there? he said nothing. I have lodgers up stairs. The clothes are worth about 8 l. together, and were taken from my drawers; two of the coats had been worn some time; the other is nearly new. The staple of the door had been forced off. I gave him in charge; he was only a fortnight in my service. I did not enquire his character.</p>

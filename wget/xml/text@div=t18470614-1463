                  </hi>. I keep a coffee-shop in Rufford's buildings, Islington. On the 25th of May, the prisoner and two others came to my shop, and went to a table—the prisoner called for three plates of meat, three slices of bread, and three cups of coffee—I put them on the table, and said, "Now let as have the money"—the prisoner said, "Don't be so fast, I will pay you"—I said, "Pay me now"—I turned two plates into one, at his request, as there was not room enough on the table—I then asked again for the money—he made use of some expression, meaning he would pay me—I said, "Let us have the money"—I took up the meat to take it away, he seized the plate, and said, "Don't be so fast, you shall have the money"—I was compelled to leave it, in consequence of other customers coming in—I was engaged, and they got up go away—I stopped them, and gave them into custody—they had eaten the meat—there had been three-quarters of a pound, as near as I could judge—it was not weighed.</p>

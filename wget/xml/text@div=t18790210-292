                  </hi>. I am a compositor, at 15, Eversholt Street, Camden Town—on Sunday, 1st December, about 11.20 p.m., I was in Seymour Street, St. Pancras—as I got to Drummond Crescent I was seized by two men—there were in fact three men; the prisoners are two of them, I have not the least doubt about it—Wainwright caught me by the right arm and Phillips by the left—the third man was behind—I struggled, and in the struggle I got a kick on the leg by the ankle—I don't know who did it—it dislocated the bone—the kick was from the left side and Phillips was on that side—I fell down, they picked me up, and I was dragged some distance across the road—I again struggled, and fell with the foot doubled under me after crossing two roads—Wainwright fell on me on the right with his hands in my pocket—he pulled my coat open—I became partially senseless-Phillips had his hand in my trousers pocket on the one side and Wainwright on the other, and in falling down some money fell on the pavement—I do not remember Mr. McColl on that night—on trying to get on my legs I found that the foot had gone—it had twisted out—I seemed to be walking on the stump of my leg—I had had between 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in halfpence and silver, a knife and some keys—my clothes were taken off at the hospital—I did not see the things taken out, but all that was given to my wife was a street door key—I have been obliged to have my foot amputated at University Hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Wainwright</hi>. It was some time after this occurred when you picked me up and put me by the post—I had a ring on my finger in the cab—I did not feel anybody try to bite it off.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Mr. Metcalfe</hi>. I was not drunk—I had a little, but was not the least intoxicated—I could remember everything before the kick, but not after—the Cross Keys, Peebles Road, was the last public-house I had been in—it is a little over a mile from the place—I had there two-pennyworth of Irish whisky warm; nothing else—I was with a companion about half an hour before that, at the Carpenters' Arms, Burton Street—I had twopennyworth of Irish whisky warm—I had not been to any other for two hours before that, when I had half a pint of stout and mild at the Jolly Carpenters in Euston Street—that is all I had—it would not be right if the witnesses said that I was drunk—I gave Mr. McColl my name and address.</p>

I am a chairmaker, and live at 54, Great Clarendon Street—on Sunday night, 1st December, about 11.30, I was going down Seymour Street and saw Mr. Bacchus on the ground at the corner of Drummond Crescent—I was about six yards away—I got right opposite, and heard Wainwright talking rather loud—I could see his face—I also saw</p>

               <p>Phillips—Wainwright stood Mr. Bacchus up against a lamp-post, and Phillips helped him—I asked Mr. Bacchus where he lived—he said, "15, Everholt Street"—I did not ask his name—I took his arm to lead him across the road—upon that Wainwright pulled me away, and said, "Come out of the b—way; you don't know how to hold the b—man up at all"—he led him up the street about 200 yards—I saw him put his hand into Bacchus's pocket and some money dropped out—I followed them—I saw another man not in custody pick up the money—I thought Bacchus was a little worse for liquor; it might have been from excitement—I was looking at Wainwright's hand—he asked what I was looking at, and said, "I'll put this in your bleeding eye"—I stepped back—the man not in custody gave a private whistle, and the two prisoners went across the road—I went back—a cab was coming, and Phillips came with me to it, and we went to the hospital—I heard Wainwright say to Bacchus that if he didn't get up he would kick him in the b—legs—that was when I saw them trying to put him up against the lamp-post—Phillips came to my assistance, and went to the hospital with me—I am positive he is the same man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Wainwright</hi>. When I saw you first, I did not ask you what was the matter with the prosecutor—I had just left Gower Street Station at 11.20—he went to fall, and I caught him in my arms—I did not give you any money—Phillips did not run away at all—the man who whistled ran away.</p>

I am house-surgeon of University College Hospital—Bacchus was brought there on the night of 1st December about 11.45, suffering from a compound fracture of the leg into the ankle joint, with a fracture of the small bone and an abrasion over, splintering the bone—it was found necessary to amputate the foot at once—I do not think the whole of the injury could have been caused by a kick—there was a bruise on the outer side—I think, possibly, the man, having been kicked, might have attempted to walk, and, falling down, might have fractured the large bone, making it a compound fracture.</p>

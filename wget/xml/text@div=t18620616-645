                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep the Cromwell Arms public-house, Fulham-road—on 27th May, about 8 o'clock, the prisoner came with another, who called for a pint of beer, and tendered a shilling—the beer was 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I gave 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out—they drank it and left—I then examined the shilling, and found it bad—I placed it on the top of the till—at half-past 9 the prisoner came again alone, and called for a glass of stout, which was three-halfpence, and tendered another bad shilling—I said, "This is too bad, twice in one night"—he said he had not been in the house before—I told him he had been there with another, and the other had tendered the other shilling—I put them in the tryer, and they both bent—I sent for a constable and gave him in custody.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I took them all out of my pocket at the same time.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> You swore that if you could have seen either of the two parties you would have said it was a bad shilling? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should not know the other party, but I knew you—no one was in the bar but myself, and I could not go after you—there was a customer at the bar, and men standing at the door to stop you if you attempted to escape—I winked at the customer to stop you if you attempted to go—you made no attempt to go—you said, "You can lock me up if you like"—I did not hear you add, "if you think I was here before"—I said, "This is the second time to night"—you said, "I have never been in the house before," but I knew better—I noticed you more than the other—I could not swear to the one that put it down; you were nearer to me—I should be very sorry to take an oath here if I was not certain—you sent your mother to me to tell me what money she gave you in the morning; but she did not give you those</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you any suspicion of the first shilling when it was offered to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; when I took it in my hand; but there were a great many in the bar, and they were gone in a minute—I am sure this was the shilling that was given me by the other person—I took it up and gave change, but I laid it in the bar; not with the rest of the money in the till—I had only half a crown in silver in the till—I am quite certain that the prisoner is the man who came in with the other man—I had given change for that half-crown, which I put in the till, and then I took this first shilling; that was the only shilling I had—I took other money between the first and second times of the prisoner's coming—I laid the first shilling aside till the gas was lighted, and then I examined it and found it was bad, and laid it there again, and then I tried the second shilling in the tryer—I did not try it at once, because I was very busy and was alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> You said before that I stood between you and the gaslight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You came at 8 o'clock the first time, and at 9 the second, and I said, "It is just an hour and a half since you were here"—I did not say you stood between me and the light; you stood nearest to me—the other was at the further end when you had the pint of beer—of course I gave change, because you were drinking the beer so fast to go; I did not give it to you because you did not give me the shilling—when I taxed you with the shilling, you said it was an old shilling that you gave me.</p>

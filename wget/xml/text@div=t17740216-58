            's; it was so late at night I could not obtain a warrant; I went down early the next morning to Ives, thinking to find him in the house; that was the 5th of this month; I met him three or four hundred yards from the house, with a pitcher in his hand going to fetch water; at that time I did not know him; I came up to his house and found it shut; the officer and I went to a public house in the neighbourhood and asked if they knew Ives; they told us he lived at the house we had described to us; I went to look at the back part of the house to see if any person could make their escape backwards; I found they could; I fixed two persons there; when I came back again I saw Ives go into his house with a pitcher of water in his hand; the house was locked; Ives opened the door himself ; I asked him if his name was not Ives; he said yes; and at that time there was a girl in the room with him, which I believe is a daughter of Mrs. Freeman; there was nobody in the house but myself; I took him into the yard to give the others notice I was in the house; I took him into custody; then the daughter of Mrs. Freeman ran up stairs to her mother; I went up stairs after the girl; when I came up into the bed room Mrs. Freeman sat upright in the bed with her pockets in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. This was I believe between seven and eight o'clock?</p>
               <p>Clarke . It might be half after eight; I will not be certain to the time; I searched her pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this up one pair of stairs?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes; I found in her pocket nineteen counterfeit shillings and a sixpence; I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177402160036"></xptr> who was up stairs; she said a man and a woman; I took the daughter up with me and went up stairs, whilst she dressed herself; when I came up stairs, Pitt and a woman were in bed; I searched the room; there were things lay very open; somebody had been at work the day before there; I found a pair of flasks; these are them (producing them); I found sand and some aquafortis in water, (producing it); I found some what they call facing in the casting business; that is a composition used such as rotten stone powdered fine to pour over the sand to make the pores fine, that when a thing is cast it should not come out full of holes; it is to make it a smooth surface.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use of the aquafortis?</p>
               <p>Clarke. If you take a composition of a quarter silver, and the rest in copper, and warm that composition thus mixed together, and throw it into aquafortis and water, it forces all the silver on the out side.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it will serve the purpose of making the composition of a little silver, and a great deal of copper, appear like silver?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever bred up in chymistry?</p>
               <p>Clarke. We are obliged to use it in the business I was brought up in.</p>
               <p>Q. I see there is a tinge upon it; is that the silver or copper?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Silver certainly .</p>
               <p>Q. If silver is dissolved in aquafortis , will hat dissolution be white; the liquid is blue?</p>
               <p>Clarke. The colour of aquafortis is the colour of water , or may be a little yellowish.</p>
               <p>Q. Now suppose nothing but silver is dissolved in aquafortis, what would be the colour then?</p>
               <p>Clarke. When it comes to stand it turns to this colour that is bluish; by shaking it, it turns like milk; I found some crucibles for melting metals; they had been made use of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else in the house?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes, up in a work shop I found what they call a window for casting, and to melt metal , and in searching the work board I found what some of the trade call aspray, some call it aget , (produces it); this is laid in the sand where any impression is meant to be cast; the impression is laid by the side of it, and when the dent is made this is turned out, which leaves a cavity or a gutter to pour the metal in to make the impression; that was found in the workshop, and I found some metal run into that gutter; upon the same bench where I found that aget I found two things that resembled a shilling and a sixpence; I found some files and some metal of the same nature as what that aspray is.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you take that metal to be?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I took it to be a composition of either bell metal and silver, or tutenague and silver ; it is a composition.</p>
               <p>Q. One of the ingredients in it is silver?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a composition in which there is silver, and putting it in aquafortis will make it white like silver?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes; here are two smooth files; I found these in the work-shop; here is a piece of scouring paper; it has been used to rub a composition of metal upon, and the edge of something has been used at one edge; it has all the marks of silver upon it; now there was a winnow stow , a furnace that has an air hole which draws the draught to the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a flue which would give an increase of wind, and performs the office of bellows to make a strong fire?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes; I saw a box under the bed where Pitts was a-bed; I asked him whose that was; he said Ives's we asked Mrs. Ives for the key; she had a bunch of keys; we could not find a key in the bunch that would open the box; I began to break it open; word was sent Mr. Ives of that and he sent me the key; he gave it to Mr. Taylor and Mr. Senhouse brought it to me; in that box I found a small pair of flasks; that was all I found in it; I searched the daughter and found two counterfeit shillings and one bad sixpence; it was the prisoner Freeman's daughter; it was on Mrs. Freeman I found the nineteen shillings.</p>

            . I went along with Mr. Clarke in the morning he has mentioned, to apprehend the prisoners; I searched Ives; I found ten shillings and seven six-pences in his pocket, which I looked upon to be bad, but they turned out to be some of them good ones when they were examined before the Justice; the good ones appeared to be the patterns of the counterfeit shillings found on the woman, which Mr. Clarke has given an account of; with regard to the box Mr. Clarke has mentioned , I heard a noise above stairs , and asked Mr. Ives if he had the key of that box; that I did not mean to do him any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177402160037"></xptr> injury ; if he had, to send it up stairs; I do not know what room the box was in; I was below stairs the whole time; I did not go into the work-shop ; he gave me the key, and I gave it to Mr. Senhouse; that is all I know.</p>

             .

            , Mr. Taylor told me he had found some counterfeit shillings; I desired him to let me look at them; he did; I was at a loss myself till I took them in my hand to know the bad from the good; the good shillings had been worked till they were as bright as the counterfeit shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain what you mean by their being worked?</p>
               <p>Clarke. They had been put in the sand; the other shillings were put in; when I came to look at the shillings and examine the counterfeit shillings, I picked out so many counterfeits (producing a paper marked No. 1). There is five counterfeits and a pattern shilling in it with them, that is a good shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. The bad shillings are not all worked from one good shilling?</p>
               <p>Clarke. No; there are seven different paterns; (produces another paper marked No. 6). This paper contains a parcel of bad shillings and a good one; the bad ones have been worked from the good one, (produces another paper marked No. 3). Here is a pattern shilling and two counterfeits; they appear to be worked from the good one; (produces another paper marked No. 5. with two counterfeits and a good shilling; produces another paper marked No. 4 with one counterfeit and a pattern; produces another paper with a crocked pattern and three counterfeits all crooked). I suppose the crooked shilling being pu t in the mould would make the counterfeits crooked just in the same manner; if you look under the head of the crooked shillings, you will find a letter, and close to the letter a dot. which seems to be done by accident in the good shilling; by looking at the counterfeit shillings you will see the like dot there; that is a striking circumstance.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the crown . I observe there is on the back of the head two or three scratches or dots , that exactly correspond in the bad shillings .</p>
               <p>Jury . They correspond as exact as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what relation Pitt stands in to Ives ?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I cannot tell any thing about it; Pitt says he lay four months in the room, and that he went on errands for Ives.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Ives say whether this was his house or not?</p>
               <p>Clarke. He owned it was his house; and let himself into the house; and he had the key of the box.</p>
               <p>Q. from Ives to Taylor . How many good shillings and sixpences did you take out of my pocket?</p>
               <p>Taylor. All I have shewed to the court; ten good shillings, seven good sixpences, and a note for five guineas; the reason of my taking the note was to endeavour to trace somebody he dealt with.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the crown . The note must be given to him again.</p>
               <p>Ives's Defence.</p>
               <p>I will say nothing that I cannot stand to; I am not guilty of any of the things these people have charged me with.</p>

On the 4th of November, at half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was returning home, up Bishopsgate-street; whether I accosted the prisoner and his friend, or they me, I cannot say, but they said they were going my way, and took hold of my arm - I said they were very kind; when we got on to Shoreditch church I said, "I will bid you good night, but if we can get any thing to drink I will treat you" - we knocked at a public-house, but could not get in, and one of them said, "We can get it a little higher up;" we went to a house in Kingsland-road, and knocked at the door - I put my hand to my pocket to get 6d., but could not find it; I had a hole in my pocket, and supposed I had lost it - they seemed irritated to think I had made fools of them; I said, "To convince you that I have property, I will leave my watch" - I took it out of my pocket; the prisoner took it out of my hand, and ran down a turning - I pursued him, but just as I came up to him I fell down; I got up again, and to my astonishment the prisoner was in custody - I said to him, "You rascal," with an intermediate word which I have no occasion to repeat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you sober? A. I had taken a little to drink, but I was not exactly drunk - this watch was my own; I was never accused of stealing it - I was accused of stealing a watch, but nothing else; I do not recollect being charged with stealing a box from Smith, a painter - I know him, and have drank with him; he might have said it out of a joke- I did take a brooch out of his shirt once, and gave it to Collins, the publican; I said, "I have got Smith's brooch," and we had a glass of brandy and water - Smith<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182912030083"></xptr>was not asleep at the time; he was standing in the skittle-ground; he never turned me out of the house - I am a book-vender; I know the Tiger public-house; I was in the custody of an officer, but I do not think proper to tell you what for - to the best of my recollection it was for breaking the shutter of a bad house, where I had been insulted; I remained in custody till I got out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long were you in custody? A. A few hours - I was brought before the Magistrate, but he would not hear the evidence; there were two or three prostitutes came against me, and the watchman with the bit of the shutter - I am a subscriber at the Ivy-house, and one evening I wished to get home soon, and I asked a young man what time it was; he felt his pocket, and said "I have lost my watch" - I said, "If you think I have your watch, I wish you may have lost it;" I was surrounded by I suppose fifty persons, and one of my friends said, "If you have taken it in a joke give it back, and another said I will go with any friend of yours, and see if he left it at home;" they went, and found it at his father's, and his father came to the public-house and said,"I don't wish to have any thing done to my son;" he offered me any money, but I would not take it, and he went, and spent 10s., because I had not prosecuted his son for charging me with so diabolical an act.</p>
               <p>EDWARD OXBY. I am a watchman. On the night of the 3rd of November, at half-past twelve, I heard a cry of Watch! I was in Kingsland-road - I ran over, and saw the prisoner come out of a court; I took him - I found nothing on him, but this inside of a watch at his heels - another watchman found the case: I did not see it fall - the prosecutor came up, and said he had lost his watch; he was surprised to see the prisoner in custody.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty, and heard a call of Watch! I crossed the road, and saw the prisoner who looked as if he had thrown something from his hand - Oxby took him, and I went to where I saw something fall, and found this watch-case.</p>
               <p>JAMES HILL. I am an officer. This watch was given to me, and I asked the prosecutor if he could describe it- he said his name was in the inside, on some tissue paper, and it is so.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, declaring his innocence.</p>
               <p>MR. SUMPTON. I have acted as constable in Shoreditch, in my own right - I had the prosecutor in custody for three hours on suspicion of stealing a watch.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was he discharged on the watch being found? A. I do not recollect, it is some time ago - from what I know of his character I would not believe him upon his oath; I have known him eight years - he goes about swindling people in skittle-grounds.</p>
               <p>RICHARD KEMP. I live in Bridport-place, Hoxton. I was an officer last year - I never had the prosecutor in custody, but I know him, and would not believe him on his oath.</p>

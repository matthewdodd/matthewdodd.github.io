                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 230). On the morning of 21st July, I was on duty on the right hand side of Holborn-hill—I came down to the end of Field-lane—it was about 20 minutes past 1 o'clock—I saw the prisoner standing with a female whom I had seen before with prostitutes—I requested the prisoner to move on—he said he would go when he thought proper—I said he must go when I thought proper—he did not go, be stood for several minutes, and I stood also—I then took him by the arm to move him—he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his fist and struck me—he then walked sharply down Plough-court—I followed him, to take him into custody for assaulting me—</p>

               <p>I followed him down to the house, No. 27, which is the back door of 27, field-lane—when I got to the door he began making use of bad language—he called me all but everything—I took hold of him to take him into custody, and he said, "I will be b----d if you take me"—I was not aware that he lodged in that house—I endeavoured to take him into custody, but he resisted me, and began making use of abusive language—he called me a <hi rend="italic">puppy</hi>—during that time the door was opened, and I saw Mr. Henderson partly dressed—he said to the prisoner, "Why don't you come in doors, that man will not hurt you"—the prisoner still kept calling me a <hi rend="italic">puppy</hi>—Mr. Henderson got bold of his arm, and pulled him in doors—(there was a light, the gas was burn<lb></lb>ing in the room)—the prisoner walked to a table that stood at the further end of the room, right opposite the door where I was—he stood there a few minutes, and then rushed towards the door—seeing him rush, and being much agitated, I drew my truncheon—he rushed past Mr. Henderson, who was standing with the door in his hand, and said to me, "You b----r,----r, I will learn you to lay anything to me"—he raised his right hand, and I perceived that he had a knife in it—he made a stab at me, which I warded off with my truncheon—we then closed and got struggling, and in the struggle the leathern strap which goes round my wrist, to keep my truncheon, broke, and he got the truncheon from me, and with it he made a blow at me, which I received on my right shoulder—I do not know whether he dropped the truncheon, or threw it away, but it fell—we then separated, and I was going up the court to get further assistance, and he ran after me with the knife—he struck at me—I had nothing to ward it off, and I stooped, the knife came against the side of my face—it cut my cheek and under my nose, and went down to my breast, and the knife bent, as you see it is now—I was bleeding profusely from the face—the prisoner tried to get away, but I held him till further assistance came—another policeman came up—I was obliged to let go the prisoner, I was so exhausted—I looked about, and close on the spot I picked up the knife—this is it—I afterwards went to the hospital—the surgeon examined me, and I got a certificate—the prisoner appeared to have been drinking, but he was perfectly aware what he was about.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the lodging-house, 27, Field-lane, which has a back door into Plough-court. On 21st July, and for some time before, the prisoner had been lodging in that house—he used to take his meals in the kitchen, which has a window into Plough-court—I burn a gas light there till about 2 o'clock; not all night—on 21st July I had been sitting up for the prisoner, who was out—I had a light in the kitchen—about half past one I heard a knocking at the back door—I went to it, and found the prisoner and Marshall, the policeman—they appeared to me to be wrangling, and I could hear the prisoner calling Marshall a <hi rend="italic">puppy</hi>—that was the only word I could distinguish—they were in conversation—I knew the prisoner was drunk, because he had been in my place before, and asked me for the loan of six<lb></lb>pence—I went out and talked to the prisoner, to induce him to go in doors; in fact, I pulled him in—he went about three parts down the kitchen, and the policeman said, "If you come out of that place again I shall lock you up"—the policeman stood at the door outside, and as soon as he said he would lock him up, the prisoner opened the drawer, took a knife out, and</p>

               <p>rushed past me out—I ran out of the front door into Field-lane, and saw a policeman—I told him to go round—I was not gone above five minutes—I went round the court and found the prisoner on the ground, in custody bleeding from the inside of his hand; and Marshall was standing by bleeding from the face—the knife is now bent, it was straight before—it has no handle, only the iron—that might injure a man's hand if he squeezed it very tightly—the prisoner was in the habit of taking his meals in that kitchen; he must have known that the knives were kept in that drawer.</p>

On the morning of 21st July I was called into Plough-court—when I got there I saw the prisoner struggling with Marshall—the prisoner was holding him by the hair of his head with his left hand, and holding the knife in his right hand—I seized him by the collar—Marshall was holding the prisoner by some part of his body with his right hand, and with his left hand he was holding the prisoner's right hand, which had the knife—Marshall's face was bleeding very much, but what from I did not know—I took the prisoner into custody, and when I took him the knife fell on the ground—I had pulled him down—his hand was bleeding, but what from I could not tell—he seemed to be a little under the influence of liquor, but he was quite sensible enough to know what he was doing—I took him to the station house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had been two months in the London Hospital; I got out on the 20th, and went and had a drop of something to drink; I returned home, and walked into Plough-court to the lodging house; I rapped at the door and turned back to the water closet; I had just opened the water closet door, and the policeman called and said, "This is not a fit hour of the night for you to be out;" he pushed me, and I struck him; I took his staff and threw it away from him; he went and took it and struck me, and nearly broke my jaw; I went into the house, and he came and began abusing me, and I began on him; I went outside the door, and I know I had a wrangle outside the door, and he gave me a most dreadful beating with his staff; he kicked me, and left my head all in lumps; my arms and side were all black, and my eyes and all swelled.</p>

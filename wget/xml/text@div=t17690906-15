               <p>Levi. No, I went to ask some questions about a brother-in-law, who had been struck, when I saw a bill lying which described this watch to be lost. This was on the fourteenth, in the morning, and the names were Reeve and Cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that before you told Sir John, or after?</p>

            . I was told a young fellow was taken up for an assault. I went there to bail him, and I found it was the prisoner. I saw him at the Brown Bear. He said he had been accused of stealing a silver watch. I asked this Levi if he was acquainted with the prisoner, and from what motive he could charge the prisoner. He said, He is an intimate acquaintance, and he is very ungrateful in not giving me something, as he has got money. I know Mr. Harris can do nothing without me; he can find no bill without me: money is now very acceptable. I do declare upon my oath, if I had given him a couple of guineas, he would not have concerned himself about it. Mr. Harris told Sir John he was a tall, thin young fellow in white clothes, that he prated like a magpye all the way, and that he was a little in liquor, but thought he should know the man's voice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harris. Sir John said to this gentleman, Who are you? He answered, he was an attorney's clerk. Upon my oath I did not say I was in liquor. I told Sir John, I could not tell how he was dressed.</p>

               <p>Q. About the latter end of August, did you go from your house to Margate? A. I did; on Saturday, the 31st of August - the prisoner accompanied me; she remained at Margate with me till the following Saturday, and then she asked leave to go up to town - I gave her leave; she was to return on the Tuesday - she returned on the Wednesday; her not returning on the Tuesday, and from other circumstances, I was suspicious of her, and in consequence of that, her boxes were searched in my presence, by Mr. Tufnell; in consequence of what transpired, the prisoner was taken in custody at my lodging; the first question I asked her was, "Have you paid Madame Follet the £100?" she answered, "I have not, I wrote the receipt myself."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where is Colonel Hampton? A. In India; I don't know whether he is coming home shortly - I have written to him to request he would come home; I do not expect him shortly - I don't expect any suit will be instituted by him when he does come home; I don't understand you.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a gentleman named Tufnell? A. I do; he is no relation to me; I got acquainted with him fourteen or fifteen years ago - it was not before Colonel Hampton went to India; I don't understand you; Colonel Hampton has not been in England for upwards of thirty years; I was married in India - I came from India six years ago; I knew Mr. Tufnell before I was married; I was acquainted with Mr. Tufnell in London; I have been home twice; he is an examiner of accounts, in the Audit office - he is not married; I have been on intimate terms with him - I have been in various parts of the country with him - I have been at Dover; we lived in the same house at Dover, and dined at the same table - we did not always breakfast at the same table, because I did not get up to breakfast; we always dined at the same table - we were there twice - eight or ten days each time; about two years ago; I don't exactly recollect whether that was the first visit - it is about two years since my first visit to Dover, with Mr. Tufnell; I only went once with him to Dover; he came when I was residing there; we travelled together the first time - Mr. Tufnell took the apartments at Dover; the prisoner was living in my service at both those times, and had an opportunity of observing the extent of my acquaintance with Mr. Tufnell - I considered her a very confidential servant.</p>
               <p>Q. May I ask what the extent of your means of living were in London? A. £700 a year and more; it is uncertain what my husband remits me, sometimes I have more, and sometimes less - at this present time, I have £700 a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever employed the prisoner to pawn articles of very considerable value? A. Yes; to the amount of £200 at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Now Mrs. Hampton, we have gone through the Dover residence, how long did you live at Margate? A. Three weeks; Mr. Tufnell also lodged in the house part of the time; eating at the same table; he took the house at Margate at my request - I did not pay his lodging; I paid my own - he had a bed room in the same house for which he paid separately; that I swear; I paid bills for his diet at Dover; very much through the hands of the prisoner - I have been at Tunbridge-wells with Mr. Tufnell - it is some time ago; I think I staid there seven or eight days; I was at an hotel part of the time, and part of the time in lodgings; I went first to an hotel - Mr. Tufnell was with me - lodgings were taken, and I remained there, and Mr. Tufnell left me; during the time he staid there, I paid for him - he never came back there after he left; I don't recollect that he took the lodgings - I might have been with him when the lodgings were taken; I went to Cranford-bridge with him three years ago - we travelled in the same post chaise; my daughter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170034"></xptr>was with me - my daughter was with me at all the places I went to with Mr. Tufnell.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What age is your daughter? A. Fifteen or sixteen; but she is imbecile.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Well, she is not capable of making much observation? A. I don't know - I suppose not; she had not sense enough to observe what was going forward; I had a quarrel with Mrs. Atkins a lodging house keeper at Dover, about a postman - on no other subject; Mr. Tufnell had - mine never amounted to a quarrel, nor a difference; she asked me for money; I don't remember her sitting up on the stairs one night - I know she stated she did do it; we had a difference of opinion on that subject; am I obliged to enter into this?</p>
               <p>Q. What other parts of the country have you been to with Mr. Tufnell; you have mentioned Dover, Margate, Cranford-bridge, have you been to any other parts of the country with Mr. Tufnell? A. Yes; to Boulogne, four or five years ago - Mr. Tufnell was not with me, he came and paid me a visit there - he dined with me, but he did not sleep there; he staid at Boulogne ten days on that occasion; he did not dine with me every day - I believe I have mentioned all the country places I have been to with him - I cannot swear I have not been to any other places in England with him - I don't recollect that I have been to any other places - I have certainly not been to any other place in England for a fortnight together with him, if you will bring it to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live in town? A. No. 14, Princes-street; I lived at No. 6, Conduit-street, before that, and I lived there a year; Mr. Tufnell has been in the habit of visiting me at both those houses, and that to the prisoner's knowledge; she has been in my service upwards of two years; Mr. Tufnell generally went home to his own residence about ten or eleven o'clock - he has staid as late as twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Never longer? Witness. Am I obliged to answer that question?</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to object to tell me how long he has staid? A. I don't object.</p>
               <p>Q. How many different pawnbrokers have you sent the prisoner to to pawn for you? A. Three; Dobree, Cotterell, and Gray; no others, I am sure of that; I have not sent her to pawn at any other pawnbroker's that I recollect; I have gone with her to other pawnbroker's, but not sent her; I make a distinction between going with her and sending her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that? A. To Graves'; it is somewhere in the city; I don't know where - it may be in Fleet-street, but I am not in the habit of going into the city - it was a street on the other side of Temple-bar - I know the Strand, it is a continuance of that street; I have gone with her to Graves's, three or four months ago; I did not pawn anything there - I went to pawn some diamonds; I asked £200 on them; I did not buy the diamonds in London - they were my own; I have had them for years, they were my mother's.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Barnes, a silversmith? A. I do; I have not bought property of him to a very considerable extent; one bill was £50, another £50, and a slide for £15, and some other articles which I have not paid for; it may be £15, but I have not had the bills - I have not had a tea-pot of him; if I have sent my servant to pawn articles that I bought of him, they were paid for - I have sent her to pawn articles bought of Mr. Barnes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Tufnell in the habit of intimacy with you up to this moment? A. Yes; I don't know whether he is in Court or no - he did not come to the Court-house with me to-day; nor to the Old-Bailey; he accompanied me part of the way - to the coffee house in Cornhill; I don't know where - perhaps it is Ludgate-hill - he came with me yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told my Lord this woman said she had signed the receipt? A. That she had written it; that it was not Madame Follet's hand-writing, but she wrote the receipt herself - I told the magistrate that she said she wrote it herself; that I swear positively - what I said before the magistrate was taken down, and read over to me, and I signed it - I told the magistrate that she said the milliner did not write the receipt, but she wrote it; I told the magistrate so, and it was taken down - I said to the prisoner herself, that it was written in a very slovenly manner, and did not look like Madame Follet's handwriting, and I said so to the magistrate, and I said that the prisoner told me that if I doubted its correctness, I could send and ascertain, as Madame Follet only lived in the next street, and the apology she made was, Mr. Follet did not keep a clerk; that he was a foreigner, and wrote the receipt himself - Madame Follet lived in Conduit-street.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing to prevent your sending to Madame Follet? A. I sent and requested her to come, but she took care I should not see her - Madame Follet wrote to her; she opened all Madame Follet's letters, and prevented my seeing her - I seldom go out - I had better health when I travelled.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you went to Gray's with her to pawn the things? A. Three or four months, I do not exactly know; it was not in July, it was before July; it must have been in April, May, or June.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand that it was illness kept you from going to Madame Follet's? A. No; she said Madame Follet was not satisfied with one bill being paid, and insisted on my paying the other - I was not able to pay it, and did not go to her - I was unable to go out at times, but not every day - Mr. Tufnell was present when she said she wrote the receipt herself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I believe a gentleman came to the door of the court with you and retired? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was that Mr. Tufnell? A. No; I left Mr. Tufnell this morning at the coffee-house; I left him in the street at the door of the London coffee-house; I did not see him go in - I did not get out of the coach; he did not come in the coach with me, he came with some other witnesses - I am sure Mr. Tufnell was present when the girl said she wrote this herself - Mr. Tufnell was examined before the magistrate, and I told the magistrate that Mr. Tufnell was present when the girl said she wrote it; I do not know whether it was the writing of the receipt, or the payment of the money. I distinctly swear that I told the magistrate that Mr. Tufnell was present when the girl said she wrote the receipt; I do not know what was taken down - what I swore was read over to me, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170035"></xptr>I think that was in it; I have no doubt but it was read over; I am sure it was read over; I am quite satisfied of that - it was when she was taken up at Margate that she told me she wrote the receipt - the officer was not present who took her up, I think he had left the room - the receipt was in London.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When she was taken up at Margate she told you she had written the receipt? A. Yes; it was the first question I asked her on her being taken up.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. She was then in custody? A. She was at our house - I do not know whether the officer was present, or whether he had gone down stairs when I asked her the question.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. She had been taken by an officer? A. Yes; whether he was present at that conversation I do not know - I think it was before he came - Mr. Tufnell said he should give her in custody.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Then she was not in custody? A. I think not; Mr. Tufnell said he would give her in custody - the constable had gone to get a warrant to search her boxes, and during that time I think she said so - I do not know whether the constable had been sent for or whether he had left the room; I do not know whether he had been sent for or not - I said I thought the officer had left the room, because I think he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell me you thought it was before the officer was sent for? A. I do not know whether it was before or during the time he was gone for the warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Had this woman power to pawn any property of yours when she chose? A. Not when she chose without my orders - I had not given her a carte blanche to pawn goods whenever she wanted money - I accused her of having done it without orders - I kept her in my service afterwards - I know Mr. Cotterell, a pawnbroker - I never told him I had given the prisoner authority to pawn, or any thing of the kind - I know Livermore - I have never but once gone to Cotterell's shop myself - I never said any thing to that effect to Livermore - I never authorised Ann to pawn things without my consent; I did not tell Livermore that I had given her a general authority to pawn things, nor to that effect - it is two or three months ago since I went to Cotterell's shop; I walked there - I was compelled to go there when she told me she had pawned things without my consent; she went with me - I pawned things when I went to release the diamonds; I have never had these diamonds in pawn through the hands of Ann Vickers but once, that was done without my consent - they were given her to pawn for 200l., instead of which she pawned them for 120l. - the things I pawned to release the diamonds are so numerous I cannot mention them - she had taken them prior; she confessed to me she had pawned them, and to release them had taken some goods, and it was not sufficient - she did not say she had pawned them at Cotterell's; she said they had been pawned at Cotterell's, and when it was found out, she fell down on her knees and said, "They are not at Gray's, they are at Cotterell's;" and I thought it necessary to go myself to Cotterell's - when I went to release the diamonds, I pawned one or two gold chains, an Indian shawl, and other articles; she had taken them there before by my desire - I kept her in my service six or seven months after that - I had not enough to make up the money, and I said if he would send the diamonds the next morning to my house, he should have the money - I did not mention Ann Vickers's name; I have only one servant, that is 
               <persName id="t18331017-55-person608">

               <p>Q. Did you tell him if he would send next morning your servant would pay the deficiency? A. Yes; I did not say, I did not say so - I had no servant but Ann Vickers - when I referred to my servant, I meant Ann Vickers - she was present at the time I gave the pawnbroker that direction.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe on this subject you made an accusation against a Mr. Barnes, a jeweller, on the subject of pawning - you charged Mr. Barnes with a crime? A. Yes; and preferred a Bill - I was sworn and the Bill was thrown out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where Dobree lives? A. Yes; I have gone there to pawn, but not with

               <p>Q. Now I will ask you one question. You have stated now that Mr. Tufnell was present when the prisoner said she wrote the receipt - is there any thing you know of to prevent Mr. Tufnell's being called as a witness for the prosecution? Witness.. Am I to answer?</p>
               <p>Q. Now instead of applying to my Lord about it - it is a question no honest woman need object to answer - is there any thing you know to prevent Mr. Tufnell appearing as a witness? A. Am I to answer the question, my Lord?</p>
               <p>COURT. I see no objection to your answering it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know anything to prevent his being a witness? A. No; he is in health - it was in the drawing room at Margate, in Mr. Tufnell's presence that the prisoner told me she had written the receipt - it was in the early part of the morning before breakfast - Mr. Tufnell was present when I first questioned her on the subject - he was present at the commencement of the conversation - I dont recollect whether he remained to the end of it - the prisoner and he left the room together I believe; with the constable - she confessed to the constable herself, that the only thing she was afraid of was the forgery - that was not in my presence; the constable said, she said so in his house - there is nothing to prevent his being here - there was nothing to prevent my subpoening him; but I thought there was sufficient evidence without him.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was Schofield the officer sent for to your house to search the prisoner's boxes? A. He was; I do not know the day - we had been three weeks at Margate - I was not present when he searched the boxes - some were in a room down stairs and some up stairs - I had no other servant.</p>

            . I am a police-officer of Marlborough-street. I was sent for to search the prisoner's boxes, in Princes-street, on the 20th of September, in consequence of a letter I received from Margate - Mr. Tufnell and Mr. Alkin, (the attorney) were present when I searched the boxes; there was a piece of paper taken away by Mr. Alkin; he found it in my presence and gave it to Mr. Tufnell to look at - I produced the receipt just now - I received it at the police-office - I do not know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170036"></xptr>whether I should know the piece of paper again which was found in the box by Mr. Alkin, unless I see it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At that time the girl was in prison at Dover, or Margate? A. She was and not present.</p>

            . I am the attorney for Mrs. Hampton, in this prosecution; I was present when Schofield was sent for to search the prisoner's boxes, on Friday, the 20th of September; I had returned from Margate with Mrs. Hampton, that morning - I found two pieces of paper in the box, in the presence of the officer(producing them).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How did you open the box? A. The boxes were open - the large box was corded; the lock had evidently been broken; I did not find a box entirely open; the large trunk was open; the paper was not found in that trunk; it was in another box in a cupboard - that box was not locked - I should think there was nothing to prevent anybody either putting paper in or taking goods out of it - at that time I understand the prisoner was in Dover Gaol - the landlord and his family were in the house at the time - Schofield and Mr. Tufnell were present when these were taken out - I have not seen Mr. Tufnell to day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it he that introduced you to the prisoner's room? A. He told me certainly that was the prisoner's room; and I went down with him and Schofield, and in that room I found the box unlocked; several things were in the box - I did not try whether the lock was in order; I found no property there of value, except some books; and things belonging to Mrs. Hampton, of trifling value.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find valuable property of Mrs. Hampton's in the large box? A. Yes; the various articles which are in the other indictments - there were towels and things; but the large trunk contained nothing but clothes - there were several articles of value in the smaller box.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has employed you on this occasion? A. Mr. Tufnell wrote to me from Margate, but, I consider Mrs. Hampton as my client - I received my retainer from Mr. Tufnell: the person who wrote to me I considered my retainer.</p>

            . I live at No. 49, Conduit-street. My wife is a milliner - she was in the habit of supplying Mrs. Hampton with goods - in July last Mrs. Hampton was indebted to Mrs. Follet - there was an account this year, and the year before (looking at a bill) - this bill is mine, but the receipt is not; that is her bill, the receipt is not my hand-writing, nor my wife's.</p>
               <p>Q. Has anybody in your house authority to give receipts, but yourself, your wife, and Mr. Atkinson? A. No; it is not Mr. Atkinson's hand-writing - I never received from the prisoner two notes of 50l. and one of 10l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you been in the habit of calling at Mrs. Hampton's to get your money? A. Yes, lately; I have been several times in August - I could not see her - I have seen her, but I could not see her when I called; I have seen her since this affair occurred, but not before - I called several times in August to see her - I cannot recollect whether I called in September; she was not in London, I believe, then - I have called at Mrs. Hampton's before August; I cannot say exaclty when - I did not see her often; I never saw her when I called at her house for money; Mrs. Hampton was rather backward in paying, and I called for the money; the bill was promised to be paid several times.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Who did you seen when you called in July and August? A. Miss Ann Vickers always; it was by her that Mrs. Hampton was denied to me during August; I went particularly one day to see her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have called before August for money? A. No, I cannot exactly say I did call; I have called for payment of a bill before August - there were several appointments to pay the bill, that it would be paid at such a time.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you ever called at Mrs. Hampton's house at any time before August, for the purpose of getting it paid? A. I called in consequence of these promises not being performed; every time I called Ann Vickers gave me the message, that Mrs. Hampton could not be seen; she was always the person who told me that she could not be seen.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had Mrs. Hampton been in the habit of coming to your house? A. Yes; she has not been at our house for a long time; I used to go sometimes to her house with dresses; I used to send them - I never took them myself; I have been myself, but not at that time - I cannot exactly tell how lately I have been there with dresses; I have lately sent a dress to Mrs. Hampton - she called herself at my house to order it; I should think about a fortnight ago - when I went myself with dresses I never saw her; I had taken no dresses to her to put on at the time; I never took dresses to Mrs. Hampton myself; I have not accompanied the servant who took them; I have been myself to try on dresses; I was able to see her when I tried the dresses on; I have gone many times when I could not see her before August last.</p>

             was taken into custody, she stated to Mrs. Hampton in my presence, that the receipts of Madame Follet (that this receipt) was written by herself, and she had not paid the money to Madame Follet - that was the morning of Wednesday the 11th of September I think; the very morning of her return - I was present when Mr. Alkin found some pieces of paper in the prisoner's box; they were found in Ann Vickers' room down stairs, and were shown to me at the time, and were put by I believe by Mr. Alkin; I myself afterwards looked for these papers, and found them, and gave them to Schofield - I am on my oath, and I swear these are the papers - there were some butcher's bills with them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say that these papers were first found by Alkin? A. No; at least they were found - I am not quite certian whether I did not find them first; but they are the very papers that were there - they were give into Schofield's possession, and I told Alkin they were there - they had been collected; the papers were altogether, tied up in a bundle; they were found in the kitchen - I cannot say exactly where in the kitchen - they were not on the dresser.</p>
               <p>Q. If I understand you right, you and Mr. Alkin were searching the box? A. Yes, and Schofield; and in those boxes the papers in question were found; and that was in Ann Vickers' room down stairs - the papers were left in Ann Vickers' room, and when I went to Bristol the box was sealed up; the packet of papers were sealed up; and when I came back I looked for the papers - I wanted to find them, and I certainly did find them, tied up with an immense number of bills and papers; and I gave them to Alkin, and knew them to be the same - I don't know what was to prevent Alkin or Schofield, or myself from keeping them after they were first found - I was not searching for them - I said when I found them, "Here is something which corresponds with the receipt" - I intended to take it away at the time; I don't know why I did not take them away; I certainly saw them there - I omitted it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you omit it if you intended to take them away? A. I swear they are the same papers that were found - I was in such a hurry I was not there at the sealing - I did not seal them myself; they were not sealed in my presence; let me recollect a few moments; I think it must be from half an hour to three quarters that I staid in the house after the papers were found; I was at Marlborough-street after seven o'clock in the evening - I had several things to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not strike you, as you intended to keep the papers, it was just as important a thing as anything you had to do? A. It did; it struck me afterwards; and - let me see; just let me recollect myself - I was anxious to see that the writing-desk was safe - I omitted taking the papers away at the moment; it slipped my memory; I was in a hurry - I went up stairs to see if the other places were broken open; then I came down again and went out above half an hour after - there was certainly plenty of time to take the papers - these papers were not sealed up - there was a bundle of papers sealed, but not these - I afterwards found these in the kitchen - on the dresser I believe.</p>

               <p>Q. The very place you swore before you did not find them; now I ask you was it not on the dresser? A. No, decidedly not on the dresser; they were in the kitchen; not in her room; they were taken away from there and tied up with a bundle of old papers.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not sworn to me, that you found them on the dresser? A. No, I did not - I spoke to the servant-maid, Sarah Yarnold, to know where all the old papers had been placed; she said they were tied up together - they were brought ot me in a bundle, and I myself took them out of the bundle in the kitchen - I cannot tell what parot of the kitchen; I intended to take them away, and forgot it - I have not been in Court during this trial - I have not spoken to anybody about the trial; I have been waiting a long way from here on purpose to be sent for when wanted - not a long way off; I was with some friends at North, Simpson's, &amp; co. - nobody has told me anything that has been sworn to-day.</p>
               <p>Q. You conducted Schofield and Alkin to the prisoner's room? A. I did - on my word I cannot say whether I did or did not; I believe I did certainly in the backkitchen - I have now a distinct recollection that I went down myself and said, "Good God, here are the locks open."</p>
               <p>Q. It astonished you to find the locks open? A. I knew they were open before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to make that exclamation,"Good God! hereare the locks open," A. Why it was my own exclamation; I did not know the locks down stairs were open, but the locks up stairs were - I knew the locks in Mrs. Hampton's house were open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you said, "Good God! the locks are open," but you knew they were open before; Mr. Tufnell was it not to convey to the officer and Mr. Alkin, that you were perfectly astonished at finding them so, that you made that exclamation? A. No; I don't know why I made the exclamation - I certainly knew from the letter of Mr. Thompson, which I received at Margate, that the locks had been picked.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you exclaim, "Good God! her are the locks open," when you knew they were open? A. Oh! but not these locks I meant the locks were open up stairs, and I decidedly did not mean these down stairs; I had no reason to think any locks but those up stairs had been opened; decidedly not - I used that exclamation, because I was astonished to find all her own locks picked too.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been to Princes-street before that day; when had you been there, before you took Schofield and alkin there? A. On the Saturday three weeks; not afterwards, decidedly; I was close to the trunks, certainly, when I made the exclamation; there were three I think; I don't think all were picked; I exclaimed about two; the large trunk had the lock open; I saw that when it was open.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was that trunk corded or not? A. It was corded, and very heavy.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How did you discover the locks were open immediately, on going into the kitchen? A. When we uncorded it, I think it was then I made the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170038"></xptr>exclamation; it was just after we went into the kitchen; the trunk opened of itself when the cord was taken off; I think I went into the front kitchen first, and in the other kitchen afterwards, and when I got in I saw the trunk uncorded.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was not uncorded when you went in first? A. Yes, I saw it with the cords on; the prisoner at that time was a prisoner at Margate; Schofield went into the house with me at the time; she was at Margate or Dover; we had come up to town together, for the purpose of making a search; I did not ask her for her keys, decidedly not, because I had them before; they were taken from her at Margate - her keys were in her box at Margate, and those keys I have now; and those keys I brought up from Margate to town.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there the least mark of violence on the trunks, were they not opened as a gentleman who had the keys might open them? A. Decidedly not, the locks were taken off evidently; I think one was totally off; I have no notion how the locks came off; I was there the whole time at Margate that she was there; there were a large quantity of empty jewel cases in the trunk; I can form no idea how they came there, I was absent the whole time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there no valuable property in the boxes? A. There was linen, towels, and a vast quantity of empty jewel cases, but no jewels; there were some clothes; some Indian towels.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You say you have known Mrs. Hampton thirteen years, have you been on friendly terms with her? A. Very much so; occasionally I have visited her house; I have been to Dover with her; Mrs. Atkins was the landlady at Dover; I have not seen Mrs. Atkins since I was at Dover.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you on good terms with her? A. She was very angry at my finding out that the postman had been defrauded of 1s. 6d. out of 2s. 6d. his Christmas box, which was to be given him; she was very angry at my finding out he only received 1s.; she had certainly the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you angry at her finding out anything? A. I was; I was at Boulogne some years ago with Mrs. Hampton, and at Tunbridge Wells; I was at Dover I think a fortnight or three weeks at one time; I took the lodging with Mrs. Hampton; on my word I cannot say whether she was with me when I took them, it is two years ago; I dined at Mrs. Hampton's while I was at Dover, and so I did at Margate, at Boulogne, and at Tunbridge-wells; one day at the hotel, and another day at Mrs. Hampton's; I am not related to her; not at all related; I think I have not been to any other places with her; not that I recollect; if you will mention to me, I will tell you.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't forget the trip to Cranford-bridge? A. Oh! I was certainly at Windsor; I went in the same chaise; I had entirely forgotten that; we went go Windsor; Mrs. Hampton always paid for the journey, she paid me again if I paid it; when I went out of town she always requested me to settle the bill, and then she gave it me back again; it was repaid to me; I did not pay Mrs. Hampton's expences; she paid my travelling expenses; I never had any expenses paid by Mrs. Hampton which concerned me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Concerned you solely you mean? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Don't you think when you travel with a lady in a post chaise, at least half of it belongs to you? A. Yes, but she would not allow me - I mean to swear; when she was staying at her lodging I did not pay; she said for my dinner; I was on a visit to her at all the different times.</p>
               <p>Q. That being the case, of course, she paid for your bed-room? A. Except at Margate, where I paid for the bed-room myself - I went to Margate on the day of the storm, and the house was occupied, and had not sufficient room - Mrs. Hampton paid for my bed-room at Dover to my knowledge; it was the same house - Mrs. Hampton paid for it; I do not recollect that I paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, you say the prisoner said she wrote the receipt? A. She did, she was just taken into custody at the time; at least, the constable had not got her; it was before the constable came - I had her in my possession in the room - nobody was present at the confession but Mrs. Hampton and myself - I am not quite sure whether I told the magistrate of that confession or not; it was not that I took her up for - I was examined before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you a witness in a case against Mr. Barnes brought by Mrs. Hampton? A. Yes, I went before the Grand Jury - the bill was ignored - sometimes I and sometimes Mrs. Hampton have instructed the solicitor in this prosecution - I recommended Mr. Alkin as the solicitor; I employed him; I wrote to him; he has never before been concerned for me - I recommended him because he was a connection - there were two servants in the house in Princes-street (a maid servant and a man) when I went and found the box open - they were keeping the house - I made no inquiry as to how the girl's locks happened to be open.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. The house in Princes-street is only partly occupied by Mrs. Hampton? A. Yes; Mr. Thompson lived there - when the girl left Margate on the 7th of September, she stated it was her purpose to go to London; she then had plenty of opportunity of doing anything in the house of Mrs. Hampton she chose.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said you had the keys; on your oath, as you will answer to your God, did you ever open or pick the locks of either of the boxes? A. I did not; never - never - never, I believe, was I down there till that very day; the first time I saw the two papers in question was when Schofield and Alkin were present.(Receipt put in and read.)</p>
               <p>The two papers being produced, had the following words on them.</p>

I most positively deny the charge Mrs. Hampton brings against me; I never saw the receipt; I never gave her a receipt from Madame Follet - in February I paid 40l., bringing the bill receipted to that effect; then gave it to Mrs. Hampton, and never saw it since - before the 22nd of July last I received from her two 50l. and a 10l. note; she desiring me to take them to Mr. Barnes, in part payment of the heavy bill she owed him, which I did, and brought Mr. Barnes' receipt, and gave it into her hands - Madame Follet had been promised to have her bill settled in July; Mrs.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170039"></xptr>Hampton sent me several times to put off the payment, and they came for the bill at different times, and she told me to put them off when they did come - in July last I was desired to tell them by Mrs. Hampton, that in consequence of the failing of her agent she was unable to pay the bill; I did so - he afterwards called again from time to time, and in August last Mr. Follet called every week for his money, and gave violent knocks at the door, which Mrs. Hampton must have heard; and Mrs. Hampton was fearful he would force himself into the drawing-room, to ask her for his money - she heard him every week declare that unless he was paid his bill he would force his way into the drawing-room himself to her - she always sat with the drawing-room door locked; and desired the door should be shut in his face - she applied to Mr. Tufnell to know what she should do; he applied to a lawyer, and brought her home word in my presence, that Madame Follet could not hurt her or call on her for the money, she being a married woman; she must sue her husband; and to treat it with indifference - Madame and Mr. Follet frequently applied, but Mrs. Hampton never would be seen - at another time when Madame Follet called for her bill, Mrs. Hampton told me to tell her to do her worst and her best, and to sue her husband for it, and I told her so - Madame Follet again applied and she desired me to tell her to wait till October, and she would pay her; I told her so, and if Mrs. Hampton had the least suspicion of the receipt being forged, she was in the habit of hearing them apply for their money every week three days out of seven in August, and never would be seen by her - she was in the habit of going to Regent-street, to purchase articles, and passing by their door, and going out of an evening with Mr. Tufnell, in August, and passing Madame Follet's house, where she could have inquired about the receipt - I never received money from her to pay to Madame Follet - the money in question I received was for Mr. Barnes, which I paid him, and brought her the bill and receipt - I have gone with different messages which she has given me for Madame Follet, and she has been in the habit of hearing them give loud knocks at the door, and stating they would have their money, and not leave the house till they got it; and she has desired me to show them into my room, and sent her daughter up and down with messages, when he was in the house, declaring he would not leave the house till he had his money - I have not the least hesitation in saying this is all done to put me out of the way and banish me, to crush the facts I am in possession of concerning the criminal intercourse between them, such as his sleeping with her, her clothing him, and feeding him, and making him presents of money, and diamond pins; also of her lending him at different times, large sums of money - when he has received her money from her agent in the city, he has borrowed large sums from her, which made her unable to pay her debts; and I am in possession of her pawning jewellery, clothes, and different things, even her petticoats, and other things, with pawnbrokers who have from her received authority to take them in - the whole of it is a conspiracy between Mrs. Hampton and Mr. Tufnell to banish me and my evidence - Colonel Hampton is daily and hourly expected in England, in consequence of suspicions of their criminal intercourse, for he has heard of her shameful proceedings with Mr. Tufnell, and they daily expect he will arrive - their principal object is to defraud the tradespeople and throwing all the blame on my head, and to banish my evidence against them.</p>

            . I am a jeweller and silversmith, and live at No. 15, Henrietta-street, Cavendish-square. I knew the prisoner as the servant, of Mrs. Hampton; Mrs Hampton was a customer of mine - at present she is a debtor to the extent of many hundred pounds for jewellery and plate - between the 15th and 22nd of July, I remember the prisoner paying me on two or three occasions, money on account of Mrs. Hampton - on two or three occasions, in the month of July - (refering to his book) - I have an entry on the 17th of July, to credit of Mrs. Hampton, "cash 50l.," and on the 20th of July, "Of cash 60l.," - here is "Mrs. H." with the date on one of the notes I received from Mrs. Hampton; the date looks like "20, 7.," which is July.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have spoken to two payments; in what was the 60l. paid, was it by a £50 note, or what? A. To the best of my recollection it was a £50 note and a £10 note - I did not make an entry of the note and the manner in which it was paid - I mark every note, and have marked this "Mrs. H."</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What did you mean by "H.?" A. Hampton - I have seen a note with my hand-writing, and "17 - 7," by which I have no doubt the payment on the 17th was made by that very note - (looking at a note) - I should say I never received this note, but on the 17th of July, a note of £50 was paid me, and I recognise the other note as one I received from the prisoner on Mrs. Hampton's account - the balance due on the 20th of July, would be about 700l.; I had very often applied for payment - I never gained a personal interview with Mrs. Hamptno on applying for payment; the messages were always sent through Ann Vickers - I have received a great number of sums of money from the prisoner from Mrs. Hampton, somewhere about 600l. at different times, I would say 500l. - I have several times endeavoured to gain a personal interview with Mrs. Hampton, and have been unable - Mrs. Hampton made a charge against me.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been acquainted with Ann Vickers? A. As the servant of Mrs. Hampton, since February, 1832 - Mrs. Hampton herself gave me no order for any part of the property she has had of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray have you and Ann Vickers been on very intimate terms? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not mean the ordinary terms of intimacy; pray have you been very late of a night at the house in Princes-street, when Mrs. Hampton was from home? A. Yes, I have staid there all night long - I understand it was not for receiving this £50 note, knowing it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170040"></xptr>to have been stolen, that I was indicted, it was on another note.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you, ever since the charge was made before the magistrate, been in the way, ready to come forward and answer any charge? A. Always; I never took any order from Mrs. Hampton for goods for her - I think I have had two personal interviews with Mrs. Hampton - the orders for goods came invariably through the young woman, and she made the payments - I am a single man.</p>

            . I am managing clerk at Mr. Cotterell's. I know the prisoner; she has pawned articles at our house, articles of great value, diamonds - I know Mrs. Hampton; I saw her on the 14th of May at Mr. Cotterell's shop - Ann Vickers was with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Hampton on that occasion, in Ann Vickers's presence, give her authority to pledge with you, and give you permission to take in any articles she might bring of her's? A. She did, and I have acted on it ever since; I shouldthink I have advanced 400l. or 500l. through that girl on Mrs. Hampton's account - I should think as much.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you summoned here on a trial, in the event of which, if the prisoner is convicted, you will have to restore 
               <persName id="t18331017-55-person622">al</persName>
             the property? A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if the prisoner was convicted of stealing the property you say Mrs. Hampton gave her authority to pawn, you would have to give it up? I do not know that - I have a book with me containing an account of the pledges in September; I received pledges on the 9th of September - nothing between the 7th and the 9th; nothing on the 7th - on the 9th, a silver tea-pot, two castors, a mug, six dessert forks, a pair of sugar-tongs, two ladles, a butter-knife, two silver soap-dished, and one cover, a fish-slice, a silver gravy-spoon; 34l. was what I advanced - on the same day there was a gold chain pawned for 15l. 6s. 6d.; on the 10th, two gowns for 12s., and a shawl and handkerchief for 16s.; there was nothing on the 11th - I have not received any thing in pawn from Ann Vickers since that time.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you advance the money to her on the faith of the authority given to you by Mrs. Hampton? A. It was advanced to her as the servant of Mrs. Hampton; I advanced the money on these goods exactly as I did on all the other goods - I am only a shopman to Mr. Cotterell; it does not make a penny difference to me whether my master is obliged to give up the property or not.</p>

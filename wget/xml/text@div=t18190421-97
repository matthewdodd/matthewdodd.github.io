On the 27th of March, my wife and I were taking care of a house in Fitzroy-place; we left nobody in our own house - we had not given it up. A woman sent a girl to give me information; I went, and found my cottage-door open. I informed Mr. Pool, and he said he saw a man and a boy going over the fields; I followed them, and saw two men, one with a long dark coat, the other appeared like a soldier. I went up to the man in a dark coat, and took a bundle from him, saying,</p>
               <p>"These things belong to my wife." I went to strike him; he fell on the ground, and said to the soldier,</p>
               <p>"Return me my money." The soldier then gave him two half crowns - it was the prisoner. We returned back. As we were going along I said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"If you will assure me here is all my property, I will forgive you." He said there was. I told him to run; he said he was lame and could not. We went to a public-house, and an officer was sent for; I immediately gave him in charge. I do not know how he got into the house - I found my bundle on him.</p>

            . I am a soldier. On the 27th of March I was at the Vine, public-house, in Kentish-town, I saw the prisoner, and a boy, with a bundle in his apron - I suspected it was stolen; part of a gown hung out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210048"></xptr>apron. He went towards Islington, I followed him. As soon as he saw me he began running, I ran after him, and seized him, the other got away. I could not call for assistance. He laid himself down, and would not walk - I said I would not handle him; he then got up, and gave me 5 s. to pay for some beer - I took it to get him forward, as I could not get assistance. We met the prosecutor, I then told him he had got the bundle and was in my custody. He offered me a guinea to let him go, but I insisted on keeping him.</p>

            . On Saturday, the 27th of March, about six o'clock, I was sent for, and took the prisoner in charge with the things. I asked him how he came to do it? he said the other man, who had got away went into the house and he received the things. I found 21 s. on him; he said the soldier wanted him to give him a guinea and two silk handkerchiefs, but he would not, but he gave him 5 s., which he returned.</p>

When we came to a gentleman's house he left me, brought the bundle out, and said it was his master's; he asked me to carry it in my apron. I took it innocently; the soldier came up, and asked what it was? I said it was nothing to him; he said it was stolen, and he knew where it came from - the boy ran away. The soldier said if I gave him a guinea he would let me go; I gave him 5 s., and he told me to run - the prosecutor came up.</p>

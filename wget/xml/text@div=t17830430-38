               <p>Court. Was that in the place you left it the over night? - I went backwards in the yard, twelve holes bored with a spike in the pannel of the kitchen door; the back door that goes into the yard; and underneath that door was a hole cut, and four holes of each side, to break the piece out, and from the top of the place where the bolt was, is 2 feet 8 inches high; and from the bottom of the hole to the fill of the door, is eight inches.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the hole large enough to admit a person to get in? - It was but four inches one way and five in the height.</p>
               <p>How was the door got open? - That I cannot tell, it was unbolted.</p>
               <p>Could hand be introduced through that hole, and force the bolt? - Yes, from thence I went backwards into the shop; going into my shop I found my till burst open.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell me the situation of your shop? - It is towards the street.</p>
               <p>And what room does it communicate with backwards? - The kitchen.</p>
               <p>Is there a door from the kitchen to the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What state did you find that door in? - That door was not locked or shut; I did not shut it, as we leave it open that we may hear readily; the key of my till was taken out of my glass-case, there was five pound in silver in it; and twenty-four or twenty-five shillings worth of halfpence, it was all gone every halfpenny? the next thing he saw, was the glass-case in the window had been pushed backwards, and there I found dark with the grease all round it.</p>

He muttered something, but I could not tell what he said; says I, I insist on knowing what you have got there, and will know; will you says he; yes says I, I will; I went to catch him, and he drew from me, and took to his heels, and ran up Artillery-lane; and I cried out Stop thief! and he directly threw the handkerchief away with the things in it; and an iron spike at the time he threw away, I desired the other watchman to pick up the things while I pursued the man; I pursued him, and never lost sight of him till he was taken; which was in Petticoat-lane near Widegate alley, there was two men more came to my assistance, and they laid hold of him before I got up; but I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the same man that you saw firs t? - I am sure he is the same man, for my eyes were never off him, we took him to the watch-house; there is somethings that I took out of his great coat pocket, a loaded pistol, a picklock key in his waistcoat pocket, and a knife; that pistol and that great gimblet was in his great coat pocket; this small one was picked up in the street where he threw the parcel; one of the watchmen picked up the small gimblet; I took seven watches out of his body coat pocket, and many buckles and buttons, and many things, I do not know what they were, out of every pocket belonging to him; we saw him pull out whole strings of gold rings, out of his breeches pockets, and fling them in the ashes or any where.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. What kind of light had you when you pursued him? - It was not moonlight, it was a brightish sort of a morning, but I was so nigh him that my eyes was never off him.</p>

               <p>Repeat to me what things you have? - Here are three bunches of gold rings, two punch ladles, and three rings that were on his fingers, one set with stone, and two plain.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know these three articles came out of that bundle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Delaforce. Can you swear to any one of these articles? - I swear to them all, there is a poesy on each of the single rings, that I can swear to them by.</p>
               <p>How do you know the bunches? - I can<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300076"></xptr> swear to them by putting them off and on some times.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you swear to plain gold rings by putting on and off? - By the maker's name in them, the maker that I employed.</p>
               <p>Court. Are they all of your own make? - No. Sir.</p>
               <p>Is there any of the rings of the bunch that you can swear to? - This stone ring, this morning ring set with stones, that is in the bunch.</p>
               <p>Court. As to the punch ladles? - I can swear to them, by a sixpence and a shilling of Queen Anne, and King George, that is in them.</p>
               <p>Court. Is not that a common thing for punch ladles? - I had them made myself.</p>
               <p>Is it a part of your business to sell new plate? - New, as well as old.</p>
               <p>Was there any other part of the bundle of goods that were delivered to you, that you knew to be your property? - Yes, there are the watches, because I had all the maker's names put down in a book.</p>
               <p>What else could you swear to, take the inventory in your hand and look over it? - I should not do any injustice, to swear to the whole, but I would be very careful what I did in such a thing as this, the goods have been in my possession so long that I could swear to them all.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell me of the articles that you are sure of? - The watches, the rings, the punch ladles, and the candlesticks.</p>
               <p>Can you swear that you lost out of your shop, as many articles as correspond with those that you found afterwards in the bundle? - Yes, my Lord, and more, I lost seven table spoons and many other things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Were all the articles that you have enumerateed in your possession the preceeding day? - They were at night when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Were they all contained in the bundle that was found? - They were all in the bundle that was found by the watchman, except two plain rings, and one stone one that were on his fingers, all that was in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner's Council. Ask the man who can tell you, I do not want to stop the question.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. My Lord, here is evidence to prove that this man was seen to pick the bundle up, which amounts to nothing, if any of the things that were in the bundle were found on his person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. While you was at the watch-house, was the things that you found on that person, any of them put in the bundle? - The rings in particular, were kept separate in the bundle.</p>
               <p>Yes, but some things that Mr. Delaforce has sworn to? - Yes.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was at Kingsland-road to see a gentleman, a master taylor; I was at dinner with him, we had something to drink, which got into my head, I slept at his house, as I had some money about me; I desired him to call me at three in the morning, which he did, and in coming along in my way home, I picked up a bag with a handkerchief tied to it, and I carried it in my hand; for the distance of twelve or fourteen yards; upon which, finding it too heavy to carry in my hand, I took and swung it over my shoulder; then the handkerchief being undone, the things came out, and I laid down the bag, and put what came out of the handkerchief into my pockets; and so tied the handkerchief up; one of the watchmen came up to me, and asked what I had, I told him I had found something, but did not know what it contained, he run after me again, I was very willing to shun him, for fear he should strike me, and so I dropped the bag; I have seen the gentleman that saw me pick up the bag, he heard that I was in the Poultry Compter, so he came and asked me my name, and how I came by the bag; I asked him his name, and I gave it to my friends: If the laws of England will find a man guilty for picking up a thing in the street, I am guilty, otherwise I am as innocent as the child that is unborn.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. Where do you live? - I live in Houndsditch, I know the prisoner no further only when I saw him pick up the bundle, and when I saw him in the Compter.</p>
               <p>When did you see him pick up the bundle? - On the 7th of April, on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Where? - It was just close towards the turning down Cock-lane; I was going to turn down Cock-lane.</p>
               <p>From where? - From Hounsditch.</p>
               <p>What time of the day? - To the best of my knowledge half after three in the morning, I saw a bundle before me, and I thought to go to it, and before I could get to it, the prisoner got it, I saw it first, about ten or twelve yards from me, almost close to the curb stone; and before I could get it, the prisoner at the bar had the advantage of me.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by that? - He was coming to meet me, and he laid hold of the bundle; says I to him my friend you have got the start of me, he said, I suppose somebody or other will own this bundle, and if they do not says he, I shall advertise it: I said, to him where do live, says he, I can tell you, my name is Lewis, I lodge at one Mrs. Sheen's in Shakespear's-walk, Shadwell; and if you should hear any body enquire after it, I should be glad; I went about my business towards Cock-lane to call my men up to work; I parted with him, he went towards Bishopsgate-street as far as I could observe, and I went down Cock-lane to call the people, I had several men to call up to do my business.</p>
               <p>What business? - In our Passover cakes.</p>
               <p>Do they work for you? - Yes, I employ many men at that time, eight or ten to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300078"></xptr> make biscuits for my own people, we are obliged to make them early and late, I was telling some of my work folks, says I, if I had been a little sooner I should have found a bundle in the street, but what it was I could not tell, the next day I heard there was a man committed to the Compter; I went there to enquire after him, I told him if I can be of any service I will, for I am the man that saw you pick up the bundle, he sent his friends to me to be so good as to serve a man in his situation, which I would be glad to do, be he Jew or Gentile.</p>
               <p>What kind of a bundle was it you saw him pick up? - I cannot tell whether it was a bag or not, it was a sort of a darkish bundle.</p>
               <p>What size might it be? - I cannot tell, I did not take so much observation, as I was going about my own business, it was a good sizeable bundle; I think it was this length, ( about half a yard,) in a sort of dark thing, a cloath or such like.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you no curiosity to know what was in his bundle? - No, my Lord, I was very late in my business, I could not stay, I had business more material.</p>
               <p>Did not you think you had some little claim? - I thought it might have dropt out of some country cart, something, I could not tell what.</p>
               <p>Is not there a notion among you, that if any thing is found, that all those that are present are to divide it among them? - I know nothing at all about that.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell this man that you was to have half? - No.</p>
               <p>You are a very disinterested man to let this man carry off the bundle? - I was too belated in my own business.</p>
               <p>How long had you known him before? - I never saw the man before he picked up the bundle, and once in the Compter, I never made any enquiry about it, I gave him my directions.</p>
               <p>You have a good memory? - I must, my business require a good memory; it does indeed.</p>
               <p>How was the prisoner dressed that morning? - Not as he is now to be sure, I do not know how he was dressed, he had a sort of a great coat on, that I am pretty positive of.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing of any gimblets or iron crows. - No.</p>
               <p>Do you deal in silver as well as biscuits? - No, never, no man can ever say, I ever bought any silver.</p>
               <p>And did you really never see this man before? - No, my Lord, never.</p>

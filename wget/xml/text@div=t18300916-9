The prisoner was four or five months in my employ- on the 10th of August these ten sovereigns were locked up in a drawer in my first floor front room; I had the key of the drawer in my pocket - I saw them safe at half past one o'clock, and at two I sent the prisoner up to the room to fetch the back of a sofa down; when he brought it down to the shop my little boy asked my wife for a halfpenny, which she gave him, and the prisoner asked if he should go with the child to buy some pears - he went out with him, and did not return at all; I found him in custody on the 21st of August - I did not see him till then; when he went for the sofa-back he was in the room five minutes, and had an opportunity of going to the drawer - I have got none of my money again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are there not two parishes in Clerkenwell? A. Yes, but I am sure my house is in St. James' - I had a good character with the prisoner from his uncle; I always lock my drawers, and keep the key in my pocket - he always served me well; I have nothing to say against him - I would have trusted him with any thing; I believe this to be his first offence - his uncle is a purser in the Navy, and a respectable person.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you miss the money? A. Not till eight o'clock in the evening, when I went to put some money by.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I took the prisoner on the 21st of August, in Millbank-row - I did not make him any promise or threaten him; I asked if he knew Mr. Lawrence, of St. John-street - he said No; I told him I had reason to suspect him of stealing eight sovereigns from Mr. Lawrence, and he must go with me - he then said he did not take so many as eight, but acknowledged taking some, and at the station-house I heard him acknowledge taking seven; no threat or promise was made to him there - he said he had changed one sovereign at Mr. Morgan's, in Oakley-street, for a pair of trousers; I inquired, and found that true - he said he had lost some at Camberwell-fair, but he could not tell how many.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I do not remember saying what the Policeman says about the sovereigns.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a very good character.</p>

The prisoner was in custody. I found the sheets tied in a handkerchief at the foot of the bed; and in a hole which was made in the hay loft, I found a pair of boots and a great coat of mine; he had left a pair of shoes and his own hat behind there. The prisoner had been in my service for thirteen months, and knew the way of the house, and knew I was always out at that time. My things are worth more than 30 s.</p>

            . I am a waiter at the Grapes, public-house, Whitecross-street, opposite Davis's. In consequence of information, about four minutes after three o'clock, I went over, and found the prisoner in the bedroom, adjoining the hay loft - he had a red night cap on; I watched him some time, and saw him pulling the sheets off the bed. I then went in and brought him out, and took him into the loft - he had neither shoes nor hat on; he asked leave to get them from among the hay, and did so. I looked into the hole in the middle of the hay, where they were, and found a great coat and boots. There was a hole broken through the lath and plaister wall, from the loft into the bed-room, so that the door could be unbolted. Davis's daughter and a person were in the house. The room is part of the dwelling-house.</p>

            . I am an officer. I found the prisoner in Kemp's custody in the loft, and found a great coat concealed amongst some trusses of hay, and on looking further I found a large hole broken through the wall, which is about five inches thick; a hand could then reach the bolt. I went to the other bed-room, and found the pannels of that door split to pieces, the beading cut down, and the pannels pushed in, so that a hand could undo that door also - it must have been done with a knife. The prosecutor's house is in the City.</p>
               <p>RICE DAVIS. The property is all mine, and was safe when I went out - the handkerchief they are tied in is not mine. The boots were in a bag, which does not belong to me. They are worth 3 l. 1 s.</p>

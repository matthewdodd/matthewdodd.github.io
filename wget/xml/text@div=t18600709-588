On 27th March, Robert Blaylock's case was taken—he was sworn and heard, and M'Gall was heard, and the Committee resolved that the vote of Robert Blaylock was a bad vote, and be struck out of the poll—at page 17 in the general resolutions, 29th March, I find a reso<lb></lb>lution of the Committee that "Robert Blaylock was bribed to vote for Mr. Hodgson for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of which 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid him by Robert M'Gall"—the resolution is, "The Committee are of opinion that William M'Gall, in his evidence before them, was guilty of wilful and corrupt perjury."</p>

Yes, long before the election; he came to me and said he was very unwell: he said he wanted a pair of shoes, and I gave him a shilling or two to help to buy them; I gave him no money at the election, and had no talk with him about money at the election.

No. Did you give them to anybody to give to him? No, I did not. Did four sovereigns never pass from you for Brown? No. Will you swear that? I will most distinctly—such a circumstance never existed. What is the most you have ever given him at a time? Never more than I have told you; two or three shillings. Did you give him two or three shillings about the election time? No, it was in the summer time. Since the summer up to this time you have never given him a shilling? No. And you have never given any person money for him? No; I most distinctly swear that.

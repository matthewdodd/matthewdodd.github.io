                  </hi>. I have one partner, we are stationers. On 21st Aug., the prisoner entered my shop about 5 o'clock in the afternoon—he inquired the price of silver pencil cases with penholders attached—I told him the price, and showed him some—I put a tray of them on the counter—he did not like them, and he required to see a second case—I removed a second tray from the window and set them before him, and I replaced the first tray in its original position—he did not like any that were in the second tray, and he wished to purchase a penny penholder—when he purchased that, I noticed the stone of a pencil case glistening under his arm—when he was about to leave the shop, I stretched out my hand and removed the pencil case from below his arm—I called a policeman and gave him into custody—the officer took the pencil case; this is it—it is the property of myself and partner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I take the pencil cases out of the tray, or you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You took some with your own fingers, and you took some out of my hand, and I noticed narrowly that the ones you took were replaced again—you removed pencils from various divisions, from 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw this one below your armpit, and your arm was closed to your side quite unnaturally,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185209200083"></xptr>
               <p>which caused me to watch you for a few moments, as I knew if you moved your arm it would fall—in going to get the penholder I walked backwards, keeping my eye on your arm, to see if you moved—in the first instance you asked for a sixpenny penholder, you then asked for a penny one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When you took the case from me, did I not tell you I was innocent, and did you not tell me to be off about my business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did at first, as I wished to avoid the trouble of prosecuting you; but the officer said the case was so plain, he persuaded me to press the charge.</p>

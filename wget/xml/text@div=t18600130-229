                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Brown, of 7, Fann-street, Aldersgate-street—the prisoner occupies the first floor; he took it on Satur<lb></lb>day night, 31st December—on that night, a little after 12 o'clock, I went up to the second floor, and I found ray boy crying and Mr. Rogers's girl crying—my husband was on the landing—I told him something, and then went down to the prisoner's door—I knocked, and he opened it—my husband said, "Why did your wife beat my boy?" he said, "I will serve you the same," and struck my husband a blow with a hammer, and he fell—he put his hands in this way, and there is a bruise on his hand now—he then struck Mr. Rogers with the hammer, and she fell—he next struck me with the hammer just above the hip—this is the hammer (<hi rend="italic">A large heavy one</hi>); it hurt me very much indeed—I fell, and could not recover myself for a few minutes—I was taken to the hospital and bandaged, and came away the name night—I went twice or three times as nn out-patient, and have not recovered yet—I feel it greatly when I walk any distance, but not when I am in-doors.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker—the prisoner occupies the first and second floor of the same house—on Saturday night, 31st December, I was standing at the street door, and went up to his door at a little after 12 o'clock, as my boy was crying—my wife came down at the time; she knocked at the prisoner's door and asked why his wife had been knocking my child about—the prisoner opened the door and I asked him the reason his wife had knocked my boy about—he said "You can be served the same;" he lifted a hammer and aimed at me—I put up my left hand and received the blow, and fell by the force of it—I did not see my wife hit or on the ground.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you come in from the street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; my wife met me at the street door and went up before me—I followed her half a minute or a minute afterwards—there was nobody else on the landing at the time my wife knocked at the door—I never touched the door; I swear that—Mary Ann Rogers and the daughter and the mother came up from the street—I should say that Mis. Rogers was sober from her appearance—I had not heard the sound of a hammering into the wall—there was not a chest of drawers in the place as I went up; it was what we call a common bench to work on—neither I nor my wife gave the prisoner any provocation—I had not the slightest quarrel with him—nobody kicked at this door while I was there, and no one had broken it open—I have never been in the room—I saw nobody inside it—it is not true that I burst the door open and broke the lock; I never touched it.</p>

On 2nd Nov., about 2 o'clock in the day, in consequence of information, I went to a house, No. 8, Cottage<lb></lb>place, Commercial-road, Lambeth—John Toomer keeps that house—Ann Toomer is his wife—Riley does not late there, but cornea there occasionally—she is the mother of Ann Toomer—I went into a room on the first floor—I found the three prisoners there—I said to the man, "Here we are again, Mr. Toomer"—I had been to see him before—not there, but I had visited him at another place—he said, "Yes, Mr. Brannan"—I said, "I have re<lb></lb>ceived information that you are coining"—I directed the officers who were with me to secure him, and then proceeded to a cupboard in the room and searched it—the door was thrown back against the wall—I found in it a galvanic battery and plate, a ladle with white metal in it, and these four crown pieces—the battery had some acid in it, which I now produce in this bottle—I found a bag containing three counterfeit crowns, which are bent as if they had been tendered and returned—I said to an officer who accom<lb></lb>panied me, "The stock is rather limited"—and John Toomer said, "They are not typed, so help me God! I only made a few pieces to keep these two b—rs"—there were the two female prisoners, and three small children there—I searched John Toomer—he said, "You may search as long as you please, you won't find a <hi rend="italic">trap</hi>; I have not such a thing in the house."</p>

               <p>Q. Did you receive any Bank-note from your master? - A. Yes, I was to get it changed; it was a one pound Bank-note; I went into the public-house; they told me they could not give me change, and when I came out of the public-house I had the note in my hand; a man then came to me, and said, my dear, your master says you must give me the note; I am to go and get it changed; he then snatched it from me and ran across the road, and ran down Glass-house-street; I holloaed out, stop him, I heard a person say he had got him, and I then went home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see any body that had stopped him? - A. Yes, he was brought into the shop by Mr. Allison, a neighbour; a person had told him it was my note.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether the man that Mr. Allison brought back to the shop was the man that snatched the note from you? - A. I am not sure it was the same man, but he had a brown jacket on when he snatched the note from me, and so had the man that was brought back to the shop.</p>

             sworn. - I live at No. 11, Glass-house-street: On the 6th of April, about half past ten o'clock at night, I heard a cry of stop thief; I was then in my own house, and the alarm seemed to come from Brewer-street; I live about twenty doors from Mr. Taylor's house; I looked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180504240004"></xptr>out of my door and I saw the prisoner running; he crossed to the same side of the way that I live on, and as he was passing my door, I caught hold of his collar, and told him that I should not let him go; he said he was not the person; I told him it was of no use to make any resistance (because he struggled very much), I would not let him go. I heard a voice saying that he had got the child's note; I asked Mr. Maynard, my opposite neighbour, to hold him while I looked for the note; Mr. Maynard took hold of him and I looked on the ground and saw a piece of paper; I went to my own window, where I perceived it was a one pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was it that you found this one pound note? - A. Exactly where I stopped the man; I told Mr. Taylor's people, that came down, that I had got the note, and I begged of them that they would not let the man go; the prisoner was taken to Mr. Taylor, and I asked him if he had lost a note; he said, yes, he had sent his little girl out to get it changed; the prisoner was taken to the watch-house. I produce the note; I have had it in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor.) Had you any mark on the note by which you could know it again? - A. No, not the least in the world.</p>

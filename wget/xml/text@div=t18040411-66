             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Do you know the prisoner, Howes? - A. I have known him nine years; I have known him as an attorney at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that letter, (a letter handed to the witness,) and tell me whether you believe that letter is Howes's hand-writing? - A. I have a great doubt; it is a great similitude, I think it is wrote too loose for it; I was in Mr. Humphries's chambers, I then thought, at the first flush, it was his handwriting, it has a great similitude; upon my oath, I think he did not write it.</p>


               <p>Q. Look at this bill, (another paper handed him,) what do you say to that? - A. Formerly, in my days, he did not write full Robert, only R; I cannot believe it, I never saw it done; it is not his mode, he wrote quite a different hand in my days.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Condescend to look at it for one minute, and do not look at the blank side? - A. He wrote quite a different hand in my days; he wrote in a stiff technical way, he could not write this loose hand in my days; it is a strong resemblance.</p>

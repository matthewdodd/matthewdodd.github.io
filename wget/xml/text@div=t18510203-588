                  </hi>. I keep a grocer's shop, at 176, Upper Whitecross-street. I occasionally employ Caulfield, and did so on the evening of 1st February—in consequence of suspicion, I had some money marked on the edge with a slight scratch, and put it into the till about five o'clock—there were four half-crowns, and five shillings, all marked—Caulfield came about half-past five—there is only one till, which is common to all the shop—I saw the money safe about eight—there were twelve half-crowns, including the four marked ones—I shortly after received a communication from Mr. Stanley—I went into the shop and found the prisoner in Brannan's custody, who produced two shillings and fourpence or fivepence—Brannan counted the money in the till in my presence, and there were still twelve half-crowns—Caulfield said, "I am innocent, pray don't press the charge"—Brannan produced two shillings to me, one of which was one of the marked ones—at the station, Caulfield said, "We are all liable to mistakes; I made a mistake last Saturday, which you rectified; I may have mistaken the woman's money for a half-crown."</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Starling. I left a parcel, con<lb></lb>taining money, at Hitchcock's—on the night of 1st Feb., about eight o'clock, Burge came to the shop and asked Caulfield for half a pound of sugar; he served her; she put down a shilling—I am sure of that—Brannan immediately came in, caught hold of Burge's arm, and asked her to let him see what change she had—I saw her turn her pocket inside out, but did not see what it contained—I believe no one had come to the shop between the time of my master leaving it and Burge coining—I did not see any one pay a half-crown during that time.</p>

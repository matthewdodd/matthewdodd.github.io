On the 11th of May I was at the Swedish Flag public-house, in Princes-street, St. George's—I went to wait for a friend of mine—the prisoner came in directly after, and sat by me—I had a bundle with me, containing the articles stated—they were in separate parcels—I was in the tap-room—I fell asleep, and when I awoke my bundle was gone—the pri<lb></lb>soner was there—I did not speak to him about it—I was vexed, and went out—I went to his house the next morning—these things were afterwards found at the pawnbroker's—a young man who was stopping with me had left them in my care.</p>

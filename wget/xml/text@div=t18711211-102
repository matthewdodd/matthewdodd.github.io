                  </hi>. I live at 20, Wellclose Square, and am foreman of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade—on 20th September, at 12.65 a.m., I was called to a fire at a warehouse in Wapping Wall—the time is always taken as soon as a call comes, the reward for calling the engine is a shilling, it is 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the fire-escape if the man assists at the fire, but if he does not, he would only get a shilling—any assistant at the fire is paid a shilling—those fees are established by our own rules—I went down to the place with an engine, and found a waggon load of straw alight on the lower floor, and the whole of the upper floor alight, the whole warehouse, and fire coming out—the fire continued about an hour—every effort was made to put it out—I have been attached to the fire-brigade over twenty years—after the fire was out, I examined the premises, and formed the opinion that the fire began in the waggon load of straw on the ground floor, as the whole of the flooring immediately over where the waggon stood was entirely consumed, but the rest of the building was much less burnt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fireman—on the morning of 21st March last, I was with my escape in the Kentish Town Road, about 2.30, the prisoner came to me and told me that a corn chandler's was alight in Chalk Farm Road—he showed me the way, and I went there with my escape—there was a fire there, behind the shop door—it was put out—the prisoner assisted me back with the escape—I paid him a half-crown, and he wrote this on the receipt "W. Antony, 7, Smith Street, Hampstead Road"—before I gave him the money, when I unlocked my box and put it down in the book, I said "Sign your name and address here"—he said "I can't write"—then I said "I shan't pay you without you go to the station,"With that he goes to the station—at last he said he could write his name; he could write if I spelt it.</p>

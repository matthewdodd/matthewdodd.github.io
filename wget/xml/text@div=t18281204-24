The prisoner and another boy came to the shop, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening - they both said they wanted a pair of boots; I said I had none that would fit them - they said, "Let us see?" I took one boot off a hook - they looked at it, and asked me to let them look at the other. which I did; they appeared to be together, and talked together; they asked the price of the boots - I said 2l.; they said they were too dear. and asked me to make them a piece of wax-end for a dog's collar - I said I had no hemp that would make it; they asked where they could buy some - I said in the court over the way; they went out, and returned together in about three minutes with some hemp - I told them to come into the back-shop with me, and I would make it; the prisoner went with me, and the other staid in the shop - in two or three minutes the prisoner said to the other, "Go and tell my brother Tom not to go out till I come," and directly he said that the other went out; I went to fasten the door, and missed the same pair of boots which they had looked at at first, and which I had hung up again - they were safe when they came in the second time; I kept the prisoner.</p>

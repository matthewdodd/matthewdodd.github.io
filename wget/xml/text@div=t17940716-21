               <p>I am the wife of Robert Sythe. On Sunday evening last, about half past nine o'clock, I lost the things in the indictment, about half past two, the prisoner came into my shop for a pint of small beer, (I keep a chandler's shop, in <placeName id="t17940716-21-crimeloc110">Cheese-court, Oxford-street, Mary-le-bone</placeName>

He left the halfpenny on the counter; as soon as he went out, a woman in the shop went round and see my parlour door open, and I went and see the property gone; I missed all the articles in the indictment. I found the boy afterwards as the watchman was crying the hour of ten; the watchman took him to the public house; he is here. I did not find any property on him; but he was seen with a bundle.</p>

               <p>I know Mrs. Sythe; I was not in the shop, I heard the outcry of the things being lost, about half past nine on Sunday evening, I went down immediately, and we went to the Wheatsheaf, and saw the prisoner in Pall-Mall Buildings, and charged the watchman with him. I see him in that house first through the window.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that house from this woman's? - No great ways. Mrs. Sythe she charged him with the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the things? - No; he said, so help me Jesus Christ I never was in the court the whole day; and the prosecutor made answer, you rascal, did not I draw you the small beer? he said, yes, and I paid you for it.</p>

               <p>I was in the shop, about half past nine, when the boy was in, I was sitting there in the house along with my landlady; I lodge in the house, and this boy came in for a halfpenny worth of small beer, and he went to the end of the counter to take the pint pot down; I made answer and said, that is not the halfpenny pot: says he, what is that to you? He did this with intent to look into the parlour, I suppose, I see him looking; with that Mrs. Sythe's mother, Mrs. Pearce, went up with the child to bed; immediately as he see this woman come out of the back parlour door, he left his small beer and went out.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him go out with the property? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for any body else to have gone in without your knowledge? - Not to my knowledge; and Mrs-Pearce had but that minute gone out of it; we suppose that he went round the passage way into the back parlour door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was in the shop that day about half past two, with another boy, for a pint of small beer, and we drank the beer and gave her a penny for it, and had a farthing. In the evening I went again, and asked for a halfpenny worth<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179407160038"></xptr>of small beer, and drank about half of it, and away I came out. I have got no witness here, but I could make a witness of the boy that was with me about half past two; she knows where to find the boy.</p>

I felt somebody press against me as I went through the market, which was much crowded. I saw the prisoner near me - I came out from the middle of the market, and felt the same pressure again, and then lost my purse - the prisoner was then close to me, and pressing me - it was safe five minutes before; my basket has two small lids; I saw one lid lifted up - I had it in front of me, and the prisoner was before me - I said,"I have lost my purse;" a gentleman took hold of him, and I took hold of his arm at the same time; he was secured instantly, and searched; some money was found on him, but not in my purse - my servant has left me. I saw a hand drawn out of my basket, but cannot say whose it was. I believe I have said it was the prisoners - my deposition was read over to me before I signed it, I think he is the man; I took hold of him, and accused him of it - he denied it; a sovereign, and 16s. 6d. were found on him.</p>

            . Q. Might he not accidentally push against you? A. I do not know. I saw a hand come from my basket; the prisoner had not time to put the money out of the purse, for he was seized immediately. I did not swear to any of the money - I have my doubts now whether it was him.</p>

               <p>MR. COCHRAINE. I think my money was three half crowns, a sixpence, and eight shillings.</p>

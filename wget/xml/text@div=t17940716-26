               <p>I am the man that helped to take the prisoner, on the 14th of June last, on Saturday about five o'clock in the morning, he turned first up into Sloan-square, but he ran, I suppose, three quarters of a mile before we took him, into the fields, we followed him from Sloan-square, because we saw the bundle under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to run? Did you give any alarm? - As soon as he saw us he took to his heels and ran away; when we were within five yards of him, he dropped this bundle, and I picked it up, and this man took hold of him; in the bundle is two metal bells and one pint pot; one bell belongs to Mr. Richardson.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who the other belongs to? - We have not been able to find an owner.</p>
               <p>Q. Now let Wall look at Mr. Richardson's bell. (To Wall) Can you say that to be Mr. Richardson's bell? - Yes, I can.</p>

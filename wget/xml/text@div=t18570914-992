                  </hi>. I live at Clapham. On the night of 31st Aug. I was walking along Kennington Road; the prisoner came to me, and laid her hand on my arm—I turned to put her away, and a man immediately struck me and knocked me down on my face, and as I fell I observed my watch taken from me; it had been in my waistcoat pocket just before—I fell on my face, and cut it very much—I called, "Police!" and the police<lb></lb>man came; the prisoner ran away, but was brought back by a policeman—the prisoner is the woman—I had a watch key at the end of my guard—that was all safe.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was walking along the road, and you came and ran up against me, and begged my pardon: you were so intoxicated you did not know what you did. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, I never saw you till you came and took hold of my arm—I had been drinking in Charlotte Street, but I was not intoxicated—I do not believe I went into any public house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He said, "I think I have the pleasure of knowing you;" I said, "What is your name?" he said, "Mr. Whittaker;" he called for a glass of ale, and gave it to a man, and when he went out he fell down, he was so intoxicated, the man took him up by the railings, and told him to take a <hi rend="italic">cab;</hi> I went on, and saw him on the ground, calling, "Police!" and the officer came and took me. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She had hold of my arm when I was knocked down, I will swear.</p>

I was on duty in Kennington Road about a quarter before 12 o'clock—I was walking on one side, going towards Kennington Common—I saw the prisoner on the other side; she had hold of the prosecutor's right arm—I kept my eye on them—when they had walked about twenty yards, the prosecutor was thrown or fell down—the prisoner ran away—I crossed, and ran after her, and brought her back to the prosecutor—in the mean time, she had caught hold of an elderly gentleman by the right arm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You said you saw me go to the gentleman, and lay hold of his right arm, and throw him on the ground. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, I did not; I asked you what you had done to the man, and you said you never saw him</p>

               <p>nor touched him—there were two or three men walking behind him at the same time—the prisoner had hold of him the minute before he was thrown down.</p>

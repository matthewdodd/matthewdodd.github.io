               <p>I was in Mr. Connor's house the beginning of November, a month next Saturday, I called the dust-men in to take the dust away, and they ran away with the copper; they asked me for a broom, and while I went to get one, they took away the copper, it stood in the kitchen, they had a dust cart; they went away with the cart and all as fast as ever they could drive, I ran after them for an hour, I met with a man that told me of them; I never saw them before; the prisoner was brought back and shewn to me in about an hour, the copper was never found, they had parted with it; I am sure the prisoner was one of the dustmen: they would not let me light them down stairs; he said he knew he was in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080059"></xptr> house, but denied taking the copper; there were three of them, they were all gone, he said he knew nothing of his companions, he would not give any directions to them: I had seen the copper a little before.</p>

On the 28th of April, about twenty minutes before eight o'clock in the morning, I put some plate out to clean, on the dresser in the pantry, which fronts the area steps - a person could not see it passing along the street, unless he stood on the area steps of Mr. Goldsmith's, next door. I went into the kitchen for three or four minutes; as I returned from the kitchen to the pantry, I saw a man go through the area gate dressed in a darkish frock coat. In consequence of what the kitchen maid said, I looked and missed the plate, this was within a minute of when I returned - I immediately put on my jacket, ran up the area steps, and into the New-road, with Mr. Adams. I saw two men in custody half an hour after; they ran through the house, No. 14, in York-court - we found one in the privy, and the other by the dust-hole. We lost twenty-seven silver forks, twelve spoons, a silver mug, three sauce ladles, a fish slice, a butter knife, and a sallad fork, all silver; also four plated dishes. I found them all at the Apollo, public-house, the same morning, about eight o'clock, in possession of Morris, the officer. I cannot say whether it was one of the prisoners, who I saw go up the steps; but one of them had a dark frock coat on when taken.</p>

I ran into Paddington-street, and East-street, and in a back yard in York-court, we found the two prisoners - Cooley was just coming out of the privy; Connor was shuffling about close by the dust-hole - they were both out of breath, and had been running. I knew Connor again, and am sure he is the man who came up the area steps. We kept them until the constable came. Cooley wanted to speak to Coleman. I saw the plate in Morris's possession. I did not see Cooley till I got to York-court, which is half or three quarters of a mile from the prosecutor's.</p>

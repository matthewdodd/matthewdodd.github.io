I was not in the gaol, but my servant, Roberts, came and told me of it, and asked me whether she might lay in the gaol all night?</p>

               <p>Q. Do you take them off when they go up to Bow-street? - No; we did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not know that he had had his irons off? - Not that I know of.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Day at any time intimate to you a disposition on the part of Idswell, to make you any compliment or acknowledgment whatever? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had Mr Crosswell lived with you? - I believe four years and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. How has he discharged his duty? - I never had any complaint of him, till then I thought him a very honest and good servant.</p>

He owed me four pounds<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010008"></xptr>for lodging, and one thing and another. Idswell said I might have any seal I liked.

               <p>Q. When you went up stairs to Idswell what did he say? - He asked me whether I had said any thing to Crosswell about conducting him down to see an aunt that was sick? He had asked me two or three times to ask Crosswell to let him go out, and he would make us a present.</p>
               <p>Q. To go where? - To No. 13, Artillery-lane. We did not consent to it, and then he asked to let his uncle Johnny come in; that if he could be accommodated to see him, it would be more service to him than writing an hundred letters. Uncle Johnny is

            , that stands at the bar. Mrs. Jones used to call him uncle, and he used too. We did not agree to it at first, and he said, he would make us both a present of a guinea each. He was admitted in and staid near an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before the 3d of April, that you let him have access? - Sunday, the 29th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he ever let in a second time? - Yes, the Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>Q. I presume you got another guinea for that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you first heard any thing about a sick aunt being at No. 13, Artillery-lane? - They began to talk about it on Sunday morning, 29th of March. She said, she must go and see the sick aunt, and would be back again in a short time; she said, she was very ill. The next morning she came again, she said, that her aunt was dangerously ill, and wanted to see Mr. Idswell very much, and from the sight of him she would give him seven or eight hundred pounds, and that he should go in his irons, because that would affect her the more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to Crosswell on this? - I did, but we both of us refused it several times, till Thursday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that what had you received from Idswell? - He made me a present of a watch, the first day that he received any property from Bow-street, he called me up in the room, and asked me what I would have?</p>
               <p>Q. Then there were two guineas and this watch, any thing else? - No. On Thursday night Crosswell had got three pawnbroker's tickets, the times were almost out, and he gives them to this Idswell, who, promised to take the things out for him. Before I went, I went up stairs to Idswell, to know if he wanted any thing more before I went home; Mrs. Idswell was there, and he said to her, my dear, have you got this watch, coat, hat, and ring out of pawn? she says, no. Says he, you may as well give Day the money to go and get them out; and she gave me three guineas to go and get them. I went, and when I came back, I gave him the watch and ring, and he told me to take the coat and hat home to my own house. On Friday night, when I went up stairs, he told me he wanted to see Crosswell; and I went down and sent him up stairs to him, and he gave Crosswell the watch and ring back again, and told me to give him up the hat and coat.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010010"></xptr>Q. Did not they give you some cotton? - Yes, they did, for my children. They asked me what children I had? I told them, two, one of four years old, and the other of two. After Crosswell went up stairs, he came down stairs again to me, and said, Day, you have been guilty of a nasty transaction, in not giving me the great coat and hat. Then about nine o'clock Crosswell went up again, and left a great coat, and Mr. Roberts staid in the prison till near eleven o'clock; and when Crosswell came down, he said, he had settled the business for Idswell to go, and be safe, to Artillery-lane, and he was to return in two hours; so I told him, I would not go with him, he might go himself. And he said, he would load a blunderbuss that I might be safe, and he said, the next time he would go with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you the blunderbuss? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. How were his irons tied up? - With four silk handkerchiefs, and Idswell had got a rough great coat on, belonging to one Myers, a prisoner at that same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave him that great coat? - Crosswell. Just as he was going out, he said, go, make haste back, and if you want to go another night, I will go with you myself. We walked as far as Smithfield, and had a coach, and went to Artillery-lane. When we came to Artillery-lane, Idswell did not rightly know the house, and he asked a watchman which was Mrs. Cummings's? He was told, and we were going up to the door, and just as we got up to the door, we see Mr. Tilley and his wife coming away from this door. We got out of the coach about a hundred yards from the house. I says to Idswell, there is Mr. Tilley. He did not speak, nor he did not say nothing to him; but when we came up to the door, the door was half open; the man Bowley was at the door; I knew him from coming backwards and forwards to Idswell. I said to Bowley, there is Tilley, call him; he called him.

               <p>Q. You did not say it would be a d-ed good job, and there would be about fifty guineas a piece? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he consent at that time, or refuse? - We both of us refused then.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you happen to say to Crosswell, with respect to a place in the Custom House, or India House? - Idswell said, if either of us lost our places by permitting it, he would provide us one, either in the Custom House, or in the India House.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate that to Crosswell? - I did, I told him so once.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say then, did he refuse or consent? - There was no consent till Friday night, when Crosswell had got his property returned.</p>
               <p>Q. That property was first delivered to you, and by you to Crosswell? - No, it was not delivered to me; on Thursday night I fetched them out of pawn, and Friday morning I gave them to Idswell.</p>

               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. Did it happen to you to have any other article, a diamond pin or any thing of that sort? - I had not.</p>

            When you said that you might as well do as other people had done, and got prettily by it, what did you mean? - I knew there had been several shillings given to my fellow servants, and not shared among us.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to go then? - Because Crosswell said, go, and you may be very safe, and if he wants to go again, I will go with him next time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who bound up the irons? - Crosswell bound up one, and I helped bind up another, and I said at going out, I will bring him back in two hours.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing taking place on Good Friday last? - Yes, about half after one on Friday morning, I heard the alarm of murder and fire; at that present time I did not know whether it was in my own house or the next; I got out of my bed and went to the street door, I immediately found it was at the next door; I immediately heard the alarm of a piece going off, I went back and put on my breeches and jacket, and by forcing the door three times, it flew open; the first thing I saw was, Idswell laying on the floor, just within the door; I see the blood boiling out of his hind parts, he lay like on his face; the next was Day, he stood about a yard space from him; I asked Day what was the matter? he said, for God's sake help, or I shall be murdered; immediately Mr. Jarvis, the headborough, came in at the door, and by knowing of me he said, Mitchell, I demand you to aid and assist; I said, it is my intention; immediately we went up stairs, and we see four coming down stairs, two women and two men, one of the men was Barnard Solomon, and the other was Phillips; I asked them what they did there? and they immediately said, that they heard the alarm of a noise, but they did not know what was the matter; they said, for God's sake, what is the matter? Mr. Jarvis made answer and said, d-mn you, we will let you know what is the matter; Mr. Jarvis said, if you don't know what is the matter, we will let you know what is the matter; I believe them to be the words. We secured him, and gave him to the hands of the watchman; we went up stairs, we went to the bed room on the left hand, and we did not discover any person there, but we examined the bed, and on the bed we found a pillow that was tied up at one end, and a woman's night cap on it, in the resemblance of a woman; I shewed it the gentlemen; I see a number of vials containing physic, and them kind of things, some stood on a mantel piece, and some stood on a pair of drawers; and directions on them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any thing else laying about the room? - Not to my knowledge, material.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a blunderbuss in the room? - I picked up the stock of it in the passage, and then I picked up the lock and the barrel in the front room, under the grate, and several pieces in different parts of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find that part of the blunderbuss in the passage, near about where Idswell was laying? - About a yard from him. When we had been in the bed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010019"></xptr>room we came down stairs and went into the yard, and by going round into the privy the door was fastened, and Mr. Jarvis put his hand to the top, and said, if you don't open the door I will blow your brains out.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the use of that punch? - This is the thing that is used to take the nut out of the basil, that goes round the leg to fasten on the iron. I was there that night, I was sent for to the watch-house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010020"></xptr>in Artillery-place. When I came to the watch-house, the first person that I knew was Day, I knew him perfectly well, as being one of the gaolers belonging to New Prison; he catches hold of me by the hand, and says, Ray, I am glad to see you; I said, what is the matter? he said, I have been over persuaded by Charles to bring Idswell out, and I believe he is shot. I waited there for about five or ten minutes, a coach came to the door, I went to the door, and the coachman said, the man is dead; I opened the coach door, and saw Idswell dead at the bottom of the coach; I helped put him into the engine-house, and searched him, and found on him fifty-three guineas, eight watches, a ring, a pair of silver buckles and some papers; this paper I took from his right hand waistcoat pocket.(Produced and read.)</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any men that were apprehended on this spot? - They were all then secured, and in the watch-house, all but Mr. Tilley and Mr. Jones. There was not an opportunity of searching the prisoners as they ought to be searched in the watch-house, there was such a crowd of people; when I took them to prison I got a candle, and from Handland I took off a stocking that had some blood on it, and the foot of it was all soaked in blood, and all very fresh.</p>

               <p>I was alarmed this night, as I supposed, by the noise of fire, and I went to the top of my house, and I see two men at the bar, Henley and Heydon. (The house where I live is eleven doors off) I see them on the top of the house, next door to me, on the top of some back sheds, or wash-house, making their escape over the tiles; I asked them what business they had there? they said they had been after some jews that were concerned in some stamps; some neighbours said, don't mind what they say, they were two thieves; and I took them, I held them till Day came.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Tilley. I stand charged with being concerned in aiding and assisting the prisoner Idswell Idswell to make his escape out of prison. To prove which, it is represented that I frequently attended them at the gaol; I would wish first to observe that the Idswells were totally strangers to me, I was not concerned as their attorney, but as an agent for Mr. Radley, as such I visited them a number of times; during the whole times that I visited them I never had the least intention, or ever did any thing at all to induce the turnkeys to take Idswell Idswell out of prison. With respect to the scheme of the sick aunt in the house of Artillery-lane, I never knew any thing of it, I never was in the house in my life. The reason why I was more with the Idswells lately then formerly was, because at first I was not allowed to see them but in the presence of the turnkey, but within four or five days before the escape, I had permission to see them alone; they were in different prisons, and I went backwards and forwards in assisting them in their defence, sometimes from prison to prison to them. During the whole time that I attended them as their solicitor, I never used any unfair means whatever to assist them to plan any scheme for their escape. Day, the turnkey, on his examination at Bow-street, declared that I had mentioned nothing at all to him; he now thinks proper to swear, that on my calling to him, I said I had been drinking with Bryant, and that I had told him that Moses was going home that night to keep the passover with his wife and family? that circumstance I must solemnly deny, though I cannot prove false, because he says no other but himself and me was present. The fact was, that I had not been with Bryant, and that I made use of no such expression, nor do I think that I see Day at all, if I did it is very possible that I might tell him that his master wanted him; it is impossible for me to contradict that assertion of Day's, that he very well knows. He at one time swears I was six times at the prison that day, he another time swears I was four times; the reason of being so often was, being first at one prison with one brother, and then going to another prison to another, and then for some things in the preparing of the defence requested to go back; but during the whole of my attendance, I attended for no other purpose then taking and preparing the defence; and so far as my having a sum of money for assisting their escape, I have not yet been paid my bill, there is a matter of fifty pounds now due to me from them; if I had known there was any intention of an escape, or thought there was a plan of an escape, I had seventy-five pounds in my hands, and I might have paid myself what was due to me. With respect to Day meeting me in Artillery-street, he swears that he see me at one time coming out of the house, at another time I was coming from the door; I did meet him at that time, I did not know in what street I was; it is true he stopped me, I suppose he knew me, he says, for God's sake don't say that you see me here to night; I said, it is nothing to me, if you do any thing wrong you must answer for it yourself. I had a message sent me the next day from Mr. Flood, but if I had not, I was going to tell what I had seen, when I heard of the accident that had happened, that I had met the prisoner and the turnkey in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010022"></xptr>street. Day knows that I cannot contradict him, because I have no witness.</p>
               <p>With respect to Bowley, he at one time says that he spoke to me in a whisper, and it was so low that no person in the room could hear it but me; if the fact was as he wishes to represent it, that I was acquainted with the scheme, there was no necessity of his whispering to me, nor me to him, I did not do any thing of the kind, I never had any conserence with Bowley, nor any body at all in this business; I solemnly declare that I always acted fairly as an attorney; it is not probable that having a good character as an attorney to that time, as I had, that I should engage in such a scheme, and if I had been consulted on it by Idswell, I should have advised him from it. When I went away on Friday night I was desired to be with him early on the Saturday morning, and I meant to go to him, but I heard that he was killed. If they had such a scheme in their minds, it certainly never was their intention to let me know of it; Idswell and his wife always talked Hebrew before me, so whatever scheme they had in their heads, it was kept from me. With respect to Day I never did persuade him to take out his prisoner; with respect to the conversation with Bryant, it is false, and was it of consequence I would make my affidavit of it if I was going out of the world this moment. Both Bowley and Day have taken care to six times when there was nobody present but themselves, therefore it places me in that situation that it is impossible for me to contradict them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jones. At the time this accident happened I was out of town.</p>
               <p>Court. That is proved already.</p>
               <p>Jones. I thought I was in duty bound, as my niece was ill, and had warning to quit, to take an apartment for her; I did not go and take it in any clandestine manner, I told the woman of the house who I was, and what I was, and I agreed with her for the apartment.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Crosswell. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hardwicke. I am a ticket porter, unfortunately I was hired with another man to move the goods, and I received fifteen shillings and sixpence for myself and the other man, and there was some more money due to me; and as to what Mr. Day has said against me, it is totally false, because since the last trial I am told that he is the man that actually did fire the piece off, and to save himself he has pitched on me; I never was out of the room, I was by the fire side when Mr. Skelton came and took me in the front room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Heydon. My wife is a washerwoman, and she washed for Mrs. Jones at different times; this day my wife was had with a fore leg, she could not go son the things to wash, and it being Good Friday I had not been at work, I had been drinking; when I came home about nine o'clock, she said, there was a person there that wanted me to go for some soul linen, and they already owed a little bill. And I went to Artillery-street, and asked the maid if her mistress was within? she said, no, and asked me up stairs, saying she would be in presently; and while I was there this accident happened. What Mr. Bowley has swore of my being in Fashion-street, is wrong, for I never see Mr. Tilley nor Hardwicke, nor any of the prisoners at the bar before, they are all strangers to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Handland. I was passing by at the time of this bustle, and I went in with the watchman, for I was very much intoxicated, so I don't know how I got into the house; I am innocent of the charge laid to me; I worked till nine<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010023"></xptr>o'clock that morning, and then my master told us to make holiday, and we went to drinking; I know nothing of any of the prisoners at the bar, never see them till that time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Delany. I was at work that day in Thames street, at a steel-house, and we worked late, and afterwards went a drinking of some grog, and I was passing by the watch-house at this time, going home, when I see the mob, and just spoke to one man going in, and asked what was the matter? and they shoved me in along with them; here is a gentleman knows that I was at work that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jacobs. I hope your lordship and gentlemen of the jury will be very cautious as to the evidence that Day has given; in the first place he is a turnkey, secondley he is a villain in betraying of his trust. This fellow used to admit people to see the Idswell at any hour of the night, at either eleven, twelve, or one o'clock in the morning, because he got a guinea for every one he so admitted. He charges me with coming frequently to the prison, at the same time he knows I am a relation, I am a brother-in-law to the deceased, and I used to come to the prison either with a parcel or a letter, whatever it was I delivered it into the lodge, if it was a parcel, the parcel was opened, and if it was a letter the letter was read before it was taken up; I waited in the lodge till the person came down again, I never was admitted to go up stairs, which I might have done if I would have chose to pay a guinea, but that I could not, and so I never was admitted up to see him, therefore how can I be charged with planning his escape, when I never was with him to plan it, nor has any one evidence said that I was ever with him, since, or before it was planned. I look on the whole of them to be a parcel of villains, from Samuel Newport to the whole of them; Samuel Newport charged him a guinea a week for a small room, and was always extorting presents, and I dare say he has the watch in his pocket now. Certainly he has done it with a villanous intent.</p>
               <p>As for this other man (Roberts) he has been often tried, but now he is deputy governor, deputy gaoler, clerk of the papers, dog-whipper, and the Lord knows what. This Roberts has been guilty of the same thing as Day was guilty of, in betraying his trust; there was an order given by the magistrate, that the two Idswells should not be permitted to see one another, and for that very reason they were committed to different gaols. Now, when they were examined before the justice, there was always a man placed between them, that they should not speak together; but this Roberts, he says to the other gaoler, who had the other Idswell in custody, mind before you take your prisoner to gaol again, to stop at a house in Gray's inn lane, where I will bring my prisoner. My Lord he got twenty guineas for that job, which he know I know; therefore is such a fellow to be believed in any thing he says? If any man has planned his escape, he is the only man that planned it, because this governor came up to Idswell one day, and says, I am very sorry to inform you that your case is very dangerous, and I have it from good authority that it will prove fatal to you; the next day Roberts came to him, and it was told him if he could get eight hundred pounds he might get his liberty; Idswell told him he had not such a sum at present to give him, but says he, if you will admit me to go and see an old aunt I will do it; accordingly it was agreed that Day should go out with him, and with this private order, says Roberts to Day, if you get the money let him escape, if not bring him back, or shoot him, which order he executed to my sorrow; and the gaolers who lets a prisoner escape, are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010024"></xptr>more culpable than the prisoners themselves.</p>
               <p>My lord, how can I be charged with assisting and aiding the prisoner in his escape, when the escape was made before I see him, because the moment Day took him out of the gaol the escape was made. Did I go to the gaol? no; Day is to be blamed, and none of us.</p>
               <p>I have been charged with being in Fashion-street the night this escape was made; I will first give you a reason for that; the house in Fashion-street, where I was, is my uncle's, and this was our holiday time, my wife and I were there at supper, and that was the reason of my being in the house that night.</p>
               <p>When I came up to this gaol, which is the first time I was ever before any justice for any criminality whatever, I was loaded with heavy irons as ever I could bear them, I was locked up in a cell day and night, I was kept without fire and candle and bed, obliged to lay on bare boards; the victuals that was brought to me, was brought to me as far as from Tower-hill; if it so happened that this great man, Roberts, was there, it was kept in the lodge, he hauled it about till he mangled it entirely to pieces, to see whether there was any writing of my wife's to me in it; and when I was taken to be examined, instead of taking me back again to prison, I was frequently put into a house for the sake of shew, at the

            ; we were put into a place where we were railed in like a cage, and one keeper put at the door, who permitted any one to come in who paid him, and being ten days without being shaved or shifted, we looked very pale and miserable; I told them it was scandalous and shameful, and I said I would tell the court of it when I came to be tried; then I complained of this usage to justice Flood, but this great man, Mr. Newport had such an awe over the justice, that he thought nothing about it, and I was threatened if I said any more, I should be put into the black hole, and I was afraid it was such a black hole as at Calcutta, and so I said no more about it. Now whether it was from a deal of money I spent that day, or bow, but I had the happiness to see the Great Mogul; I met a dutchman, I asked him if he had seen my wife? he said, yes, and that she had employed a counsel for my defence, I asked him who it was? he said he was told his name was Knapp. However there we staid, and there this rascal, Day was seated at a mahogany table, with a tumbler of red wine and some nutmeg, to raise his poor spirits, least he should saint. But I am not now in their hands, here I am in a court of justice, before a good and humane judge, who hears me patiently, and a good humane jury, who will consider our lives and liberty before they take it away.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cummings charges me with being at the house, I think she has every reason to remember me, as there was a little incident that happened between her and me, for either on Wednesday or Thursday before this happened, I was in the kitchen, I was there to take care of the things; Mrs. Cummings comes into the kitchen, and makes a deep curtsey, but the curtsey was not made to me, it was to a glass of rum that I had in my hands, it was made to that; says I, ma'am will you drink a drop with me? she did condescend to drink with me, and so I think she must remember me.</p>
               <p>At Bow-street her husband was examined, but they have not brought him forward here; the prosecutors are in court, and they know what I say to be fact; he was there asked where he was that night; he said, please your worship at ten o'clock I went home; says the justice was not you at home? so at last, with a good deal of yawning, he said, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010025"></xptr>have parted with my wife. My Lord she is a bad woman, and it is a great misfortune that there is nothing but whores and rogues that swear against us; as to Bowley, he I must not touch, he is like a cobweb, if I was touch it it would break; he charges me with being in the house, I say I was in the house, it is what I don't want to contradict. I will not detain the court any longer, I shall therefore conclude, and leave my cause first to God, and then to your lordship and gentlemen of the jury to decide.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Solomons. Some little time after the prisoner Idswell was apprehended on the occasion of the stamps, Mr. Phillips came to my house, and said, that Mr. Estcourt had sent for him, and told him, that if he could procure the dies, he would give him two hundred pounds, accordingly I went to Mrs. Idswell, and I said to her, if you can get the dies belonging to the stamps, it may be the means of liberating Mr. Idswell; says she, I cannot give them you now, but if you will call on Friday, I will tell you where you may find them. On Friday, about half past ten, Phillips came to me, and says to me, now we will go to Mrs. Idswell's, to put us in possession of the dies; accordingly we went to her in Artillery-street, and we were told she was at Mr. Jones's, in Fashion-street; we knocked at the door, and asked if Mrs. Idswell was there? we were told no, she was not there; and we stopped there till half after eleven, and we went again to No. 13, Artillery-street, and rung the bell, the servant came down, and said Mrs. Idswell would be home in a minute or two, and we went up and stopped, and being taken very ill I went down into the privy, into the yard; I went down into the yard, and had not been there the space of two minutes before I heard the alarm of murdor, with that I got into the yard, and going nearer to the yard door, I heard the report of a gun, and I retreated back into the privy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Phillips. When the two Idswells were taken, the officers at Bow-street came to my house for me, I was not at home, when I came home my wife told me that the officers of Bow-street had been for me; I went to Mr. Solomons the next morning, and told him that the officers of Bow-street had been for me, and if he would go up and see what they wanted with me, and would promise not to keep me in custody, I would go and surrender myself; he came back, and I went before the justice; Mr. Estcourt was there, and they told me I was to call on Mr. Lee, in Shoreditch; they asked me if I knew any thing about the dies? says he, if you will go round the family, and endeavour to find out where they are, you shall have two hundred pounds for your trouble; Mr. Townsend went with me to Mrs. Idswell, and they sent me to Swallow-street, I went there to inquire if I could find any thing of the dies. I said, will you give me leave to go with Mrs. Idswell, and amongst the family? and I will see if I can find them; Mr. Estcourt is in court now, and he cannot deny that what I say is truth. This Friday night I went along with Mr. Solomons, as he has said, and I was but just there, and Mr. Solomons had gone down into the yard, when I heard a scuffle, and the blunderbuss go off.</p>

I had bought a watch of Mr. Idswell for three guineas and a half, and I gave the watch back to be regulated, and then after that I heard that there were many watches gone to Bow-street; I had been looking after him some time, and could not find him; this day, Good Friday, being a leisure day, I thought proper to go again after this watch, I went to Duke-street, and there were a parcel of people there who were jews, and I asked if they knew where Mr. Idswell<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010026"></xptr>was? and they said he lived at No. 13, Artillery-lane; I went there and knocked at the door, and the servant maid opened the door, and I went up stairs, and there were two or three people there, and I went out backward, and I heard the report of a gun go off, and I went to make my escape backward, and two or three gentlemen asked me what was the matter? I said there was either fire or murder, and Mr. Spencer said, stand there still, or else I will fire on you; I told him he had no occasion to fire, I would deliver myself up.</p>

               <p>The prisoner Jones called eight witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Hardwicke called four witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Haydon called three witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Delany called one witness who gave him a character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jacobs. As I was not indicted for a robbery, I did not think it necessary to have any body here, but I never was tried by any court before, and so I did not think it needful to trouble any of my friends.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Solomons called four witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Phillips called seven witnesses who gave him a very good character, and said he was a glass cutter.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Jacobs now called five witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Handland called his master who gave him a very good character.</p>

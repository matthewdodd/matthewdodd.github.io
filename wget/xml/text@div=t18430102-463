                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the Galley Quay, Lower Thames-street, in the employ of Joseph Barber. The prisoner was employed at the wharf on the 31st of Dec., for the purpose of carrying spelter—he received it from the landing scale at Galley Quay, to carry to the vault at Brewer's Quay—he was afterwards found with some spelter which he was not employed to carry—it is Mr. Barber's property—the prisoner had no right to have it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City police-constable. On the morning of the 31st of Dec., I saw the prisoner going towards the Minories, from the wharf—I itood still as he passed—he made an attempt to run, but having this weight about him he could not—he stopped—I went and asked him what he bad got—he unbuttoned his jacket, and said, "I have got two pieces of spelter, which I have brought from Thames-street, from Mr. Barber's Quay"—this is the spelter.</p>

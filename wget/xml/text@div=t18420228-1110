About five o'clock in the afternoon of the 16th of February, I was on Clapham-common—the prisoner came up and accosted me with very goss language, not fit for a female to repeat—he followed me some distance, and then snatched from my arm my bag, which contained four shillings and sixpence and two cotton napkins—I can swear he is the</p>

On the 16th of February, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner running with great speed across Clapham-common; Mrs. Bennett and others were crying "Stop thief" after him—I ran as fast as I could, but I found he was gaining ground very fast—I saw a servant on horseback, and requested him to ride after him and stop him—he ran and attempted to stop him, but he got down a lane—I went after him and found him in about three minutes.</p>

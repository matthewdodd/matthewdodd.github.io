On Wednesday, the 23d of November, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into my shop - he saw a coat in my window, and said he should like one like it; I told him I could not let him have that - he said he should like to try it on, and did so; he wanted that one; I said he could not have it; he asked when I could get him one done; I told him by Friday morning. I measured him - he said he would call for it; I asked his address; he said he lived in Caroline-place, which is half a mile from my house; he gave me the name of Martin, and was going out - I said it was usual to have a deposit from strangers; he asked what deposit I required; I said 10s. would be sufficient as I knew Caroline-place to be respectable; he put his hand into his pocket, and drew out 2s., saying he had no more change, but would leave a deposit if I could give him change for a 5l. note; I said I would but I could not give him 4l. 10s.; he said never mind, that will do - he would leave 1l. - he gave me a 5l. Bath and Bristol note. I observed to him that it was a country note; he said Yes, but it was payable in London, and I gave him four sovereigns in change; he went away, and in the afternoon, about five o'clock, I went out, and was passing Mr. Wood's, a neighbour; I went in and asked him to change the note, which he did; I gave him the same note as I received from the prisoner. Mr. Wood wrote on it, in my presence, "Goer, King's road;" this is the note (looking at it); he did not come for the coat; I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESSWELL. Q. Had you ever seen him before? A. Not to my knowledge; he was in my shop ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, being measured; I swear he is the man; I had no other note in my possession, nor any money transactions with any body that day.</p>

            . I am a stationer, and live in Queen-street. On the 8th of November the prisoner came and ordered me to engrave a promissory note for the Bath and Bristol bank: he gave me the instructions for the plate, and said it was a new firm just commencing, and the 5l. notes would be wanted to be used immediately. This was on Tuesday, the 8th. He came again on the Saturday, between nine and eleven o'clock in the morning - they were not ready - he came again at night, and took four or five; I completed the order on Monday, the 14th of November, and delivered him 500. The note produced was impressed from the plate, except the filling up. No impression from that plate was in existence before that Saturday - it is dated the 11th of August.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you engrave it yourself? A. No; I employed a person to do it, and saw him do part of it.</p>

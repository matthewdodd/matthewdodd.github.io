                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller—on 3rd June, about 1.30 a.m., I was going home along the Old Kent Road to Peckham—I saw the prisoner there—she spoke to me and after a few seconds I walked away—I missed my watch directly and went after her—I told her I believed she had stolen my watch and she said she had not—I insisted that she had and I gave her in charge.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody about 1.45 a.m. on the 3rd June and told her she would be charged with stealing a watch from the last witness—she said she knew nothing about it—when we were within 10 yards of the station I heard something fall, like the breaking of glass—I said "Look out behind," and when we got inside the door I turned up the gas and found this watch hanging to her dress, dragging on the ground—she was taken before the Magistrate and remanded—the prosecution was entered into again and I apprehended her on 13th August as she left the infirmary of Newington Workhouse.</p>

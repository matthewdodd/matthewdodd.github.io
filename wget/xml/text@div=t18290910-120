               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you playing at bagatelle? A. No; I looked at some persons who were playing - I had taken some half and half; there was an old hat left behind; the prisoner did not say if it was my hat he would return it; I did appoint to meet him the next morning at the Fox, but on second consideration, I thought the sooner I got my hat the better; I took him to a public-house, and kept him till the officer came; I asked him to go, but did not say I would settle it there - I did not take part of a pot of ale and a biscuit; there were two or three other hats on the table - the old hat was found on the table; he and his friends were playing at bagatelle.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into the public-house with my hat on, with two friends - there were several gentlemen in the room; I played at bagatelle, and had one pot of beer; this hat laid on the table - mine was as good as new, and I took this and put it on my head, and did not know but it was my own; the prosecutor came and asked if I had made a mistake, and taken a wrong hat; I said, "No, but if I have this is it," and that I would meet him the next day at the Fox, and if any one could say it was his I would give it up; I had been drinking a little.</p>

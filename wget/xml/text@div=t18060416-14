             sworn. I am carman to Messrs. Stracey and Browning. On the 22th of March about seven o'clock at night, I was going to Blossom's inn, Lawrence-lane, with this cask of shrub in the waggon; in <placeName id="t18060416-14-crimeloc75">Trump-street</placeName>

A constable came up, and I gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the same man. - A. I am sure of it, I never lost sight of him from the time I saw him roll the cask till he was taken.</p>

               <p>Q. This was not a cask that a man could take under his arm and run away with it. - A. No, it was a large cask.</p>
               <p>Q. It very often happens that jostling a cask it may tumble off. - A. No this cask was in the middle of the waggon, and if it had tumbled out it would have dashed it all to pieces.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going about some business over the water, just on this side of St. George's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160016"></xptr>church; I am a clock maker by trade. When I went by the bottom of Honey-lane Market in Trump street, I saw this cask laying in the channel, I put my foot to the cask and moved it about two yards; there was a young man that went and told the carman, and brought him back and discovered the barrel, who told him it was within two yards of where he first saw it lie.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

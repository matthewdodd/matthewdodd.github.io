                  </hi>. I am a cowkeeper, and keep a house at Northend, Fulham. On the 19th of May a lad, named Shorter, who was in my em<lb></lb>ploy, left me, without any notice—I had before that the property stated in the indictment in my box—I left home that morning, with ray milk, about seven o'clock-Shorter had the key of the front gate, and the key of that gate fitted the stable—he had the key of the house—I returned about nine o'clock, and found my box broken open, and my things gone, and Shorter also—the house door was left open, and the gate locked—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some things</hi>)—these are part of the things I lost—the value of them all was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. nearly—I am sure it was above 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know the prisoner—I had seen him the day before, the 18th, with Shorter, but never again till he was at the station-house, three or four months afterwards—I knew him as having seen him with Shorter on the 18th in the field.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I am 32 years of age. I was engaged in my own country, but was obliged, on account of some offence for which I was convicted, and had six weeks imprisonment, to fly to England, about a year and a half ago. I had a great many letters of recommendation from German merchants; I was employed at a merchant's, and while I was there I was pardoned by the king on account of the baptism of the young prince, and received a passport which will prove that at the present moment I stand here as a man whose character is not tainted; my character can be proved by Mrs. Fish, with whom I have been living. The reason I left the prosecutor was he gave me only 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and even this not regularly; he gave me on one occasion a bad half-crown; he did not act like an English gentleman, but a man who was not ashamed to enrich himself with my drops of blood. He knew that I gave lessons to several English gentlemen, and he employed me over time in order to prevent me. The character of the other witnesses will be known to you by their own confession before you; the case itself you will find is not at all a case which will form even a charge, but will fall to the ground. According to the prosecutor there must have been forty dozen of caps stolen, which could not have been taken out of the warehouse described by the prosecutor, because he always had the key of his shop with him; he was the first who opened the shop, and the last in the evening who locked the shop; this little room would not hold such a quantify. Amongst the caps I sold to Richardson were several cloth-caps, some velvet and Scotch wool, which I bought from the prosecutor and several other manufacturers; I bought 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of the prosecutor, to send them to Germany to a friend, who was to take orders and send them to me. I have pawned them in several pawnbrokers' shops. This great lot of caps would have to be kept somewhere, though I have always lived at Mrs. Fish's in St. Mary-axe, and this lady has never seen the things in my room, and I could not speak English to sell them some-where else. This woman has painted her name over the door, and she has bought stolen goods, and has lately been obliged to give back a lot that she had bought She has only lately sold stolen goods, and she has pawned the caps in question, and given the money to the witness Rotchford. If you consider this you will let me go, I having been already four weeks in prison.</p>

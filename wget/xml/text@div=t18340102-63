               <p>ELIZABETH RAWLINSON. I am the wife of John Rawlinson, and live at No. 26, <placeName id="t18340102-63-crimeloc353">Bread-street-hill</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18340102-63-crimeloc353" type="placeName" value="Bread-street-hill"></interp>
                  <interp inst="t18340102-63-crimeloc353" type="type" value="crimeLocation"></interp>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. At what hour in the evening? A. After dark, and before eight o'clock - it was not a very light street - the light in the shop was not gas - the light was a very short distance from the machine - I was standing in the private door, nearly close to the shop - when you were brought back by the policeman I nearly fainted; but I was positive of you - I am not aware that my husband put any questions to me - he said, "Do not swear to the man if you are not certain;" and he said to the policeman, "Let him go:" but I am certain of you.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CARTLIDGE (city-policeman, No. 56). I was in Old Fish-street on the night of Tuesday evening, the 17th of December, and heard Mrs. Rawlinson cry "Stop thief" - I took the prisoner at the bottom of Five-foot-lane, not a hundred yards from the prosecutor's - when I first saw him he was running out of St. Nicholas Olive Church-yard - I fell down when I got within ten feet of him, and lost sight of him for a moment; but he was seized and brought back - he was the only person running before me when I fell; and I observed that he had a dark coat on, and white all down the back of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.How far was I from the prosecutrix's house when you heard the cry of "Stop thief?" A. Not above three houses - I observed you in the churchyard seven or eight yards from me - I fell down in the lane; that is, about forty feet from where I stopped you - I did not stop you - you were speaking to a person when I came up.</p>
               <p>Property produced and sworn to.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is generally said a prisoner pleading his own cause has a fool for his advocate; but necessity compels me to adopt this course - being out of a situation, it was necessary I should call at the places where one was most likely to be found - I had been to a house of call at Clerkenwell, and then to Aldersgate-street; then to Bermondsey-street - I came down across Fish-street, Friday-street, down Five-foot-lane; and there I was walking - a person came and asked if I had seen anybody pass that way? - I immediately replied, "No;" and the policeman came up and said, "Oh, I dare say this is the man," and took me back to the prosecutor's house - when I got there I denied all knowledge of the robbery - the husband said to the wife, "Can you swear to the man?" - she said at first, "Yes" - then she was in such a state of agitation, several persons cried out, "Take her into the parlour" - the husband said, "Can you swear to the person? - do not lock him up if you cannot swear to him" - I do not know her answer; but he immediately said, "No, she cannot swear: let him go" - the policeman replied, "No, I will keep him till the morning; then perhaps you will know him better" - I believe it was the duty of the policeman to take me before the inspector; and if so, in all probability I should have been discharged entirely, but in the morning the prosecutrix swore to me, and I was committed - and now, gentlemen, I leave my case in your hands, with a full conviction of receiving an impartial verdict, free and unshackled by oppression or prejudice.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CARTLIDGE re-examined. I did not say,"Perhaps this is the man" - as soon as I got up to him I said, "You must come back with me" - he was talking to a person who had asked him if he had seen a man go that way - the person had stopped him on hearing me cry"Stop thief" - he was asking him that - the person with him said he had asked him if he had seen anybody come that way - the person did not appear to know the prisoner - I am positive I am not mistaken in the person I was following; for I had so good a view of him by the gaslight - he was in the church-yard when I first saw him; that is forty yards from the prosecutor's house.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH RAWLINSON re-examined. I saw him coming up the hill as I stood at my door talking to a neighbour, before he went into the shop - I speak to his face, and observed his hat was torn all down; and he appeared to have a dark coat on - I saw his face in the shop, and as he came out - I have never had a doubt that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask the officer one question on the situation of the night and the hour.</p>
               <p>W. CARTLIDGE. It was between six and seven o'clock in the evening of 17th December - the gas-light was three doors from the shop - I do not know what sort of a light the prosecutrix had in her shop - I think it possible to recognise a person at that hour in her shop - I think I have seen the prisoner's face; but not on that night - I only saw his back.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 18, St. Mary's Square, Paddington—on 21st August, between 8 and 9, I went into the Queen and Prince Albert public-house, at Knightsbridge—the prisoner came in, and I had some con<lb></lb>venation with him, and drank beer with him—I left about 8.30, and the prisoner left at the same time—I told him I was going across the Park, and he said he was going that way too, and we entered into conversation—soon after we got into the Park, he put his hand on my throat, and threw me backwards—he then took my chain—he struck me on the head, and I was insensible for some time—when I came to myself, I missed my chain, coat, and hat—I gave information to the first policeman I saw in the Park, and went with him to the station—I saw the prisoner about 11.30 the same evening at the station, and identified him—I have not the slightest doubt about him now—this is the chain I lost; I can swear to it—I have not seen my coat since—the prisoner said he was stationed at the Chelsea Barracks.</p>

Yes; you got into conversation with me—I did not ask you to go up stairs into the room above—I did not stop anywhere when I got into the Park, and I did not give you a two-shilling piece—you just looked round, and I happened to turn at the same time—you put your hand to my throat, and threw me down—you knelt on me, and used great violence—I did not run away and leave my coat.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman A</hi> 20). I received information from the last witness on 21st August, in consequence of which I searched for someone—about 11 o'clock, I saw the prisoner between Albert Gate and Apsley Gate—he was standing under a lamp-post, examining something, but I could not see what it was—I watched him—he went and spoke to someone who was sitting on a seat—I went and spoke to them, and in consequence of what they told me I followed the prisoner to Apeley Gate—I asked him the time; he said he did not know—I said, "You have a chain, have not you got a watch?"—he said, "No"—he then said, "You know what sort of chaps we are; if you like it, I'll sell you this chain for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "No," and seized hold of it, and took it away from him—he said, "If I had any of my mates here, you would not take hold of it like that"—I then charged him with stealing the chain—he said, "It is my chain, I have had it about a fort<lb></lb>night; my sister gave it to me"—I took him to the station, and sent for the prosecutor—he came about 12, and immediately identified the prisoner—he made no answer—the charge was taken, and he made no answer to it—the prosecutor first came to the station about 10—he was perfectly sober.</p>

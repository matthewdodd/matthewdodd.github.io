On the 6th of January, Thursday evening, about seven in the evening, I was going to St. Paul's-church-yard, from my house; a few yards before I came to the corner of Norfolk-street, where there is a pastry-cook's shop, I perceived a croud there, being twelfth night; I thought it most prudent to avoid that croud, being on the footpath; on stepping from off the curb-stone, I found myself pushed by several men, that I could not get off; they pushed me about violently; and from some words they uttered, I apprehended I was in the hands of pick-pockets.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to you that the pushing was done by design or accident? - I think by design, and thought so at the time, and endeavoured to extricate myself; there appeared to be seven or eight, some behind and some before; but they seemed, as it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120039"></xptr>appeared to me, to be particularly engaged about my person; one man in particular pushed me on the left shoulder, on the pavement, from the way I was stepping; I could but notice him; that was the prisoner; they uttered bad words of swearing, such as where are you going, and damn you, what are you about? I saw him about before; I cannot say he said those words, but he was among them; he put his shoulder against mine; I had my left shoulder that way, with his left shoulder; I found myself quite impeded going along, and found myself in a very disagreeable situation; the croud these men made, was a distinct body from those about the pastry-cooks; I was drove more towards the pastry-cook's; and I was pressed up between two men, much nearer the pastry-cook's than I was at first; I made an effort to extricate myself, intending to use a good stout stick I had in my hand; I drew it up, and found I could not use it; it was held by somebody behind me; there was a pressure upon it which disabled me; at the same time that I attempted to raise my stick, I felt my watch drawn from out my pocket: I can only say I felt it drawn suddenly in a very few seconds; I made an effort with my left hand to save my watch; and I caught it at the moment it was jerked out of my pocket, and held it with one hand, while some man held the chain on the other.</p>
               <p>Was it in fact taken out of your pocket? - Yes; I had it naked in my hand, and some man had hold of the seal; I held it fast; I suppose I caught it at the very instant it came out of my pocket; I am sure I did not secure it till it was out of my pocket; it was separated from my fob, before I secured it again; I cannot say I saw it in the hand of any person; the watch in the scuffle was injured; I pressed into the pastry-cook's shop as a place of safety; and I was standing at the door of the pastry-cook's; I found myself still pushed by the prisoner and others that I had seen before; and I held up my stick to strike them: I thought it audacious; I saw the people by whom I was surrounded, go off towards the New Church in a body; and the person I particularly noticed, went last; then I pursued my business: I found I had lost a silk handkerchief and some silver: I do not think the particular man I spoke of, took out the watch, or took the silver and the handkerchief; and going along, I reflected on this transaction: I thought it a great evil, and made up my mind to go and get assistance and take them: I went to get assistance; and going through St. Martin's-court, near a pastry-cook's shop, going to Cranbourn-alley, I saw those very men whom I met in the Strand: I think they were all the men: but this particular man was there likewise: I stopped for a second or two: they were walking to and fro: I perceived that man particularly: they were dressed in blue coats, made me know them again: I then went as fast as I could to Cranbourn-alley, to my friends: I desired them to take a stick a piece, and follow me, for I said I have been stopped in the Strand, and robbed; and knowing where the prisoners are who did it, I am determined fully to do it: the name of one is Mr. Hill; the other is

            : they are not here: we went to St. Martin's-court: I told them I should point out a particular man, as I was sure of his person: I again saw those men: I pointed out one man: he was about two yards distance: that was the particular man I have described; and I said, that is one of the thieves: that man immediately ran off through the croud, towards St. Martin's-lane: I made the observation quite aloud, that he might hear me: he ran towards St. Martin's-lane: I verily believe he saw me: he looked round, and darted off: I pursued him, and the persons that were with me: I missed him half a minute: then saw him again in Crown-court, and returned into St. Martin's-court again: I saw nothing of him till I came to the broad part of St. Martin's-court: I saw this very man again talking to a great number: they stood very near each other, and appeared to be talking: I took hold of this man's collar, and desired him to come along with me, for he was one of those that stopped me in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120040"></xptr>Strand: he made no answer, but struck me a blow on the face, and knocked me against a stationer's window: at the same time I was assaulted by a great number of sticks, ten or a dozen: they beat me pretty sharply about the arms and shoulders: at the same time I was engaged with that particular man I have described before: at the same time my friends rendered me all the assistance they could, and knocked one or two of these men down, and took one of their sticks: I struck Wallis on the head, and knocked him down: he got up, and essayed to strike me again, and I struck him again on the arm: he then fell on his hands and knees, and crept under a butcher's bulk, and begged I would not strike him again: the patroles came up, and I delivered him to them: he was taken to Sir Sampson's and examined, the next day, and committed.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was that one man in particular, that pushed you to the window of the shop? - The prisoner.</p>
               <p>That was the same man you afterwards apprehended in St. Martin's-court? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Had you made any particular observations of him before that time? - No; they commenced then.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to you at that time, from his general behaviour, to belong to the others that were about you? - Yes; he had that appearance all the time.</p>
               <p>Can you say whether he was or was not one of them that uttered those words you spoke of? - I cannot; but he was the most active person in the transaction, which caught my attention the more.</p>
               <p>He was the man that pushed against your left shoulder, and pushed you up against the shop-window? - Yes; he was the man; I have not the slightest doubt about it; if I had, I would happily decline giving that evidence; when it first commenced, there was no more than the common lights of the common lamps, when I was first assaulted; when I was pushed up nearer to the shop of Mr. Golden, a linen-draper, and when my watch was taken out of my pocket, I had still better light from the pastry-cook's shop.</p>
               <p>Then the man most active in surrounding you, was the prisoner? - Yes, he was; he had a much lighter coloured coat on than any of the rest; a lightish coloured drab great coat.</p>
               <p>Had you any opportunity of observing his countenance by any of those lights? - I observed his countenance particularly; he had a round hat; his hair was black, and tied behind; that I particularly noticed.</p>
               <p>You are sure this was a distinct body of men, to those that were assembled about the pastry-cook's? - It appeared very clearly so to my mind.</p>
               <p>Who was the man that you meant to point out as the person that was loitering at the door of the pastry-cook's? - That person, to my firm belief, was the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner at the bar the person, whom seeing loitering at the pastry-cook's shop-door, you thought of striking with your stick? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you time enough, while you was at the door of the pastry-cook's, to make such observations as to know whether he was the person that first shoved you on the pavement? - Yes; I had time enough for that, and light enough for that; there was a glare of light there; the prisoner is the man whom I alluded to as one of the thieves; and he is the man who on hearing that, turned round, looked at me, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Is he the very man, whom after you had pursued and lost for a time, you saw again in the same coat? - Yes, he is the very man.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner the man whom you then took hold of by the collar, and desired him to come along, telling him he was one of those that stopped you in the Strand? - Yes, I made use of that expression.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner the man that made a blow at your face? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was the man that got under the butcher's block? - Yes; I believe he gave charge of me.</p>
               <p>Now, upon your oath, and considering the serious consequence of the prosecution to the prisoner, have you any doubt? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120041"></xptr>Consistent with the duty I owe myself and and the public, if I could possibly doubt it, I would express that doubt in favour of the prisoner: the enamel of my watch, I believe, dropped off in consequence of that scuffle.</p>
               <p>(The watch produced; the whole of the enamel gone.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I take it, on the out-set, that you mean to convey to my lord and the jury, that you conscientiously believe, without the smallest degree of doubt, that whenever you speak of the man as the particular man, that you mean the prisoner? - I do.</p>

               <p>How many minutes might the transaction in the Strand have occupied? - I cannot think of ascertaining the quantity; a very few.</p>
               <p>Such as two or three? - More than that; it was a very short time.</p>
               <p>And you was as every man in your circumstances must have been, in great confusion? - I was.</p>
               <p>No person who was in your company in the Strand, is here to night? - No.</p>
               <p>No person who was in the pastry-cook's shop is here? - No.</p>
               <p>Your two friends who assisted you to secure the prisoner, are not here? - No.</p>
               <p>The only persons who are here, are the two patroles to whom you gave charge of the prisoner, and who gave a charge of you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In St. Martin's-court you observed two or three blue coats? - Several, I did.</p>
               <p>My lord asked you a question, which in the course of the examination we had not an answer to; that is, about how long it was before you went to St. Martin's-court? - I rather decline computing the time.</p>
               <p>About how long? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was it half an hour? - More than that; I suppose it might be three quarters of an hour before I returned to my own house from the pastry-cook's in the Strand.</p>
               <p>In the course of that distance you must have passed and repassed a good many pastry: cook's shops? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And of course on a Twelfth Night, you must have passed a good many crowds of persons? - Yes.</p>
               <p>On those nights I am told, that wherever there is a particular shew, there are mischievous boys marked in tacking ladies gowns and coats to posts? - That is very well known.</p>
               <p>And there are other mischievous things done? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>But there is a great throng? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe that it is a very common thing, I believe it is almost a universal one, for the pastry-cooks to have a constable at the door-on such nights? - It is very common.</p>
               <p>When you retired to the threshold of this pastry-cook's shop, as a place of safety, you thought the conduct of the prisoner was very audacious? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you make any alarm to the people of the shop, or the constable, or any body else there? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>In your way, in going to your friend's in St. Martin's-court, you saw the same man again? - I did.</p>
               <p>How long might it be after you had passed through St. Martin's-court to Cranburn-alley, before you returned? - I ran as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>The man escaped, and got clear out of your sight for some minutes? - Yes; and the next place I saw him in, was in this same St. Martin's-court.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived in Russel-street? - If you will give me a minute to recollect; I purchased the lease in the month of May, in 1785.</p>
               <p>You lived there at the time it was burnt down? - Yes, I did, and lost a great deal of property.</p>

Passing through St. Martin's-court on the 6th of January, about eight o'clock, I saw Mr. Hill and the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120042"></xptr>in a scuffle together; I took him into custody, and took him to the office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was he searched? - Yes; a pair of gloves and a linen pocket handkerchief was found upon him.</p>

               <p>Jury to Patrole. Whether or no Mr. Hill was charged by the prisoner at the same time? - No, my lord, I did not hear it.</p>
               <p>To the other Patrole. Did you hear the prisoner charge Hill, the prosecutor, with any thing? - No, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hill. When the patrole came up, I desired him in as plain a manner as I could, do you take care of this man, for he has been concerned in robbing me; and the prisoner said something to this effect, as do you take care of him; I will not say the words exactly.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any specific charge made against you at that time? - No, only what I have said; but the patrole did not notice it, as the patrole said.</p>

               <p>I live in Great Wild-street. I was returning home from Mr. Giblett's, tallow-chandler. Passing through St. Martin's-court, I was beset by Mr. Hill, whom I now recollect, who took me by the collar, and said, you rascal, you shall go with me; I was very much surprised at such an expression from a strange man, who I never saw; and he on the instant struck at me with a stick of uncommon size; I endeavoured to retreat; and I think as well as I can recollect, it was at that time I received the blow on my arm, which hurt it very much, in defence of my head; and I struck him, and disengaged myself; I got from him a few paces, and stood to reflect why he should serve me so; and I saw a number of sticks engaged in a quarrel; and fearing this man might attack me again, whom I did not know, I retreated from the place the other way, not being able to pass that way without being struck; he pursued me into the broad part of the court; and somebody struck me on the head with a stick of uncommon size, which knocked me down; as I lay on the ground, he said, you are one of the thieves which stole my watch; then I suspected he had an idea that I had stole it; I got up again, and saw three or four of them coming at me with large bludgeons; there was a butcher's bench which projected about two feet from the window; and to preserve myself, I got under the bench, otherwise they would have killed me, I believe; I told them then, if I had been guilty of any impropriety, to take me to the justice, and not use me so cruel; I advised them to take me to the justice, which they did; when we came to Bow-street, Mr. Hill told the clerk I was one of the people who had robbed him of his watch; I answered, if that is the case, you had better search me; he said, you know very well you have not got it, but if you had had your desire, you would have got it. Gentlemen of the jury, if I am guilty, I hope God will inspire you to find me so; but if I am innocent, I hope you will be inspired to find me so: Mr. Giblett would attend here; he was here yesterday; he staid here till nine o'clock; under the pressing necessity of the death of a relation, he could not come to day; but here is a gentleman here who can tell the time I left his house.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120043"></xptr>What is Mr. Giblett? - He is a tallow-chandler; Cambridge-street is in Carnaby-market.</p>
               <p>At what time did you first see the prisoner there? - About five, to the best of my recollection; indeed I am sure of it; there was a clock in the room, and I particularly noticed it; Mr. Giblett was in company with me and the prisoner; we had business to transact together; the prisoner continued in Mr. Giblett's house till half past seven; I recollect particularly that, because Mr. Giblett noticed to me and the prisoner, it was near half past seven; that he was going out to supper; we parted at that time, or within a few minutes of the time; I said to Mr. Wallis, as Mr. Giblett is engaged, we will go; we parted at Mr. Giblett's house; the prisoner lived in Wild-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields; I know St. Martin's-court, St. Martin's-lane.</p>
               <p>How long would it take a man to walk quietly and leisurely, to St. Martin's-court, from Cambridge-street?</p>
               <p>Jury. About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>You are quite sure, that from five in the afternoon, of the 6th of January, till half past seven, the prisoner was not out of Mr. Giblett's house? - I am sure of it; he was not absent at all during the whole of the time we were engaged on business.</p>
               <p>Never at all out of your sight? - He was not; I have known him above two years in general, a very good character; I never heard to the contrary myself.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure you have not mistaken the day? - I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>How soon after this was the prisoner taken into custody? - The next morning; he sent to me, and I particularly recollected that he had been in my company the preceding evening.</p>
               <p>Court. Where do you live? - In Stanhope-street, Clare-market.</p>
               <p>Where did you understand the prisoner was going when you parted at Mr. Giblett's door? - He did not notice to me, but I understood he was going home.</p>
               <p>Which way did he turn? - He turned to the right.</p>
               <p>Was that in the prisoner's way home? - I was going a contrary way; and I did conceive he was going the right way home; I was going to Charlotte-street, to supper, myself.</p>
               <p>What employment does the prisoner follow? - I have known him in the capacity of an attorney's clerk.</p>
               <p>What attorney? - I do not at present recollect; I know he has wrote for attornies.</p>
               <p>Where has he lived during the time you have known him? - I cannot pretend to say, the whole time.</p>
               <p>Then you have not been much acquainted with him? - Yes, I have, but not going to his apartments; I have seen him in different companies.</p>
               <p>How long has he lived in Wild-street? - To the best of my knowledge, three months; that is the only place I have been acquainted with of his residence.</p>
               <p>Then you saw no more of the prisoner that evening? - No.</p>
               <p>Now he has lived three months in Wild-street, with whom, and in what house? - To the best of my recollection, it was a corner house; I did call upon him once; in fact, I met him at his own door, the corner of Wild-street; this corner near Duke-street; I saw him passing, at his own door once.</p>
               <p>Was you never in his house or his lodgings? - I never was.</p>
               <p>Of what sort has been your acquaintance with him these two years past? - I have seen him in different companies, and by that originally I became acquainted with him, in general in very respectable houses, at the King's Arms in Holborn.</p>
               <p>On what occasions? - Merely to spend the evening.</p>
               <p>By appointment, or how? - Casually.</p>
               <p>Which King's Arms in Holborn? - The King's Arms in High Holborn.</p>
               <p>How often have you met him there casually? - Three or four times a week; I frequently use the house myself.</p>
               <p>Was he never at your house? - Yes; he has called of me, at No. 2, Stanhope-street; I lodge there; I have lodged there three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120044"></xptr>months; I have known the prisoner from having connections in the lottery; he has had connections in the lottery, when not connected with an attorney.</p>
               <p>Was that the commencement of your acquaintance with him? - To the best of my recollection, it was.</p>
               <p>Explain to us the particular business upon which you was employed at Mr. Giblett's that evening? - It was a lottery transaction.</p>
               <p>Describe that transaction? - The prisoner being acquainted with the lottery, it was in point of purchasing shares in the next ensuing English lottery; I recommended Wallis, he having had a connection in the lottery, to Mr. Giblett, and being an acquaintance of his and mine; the whole of the business was not determined that night; but it was to purchase some shares by Wallis, for Mr. Giblett's benefit; I was there about five; Mr. Giblett was at home; I recollected the next day, being the 7th, when the prisoner sent to me; after he was taken into custody, we were asking several questions; but we were not on that all the time; I took particular notice of the time by the clock; and Mr. Giblett pulled out his watch at the time; and there was a clock in the room; it is a back parlour.</p>
               <p>What sort of a clock is it? - I cannot describe it particularly; it is a high clock, about five feet high.</p>
               <p>Which side of the room does it stand in? - It stands fronting the door.</p>
               <p>And during all that time, you swear the prisoner was never out of the room, from five to half past seven? - I am perfectly sure of that, not only from the clock, but the watch.</p>
               <p>Are you a master watch-maker? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you relate this to the magistrates at Bow-street? - I did not receive his note till after the examination; he was at the

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep an eating-house in Cross-lane, Holborn. I have known the prisoner about five years, a most just and respectable character; a very unspotted character, he has borne ever since I knew him, during the whole five years.</p>
               <p>Court. What has been his employment? - A lawyer's clerk; I cannot tell to who; and he has been a clerk to a licenced lottery-office; and during the recess of the lottery, he has been clerk to the lawyers; he has lived in Great Wild-street the latter part, I think about eighteen months.</p>
               <p>With whom? - With his father; his father is a shoe-maker.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three more witnesses who gave him an exceeding good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Brogden. During this time, from five to half past seven, what had you to eat and drink? - We had some brandy and water.</p>
               <p>Who supplied you with that? - A servant of Mr. Giblett's.</p>

               <p>Had you any more than yourselves? - No, no other person that night.</p>
               <p>Who let you out when you went out of the shop? - We let ourselves out; the shop was not shut up; the door was on the latch.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Hill. As I understood you, it could not be later than seven? - According to my apprehension, I think it was about seven; I generally drink tea about six; and I waited a little time, and I set out; I apprehend it must be near seven; I did not look at my watch, or any thing of the kind.</p>

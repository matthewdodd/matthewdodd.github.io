             sworn. - I am the sister of Thomas Dewell. On the 11th of October, about two in the afternoon, I lost two linen aprons, and two check linen aprons, from a back-room, near the Chapel, <placeName id="t17971025-32-crimeloc164">Old Brentford</placeName>

I got a constable, and delivered her and the things to him; we found the other two aprons and the shawl in a room in the house where she lives, not her own room.</p>

             sworn. - I am a gardener; I heard the cry of stop thief, and saw the prisoner running, and stopped her about 100 yards from this girl's house, near the alley; nothing passed between her and me. I took her to this woman's house, and a constable was sent for.</p>
               <p>(The constable produced the property.)</p>
               <p>Dewell. These linen aprons are my brother's, I wash for him, he is a tallow-chandler; I have no doubt at all about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Her mother brought me these things to pawn; and I carried her a plate of sheep's liver fried, and a quartern of gin.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Dewell). Was there any intimacy between your mother and the prisoner? - A. She has come in to ask my mother how she did, no farther.</p>

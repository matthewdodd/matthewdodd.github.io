               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the Jury, I am truly sensible of the awful situation I am in, but conscious of my innocence. Two years ago I unfortunately became a bankrupt; every one of my creditors signed my certificate. I got into the situation of Smith and Bell at the time. I found every thing respectable. They had a banking-house, Sharpe and Sons, Smithfield: they paid their bills at that time. Mr. Smith got a sprain in his arm: he got me to sign, Smith and Bell. I did it; conceiving I had his authority fully so to do. I conceived his authority was sufficient for me so to do. I throw myself upon the Jury, that what I did I thought was right and just.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130043"></xptr> Q. Within this fortnight have you had any conversation with Mr. Smith respecting of Mr. Bell - A. About three weeks ago I went to see Gibson, who was in prison in the same room with Smith; I desired Smith to assist the prosecution. He had spoken a good deal against Ashbee. He denied all knowledge of this transaction of Messrs. Carter and Strong. He said it was hard for him: they had been doing business without his knowledge, and it was hard for him to answer for it. He said he always knew the prisoner's name was Ashbee. He said, Ashbee was the only partner he had.</p>

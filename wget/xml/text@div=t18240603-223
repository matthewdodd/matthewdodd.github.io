            . I am shopman to Mr. Tipping; he lives in the Borough. On the 9th of April the prisoner called at our shop, he was then dressed in a brown coat, a red handkerchief over his eyes, and a white apron; he looked out two tubs of butter, two sides of bacon, and a Cheshire cheese; the amount of the bill was 9 l. 12 s. 2 d. He said his name was William Hall, 10, North-street, City-road; there was to be 1 s. taken off for ready money, and I was to be there by half-past six o'clock, he wished to have them earlier; I was to have the money when I went; he was a stranger to me; Mr. Tipping was at home and saw him; the goods were delivered to Harrow, the carman - I gave him the direction, and told him to bring back all the goods or all the money; this was the prisoner's own proposal; I had taken the direction in writing, and made him spell it; I entered the goods in the name of Hall.</p>

            . I am carman to Mr. Tipping; I carried these articles to No. 10, North-street, City-road; when I got there I went by the house, and stopped to look at the direction; and the prisoner called out to me,</p>

               <p>"Young man, this is the house." I pulled the cart round, and gave him the goods; I think it was a green-grocer's shop; he took the two tubs of butter and put them in the passage; I gave him the cheese and the bacon, and they were taken into the cellar - he asked if I had got any thin cheese - I said No - he said he was sorry, as he looked three out - I said that was impossible, as he took the bill before he left the shop - he then asked if I had any objection to copper; I said No - he said some people had great objection to it - I said I had none, as I had the horse and cart - he said he dealt with many publicans who paid him in copper - he gave me eighteen papers, five sovereigns, and some silver; I put the copper in my cart and came away - I did not discover what I had got till I got home; then I found it was lead - my master and I went back immediately, and he was gone - it was at the house of one Mr. Morell.</p>

               <p>The papers were produced and shown to the Jury, which contained pieces of lead of the shape and size of pence and halfpence.</p>

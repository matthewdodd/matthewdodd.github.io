             Sworn. - I am one of the officers of Lambeth-street, Whitechapel: I went with Brace to Loney's house, opened the door, and found the butter under the table covered over; I asked the prisoner how it came here; he said, some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150073"></xptr>person brought it, and left it there; it is about two hundred yards from the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This tub of butter was found in my entry, by my children's account, about seven or eight o'clock at night; I went down with the vessel to Gravesend, being in that line; I landed at Bluckwall, and it was eleven o'clock when I got home; my children told me there was a cask in the entry, and butter in it, my wife was out with her friends; I went to bed, and left it in the passage; my wife brought it in when she came home, but I said, for God's sake take and roll it out, or worse will come of it; it remained in by my wife's persuasions, but I left my door open all night, and the man came in the morning; my children had rolled it under the table, the man is here who saw the man take it into the passage; I never was in trouble in my life before, and have lived thirty years on the spot.</p>

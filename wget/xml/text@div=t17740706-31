               <p>Fellows. Yes; on the 21st of June he was at Uxbridge squandering money away in an odd manner; he had much in his pocket; I apprehended he did not come honestly by it; a neighbour of mine begged I would examine him, as he suspected him; I asked him from whence he came; at first he said he did not know; I said you are Welsh; then he said, yes; he said he came up, about Christmas; I told him he had come dishonestly by money, and it would be better to tell me the truth, and circumstances might be more favourable with him; he then said he would tell me truth; that he was brother to one Morgan, who lived at No. 16, in Monmouth-street, who keeps a clothes shop; that about one o'clock in the morning a person, whom he called Hughes, knocked at his brother's door.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it in writing?</p>
               <p>Fellows. I have it here in writing; I took this in order to charge Hughes, but upon the second examination he discharged Hughes.</p>

               <p>"cut open the box, and gave this information</p>
               <p>"some money; I cannot tell what, but it was</p>
               <p>"gold and silver." Upon this I examined what he had got; he took out fifty-three guineas, a quarter of a guinea, and twenty-three shillings in silver; I asked him whose property it was; he said his brother's, and the money was given him by Hughes; he produced a silver watch that he had bought with some of the money, and upon the back of this he gave me an account of what money he had laid out for a watch and other things. He acknowledged the money to be his brother's property, and wished it might be given him again.</p>

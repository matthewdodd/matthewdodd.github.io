            . I was with Miss Preston, on this night coming from the Play with her. We were returning by Rathbone-place, and met three females; the prisoner was the inside one; the prisoner came suddenly and shoved Miss Preston down, and knocked her down; she had no instrument in her hand; it was with her fist. She then seized her shawl, and with the force of pulling it from her shoulder, she fell back herself. When she got up she went a little distance, and gave it to another person; I don't know who that person was; she was in my sight. I called the watch; the watchman was nearly at my elbow sooner than I expected, and when the prisoner came back, she used abusive language, and asked did I think she had got the property. The watchman came up, and he took her. I saw a young man of the name of Parr; be crossed the road of Rathboneplace; he came to my assistance. I know nothing of the lad that is there.</p>

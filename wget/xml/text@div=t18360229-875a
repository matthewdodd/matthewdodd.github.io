I followed a woman about half a mile—she was then joined by another woman and the prisoner—I saw them conversing together—I went towards them—they observed me, and the two women got away—when I came to the prisoner, he had his hand in this left hand pocket—he drew his hand from his pocket—I seized it, and in it were these six counterfeit shillings—I took him to the station, and found on him four sixpences, one shilling, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper, a penny doll, a caricature which I should judge cost a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a piece of netting, a lemon, and one reel of cotton, worth about 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he had found these shillings—he did not say where.</p>

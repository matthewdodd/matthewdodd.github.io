             sworn. - I am a constable of St. Martin's in the fields: On Saturday, the 6th of this month, the prosecutor brought the woman into the watch-house, he had hold of her right hand; he charged her with robbing him of a guinea and some silver; he said nothing about a seven-shilling piece, to my knowledge, at the time he charged her; I then took her down into the watch-house hole below, she was rather obstreperous, and I was obliged to get the beadle and watchman to hold each hand while I searched her pocket; in consequence of searching her pocket, I found a guinea, four shillings and sixpence in silver, two pennyworth of halfpence, and a seven-shilling piece covered up in this piece of paper, (produces the money); she said, there are three shillings of my own there; I then took her up stairs, and wrote the charge in the book; while I was writing the charge. she wished me to give him his money back, and let her go about her business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was saving up my money to redeem some things; the guinea I had sent from a person in the City, towards getting my things again; and half-a guinea I had had a fortnight; going along I saw this man, he wanted me to go along with him, and I would not; and he pulled me about, and broke my apron-string; and the constable used me very ill; it was my own money.</p>

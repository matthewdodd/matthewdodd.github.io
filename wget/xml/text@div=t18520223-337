                  </hi>. I am a gentleman, residing on my property at Nor<lb></lb>wood. On Saturday, 14th Feb., I went with my brother to the Griffin, at Newington—there was some <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi> going on there—I had rather too much to drink—I saw the prisoner there—I got there a little past 7 o'clock in the evening—I had a gold watch worth 40 guineas in my right hand waistcoat pocket—I had a short chain through my button hole attached to an arrow—it could be seen—about nine I required to go down stairs—my brother was at that time <hi rend="italic">setting-to</hi>—I being quite a stranger in the place, the prisoner said he would show me—he accompanied me down stairs to a sort of skittle ground—I made water, and directly I had buttoned up my trowsers the pri<lb></lb>soner seized hold of my watch—I immediately seized him by the collar, and we had a <hi rend="italic">scuffle</hi>—he threw me on my back, and I found my watch was gone—he got my hand off his collar by <hi rend="italic">punching</hi> my hand—my hand was com<lb></lb>pletely black—he got away—the chain remained hanging to my button hole—this is it; here is where it was broken off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Where is the blackness on your hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it is gone off; I believe you can see a little blackness on it now—it remained black five or six days—the bruise I got from the fall still remains—I could hardly move for three or four days—I was sufficiently sober to know you—you went down stairs with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Charles-street, Drury-lane. I was at the Griffin that night—I saw the prosecutor and another gentleman there—I saw some <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi>—I saw the prisoner there—I saw him and the prosecutor go down stairs together, about half-past 8 o'clock—the prisoner went down first, just leaving room for the prosecutor to follow—I was going down for orders—when I got down, I went to the left hand, towards the bar, and they turned towards the tap, which would lead to the skittle ground—in about a quarter of an hour I saw the prosecutor, and he made a complaint to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you see me go into the tap-room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I only saw you turn that way.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A labourer; I am at present out of employ; the last I did was as a baker—I was not doing anything before—I was not a pugilist—I have <hi rend="italic">sparred</hi>—I know Horsemonger-lane gaol: I have been there—a man charged me with stealing a sovereign—I was there a week, and then discharged—the prisoner was very much in liquor that night; he was drunk, the prosecutor was the same—I should think they were both drunk—I heard an outcry, and saw the prosecutor—I did not notice whether his clothes were buttoned—his brother was there—I have not seen his brother here to-day—I do not know whether it was a wet night or dry—I did not notice Mr. Harris' clothes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Griffin. I remember the prosecutor being there—I saw the prisoner there for an hour before the prosecutor was in the house—the prisoner came and asked me for the key of the water-closet, about 7 o'clock—I gave it him—it was his duty to let me have it again—he did let me have it, but not that night—it being a busy night, many persons used the place—the prisoner was in the habit of showing persons to the place—all I know is, that when the gentleman lost his watch he ran into the bar parlour, and let me know—I had missed the prisoner half an hour before that—the room where the <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi> took place is up stairs—to go to the watering place, they would not pass the bar, but go the other way—when I saw the prisoner half an hour before, he went up stairs—I did not see him afterwards—he could not have gone out of the front door without my seeing him—there was a way to get out at the back through the window—all the other doors were locked—the windows are on the right hand side, in the skittle ground—I had not seen the windows any time that evening—I was in the bar—I did not see the windows till half-past 11 that night—the shutters were not fastened—I cannot say whether they were secure at 7 or 8, because mistress and master were out, and the shutters were not fastened—at half-past 11 I went to shut</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185202230084"></xptr>
               <p>in the windows—I did not take notice of the ground, being rather busy—the windows go towards a cow-yard; by that means the prisoner might go out—there might be a dozen go that way—the ground is about eighteen feet from the bar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the skittle ground in the open air? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there are two windows to show in light—persons might get away from there without going through the house—there were a lot up stairs and a lot in the tap room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> There were a lot up stairs, of all sorts of people? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; all working people—I do not remember a Mr. Hill having been robbed there a fortnight or a month before—I have been there four months—I was in the bar when Mr. Harris came back—it was rather a damp night; I think it was raining. I am not sure—when Mr. Harris came in he was rather in liquor—he called for several glasses of brandy and water—I should say he had four or five glasses, and three different pints of gin; I drew it him—when he <hi rend="italic">stood</hi> this gin he went up stairs—I did not see him afterwards—when he came in and said he had lost his watch, I shut the door—I would not let any one go—the policeman walked in—I am quite sure that when the prosecutor came in he had four or five glasses of brandy and water, and he treated the persons with three pints of gin—when he came in he was drunk; his brother was sober—after the prosecutor took these glasses of brandy and water, he remained up stairs about ten minutes as near as I can tell—I did not see him come down; I saw him in the passage—he <hi rend="italic">hallooed</hi> out to me, and said he had lost his watch—I said, "Who has got it?"—he said, "A man in the ground;" and I shut the door, because there was a lot went to rush in—I noticed Mr. Harris's clothes; they were in about the same state as when he walked first into the house—I did not observe whether his waistcoat was torn.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

(<hi rend="italic">The deposition stated</hi>, "They were all fast in the early part of the evening.") I mean to swear that Mr. Harris was quite drunk when he came in—he was very drunk indeed, and I served him four or five glasses of brandy and water, 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth each time—I do not say that he drank it all; I was busy, you know—he drank a good drop at the bar—I will swear he drank two of those glasses—I went on serving a drunken man in that way—if he had called for a pound's worth I should have given it him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I have an office in Newgate-street. On Sunday evening, the 22nd of March, between six and seven o'clock, I was walking in the London-road—the witness Goldsmid came and touched me on the shoulder—in consequence of what he said, I felt in my outside coat pocket, and missed a silk handkerchief, which I had safe not a minute before—it has never been found.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Newington-causeway. On Sunday even<lb></lb>ing, the 22nd of March, I was in the London-road, and saw two boys—I saw one of them pick the prosecutor's pocket of a handkerchief—I cannot swear it was the prisoner, or that he was one of the two—they ran away—I was on the opposite side of the way—I was examined before the Magis<lb></lb>trate—the signature to this deposition is mine—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Listen to this, "I saw the prisoner take from the prosecutor's hind pocket a blue handkerchief with white spots; I know him by sight quite well; I have been in the habit of seeing the prisoner for the last twelve<lb></lb>month, and I am quite certain he is the person that took the prosecutor's hand<lb></lb>kerchief." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> My not swearing to him now is in consequence of passing through a field, and observing, among other boys assembled there for the purpose of gambling, a person resembling the prisoner so much, that I can<lb></lb>not swear to him now—when before the Magistrate I laboured under the delusion that it was him; but seeing another lad so like him, I cannot conscientiously swear to him.</p>

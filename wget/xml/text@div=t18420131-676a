On the 15th of January, about nine o'clock, as he was coming to work, I told him Mr. Spence wished to speak to him—I afterwards went with the prisoner and Mr. Spence to the prisoner's house—we searched it, but found nothing on the premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in High-street, Poplar. On the 15th of January, I was at work at Mr. Micheson's, in Gun-lane, and saw a man on the tiles at the back of Mr. Micheson's premises, pitching some wood down the privy—there are four yards adjoining there—I had no opportunity of noticing the man's features—I cannot form any judg<lb></lb>ment whether the prisoner is the man—Mr. Micheson afterwards found the timber there, and called in the police.</p>

                  </hi>. My father is one of the firm of Messrs. Teb<lb></lb>but, Stoneman, and Spence. In consequence of information I received, the prisoner was brought to me on the 15th of January, about a quarter-past nine o'clock—I said, "Ashley, I am sorry to say there is a charge of thieving against you, have you any objection to your house being searched?"—he said, "None whatever, Sir"—we immediately went to his house and searched the back-yard—I saw nothing, and be returned to his work as usual—about twelve the policeman came, and the prisoner was given in charge again—I have examined the wood produced—some of these pieces are prepared in a particular manner—here are some pieces of quartering planed on all four sides, which are used for fitting up convict ships, which we do by contract under Government—I do not positively swear to any one piece, but they are such as we use—the prisoner was one of a gang who fit up these ships.</p>

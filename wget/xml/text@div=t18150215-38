On the night of the 11th of January, the prisoner came late in the evening, he asked for a bed; my servant was going away; I accomodated him with the servant's bed; these two pair of small pistols lay in a chair close by the bed; I was up in the room, and saw them there. On the morning of the 12th, the prisoner got up early before me; I went up into the room; the pistols were gone. In the course of the day, the prisoner came into the tap-room with a beefsteak in his hand: he paid me for his lodging. I said, sailor, I have lost two pair of pistols, if you have them tell me, I will be favourable to you; he denied knowing any thing of them. Mr. Dickens, the officer, came down; he confessed to him of having stolen the pistols.</p>

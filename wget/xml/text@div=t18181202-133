            . I am apprentice to Mr. Hall, a coach-maker, in Eagle-street. I was passing the end of Montague-street, Russell-square, and observed the prisoner and another man, lurking about. The prisoner was looking down several areas; I saw him go down an area, and return - they went further; his companion sat on the step, and the prisoner went down the area of No. 27; I crossed the road, and got assistance; he came up with the box under his arm; I laid hold of him, and asked what he had got, he said he had got them from his mother; the other got away. A gentleman who assisted me, took him down the area; while he was looking for the person, the prisoner came up again; I pursued, and took him. I also took the other boy, but let him go to secure the prisoner.</p>

            ;) I took her up upon suspicion of that, and carried her before the Justice; (she used to lodge over our heads, but was gone away;) the constable found my watch in her pocket; I was by at the time she owned she had taken the watch, but intended to have brought it back again.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether you ever heard any bad character of me?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, never in my life; she has been in my room, and taken care of my wife when she has not been well; I never missed any thing by her; I always took her to be a very honest woman.</p>

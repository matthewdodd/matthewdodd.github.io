                  </hi>. I am a sail-maker at Greenwich. On 23d May, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was about ten or twenty yards from Greenwich Church, on my way home from my club, talking to my brother—the prisoner came up, put her arms round my neck, and called out, "Oh, Mr. Mitchell," and went away—she knew me, but I did not know her name—about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards, my brother asked me what o'clock it was—I felt, and my watch was gone—I described the prisoner to a constable, and went with him to a house in Bridge-street—we knocked at the door, and the prisoner opened it—the policeman searched the place, and on coming out he found my watch about a yard from the street-door—this produced is it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). I went with Mitchell to a house in Bridge-street, and on knocking at the door the prisoner opened the window—he identified her—another constable went up-stairs with her, and while they were up-stairs I found the watch about a yard from the street-door in a room on the ground-floor that the door opens into; it was not a room occupied by the prisoner—when the prisoner opened the door, she would pass close by there—there is no passage—nobody could open the street-door without coming where the watch was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was walking with another young girl, and met the prosecutor—he caught hold of me, and I said, "Oh, Mr. Mitchell"—if I had taken his watch, they could not have been off seeing it at the door when they came in. <hi rend="smallCaps">

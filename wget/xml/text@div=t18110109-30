               <p>Q. Did you live there on the <rs id="t18110109-30-cd177" type="crimeDate">26th of last December</rs>
                  <join result="offenceCrimeDate" targOrder="Y" targets="t18110109-30-off174 t18110109-30-cd177"></join>. A. Yes; I lived in the garret, and Mr. Bowles lived in the two-pair back room. On the night of the 26th of December, Mr. Bowles came home between five and six o'clock; he came up stairs; I called to him, and said,</p>
               <p>"will you come up and set in my room, I dare say your wife will be home in a few minutes?" He came up, and sat about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. He then asked me to light him down to his own door. He pushed the door open. I gave him a light. He said he believed he should go to bed. I left him in his room, and saw no more of him till about eight o'clock; I was then in the street. I saw him bring his wife from Mrs. Baldwyn's wine-vaults, in the same street - I saw him bringing her in company with Mrs. Smith, whom Mr. Bowles had denied his wife being in company with. Mr. Bowles had frequently turned Mrs. Smith out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw Bowles and his wife together, did any words pass between them. - A. Not till they came in the passage of his own house. I saw her sitting on the stairs; he was standing in the front of her. Bowles desired his wife to go up, and by her refusing he gave her a blow with his right hand on the left side of her head, I think, with his double fist He kept saying,</p>
               <p>"will you go up? if you do not, I will break your neck. I left them upon his carrying her up, and Mr. Togwell shut the door, and I went out I saw no more of them at that time. I came home in about three quarters of an hour. When I returned, I called to my husband to let me in. I was called to go up to see the deceased. When I went into the room I found the deceased laying upon the sacking of the bedstead; there was no bed. Mrs. Togwell had pulled her strait. The prisoner Bowles was in the room, and Mrs. Togwell, and I think Mrs. Tooley. I felt the deceased, she was very hot. I said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! Mr. Bowles, what have you killed your wife? He, with his hands, beat his head, and stamped his feet, and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! pray Mrs. Bland do not say so," and appeared very much agitated indeed. As she seemed so hot. I said,</p>
               <p>"for God's sake, has nobody sent for a gentleman of the faculty?" He went out himself, without his hat, and in about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, he returned with Mr. Steward. Mr. Steward called for a looking-glass. Bowles was in the room; the looking-glass was wiped clean; he put it over her face, and then he put it again, and pronounced that she was dead. The doctor asked Bowles if he had any words with his wife, or if he had struck her? He said, yes, he had, but nothing in particular, and when he laid her down, he thought she might have been in a fit. He never left the house till two o'clock in the morning, when Limbrick took him. I took up his two children into my room, and by my landlady's request, Mr. Bowles went up there, and I sat up all night with my landlady.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner sober. - A. I am sure he was not; he was better than half in liquor; he had been out all day. He is a sawyer by trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go out in anger. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. He was displeased with her in some way, because the five shillings that he had given her to buy a mattress, she had spent in gin. - A. I do not know about the mattress - Mr. Bowles said she had pawned his tools for a shilling. It was about dusk she came home; I understood for the pliers. She had gone out at one o'clock in the day, and did not come home to the children till eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he was rather forward in liquor. - A. Yes, I never saw any thing amiss of him while I knew him. I have lived in the house fifteen months.</p>
               <p>Q. Besides working at a trade as a sawyer, when at home, he made bird cages. - A. He was an industrious man, I saw nothing amiss of him.</p>

I do not remember I ever saw him before I saw him at a house in Earle-street, between seven and eight o'clock - I was going for some cheese for my supper. I was going by the prisoner's door. I heard a scream of a woman. I looked in the passage. I saw a man and a woman at the foot of the stairs; he up with his fist and struck her on the side of the head; she fell down backwards at the foot of the stairs; the landlady came out; she said,</p>
               <p>"for God's sake, Mr. Bowles, do not beat your wife so much." She said,</p>
               <p>"for God's sake shut the door." The man looked at me - he came towards the door. I was afraid he would strike me, perhaps.</p>

            . I keep the house No. 17, in Earle-street. The prisoner Bowles and his wife occupied the back room two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you see the prisoner and his wife come home. - A. About eight o'clock. I had not seen Bowles all the day before that time his wife was with him. I heard a scuffling in the passage. I went to see what was the matter. He struck her in anger, but not with great violence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he strike her more than once. - A. Only once. He asked Mrs. Bowles to go up; she would not; she sat down on the stairs. Bowles asked her many times to go up stairs, she would not go. He struck her on the side of the head, I believe, with his fist. He took her in his arms before him, and carried her up stairs. He asked her several times what she had done with the five shillings? she made no answer. He appeared to be in anger. I lit him up stairs, and as soon as I came up stairs, he struck her and stamped upon her side or belly, I am not sure which it was, at the lower part of her body. He asked her where the money was; he seemed to be harping about the money. He was very angry with her for being with Mrs. Smith. I begged of him not to beat his wife any more. He gave me his finger, and promised me he would not. I went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go again to his room. - A. I did, about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after. When I got into the room, Bowles was standing up by the side of the fire-place; there was no fire; the deceased was lying upon the bed. Bowles told me that his wife had a fit. I said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Bowles, she is dead."</p>
               <p>Q. In what state of mind was Bowles at that time.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090022"></xptr>A. I think he appeared to have been drinking. He appeared very much hurt upon my telling him that his wife was dead. Mr. Bowles would not believe that she was dead. Then I sent up stairs for Mrs. Bland. Mrs. Bland suggested for a doctor to be sent for, and Bowles himself went without his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon Bowles finding that his wife was dead, was he composed. - A. No, very much hurt. I was in the room; I saw him beat his head. The prisoner returned with the doctor; and the doctor, Mr. Steward, tried an experiment with the looking-glass. Mr. Steward, pronounced that she was dead, and said he could not say whether it was a fit or no. Mr. Steward left the house, and Mr. Bowles went and slept with Mr. Bland. He remained in the house till two o'clock until the officer came.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. How long did he live with you. - A. Better than two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that this woman was subject to fits. - A. I attended her in a fit once - when she was on the floor I held her down.</p>
               <p>Court. They were convulsion fits, were they. - A. Yes.</p>

            . I live in the front room in the two pair, and Bowles occupied the back room in Earl-street. On the night of the 26th, about eight o'clock, I heard a voice upon the stairs. I heard a great lumb-ring, and some one cried, and that I heard a great noise as if Bowles had throwed his wife down in the next room. I sat about five or ten minutes, and heard blows; then I went to Bowles's room; the door was open. I saw the deceased on the floor. I called,</p>
               <p>"Bowles, have done." I saw him kick her while she was on the ground, about the side of the lower part of the body. Bowles said,</p>
               <p>"what can I do, Mrs. Tooley?" Mrs. Togwell came up; he promised her that he would not beat his wife any more. The deceased said, as she laid on the ground, you and Mrs. Togwell may go. We went away. I left the deceased on the ground. I stepped into my own room. I heard many things that passed in Bowles's room. The prisoner asked his wife what she had done with the things? she said she had pawned them herself. I believe he struck her then, for the child cried out,</p>
               <p>"pray father do not beat her any more, beat her again tomorrow." He said to the child,</p>
               <p>"go and ask your mother what there is for supper." He questioned the child to know what the mother had bought for the sister out of the money? the child answered, that she did not know that the mother had bought any thing. I heard nothing else until Mrs. Togwell came up.</p>
               <p>Q. What brought Mrs. Togwell up. - A. The little child went and said her mother was in fits. Upon Mrs. Togwell's coming up, she called me, and told me Mrs. Bowles was dead. I went into Bowles's room; I found her laying upon the mattrass, with the blanket over her. Bowles was standing at the foot of the bed by the fire-place; he seemed very much hurt when Mrs. Togwell told me his wife was dead. He appeared agitated, and beat his head very much. Mrs. Bland proposed to have a doctor. Bowles was glad enough to go - he went without his hat, and when Mr. Steward came, he pronounced her dead. Bowles seemed distressed and hurt. After this Bowles remained in the house until Limbrick the officer came and took him.</p>

            Can you say whether they were comfortable together, or did they quarrel much. - A. I have heard them quarrel together, and fight. I have heard the deceased say,</p>
               <p>"pray father do not beat me."</p>
               <p>Q. On this night was Bowles sober. - A. He was very much in liquor; he was a very industrious man. His wife would get in liquor as well as him. I did not associate with them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. How long have you lived in this house. - A. Two years.</p>
               <p>Q. You were saying something about five shillings. - A. Yes, he asked her what she had done with it? he gave her five shillings to buy a mattrass for the eldest girl that was out of service.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I live in Leicester-street, Leicester-square. I was called in by the medical gentlemen during the dissection of the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the gentlemen. - A. Mr. Steward, surgeon; Mr. Lonsdale, a surgeon; and a medical student, a young gentleman. When I went in, the three principal cavities of the body were laid open, but nothing removed or touched; the abdomen or belly, the chest and the head. My attention was first drawn entirely to the abdomen; there was a little blush of redness upon the stomach, and within the stomach a quantity of gin; the quantity of fluid might be about ten ounces - the smell indicated a considerable quantity. I must add, that this was done the day after the decease. Nothing preternatural in the chest; on the head marks of blows, but under the integument of the skin no mark. On the bone, that is the scull, the scalp skin was taken off, and part dry by the bruises. On opening the inside of the scull-cap no appearance of bruises; no fracture. The membrane of the brain nothing implying the effects of injury there, nor upon the upper part of the brain. On the surface and cavity a watery serous effusion on all the surface of the brain. In the cavity of the brain, on rising of the brain from the lower part of the brain-case, a large coagulum of blood appeared. I took the opportunity afterwards of examining the large vessels of the lower part of the brain, and I observed in her head, on one of the four principal arteries of the brain, a transverse rent of the artery going up into the brain.</p>
               <p>Q. From the observation that you made, what do you suppose to be the cause of this person's death. -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090023"></xptr>A. The immediate fall of the quantity of blood, pressing upon the brain, that was the cause of her death, according to the best of my judgment.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the rupture of that material artery the cause of that effusion of blood. - A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in Court and heard the evidence given of the violence that had been used, do you or not conceive that that external violence was the cause of the rupture of that artery. - A. There is an external difficulty here. If I had seen no marks of external violence there, I should have said it was a common case of a sanguinous apoplexy.</p>
               <p>Q. With the assistance of the external violence that you have described in this case, and the quantity of gin in the stomach, and this effusion which we know to be the effect of encreased action, do you conceive that the state of the woman approached to a state of apoplexy, so far that at that time a slight agitation or blow would produce an effect which would not take place; was not the person inebriated. - A. When I have opened the head of those that died from inebriation, the effusion was present, not the rupture.</p>
               <p>Q. The effusion of serum, could that take place instead of the coasulum of blood with such blows as you have heard described. - A. From concussion; a state of concussion of the head might produce the effect, but not at that time; the coagulum of blood from the rupture of the vessel produced death, and not the effusion of the serum.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You said, were you have opened the head of persons that died of drunkenness, you have found the serous effusion, but not the rupture. - A. I have found the serous effusion in a greater degree than here. I recollect two instances.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you found the rupture also, were persons died of drunkenness. - A. I have opened the head of a young man that drank a great quantity of whisky, so much as he was hardly able to stagger to bed - on opening this young man's head, I found this serous effusion.</p>
               <p>Q. Where persons die of intoxication, I take it for granted, apoplexy takes place in persons that die of drunkenness. - A. In persons that are sober, and persons that are inebriated.</p>
               <p>Q. And I take it for granted that drunkenness will produce it. - A. Very much so; it resembles very much the natural apoplexy.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether the rupture of the artery might have arisen from blows, of which you saw the marks. - A. I cannot say, the rupture might or might not have arisen from blows, of which I saw marks, considering the state of circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing this poor woman to have fallen down in a fit, that might have contributed to it. - A. If I had not seen the marks, or heard of the blows, I should have considered it an apoplectic fit.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Supposing the vessels of a person to be filled, the circulation encreases in consequence of intoxication. With such blows as you saw upon this person, would not that have a tendency to have produced the rupture that you saw. - A. Undoubtedty - but I cannot say it did.</p>
               <p>Court. Then upon the whole, considering the intoxication, such a quantity of ardent spirits might have occasioned the bursting of the artery that you have mentioned. - A. It might.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel.</p>
               <p>Mr. STEWARD. Q. You are a surgeon. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. We understand you were called in upon this woman being discovered or supposed to be dead. - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were brought to the spot by the prisoner himself. - A. Yes. When I arrived there, I found the deceased laying upon the bed, seemingly dead. I ascertained that she was dead. There were three women in the room at the time, Mrs. Togwell, Mrs. Bland, and Mrs. Tooley.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of these three women in a state to make correct observations of what passed. - A. Mrs. Bland appeared frantic, she was stamping about.</p>
               <p>Q. You assisted Mr. Bell in the disection of the head. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What in your judgment was the occasion of her death. - A. The rupture of the blood-vessel.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say the rupture of the blood-vessel was occasion by the blows, which you saw the marks, or by any fall. - A. It is certainly very hard to say.</p>
               <p>Q. With the quantity of spirits you found in her stomach, do you think in the state of intoxication that she was in, the state of anger she was in, or irritation, might account for the rupture of that blood-vessel. - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. How many blows were there on the head. - A. I think there were four.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether the blows were violent or not. - A. They were not so violent to effect the skull, only the integument.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing they were given by the fist, were they violent or not. - Q. I do not think they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the circulation of the blood being much encreased by intoxication that this woman is stated to be found in, would not the blows then have a tendency to fill the vessels. - A. One blow would have done it, there would be no occasion of repeating it; in my opinion the patient must die instantly, the rupture of the vessel would occasion instant death.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark of any blow were the rupture was. - A. No, there could not be any; there was one upon the root of the nose, one upon the left temple, one by the right ear, and one behind her head.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the rupture such that either these blows would effect the rupture of the vessel. - A. I do not think it could.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it be produced by either of these blows. - A. It is very hard to say - it is my opinion it was not.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you ascribe it. - A. To the effect of intoxication, causing a greater action of the vessels of the head, together with struggle and passion. It is my opinion it might have been produced without blows, if there had been intoxication, struggle, and passion.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

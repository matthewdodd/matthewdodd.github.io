                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Adrianus Visser, he lives in Lower Thames-street. On 21st Feb. he brought me some bags of oysters, and told me to convey them on board a vessel when it was cleared—I had</p>

               <p>them safe about 9 or 10 o'clock, and in about an hour afterwards I missed one bag and another half bag, I think about three quarters of a bushel—in consequence of what was told me, I went to the Shades tap, where I saw Bone eating some small oysters—I could not swear to the oysters—I told him I was told that he had stolen some oysters, and I would get an officer—he said he had been told to take a few.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman, and live at Bermondsey. I saw some oysters under a boat at Tower-wharf on a Saturday—I saw Campbell come down and take a little handkerchief full of oysters from under the boat—I did not know whose oysters they were, but I inquired afterwards and saw the last witness—Campbell went away and returned with Bone, and between the two they lifted a bagful on Bone's back—there were some others with them—they all went away, and I gave information to the last witness.</p>

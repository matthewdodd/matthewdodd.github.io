            . It will be my duty on the part of the prosecution to state to you as shortly as I can, the circumstances which form the leading features of this case, and from which, if from any thing, you are to infer the guilt of the prisoner at the bar. In the first place there will be no manner of doubt from the evidence, that the deceased Wilkinson came by his death by means of the prisoner; it will be perfectly clear that that fatal event was in consequence of a stab with a knife, given by the prisoner; but when that fact shall have been established, there will still remain for your consideration, under the directions you will receive from the Court, two questions; I say two, because I apprehend that the circumstances of the case (as well as I have been able to consider it) will exclude the consideration of a third; the only question will be, whether the crime shall be that of wilful murder, or some smaller denomination of offence; for I have not been able to discover any circumstances that can exculpate the prisoner from all imputation of crime. Gentlemen, I have not found that the prisoner and the deceased had any acquaintance with each other, I have not discovered any circumstance of malice or resentment which could have been felt by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090123"></xptr>the prisoner towards the deceased; the crime imputed to the prisoner seems to have been the result of a general violence of disposition and a general depravity. Gentlemen, on the day on which this melancholy event took place, on the 16th of July, a person of the name of

            , a witness, was at a publick-house, and sitting in a box, where a woman of the town came in; the prisoner was likewise there, and the woman for some reason that does not appear, told him she was a prisoner and in custody of Benjamin, and asked the prisoner to treat her; I believe he did treat her with some beer, and on that occasion used some very horrid expressions which will be stated; among the rest he said, d - n his eyes (with other vulgar expressions) he would stick the first thief-taker that he should see, or should come near him. What the woman said was not true, she was not in custody, and it was so explained to the prisoner; he continued, however to use several menacing expressions, directed generally to thief-takers, by the appellation of those blood selling rascals, the first of whom that came in his way he would stab; Benjamin was very much alarmed, and left the publick-house, under aprehension his life was in danger from the prisoner. Wilkinson, the deceased, who had no concern in this, came in, and I believe Benjamin informed him of the prisoner's expressions; and the deceased said to him you had much better go home about your business, and not use those sort of expressions; upon which the prisoner transmitted those expressions to Wilkinson, abused him very violently, and threatened he would cut his liver out, at the same time drawing a penknife, the deceased was alarmed at this, and sent for a constable, who came, and he gave him charge of the prisoner; the constable and Wilkinson together seized the prisoner, he resisted very much, and they found it very difficult to secure him; and I observe on the deposition of one of the witnesses it is stated that the deceased struck the prisoner at the bar several blows with a stick, which he had, in order to secure him; it was at this period that the deceased drew from his pocket that knife which he had before shewn, accompanied with the expressions I have stated, and he made a cut at the constable but missed him, and he also attempted to stab Benjamin, but he escaped, and in the instant the prisoner insticted the fatal wound on the deceased; there was a great effusion of blood; the poor man immediately called out he was a dead man, and in about half an hour afterwards he died. Gentlemen, the prisoner can have no apology to make for this offence, so as to exculpate him from all imputation of crime. You have the good fortune to try the prisoner, and he has the good fortune to be tried, under that direction which you will receive from a very learned and a very humane quarter; I am quite sure that every circumstance that can be even strained in favour of life, that can be urged in mitigation of the crime imputed to the prisoner, that can at all soften it down to a crime of a more innocent description than wilful murder, will be attended to. It is unnecessary for me to enlarge on the law upon the subject. It will remain only for me to call to you the witnesses; I shall call all those which I am instructed know any thing that passed on the occasion; and then I am sure the prisoner will receive at your hands, a fair, honest, and merciful consideration of his case; such an one he is entitled to, the laws of his country ask for such an enquiry, and in the result I have no doubt but publick justice will be satisfied.</p>

There was an officer, Alexander M'Call standing in the passage, who was sent for to take him, he was afraid to go near him, he was about two yards from him; when I first went out into the passage, I only saw the back of Wilkinson going out toward Nightingale-lane; he said nothing that I heard; and I heard no quarrel; I had a broom in my hand; the prisoner knew me, and as soon as he saw me he put the knife in his pocket, I believe he shut it; I said to the prisoner when I saw him putting up the knife, what have you done? as soon as I asked him the question,

               <p>I am a waterman by business; on Thursday, the 16th of July, between six and seven, I was walking up Nightingale-lane, and I came just by the corner, the oil shop, about two doors from the King's Arms in East-smithfield, just as I came round the corner the prisoner came out of the King's Arms with an open knife in his hand, and swore damn his bloody eyes if he would not stick the first thief-taker that ever he saw come near him; the knife was open in his hand, and he put it into his pocket and walked to a post, the corner of Nightingale-lane and East-smithfield, then he took his knife out again, and he had a pair of long canvas trowsers on, and he took his knife and cut a bit of the flap of them off; then he held his knife to Wilkinson, who was standing on the foot-path about two yards from him, talking to two gentlemen; the prisoner kept swearing all the time, damn his bloody eyes and limbs he would stick the first thief-taker.</p>
               <p>Had Wilkinson done any thing to him at any time? - Nothing that I saw.</p>
               <p>Did he strike him? - Never in my presence.</p>
               <p>Did he raise his stick in a posture threatening him to strike him? - No; only put the stick in an upright posture, telling him to go away.</p>
               <p>Was the soldier in liquor? - He appeared a little in liquor, but not so very bad.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner make any reply to Wilkinson? - He kept swearing, but I cannot recollect the particular expressions; he was damning and blasting his eyes; Wilkinson desired somebody to fetch Mr. M'Call, for he was afraid of his life; and he would give charge of him; when the man was gone for Mr. M'Call, the prisoner walked round the corner of the court, into the passage that leads to the King's-arms; that is about ten or a dozen yards; he kept muttering bad words to himself; I saw M'Call come in half a minute, and join Wilkinson; and then I saw them go together towards the passage; I did not see what passed in the passage.</p>

               <p>What was Wilkinson? - He was an attendant at the office, I believe, which is facing the King's-arms; the next thing that I saw, was Wilkinson coming from the passage; from that way, with his left hand on his left side; and his right hand upon the left; I said, Mr. Wilkinson, are you stuck? and Wilkinson said, I am a dead man, go and fetch Dr. Davis; he walked home not quite twenty yards; I never saw him afterwards, neither alive nor dead; after I saw Wilkinson,

             called on his recognizance, and not appearing, a subpoena was made out, and an officer of the Court was sent to fetch him.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER M'CALL sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a headborough of Aldgate Parish; I was sent for, near seven, on Thursday, the 16th of July; I went to the corner of Nightingale-court, which is the passage that leads to the King's-arms; Wilkinson told me that a man had drawn a knife upon him twice, and gave me charge of him.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner within sight or hearing at that time, when he gave you charge of him? - No; I did not see him; I do not believe he was; then Wilkinson and me went to take the prisoner; there is only one house between the street and the court.</p>
               <p>When you got into the passage, did you see the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was he doing when you first went into the passage? - Making water.</p>
               <p>What passed between you, when you went in? - Wilkinson said, this is the man I give you charge of, for drawing a knife on me twice; and threatening my life.</p>
               <p>What passed next? - I took out my staff, and told him he was my prisoner, and must go with me; he said he would not; I desired Wilkinson to assist me; Wilkinson laid hold of the prisoner's right arm; and I laid hold of his left arm; we got him along about two yards.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by you got him; do you mean that you took him against his will? - I told him, it is of no consequence, my friend, you must go before a magistrate; and he rushed Wilkinson against the wall with such force, that Wilkinson fell behind him, and lost his hold.</p>
               <p>Was this a very narrow passage? - No, Sir; the part that we were in at this time, was as far as from me to the Jury; I suppose three yards wide. Wilkinson had this stick in his hand by the middle, which is broke; is leather, in imitation of wanyee.</p>
               <p>There is no sword in it? - No; it has never been out of my custody; he held it by the broken part; and he struck him over the back with it.</p>
               <p>Did he strike him more than once? - I believe he might strike him as many times as three, he struck him straight up the back; not across the shouldes.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner do to Wilkinson, at the time he struck him? - He had rushed him against the wall with such force, that he had lost his hold; he jammed Wilkinson against the wall, ready to knock him to pieces; he was a very little man; and the most inoffensive man in the world: then Broad came up, and laid hold of the prisoner by the collar; Wilkinson then got on the side of him again, and laid hold of him; from that spot, he went quietly into the narrow passage, I suppose five yards; when he got into the narrow passage, in which it is as much as two can do to walk on abreast, Broad kept walking backwards, with his hand on his collar; I and Wilkinson held him by the arm; and he fell back; he began to be very obstropulous.</p>
               <p>What did he do or say? - He shoved us; and rushed one way and the other, struggling and trying to get from us; then he made a stop, which appeared to me, to be with intent to throw Broad; Broad is rather bigger than me [the witness was a middle sized man]; we were about in the middle of the passage.</p>
               <p>Court. Then, that is a yard and an half further than the five yards? - Yes; in the act of stopping, he had drawn the knife; I did not see his knife before; nor I did not see him draw it; he had drawn his knife, and made a stab at Broad; and cut through his red cloth breeches; and through the leather lining; when the prisoner saw he had not stabbed Broad, he immediately attempted to stab me; and I jumped back against the door, and avoided the knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090127"></xptr>Did he accompany those attempts to you and Broad, with any expressions at the time? - There was not a word said at the time; as I jumped from him, the way was wider; I quite quitted him; and was three feet from him; and he caught hold of Wilkinson by the collar, and stabbed the knife into him; into his left side, with the other hand; when the knife was in, up as far as his hand would let it go, he gave his hand a twist, and with all the heart-felt satisfaction -</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do not talk of heartfelt satisfaction; do you state facts, and do not make comments upon them? - Well, he did shew all the heart-felt satisfaction; and said, you b - r, I have done you.</p>
               <p>Did he say that, whilst the knife was yet in the body of Wilkinson? - At the instant he gave his hand that turn.</p>
               <p>What happened next? - He

             the knife from the body of Wilkinson; he came towards me; Wilkinson put his hand on his side, and said he was a dead man, fetch Dr. Davis for God's sake! then the prisoner came towards me with his knife in his hand; I went out of the end of the passage, and the prisoner clapped himself against the wall; and seemed very much agitated; he had the knife naked in his hand; I stood at some distance from him a minute, when Mr. Mayne came out; then we both went up; I was afraid before; whilst he stood against the wall, he shut his knife, and put it into the pocket of his trowsers; Mayne said, what have you done, my friend; I pointed to Mayne, to take out the knife from his pocket, which he did: the prisoner said it was done, and it could not be helped.</p>
               <p>As nearly as you can, state his own words? - He said he knew what he had done, and it could not be helped; I went to Wilkinson's; he was sitting on a chair, with his hand on his side, and reaching; I do not suppose he lived an hour.</p>
               <p>Court. Are there any examinations returned? - There are not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Parke. Did you happen to know the prisoner before this? - I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Did he appear when you saw him first, to be in liquor? - I did not observe that he was; I conceive by his conduct, he must be in liquor; I just put my staff on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>When Wilkinson spoke, did he use the stick in any way whatever? - He did not use the stick, till he had rushed him against the wall, and thrown him on his back; I am perfectly sure of that; nothing could be done by either party, that I did not see.</p>
               <p>What time might elapse, after you came up, to the time the wound was given? - I think it was four or five minutes, but hardly so much as five.</p>
               <p>Court. What are you, constable or a headborough? - I am headborough of Aldgate.</p>
               <p>Was there any constable in the passage at that time? - There was not.</p>
               <p>Had you any warrant to apprehend this man? - No; they sent for me to apprehend him, for drawing a knife on this man.</p>
               <p>Had you any warrant from a Justice of Peace to him? - No.</p>
               <p>The Judges, Wilson and Grose, who were on the bench, concurred with Mr. Justice Gould (who tried the Prisoner) in opinion that this was an unlawful arrest and imprisonment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. Gentlemen of the Jury; there is no question whatever, but the prisoner has been the author of this man's death; to be sure, the expressions he has made use of, are horrid and shocking indeed; but we must lay aside every incentive to indignation; we must try this cause with absolute coolness; and consider what the law of the country is; for we must not violate that law, to satisfy our resentments, which may be of infinite consequence; this man retiring into this dark passage, and being there quiet when these people came in; offering to do nothing till they attacked him; the thing being over, it was unwarrantable in these people<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090128"></xptr>to seize this man thus quiet, without having an authority from a justice of peace, he was therefore illegally assaulted and arrested by these men; where a man therefore is deprived of his liberty illegally, and does an act that causes the death of the assailant, in any manner whatever, certainly by law it reduces the offence to manslaughter; that is the case; and in this state of the evidence, the Counsel admitting that they cannot vary the facts, I think you should find this man not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter.</p>

               <p>Guilty of Manslaughter on the Coroner's Inquisition.</p>
               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. Justice GOULD.</p>
               <p>After sentence was passed on the Prisoner for Larceny, Mr. Recorder thus addressed the Prisoner:</p>
               <p>Prisoner at the Bar. You have been guilty of a very atrocious offence in killing your fellow creature; in holy writ we find, that whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed; your crime has been attended with every circumstance of cruelty and barbarity, scarcely to be paralelled in the records of this court or any other court in this kingdom; and yet you have not been condemned to death, to suffer the sentence of the law as a murderer; your conduct has provoked the just indignation of mankind at large; and yet such is the mild administration of the laws of this country, that the Judges have thought fit, under the circumstances of the case, to direct the Jury to spare your life; but that not from any personal consideration respecting you, but because however provoked by your cruel and barbarous treatment of the deceased, the law of this country is not to be stretched one tittle beyond the letter of it. No circumstance that respects your conduct has favoured you on the present occasion to mitigate your crime; the mistake of the officer alone, who should first have obtained a warrant before he arrested you for the breach of the peace, is the only reason that can be assigned why you should not be ordered to almost immediate execution; under such circumstances the Court will inflict the severest punishment they can on you; and I have one observation to make to you, as a man of your description seems to have very little feeling for others, and that is, that notwithstanding the punishment you will receive, if under any circumstances you should be found killing a fellow creature another time, you will be immediately condemned to execution; the sentence of the Court is, that you be</p>

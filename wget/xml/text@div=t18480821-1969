                  </hi>. I am in the service of James William Courtenay, of Lower Eaton-street. On 18th Aug., about half-past six o'clock, I was showing some handkerchiefs to a person in the shop—the prisoner came and redeemed a pledge—it was given her—she left—I missed a white handker<lb></lb>chief—I followed her to another pawnbroker's, and gave information—the shopman gave me the handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is not the one I missed—I then came out, and watched outside—I afterwards went in, and asked the prisoner how she came by the handkerchief—she said, "I brought it from home; it is mine"—I took her back, and afterwards went with her to her house—she said, "You may search"—I did so, and found this white hand<lb></lb>kerchief in her basket—it is Mr. Courtenay's, and was safe two minutes before she came in—I know it by the private mark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. Did not she invite you to search her basket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I should not have done it if she had not pointed it out—there is no mark on the other one, it has been taken off; but here is the pin-hole where it was pinned on—I did not miss it—it was a white silk one that I missed—we had only one handkerchief of this pattern—my master is not here—she dealt with him, and me as well.</p>

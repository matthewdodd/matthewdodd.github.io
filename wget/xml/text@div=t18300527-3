            . I am a Bank clerk. I produce three 10l. notes, Nos. 12,575 and 12,576, which were paid in on the 28th of April, and No. 12,577 paid in on the 30th of April - neither of them were paid to me, but I have marked on them the date they were paid in; it is my business to do that - a person paying in a note invariably writes his name and address on it.</p>

I know these notes; they correspond with the numbers I paid Madame Vestris' servant on the 24th of April; I have a memorandum here, which I took from the book in which I entered the numbers at the time I paid them - I made the extract from the book myself about a fortnight ago. These are the notes I paid Madame Vestris' servant; they correspond in number, date, and amount.</p>

            . I have been examined here before. I lived next door to the prisoner - I knew him before the 9th of November; I have known Seymour ever since Bowfair. On Sunday, the 9th of November, I met the prisoner Bennet, about six o'clock in the evening, in Brick-lane-Seymour was with him, they both met me; Bennet asked me to go and take a walk with him up Whitechapel - I asked where to? and said, I was going to chapel - He said, "never mind," I said, I would go with him. I did not then know what I was going to do; they took me up by Aldgate, and kept walking about from the five lamps towards the watch-house - I did not know what I was going to do. Bennet said, "I will go in, and buy a halfpenny worth of horehound." We were then opposite Mr. Key's shop; he went in, and brought out some horehound; Seymour told Bennet that there were some notes, as he had watched them on Saturday night, and saw them put them in the till, and told him to go in-Bennet said,"Is there? I will go in;" he pulled off Munroe's hat directly, put it on, and went in, and brought out a pocketbook, and gave it to Seymour, who was at the door. I and Munroe were walking backwards and forwards-Munroe had joined us in Whitechapel-Bennet walked on the other side of the way. Seymour told me and Munroe to come on and follow him; he took us to his house in George-street, which is near Wentworth-street. When we got there, we found Bennet there; he and Seymour divided the money out of the pocket-book; there was some bank notes, guineas, and silver, there was a great deal of silver; they gave me some notes. After they had parted the money, Seymour and Munroe threw the pocketbook away by the sugar-baker's, near Seymour's house. Before I left Seymour's house, he took my share away from me; I slept at Seymour's house that night, and went out with him next morning about seven o'clock. - He took me to a hatter's, and bought a hat for each of us,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140015"></xptr>which came to 17s.; he had a 3s. piece in change for a 1l. note. I returned home to Seymour's, and went out again with him to a clothes shop, near Black Lion-yard, and to other places, and laid out part of the money. - (Looks at a pocket-book.)-This is the one, I know it by the reading on it-it is the pocket-book that was thrown away opposite George-street, in Wentworth-street - Bennet, Seymour, and Munroe threw it away.</p>

             FARR re-examined. It is the pocket-book which contained the notes and silver-there was more than 40l. in it. I was present when the prisoner was examined at the Mansion-house; the Lord Mayor asked him what he had to say - He was neither threatened or promised - He denied taking it, and said Duproy took it out - He said that he was one of the party, and received part of the stolen property, but denied taking it. This was after Duproy had charged him with being one of the party.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Messrs. John and Robert Robinson, of Milk-street, Cheapside—on the morning of 15th December, Jacobs and another woman, and a man, came to our warehouse, and asked to look at some velvets—I rang the bell for some one to come and attend to them—there was a knock, which occasioned me to go to the warehouse door—when I came back they proposed to leave, saying they would call again in a quarter of an hour—they afterwards went up into the velvet room—they did not buy anything there—in consequence of something that was said to me by Mr. Robinson I watched them when they went out, and followed them to the corner of Aldermanbury—Jacobs went into Fountain-court—I passed the other woman, and she ran away—I turned into Fountain-court, and there saw the two prisoners by the side of each other—the male prisoner had a bag on his hand, holding it open, and the female prisoner dropped these two pieces from underneath her mantle into the bag, and the bag fell on the pavement—I caught hold of the male prisoner, took the bag from him, and said they were some goods stolen from Mr. Robinson's—he tried to get away, and in doing so tore his coat—he did get away—I followed him, halloing out</p>

                  </hi>. On the morning of the 16th I was standing near Aldermanbury, and heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I saw the male prisoner running away up Aldermanbury, and the last witness pursuing him—a man came past, and knocked him up against a doorway—he was going to run away again, and I laid hold of him, and held him—he tried to get away from me, and another man came to my assistance, and we held him till the constable came up.</p>

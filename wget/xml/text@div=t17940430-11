               <p>Q. Do you know of his having lost any printed callico? - Yes. On the 24th of April he lost somewhere about ten yards, I cannot say exactly, I was serving in the shop, and a neighbour came and told me that a person had took a piece of callico away from the door; I asked him the description of the person; he described her as a person with a red cloak; I pursued her and overtook her in about half a minute, it was the prisoner, and she had a piece of printed callico under her cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen her in the shop? - She was not in the shop, the callico hung at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take on yourself to say that that callico had been hanging at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300015"></xptr>door just before? - I had seen it just before.</p>

It was a strange woman in the street that met me and gave it to me to hold.</p>

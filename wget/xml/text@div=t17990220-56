               <p>Q. Who was in your company? - A. The mistress of the house and another woman.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no other sailor with you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of night did this happen? - A.Between eleven and twelve at night; the door was shut, and some person knocked at the door; the woman asked, who is there; some person answered, it is me, do not you know me; and she opened the door, and called out to me, here comes a press-gang; then four men came in, dressed in sailor's clothes; one of them sat down, and said, he would be half-a-crown to half-a-crown of mine for something to drink; I said, I would be a shilling; I took out a shilling, and gave it to the woman; he put his hand in his pocket, but took out no money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of the two prisoners? - A. The shortest of the two prisoners, Tate, is the man that sat down by me, and offered half-a-crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other prisoner one of the four men that came in? - A. Yes; the woman brought liquor in, and put it down; then I gave the woman another shilling; the liquor was brought in, and I got up to go to the door to go away.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the liquor was drank? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take them to be a press-gang? - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200056"></xptr>No, I did not, because there was no officer with them; I did not like the look of them; the two prisoners followed me to the door, and took hold of me, one of each side, before I could shut the door after me.</p>
               <p>Q.How did they lay hold of you? - A.By the collar, and by the left arm; Irish Jack had hold of me on the right side by the collar; they told me they would take me on board a tender; the other two men followed me, and dragged me down the yard.</p>

               <p>Q. Had the two prisoners still hold of you? - A. Yes, they brought me against a shed, a boarded place; Tate then put his hand in my waistcoat pocket, and took out six or seven shillings, I am sure I had six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it from the pocket that you had taken the shilling to pay for the liquor? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you taken notice of either of the shillings from any thing remarkable? - A. Yes, two of them; there was one with an M on it, scratched with an awl; the other was a crooked shilling, with R W stamped upon it.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you observed these marks upon them before you lost them? - A. Yes, particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. So that from these marks you could have known these shillings again? - A. Yes; Tate then put his hand in my right hand side pocket, and took out a shut knife; Connoway had hold of me at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the other two men that came out any thing to do with it? - A. No, they had not; Tate said, here is a knife, perhaps he may cut our throats with it; Connoway then put his hand to my head, and put me up against the boards, while Tate struck me several times; they went away together.</p>
               <p>Q.What became of the other two men? - A. I did not see them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of them before? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe enough of them to be sure the prisoners are the same persons? - A. I am sure they are the same persons.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this happened did you see either of them? - A. I saw two of them the same night, about a quarter of an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to after they left you? - A. I went back to the house, and from the house I went into the street, and told the watchman that one of them was a tall man, of the name of Irish Jack.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know his name was Irish Jack? - A. I heard him called so in the house; I did not describe the person of the other; I saw the two prisoners again about ten minutes after they left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they when they left you? - A. They were close by the watch-house, the watchman had hold of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you since seen any money that you thought you had lost? - A. Yes, I described to the watchman in the watch-house the mark on the two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body shew you any shillings afterwards? - A. Yes, before the Magistrate, the next day; the next day I saw another of the men, one of the other two close by the place.</p>
               <p>Q. He is not here? - A. Yes, he is.</p>
               <p>Q.What is his name? - A.

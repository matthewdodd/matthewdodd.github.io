I am clerk to my brother in Upper Thames Street—he brings out blotting-pads for advertisements—I know the prisoners as advertisement canvassers—on 31ST August O'Brien brought me this advertisement from Messrs. Holloway—I looked at it and said, "This is not properly signed," but as we were going to press I told him he must bring me an order properly signed in the afternoon, which he did—this is the second order he Drought—he told, me it was a proper order from Messrs. Holloway, and I believed it and paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. commission.</p>

                  </hi>. I publish a penny blotting-pad advertiser—I have known the prisoners three or four months—O'Brien brought me Holloway a advertisement on 31ST August—I authorised my brother to pay him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I suspected its genuineness, and communicated with Messrs. Holloway, and subsequently saw McLean and O'Brien on the subject—I asked O'Brien if he had received the order from McLean; he said he had; I asked McLean if that was so; he said "Yes"—I asked McLean if he had received part of the money—he said he had, which my brother confirmed—O'Brien said a Mr. McClure was there, who had given the order to McLean—I sent him to look for McClure, who never turned up—I asked the prisoners who signed the orders at Holloway's—both said "Davis"—I asked why the order was signed "Duncan"—they said they had made a mistake, it was Duncan—I paid O'Brien a cheque for Lamplough's advertisement for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for Wright's, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for Jones's—he reported them to be <hi rend="italic">bond-fide</hi> advertisements—I produce the orders.</p>

You both came several times about it—I remember your saying McClure was at Greenwich, but I do not remember asking you to wait till I had seen my solicitor—the whole thing was rotten, and after inquiry I paid less than I otherwise should have done.</p>

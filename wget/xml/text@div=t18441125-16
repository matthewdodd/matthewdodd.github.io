                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable</hi>.) On Sunday, the 13th of Oct., I was on duty in High-street, Islington, about half-past one in the morning, and saw the prisoner there and four other persons with him—they were wrest<lb></lb>ling and creating a great disturbance—some of them were sober, but the prisoner was drunk—Gooderham, another constable, was with me—we re<lb></lb>quested the prisoner and the others to go home—after some little time they went down Parsley's-court—I passed that court again some few minutes after—I then heard them threatening how they would serve us if we went down the court, and they were throwing bricks at me at the time—I was by myself at that time—one of them, not the prisoner, came up and threw a brick at me as I stood on the pavement—I instantly secured him, and as I did so the prisoner came up and struck me on the head—my hat fell off in the scuffle—I scuffled with the one I took for throwing the brick, and my hat fell off at that time, and then the prisoner came up and struck me on the left side of my head with a brick, or some hard substance—it appeared the colour of a brick—I saw something in his hand similar to a brick—it cut my head in four places—it bled—the loss of blood was considerable, in fact, I became insensible, and when I became sensible I was in a sitting position against the wall—I found something at my shoulder, and I found that my collar bone was broken—after he struck me the first blow with the brick I caught hold of him by the neck—there was a light about four yards off at a public-house, which is burning all night—that enabled me to see him—this was just inside the court—I am sure he is the same man—I have no doubt of it—after I was struck with the brick I became insensi<lb></lb>ble—I lost all recollection of anything till I found myself out in the street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Islington. I saw Higgins on a 13th of Oct., between in and ten o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing—he had four wounds on his head—they were severe wounds—I thought they were dangerous at the time—the flesh was completely cut through, and the bone exposed—I should say the wounds were incised by a blunt instrument, such as the end of a brick—they were such as I have seen produced from sabre wounds, or the end of a brick—it is very easy to divide the scalp with the edge of a brick—that appeared to me to be the instrument used—they were on the right side on the parietal bone—there was a great discharge of blood—I found the collar bone fractured in two places—that might be done with any heavy instrument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I was very much intoxicated; I had been out and had a good deal of drink; I was going home with one of our young men under my arm; we went down the court; I went home to my lodging; the door was fast, and I could not get in; I knocked three or four times, and could get no answer; I then came down the court again and met the last policeman, who hit me, and knocked me down two or three times; it is a very dark place, and you could not know your own brother if you were to meet him there; I had a tussle with him, because I did not know him, and he broke my head with his staff.</p>

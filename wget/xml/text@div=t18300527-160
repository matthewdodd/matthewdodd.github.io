I had a brother named James; he lived at Deptford in 1805 - he was married in April that year, but I was not present; I saw the prisoner before the 23rd of April, and heard from her and my brother then, that they were about to be married - and from her mother likewise; her mother's name was Savage - she had a second husband; I heard from the prisoner, and my brother likewise, that they were married at Lewisham, in Kent; after I understood they were married, I called on them in a little street down Butt-lane, Deptford - that was about the 12th of May following; I saw them in their own room, and in bed together - that was when my brother told me he was married; I said as he had made his bed so he must lie on it, and not to trouble me as he had done - I breakfasted with them; I remember their living together about six months, but I believe they were longer together - they passed as man and wife; I saw my brother in March, 1820 - this signature in the register is his writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What way of life are you in? A. A sawyer; I was called on in April last to give information, and I went to Mr. Waite's, the attorney, to give information - I have not received any money nor any thing else, nor the promise of any thing but what the county allow; I lived at the corner of Great Eastcheap and Crooked-lane in 1805, and my mother lived at Chiselhurst - it was about five o'clock on the 12th of May, 1805, that I saw my brother in bed with the prisoner; I will swear it was in May - I cannot exactly say the day; about six months after his marriage was the last time I saw my brother, till March, 1820 - I never stated he was dead in the interim; I never got any thing by representing him as dead - I heard upon casualty that he was dead, but never heard he was drowned; I have never seen him since 1820 - he may be dead; I did not know

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Mr. Nesbit? A. No; I never told any one I had not seen my son since 1805, because I have seen him later, and have had letters from him; I never told Mr. Wood so - I never told Mr. Neshit my son was drowned at sea twenty-two years ago.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you yourself married since? A. Yes, in 1819, at Islington; the person I married died in 1827; I do not recollect seeing the prisoner between 1819 and 1827 - I left her in 1814; I heard she had had a child - the child was with her; I did not appoint any meeting with her after 1819 - I called on her occasionally in Buckingham-street; I gave her money, but swear I did not receive any from her - she was keeping a bad house there I believe; I believe I stopped two days once, and slept with her, but this was not while my wife was alive, it was in 1828; I cannot tell where she lived in 1826 or 1827, or when she began to live in Buckingham-street - I believe it was in 1828.</p>
               <p>Q. From 1814 to 1828 had you not been in correspondence with her, in connexion with her, and living with her? A. It might have been 1815 when I returned from sea - I am not certain; I did live with her for a fortnight in Apollo-court, Fleet-street - it is the same sort of house as the other; I have only lived with her there and a few nights in Buckingham-street - my mother has had some property left her, but I have not; I live on my half-pay - the prisoner took me to the Consistory Court in 1828, and recovered 40l. for a maintenance; I had paid part of it, and then I found out this - I was written to by a gentleman named Rowen, who is here.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Had you any connexion with the prisoner from which you could possibly infer the child was your's? A. No; I had left her three or four years before the child was born - when I first saw it, it was six or seven years old.</p>

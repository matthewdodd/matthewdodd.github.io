               <p>HENRY D'ESTERRE, Esq. I live at Limerick, in Ireland. In June, I was at Long's hotel, Bond-street. On the 28th, about half past nine at night, I was in the <placeName id="t18200628-55-crimeloc305">Strand, near Round-court</placeName>

Duncan put his hand on him, but he passed him, and kept close to him; he called stop thief himself, as many people got about him; I said No, that is the thief; he had not run twenty yards before he was stopped. I never lost sight of him, he was surrounded by a number of people, I saw the watch picked up at his feet, the seals were taken off, they were produced at the watch-house, I did not actually see the watch picked up, but I saw Duncan's hand rise with it.</p>

            . I am a broker. I was sitting at my door, at the corner of Round-court, and heard the prosecutor cry Stop thief! - I turned, saw a man running towards me, and attempted to stop him, but he cried Stop thief also, and I let him pass. The prosecutor said</p>
               <p>"Stop him! the villain has got my watch. He had not gone above four or five steps before he was secured by some women, and I laid hold of him again. A crowd came round, and I with many more, attempted to search him. In the act of searching him I felt the watch in a hand - it was as close to him as possible, and might have been his hand, but I cannot say, there was such confusion. I got fast hold of it, and on going to the watch-house a neighbour, Mr. Haynes, said, he had got the seals.</p>

            . I live in Round-court. I heard the cry of Stop thief! went up and saw the prisoner running, and laid hold of one of them - I cannot say it was the prisoner, it was like him. A number of persons came round and laid hold of him. As soon as their arms were extended to lay hold of him, I put my arm under theirs, and saw the seals hanging down his left thigh - I seized them, and endeavoured to draw them, he made a bob, the ribbon broke, and I got the seals.</p>

            . I belong to the Grenadier Guards. I was sitting at a door in New Round-court, where I am quartered, and saw the prisoner run up the court - I am certain it was him; he was pursued by some men. One made a catch at him; he cried out Stop thief! and he let<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280028"></xptr>him go. The prosecutor said,</p>
               <p>"That is the thief!" I caught him, and saw the seals hanging from his trowsers; some one snatched at them and they came off. I held him till he was taken to the watch-house.</p>

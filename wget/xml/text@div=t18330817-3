About four o'clock on the morning of Sunday, the 23rd of June, I was awoke by the ringing of the house bell; I got out of bed, opened the window and looked out, and saw the police-sergeant, who told me the house was broken open; I saw the prisoner in custody of the policeman - I had fastened the shutters the night before with a bar outside, and a bolt goes through each end of the bar, and screws - I fastened it that night about half-past eleven o'clock, and the door was locked and bolted - the glass was quite whole when I went to bed - I found the shutters open and one square of glass broken; a person could reach things out of the window from the hole - they laid about an inch and a half from the window; four pieces of lawn stood there, each piece measuring six yards and a half; I missed the whole four pieces - I saw two of them in the custody of the police-sergeant; they had my private mark on them - I am certain of them - they were safe when I went to bed at night - I did not hear the prisoner say any thing - I think I had seen him on the Saturday evening before, looking in at the window at the other end, about seven o'clock, it was quite light - a parcel of handkerchiefs hung<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183308170006"></xptr>inside the window and he was looking at them; I believe him to be the man - the lawn was worth 40s. altogether.</p>

            . I am a police-sergeant. I was in Rose-street, Brick-lane, about forty yards from this house, about a quarter after four o'clock in the morning of Sunday, the 23rd of June, I heard a noise like something falling very heavy on the pavement, and immediately a smash of glass - I instantly ran into Brick-lane, and saw three men standing in front of the prosecutor's shop; the prisoner was one of them - One of them was in the act of pulling a piece of lawn out of the prosecutor's window - I cannot say whether that was the prisoner; they were all three close together - two shutters were down, and a square of glass broken out completely - the moment they caught sight of me, they each drew a piece of linen from under their coats, and threw it into the road; I am certain each of them had a piece - they ran off; I pursued them, calling Stop thief! up Brick-lane into Wellington-street, across Wood-street into King-square, and there they separated, and ran different ways - I pursued the prisoner across Goswell-road, and never lost sight of him till he was stopped by Gray, the policeman - I am sure I saw him throw away one piece of lawn - I came back with him to the prosecutor's house, and rang the bell, the prosecutor looked out of window; I told him he had been robbed, and asked him to examine what he had lost - he went with us to the station-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your attention was called by the noise? A. Yes - I looked as attentively as I could; I could not tell which it was that put his hand in at the window, they were so close together - there were three pieces of lawn thrown away, and it appeared to me that each threw away one piece; but I will not swear it positively, in the hurry of the moment - I did not lose sight of the prisoner for an instant, I was within a few yards of him at first, and I kept up with him all the way; I did not lose sight of him when he turned the corner - I only saw three men running - I did not see a piece of lawn in the hands of a carman - I do not recollect seeing any woman whatever; I named to the magistrate something about a piece being found afterwards in the hands of a woman; that was the piece that was found in the hands of a waggoner; I did not see the waggoner - I picked up two pieces of lawn, another person picked up one - I found the fourth after the prisoner was committed, in possession of a person in Whitecross-street, a person who lives there, he is not here - this piece of lawn was delivered to me by a young woman at her father's house, it was not found till afterwards - I ran after the prisoner about three hundred yards - I did not see anybody on the spot, there was nobody in my sight all the way I pursued - I saw two pieces of lawn thrown away and three men run away - I found nothing on the prisoner when he was taken - I produce the two pieces I saw thrown away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prisoner say anything at the station-house? A. He said, he was running after the other two men.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I was on duty on the 23rd of June, in Goswell-road, about a quarter after four o'clock in the morning - I heard a cry of Stop thief, and saw the prisoner run across Goswell-road, about ten yards before me, and the sergeant running after him, crying, Stop thief; as soon as the sergeant saw me he gave a signal to pursue; I pursued him up Ashby-street to Northampton-square, and never lost sight of him - I caught hold of him and told him to go with me - he d - d the thief and said he was gone the other way; and said, that he (the prisoner) was out of breath, but he did not mind that, he would run at any time until his legs dropped from his body to stop a thief - I said that would not do for me, and I took him to the sergeant, and then to the prosecutor's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many men did you observe running? A. Only the sergeant and the prisoner - I saw nobody running before that - I did not see the lawn thrown away - the sergeant had two pieces as he ran.</p>

            . I am a secret springer in the watch trade - between four and half-past four o'clock I was awoke by the cry of Stop thief - I live in Wellington-street - I got up, opened my window and looked out, and saw two men running - I did not follow them; one had a black coat on, and the other a green one; it was light enough to see that - I continued at the window a little time, and something took my attention at the left hand, and I saw a roll lying in the kennel - I put on my clothes, and went down and took it up, it was a piece of lawn - I took it home, I have it here, it has never been out of my possession.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far do you live from the prosecutor's house, in the same street? A. No; round the corner, not above thirty or forty yards from the house.</p>
               <p>JOHN GOODINGE. This has my private mark on it; I swear it is mine - I had not sold it, and the two pieces have my mark on them likewise; they were all in my shop the night before - I have the piece the woman found at home.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, Thomas Munn, a farmer, at Kempsey. On the 7th of Sept. I saw a brown gelding of my father's in a field at Kemp<lb></lb>sey—it was missed the next morning at five o'clock—in consequence of some information, I came to town after it—on the 16th of Sept. I went to Mr. Young's, at Paddington—I did not see the horse there—the policeman showed it to me at the Red Lion—the prisoner is a native of Kempsey—I saw the prisoner, and gave him into custody—I had no conversation with him at all about it—I asked him how he came by the horse—he said he bought it at Banbury—I asked him of whom—he said he did not know.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tripe-dresser, and live in Paddington-street. I am a Kempsey man—I know the prisoner—on the 12th of Sept I had some communication from Mr. Munn, at Kempsey, about a horse—on the 14th of Sept. I saw the prisoner at my door—he had a hone and cart with him—he told me he had got that horse for sale, and wanted me to buy it, or if I did not want one myself, could I recommend him a customer, as he could warrant the horse sound and quiet—I wrote to Mr. Munn about it—I refused to buy the horse, but told him it was most likely I should find him a customer in the course of a few days—I knew where he lived, and let him go away—on the Monday the prosecutor came—as we were going over the bridge in the Har<lb></lb>row-road we met the prisoner with the saddle and bridle, and he was riding the horse—I had before taken Mr. Loder, a neighbour, down, with a view of buying the horse—we tried it in harness, and when we got down to the Red Lion Mr. Munn and the officer came, and we gave the prisoner in charge—he said he had bought the horse on Saturday week, at Banbury, of a farmer that bred him, and he had been in no dealer's hands beside his—he was taken into custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Was anything particular said by you or Atkins to encourage her to tell what became of the money or whether she had taken it. - A. Nothing more than I said I was very glad to find her where I did; I left her with the officer till I fetched a coach; she wanted to know what we wanted to do with her; she said that she had robbed nobody, we might hang her if we pleased, that was in the room she said that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge her with any robbery. - A. Yes, she was examined by the officer, he searched her pocket, I told her that she had robbed a gentleman; then she said that she had robbed nobody, we might hang her if we pleased, that was in the presence of the officer when we were searching her in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any more. - A. Not in my presence, I went out for the coach, she was searched while I was there; there were nine one pound bank notes; there were three pounds in change, half guineas, seven shilling pieces and silver. There were various other articles in a bundle that she had with her, and there was a little pocket book.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not Mr. Bordman's. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any red pocket book about her. A. No, not on her person; there were various other articles found about her, and two duplicates.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take her in custody. - A. Yes. When I went to the top of the stairs and asked the woman that I saw in the room for the prisoner, she pretended not to know any such person; I saw the prisoner sitting near the door, and when I mentioned the name of Mrs. Clements, I saw her moving herself as if to hide herself behind the door. Mr. Harrison went into the room first, and said here she is; I went in and laid hold of her arm; I said I am an officer, I shall take you in custody on suspicion of robbing a gentleman at your master's house, and I told her I should search her, which I did, and in her right-hand pocket, I found in a black pocket book, nine one pound notes; and in her left hand pocket I found three half guineas, two seven shillings pieces, and fourteen shillings and sixpence. I found in her pocket, a silver thimble, and a new gold ring, and in her bundle, I found a new cloak, new stockings, and some new ribbons. I asked her how she came by that money, she said her husband had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290033"></xptr>sent it her.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Mr. Harrison) When she hired herself to you did she say that she was married or single. - A. She was married, but he died before she came, after she was hired; her daughter lives at our place now, she is bar maid.</p>
               <p>Atkins. I told her I did not believe it, I believed that she had taken the gentleman's pocket book and money, she burst out crying, and said, hang me if you please, I have robbed nobody, I have picked it up in the gentleman's room, all except two pound, which my husband sent me; she cried very much and said she would not go when Mr. Harrison was gone after the coach, he arrived and we went in the coach; when were we in the coach I asked her what she had done with the pocket book, she said, in the coach, in the presence of Mr. Harrison, that she found it on the top of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. The pocket book. - A. No, the notes; she said she found all the notes, except two pounds, at the top of the stairs, she repeated it several times going to the office; when I went to Mr. Harrison's Mr. Harrison had got the pocket book, which was found on the leads under the window where this woman slept, there is a person here to speak to that. I produce the pocket book, I had it of Mrs. Harrison, she is not here; the boy is here who took it off the leads.</p>

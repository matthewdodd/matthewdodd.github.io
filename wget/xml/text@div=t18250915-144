On the evening of the 25th of August, I saw the prisoner in the shop, between seven and eight o'clock. I was called out just before eight, and stayed till half-past ten. I cannot say whether he was in the shop when I went out. The bacon was not missed till about half-past ten next morning. Ann Watkins sent for me, and gave me my bacon, cut in two pieces. I am certain it was mine.</p>

            . I live in Russell-place. The prisoner brought a basket for me to take care of for a day or two - she said it was a parcel she was going to send into the country to her friends - he husband and she had been quarrelling, and he had pressed her to do it - this was on the Friday, and the parcel was with me till the Sunday morning - I then heard of the loss, and got Mr. Goddart to see it.</p>

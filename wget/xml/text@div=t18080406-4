I went out between five and six in the evening, I locked the door of the area and likewise the area gate, and took the key with me; when I went out it was dark and rainy; I returned home about eight o'clock, I found the area gate remained as before, I found the area door unlocked, and I found the street door open; the watchman had been previously put in to take care of the house.</p>


               <p>Q. When you searched the house did you miss any of the goods. - A. I went up stairs, I missed two beds, two bolsters, two pillows, six blankets, three counterpanes, two white and one coloured.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the two beds. - A. I dare say I could not buy them for fifteen pounds; the counterpanes are worth three guineas; one was quite new, it never had been on the bed nor wetted.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 24th of October last were you near her house in the evening. - A. I was going down the street; passing her house towards Russel square (it was about half past six in the evening), I saw two men coming out of her street door, with large bundles on their backs, they appeared white, as if they had counterpanes over them; each man had a large bundle; one man was a taller man than the other; I think the tallest man came out first; Bradey was the shortest man. They went up King street, toward Holborn; I passed the short man, he throwed the bed down in King street, I passed him; the tallest man passed on; I pursued him, he was about two hundred yards before me, he was going as I conceived towards Holborn; I went down King street, the way I thought he went, however I lost him. I returned to the house No. 39, and saw the door open.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of looking at the tall man, so as to know his person. - A. I did not look at his person; from what I saw of him I believe he is much about the same size as the tall man.</p>

No, I stand five foot nine, and the man Humphries was near as tall as me; when I saw the man at Bow street I looked hard at him, I thought it could not be the man Humphries.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if he is the man you think he is strangely altered. - A. Yes, he is strangely altered; I should pass him a dozen times in the street and not notice him.</p>

I did, I saw a boy coming out with a bundle wrapped up in a shirt; I stopped him and took him into the parlour where he had come from; Bradey was in that parlour he was getting out of bed. I examined the bundle, I found it contained a crow and three double Skeleton keys.</p>

               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called no witnesses to his character.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon the evidence of Mrs. Kindsey there can be no doubt but what a burglary was committed in her house by some persons after she had left it locked, by stealing in it two feather beds and other articles; you find that she proves most distinctly that she locked up the house between five and six, when she returned between seven and eight she found it broken open. The question for you is whether you are satisfied the prisoner was or was not, the other man that was concerned in this burglary.</p>

I am an inmate of St. Saviour's Union—Daniel Dorman was also an inmate—he was seventy-one years old—I am sixty-three—on the 11th May, about 3 o'clock, we were both pulling a truck along the Blackfriars Road—he was on one side of the handle and I on the other—going towards the Surrey Theatre—we were on the nearside—about 8 or 10 feet from the footway with one wheel on the tramway—the prisoner was going in the direction of Blackfriars Bridge, in the opposite direction to me—he was behind a bus, and his off wheel caught my off "wheel, which turned the truck round and Dorman fell partly underneath the truck and the wheel of the van which went over his leg—the truck struck me in the back—prisoner tried to get between the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> and the truck, and that is how the accident occurred—I did hear the prisoner call out.</p>

                  </hi>.—I am a labourer, living at Orange Street and am a stranger to all parties—on this day, about 2.45 o'clock, I was walking up the Black-friars Road, towards the Surrey Theatre—I saw the old men pulling a truck towards the theatre—about 8 or 9 feet from the kerb—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner coming with a timber carriage loaded, behind an omnibus going to<lb></lb>wards Blackfriars Bridge—the omnibus was about 6 feet away from the truck—the bus was not in a line with the truck—in my opinion, there was not room for the prisoner, if he tried to get between the bus and the truck there was only one horse to the van—he was going at the rate of four or five miles an hour—I did not hear him call out to the old men—his fore wheel caught the wheel of the truck, which sent the old man under the prisoner's hind wheel, and it went over his leg—I picked <hi rend="italic">him</hi> up and took him to Dr. Smith's—the prisoner drove on fully 30 yards—he might have stopped—he was told he had run over the man, he said "Very well, I will see all righted."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner's cart was heavily loaded with timber—he was sitting on the top of the timber, something like 10 feet from the ground—he might have run against the houses and not have known it—when he was told he said he was not aware that he had run over anybody—he had been drinking, he was not sober—the old men went along straight enough—the truck was meeting the omnibus—the omnibus did not slacken its pace—it was going slowly—I should think he could see the truck—three or four persons assisted me to take the old man to the doctor's—the prisoner was staggering about outside the doctor's shop—he was tipsy—he was excited—the Coroner's Jury returned a verdict of accidental death.</p>

I am an wholesale frame maker in Blackfriars Road—I saw the accident happen opposite my door—the old men were going towards the obelisk, partly on the tramway and partly on the stones—the prisoner was coming in an opposite direction—I saw him 50 or 60 yards off—he pulled from the near side of the road and passed between the omnibus and the truck—the omnibus was going the same way as the truck—I think there</p>

I have no doubt of that, by the way he went on—he jumped down and begun to abuse the gentleman who had stopped him.</p>

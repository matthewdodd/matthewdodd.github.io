                  </hi>. I am single, and live at Stratford, with my parents. I have known the prisoner about five years—he was in the habit of visiting me at my parents' house—we kept company—he came there on 30th Oct.—there was a silver watch on the table—he was with me about half an hour—, I did not miss the watch till next morning—I was in a passion about it, as the prisoner and I had not been so friendly as usual, and I flew to the police-station, not thinking what it would come to, and I gave information against him—I took the policeman to look for him, and we found him coming out of the Pavilion—I accused him of having taken my watch, and he said he had not taken it at first, but he afterwards owned to the policeman and to me that he had taken it, and I gave him in charge, not knowing what I was doing—he bad had the watch before; be took it when he thought proper, and brought it back—if he had asked me for the watch that night I would have let him have it, or anything he had asked for—I beg you will have mercy on him.</p>

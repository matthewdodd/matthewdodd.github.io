                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant H</hi> 4.) I went to a marine store-shop in Dock-street, Whitechapel, on the 15th of February—I found the prisoner there, and this copper on the floor—I asked who it belonged to, and the prisoner claimed it—I asked where he got it—he refused to tell me—he said the copper was there, and I might have that if I would let him go—I asked him to carry it to the station-house—he said he would not, and I took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Webb, of Clerkenwell—they are builders, and have some work to do at the Commercial Railway. I had charge of a house in George-yard, St. Georges-in-the-East—I had set the prisoner to work there—on Friday, the 15th of February, I saw the copper fixed in that house, and the prisoner was there at work—I saw him at half-past five o'clock at my house, when he came there to book the time—this is the same copper—one man could carry it.</p>

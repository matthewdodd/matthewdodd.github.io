The things mentioned in the indictment were received by me to be sent by the waggon, on the 24th of February. They were in five parcels; some were to go to Chinner, and some to Thame in Oxfordshire. The waggon was loaded over night. I examined it in the morning, and found one of the lines had been cut; I fastened it again, but did not examine whether any thing was taken out. I did not suspect any thing. When the prisoners were taken up I was called upon. When I saw them I knew them both; they used to come to our yard.</p>

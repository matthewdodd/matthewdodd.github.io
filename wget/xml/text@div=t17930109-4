I was alarmed a little, it was a star light night, I rather apprehended that it was the person the prisoner called out to and said, he was hobbled to; I thought it was best to keep him in custody, and the man came nearer to me and he addressed me exactly in these words, says he, what is the matter? sir, says I, there is a boy here that I have found with a little matter about him; says he, there is another over the ditch, do you know what is lost, and he clapped the gun on the ditch, and he said, if you stir a foot I will shoot you; it is the big one,

            Did you pursue the same road after you took him, that he was going? - I did, I was not in the least apprehensive of meeting with any other; I intended to have gone as far as the public house and to have got the people belonging to the public house to detain him, while I went back to Pentonville, only I was deprived of that opportunity by the circumstance that interfered.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw nobody near him when you took him? - No, I did not.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live opposite to Mr. Burden; I looked over at six o'clock and I saw a light in the room, and was surprised, and I saw three persons in the room, I did not know who they were, nor what they were doing; I did not see them come out; this was before the alarm.</p>
               <p>LEMON CASEBY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable; I produce a tea chest, a watch case, and a blanket that was brought to the public office Hatton-garden, about seven o'clock in the evening of the 22d of December; Emmett brought them to me and some other things. (Deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Mr Burden. How was your sashes fastened? - By a spring fastening, the sash was forced up, and by that means the spring is not so good as it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Martin. I works with my father preparing rushes for the tallow chandlers, and I had been finishing some work that day, and on the night I was going up to Mr. Springall's a tallow chandler at Islington, two men coming along they said, get out of the way, they chucked this bundle over the bank and they ran away, and I got over to look at it, and two men came up, one with the gun, and they asked me what I did there? I said, nothing; they said, there is a man just now that has been knocked down and robbed, and they laid hold of me, and that gentleman came along, and the two men said, I must go, and they let me loose in the mob, and I stood in among them; I am really as innocent of it as the child unborn; the two men that took me into custody is not here, they let me go, they said, they would have nothing to do with it; I do not know who they are, I never saw them before in my life; I was loose among the mob above ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Rowe. I was coming from Islington leading a drove of sheep, coming across the fields I saw a man with a four legged table on his head, I immediately followed him and gets over into the field, and he makes pretence to buckle his shoe and left the watch case on the ground, when I came up close to him says he, here is something for you; says I, I don't want it, and I turned about and picked it up and was going along and that man came over to me.</p>
               <p>Court to Caseby. Did you know either of these men before? - I knew Rowe but I did not know Martin.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Martin called one witness to his character.</p>

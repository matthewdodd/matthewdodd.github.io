                  </hi>. I am a barber, of Three Colt Lane, Bethnal Green—I locked up my house quite safely about 12 p.m. on 2nd of April—I was aroused about 3 o'clock the following morning by the police—when I got up I missed the looking-glass and two pictures and frames (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), also two books—I afterwards identified them at the police-court—I found the shop-door prised open—the street-door was also open—the goods are worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

About 2.30 a.m. on 3rd April I was walking in Bartholomew Place, Bethnal Green—I saw three men coming towards me—the prisoner was one—he was carrying this looking-glass and pictures—I said "What have you got?"—he said "All right, sir, we ate moving from 184, Bethnal Green "Road," and that they belonged to him—I said "Where are you going to live?"—he said "In Commercial Street"—I said "What makes you so late moving?"—he said "I stopped to have a parting glass with the people in the other part of the house"—I walked with them to the next lamp, and looked at their faces—I said "You had better come along with me to 184, and see if it is all right"—one of them disappeared—I caught hold of the prisoner and the other, and we went towards Bethnal Green Road—suddenly the other man kicked me in the leg, and said "Shoot"—the prisoner then threw the pictures and glass on to my forehead and cut it, also breaking the glass in the picture-frame—I threw the prisoner down—he struck me about the body when he was down—I drew my rattle, hit the prisoner with it, and then sprang it—the other man ran away—a constable came up, and he carried the property to the station—I took the prisoner—on the way to the station he struck me on the eye, and I had great difficulty in getting him there—I then went to Three Colt Lane and examined the shop-door—the box of the. lock had been prised—the shop-door opens into the passage.</p>

I left it with my wife when I went out the night before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How many doors are there to your house? - A. Three doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the last person up in the house? - A. No, my wife came to bed after me; very soon after.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not alarmed till six o'clock in the morning, except by this cat's story? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the 4th of April, was not it? - A. When I went to bed, it was the 4th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it light? - A. I suppose, about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. It is impossible to say then, whether it was broke open in the night, or after day-light? - A. I cannot say, upon my oath.</p>

               <p>Q. The Bank note you trusted with your wife after ten o'clock at night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What she did with it, you know nothing, but from herself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. She is not here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did there appear to be the marks of the feet of more than one person? - A. Yes, two or three; it appeared to me, that in coming down the cellar they had slipped some little way.(Mr. Raine desired the prosecutor to send for his wife).</p>

               <p>Court. (To Levi). Should you know it if you saw it? - A. Yes; I had it two months in my possession, and was going to change it several times for necessaries, it has got a great deal of writing at the back of it, but I can neither read nor write.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Is that it? - A. I believe that is it, without Mr. Griffiths has changed it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Looking at that note, you can take upon yourself to say that is the note he had from you? - A. Yes; he took it out of my drawer, with twenty-six guineas, I gave him the key.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. And that note you had from Hutchinson? - A. Yes; two months before he was in custody, we were going to set up a shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. (To Griffiths). I believe you apprehended the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes; on Saturday, May the 7th, in company with some more of the officers, Smith, Nowlan, and some others; I went to Hutchinson's house, No. 2, Hollis-street, Clare-market; when I came there, the house was shut up about seven o'clock in the morning; I saw a string in the middle of the door, I pulled it, and the door opened; I went up stairs, and up one pair of stairs, in the back room, Hutchinson and his wife, or his girl, were a-bed; I went into the back room, and desired him to get up, he got up, and in searching the place, I found between the bed cloath, this horse-pistol, and in a little trunk, close by the side of the window, this pocket pistol; two iron crows in the front room up one pair of stairs, rolled up in a woman's gown upon a chair; and in a table drawer in Hutchinson's front room, I found all these picklock keys, and at the same time, a box of phosphorus matches, and a box of gunpowder.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to those keys, did you try any of those keys with Mr. Lovell's locks? - A. Yes; that key with the string to it unlocks Mr. Lovell's cellar door, a slap that opens into Butcher-row; Brown was taken by my fellow officers, in the same house, up two pair of stairs, Smith and Nowlan; and when we took them away. I took the young woman's word for appearing before the magistrate at twelve o'clock, but she did not come; about a week or nine days after that, I had a search warrant against the house for this Bank note, and I understood she had moved from there, the house was shut up through some further information; I found she lived in Shoe-lane; I went there and searched her place, and in the drawer of a looking glass was this 10l. Bank note, and twenty-six guineas in gold.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had got the 10l. note, did you at any time show it to Hutchinson? - A. Hutchinson at the office declared it to be his.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was not that taken down in writing? - A. I cannot say whether it was or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to state, that no examinations were taken down of the prisoner at all before the Magistrates? - A. I cannot say whether it was or not, I was in and out.</p>
               <p>Q. But will you swear no examination was taken down in writing by the Magistrates at all? - A. I believe there was some, I cannot be positive, but I think there was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. What day was this? - A. I cannot say, he said it was his note.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Levi). Q. Who lived in this house besides you and the prisoner Hutchinson? - A. A lodger.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that lodger? - A. Brown and another man lived in the garret.</p>
               <p>Q. Who let those lodgings? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your house, or Hutchinson's? - A. My house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Brown say, or do any thing? - A. Not to my knowledge; he sat on the chair, and saw me carry the skins in the street to the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing? - A. Not the least that I can remember; then Estwick came home with me, I told them I had but ten guineas, if they would call to-morrow, I would give them the rest; the next day, Estwick called in again, and I gave him ten guineas more, that was on Sunday; the next day, Hutchinson and Brown came, and Estwick and I gave them sixteen guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you delivered those skins into the possession of the officers; to whom did you give them? - A. I spoke to Mr. Thompson at Whitechapel Office, and told him I had got the skins, and then I took Thompson and Smith, the Officers, with me, and put the skins into a coach.</p>

            -examined Mr. Knapp. Q. Pray let us know a little how you get your livelihood? - A. I keep a sale shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been in this Court? - A. Always upon honourable term, I can prove it.</p>
               <p>Q. Always as an evidence for the Crown perhaps? - A. I get very little for my evidence, I never require any thing, I do it for the public good, because I might have brought half a dozen skins, instead of the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been in this Court? - A. Twice before, and that was to deliver up 1000l. worth of property.</p>
               <p>Q. This thirty-six guineas was a fair price, was it not, for that quantity of skins, Mr. Honesty? - A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to buy them for thirty-six guineas, you who stand forward for the public good, when you know it is not a fair price? - A. I did it in hopes to bring forward 1000l. worth of property that Estwick was concerned in, to discover them for the good of the public, without see or reward.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before, for the good of the public, you informed Mr. Thompson of it? - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220091"></xptr>I had not seen the prisoner, during that time, that was three weeks, within a day or two.</p>
               <p>Q. So then the public good had the go-by for three weeks; you did not inform of it during that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you give any information at all, till you were charged with stealing some boots belonging to a gentleman at the other end of the town? - A. I did not know where they were.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Answer the question, it is a plain one, did you give any information of those skins, till yourself was taken up for stealing some boots? - A. I was taken up about those boots, and I proved them to be honest boots, I have got them at home.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you give any information of those skins till yourself was taken up for stealing some boots? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Then you did not give information for the public good, till three weeks afterwards? - A. No, not for stealing a pair of boots; I had them hanging at my window, so that they could not have been stole, I may have had others, not knowing them to be stole.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes, you may have others in your honourable shop; do you know any thing about any waistcoats? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of any charge against you of having stole some waistcoats? - A. No; I denied that, there were no waitscoats.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was not that charge made upon you, that you had some waistcoats in your shop? - A. No; I had not</p>
               <p>Q. No certainly not, and with all this public good but was not somebody weeked enough to charge you with having some stolen waistcoats? - A. No; no such charge that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a charge made against you, respecting your having some waistcoats, the property on a Poland Jew? - A. I denied that.</p>
               <p>Q. But did not they make the charge against you? - A. Any body may choose to say that.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was not there a charge of that sort against you? - A. No; there was no Polish Jew charged me with taking waistcoats.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Nor a laced coat? - A. No; not that I had taken.</p>
               <p>Q. But found in your possession? - A. No; a Polander had a coat, but he had not it of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever that coat in your possession? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Never in your life? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was this charge against the Polander; was he charged with having stolen a coat? - A. I don't know; there might have been such a thing, but I know of no coat.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What Polander are you talking of that might have a coat? - A. No one man in particular.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not give any information of this till you were in custody yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Durham? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A watchman you know? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his being tried at Clerkenwall? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You were a witness against him, were not you? - A. No, to be sure I was not; that watchman was taken up concerning the silk.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave evidence upon that occasion? - A. Not against the watchman; my heart alive, that man was taken up because he did not do his duty; what do you mean by abusing me, I did it for the good of the public.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell that watchman to keep out of the way? - A. It was my honesty to take every thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Brown asleep, drunk? - A. He was rather intoxicated, and laid upon the chair, when I paid the money to Estwick.</p>
               <p>Q. The two other times you had been at Hutchinson's lodgings Brown was not there? - A. When I went Brown was not there; and when they came the next day for ten guineas, he was not with them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. (To Lovell.) Q. Look at those skins? - A. These are black Spanish, made from goat's skins, they have my mark upon them, some of them by this lad, and some of them by myself; these are all of them mine, though they are not all marked; it is the custom of our business not to mark every skin, but one in a dozen, the outside one; I know them from their being of the same manufactory.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of those that have your mark? - A. I suppose it to be about fifteen or sixteen pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. (To Griffths.) Shew Lovell the note.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. (Looks at it.) I verily believe it to be the same that I left in the pocket-book that I gave my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. What enables you to speak to it? - A. From some scribling on the back; I did not take an account of the number.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that foribbling the same as was contained upon the note in your pocket-book? - A. I verily believe it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe, before the Magistrate, you were not certain of the note? - A. I believe it to be the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you certain of it before the Magistrate? - A. I did not swear to it, nor will I now, if it was an hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. As to these skins. I need not ask you if thirty-six guineas as a fair price? - A. If I had bought them, I should not have thought so.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220092"></xptr>Mr. Knapp. It is only such honest men as Mr Nathan that would think so.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who had you received the note from? - A. From a man coming into the shop; I don't know who he was.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you make that scribbling upon the note yourself? - A. It was so when I received it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Did you lose any money? - A. I lost the till out of the shop with, as near as I can guess, about five pounds.</p>
               <p>Hutchinson's defence. I know nothing at all of this; any other person in custody Mr. Nathan might have said the same of; that note I had two months before I was taken into custody, I had it from Bristol; and have had witnesses all last week to prove it, but they are now gone.</p>
               <p>Brown's defence. I was a lodger in Hutchinson's house, I never saw any of the property there; I know nothing about it.</p>

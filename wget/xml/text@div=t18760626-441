                  </hi>. I am a sorter in the inland branch of the Post-office, and have been in that employ five years—the prisoner was a junior sorter in the newspaper branch—on the morning of the 21st June I was on duty at the Falmouth road sorting table—the next table to that is the North Devon, and the two tables are divided by a—wire partition—the table in front of me was about 5 feet square—about 7.55 a.m. the prisoner came to me for me to repay him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which I had borrowed of him on Friday—I paid him and he sat on the rope and took up a handful of letters, looked at them, and put them down—we had some discussion about a cricket match, and I said that I could not talk to him as I had a great deal of work to do—I then saw him put his hand on my table, take up a small packet, and put it up his right sleeve—he then asked me if I was a teetotaller, I said "Yes, at present"—he said "I am going to have half a pint of beer," and walked away with his hat on—Smith, from the next sorting table, then made a communication to me and I went to Mr. Joel, the overseer, who went after the prisoner and brought him back—I then said "You have taken a packet off my table"—he said "It is a lie"—he shook his hand and I saw the packet fall from his sleeve—I said "There is the packet, Mr. Joel, just fallen from his sleeve"—I rushed forward and picked it up and put it in Mr. Joel's hand—there were no letters on the table, a bag hung there but the mouth was closed—this is the box, it was going to Truro, which is on my road.</p>

I am a boy sorter at the inland branch—on 21st June I saw the prisoner sitting on a corner of Ellis' table with his hat in his hand—I saw Ellis speak to Smith, who spoke to Mr. Joel, and he fetohed the prisoner back—he went to the northern table—I saw him shake his sleeve, and Ellis said there is the packet, Mr. Joel; and when he took his hand away I saw the packet where his hand had been—I was deputed to attend in the Missing Letter Department of the General Post-office in this case, and when the prisoner came in he made a motion, I thought he meant, was I there on his business; I nodded my head—he was afterwards behind a screen and came and asked me if had been doing the same as he had, I said "No?" he said "What are you here for?" I said "On a little business referring to yourself;" he said, "Did you see anything?" I said "That is my business;" he said "Did you see the packet drop from—my sleeve?" I said "I cannot answer you that;" he said then you think I took it, and if you think I took it you had better say so; if I get half a chance I shall say that Ellis must have put the packet there.</p>

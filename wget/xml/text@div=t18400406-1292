                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Oliver Pain, of Broadway, Stratford, in the parish of West Ham. I had ft watch on the 31st of March, which I saw safe at eight o'clock at night, in the drawer in the bakehouse, which is part of the house—I came back at eleven o'clock—It was gone—I immediately informed the police, and told my suspicions—the prisoner was taken into custody on the following morning—this is my watch, chain, and seals—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—the bakehouse-doors were shut when I left it—I shut them after me—when I returned, they were still shut—our people go in and out there.</p>

I took the prisoner into cus<lb></lb>tody, and told him Mr. Pain wanted to speak to him—he did not ask me what it was for, but accompanied me to Mr. Pain, who told him, in my presence, that a watch had been stolen out of the bakehouse, belonging to his man, and that he, the prisoner, was strongly suspected—he said the watch was stolen between nine and eleven o'clock—the prisoner re<lb></lb>marked, "I was in-doors at a quarter to ten o'clock"—there were foot-marks in the garden—he afterwards said that he went into the parlour, stole the watch, and put it into his boot—he pulled off his boot, and the pro<lb></lb>perty was found in it—he said he was sorry for it.</p>

               <p>As I was coming up from Birmingham to London on the 6th or 7th of June; at about the o'clock at night, being alone and near a farm house, not far from the Black Hat near <placeName id="t17790915-4-crimeloc21">Tottenham-court turnpike</placeName>

I followed him into this farm; he ran in among some hay; I ran after him; there he struck me with the stick that he had in his hand; I doff'd my shoe and struck him with the heel; a battle ensued, and I believe I should have mastered him, if it had not been for a dog that frightened me away; I then went out to the turnpikeman and told him my story; I then came back with the watchmen and they found the prisoner; they took him to the watch-house; we found the purse and the sixpence that was left in it, upon him; the three shillings were not there. It was a moon-light night; I am sure he is the man that robbed me; there was a man and woman close to us at the time that he kept me in the road talking. I tried to get away from him, but he would not let me; the man and woman who were there at the time he was talking with me went on; he had been with me half an hour before they passed me; I do not mean to charge him with taking the bundle, I only lost it in the scuffle.</p>

               <p>I am a serjeant of the watch. On a Sunday, which was the 6th or 7th of June at about twelve at night, I saw this girl (the prosecutrix) standing with one of the watchmen at his box, the watchman told me that she had informed him of her being robbed, and that he had desired she would continue with him till I came round to acquaint me with the matter. She informed me of the affair; she told me whereabouts it was at the farm-house. I took two or three of the men with me; she said he had taken a purse from her with three shillings and sixpence in money, and she had lost a bundle; she said she followed him into the farm yard, and she was sure he was gone into some of the out-houses; I went into the out-houses; we searched round with a lantern, but could not find him; there was a hay-stack on the outside of the yard almost finished, I searched round it, and we found two men, and pulled them out. We asked the girl if either of them was the man; she said no. We had almost given it up, when one of the men turning the hay from the bottom of the rick found the prisoner lying there; we pulled him out; as soon as the girl came up to him she said that is the lad that robbed me; I said be particular in what you are doing, if you swear to him you will take his life away; she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150007"></xptr> came round again and said that is the lad, I will swear to him by his eyes; she said if you search him you will find my purse and money. I searched him and found this purse (producing it) in his pocket with a little bit of white worsted, and a bit of white thread, as she had described before we found it, and one sixpence in it.</p>

               <p>(The purse was deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Harris. She brought an old handkerchief she took off his neck at the house when she came to give the information; I asked the prisoner when I found him, if it was his handkerchief; he said it was not, but one of his fellow servants told me he had lent him that handkerchief on the Sunday.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman. I can say no more than what Mr. Harris has spoke before; I went with him, and found the prisoner underneath the hay; he said he belonged to Mr. Ross, and had been a servant to him some time; but Mr. Ross said he knew nothing about him. I saw this purse found upon him. The girl challenged him as the person, and she told us before we went there that she had torn a little bit of his coat off, and we found a bit had been torn out of the slap of his coat.</p>

               <p>I was out on Sunday night between twelve and one o'clock; she was walking along the road; I was coming up, I was hurt with beer; she asked me where I was going; I said home; she laid hold of me and asked me if she should go along with me; I said she might if she would; she held my arm along the road, she was going into the fields to lie among the hay; she asked me if I would go along with her; I said I was going home; I said if she would go into my master's yard, I would go with her; we went and sat down upon the hay half an hour; I said I would get up and go home; she said d - n me you are not worthy of a woman, you have not above sixpence to give her; she pulled out a purse and said if I would go with her into the field she would give me that; she took off my handkerchief; when she saw it was good for nothing she wanted the purse again. She would not swear she was robbed before the justice till they told her if she swore against me, and cast me, she should have forty pounds.</p>

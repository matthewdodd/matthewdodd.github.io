Venables, of Whitechapel, for 100 dozen collars—I said, "Very well; I will get them ready"—I took the order, and said I would do them at soon as I could, or something of that kind—I got 94 dozen ready—that was all I had—after packing them up, I gave them to the porter to take—the prisoner went with the porter to get the money—I gave the prisoner an invoice, and he made it out himself—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "London, November 24th, 1862. 3, and 4, Fitchett's-court, Noble-street.

                  </hi>. I am in the service of my father, Griffiths Foulkes, of Little Russell-street, Covent-garden. On the 29th of March a person, who I believe to be the prisoner, came to me, and on the following day the pri<lb></lb>soner came for a parcel of goods, which he said had been left by mistake—we had had a parcel the day before from Edwin Leaf, of Wood-street—the prisoner represented himself as their porter—I thought it extremely unlikely—he said he came from Leaf's and Co,—I gave him the parcel, containing two pieces of satin, and a piece of silk, worth 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I directed our porter to follow him, and he brought him back in a <hi rend="italic">cab—the</hi> prisoner said he hoped I would forgive him, be bad a wife and six children, and it was all up with him—he produced this book—we bad sent no order to Leaf.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Richard Foulkes. On the 30th of March I saw the prisoner at my master's—I followed him down Holborn—Messrs, Leaf live in Old Change—the prisoner then took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and went down the Blackfriars’-road, over the bridge, then got down and went away, leaving the parcel in the <hi rend="italic">cab—</hi> I spoke to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man—I asked him to stop till the prisoner came back—he told me to stand on one side, and I took the prisoner when he came back—I said I must take him back, this was not the right way to Mr. Leaf's—he then would not get out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he burst into tears, and I said, "You had better get out."</p>

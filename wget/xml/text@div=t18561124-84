               <p>and a half of iron from their yard—I had noticed it to be safe on the day previous—it was counter balance weights, broken up for the purpose of being sold—we sold it at 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton—next morning I went down as soon as it was daylight, and found a vast quantity of rust from the place where the iron laid, across the yard to the outer wall of the yard which is next to the unoccupied house—I observed immediately, on the other side of the wall the ground was very much cut up, apparently by the fall of some heavy weight, for twenty-seven feet in length; and there was a track of foot marks from where it fell, to the wall of the prisoner's yard; on that wall I observed a deal of dirt and iron rust; and on the other side of prisoner's wall I observed foot marks leading to the centre of the yard—a part of that yard is paved, to about four yards from the prisoner's back door; I traced the foot marks up to that paving—I gave information to the clerk of the works, and to the police, and went with Bywater, the policeman, to the prisoner's house, about 10 o'clock on that Saturday morning—I had seen the marks between 7 and 8 o'clock—I found the prisoner at home—I heard the policeman ask him if he had any iron by him—he said, "No"—the con<lb></lb>stable was in uniform; he told him he had come to search his place for stolen iron—he said he had no objection to our searching the place—I saw the house searched, and nothing was found—the constable asked him where he sold his iron—he mentioned two persons' names—he said he always cleared out his iron on Saturday and Monday, and he had not sold any since Mon<lb></lb>day—I told him I should give him into custody on suspicion, which I did—I afterwards saw some of the iron we had lost at Mr. Gray's, in Cavendish-grove, Wandsworth—I saw some at the police station.</p>

               <p>JOHN BROWN. I live in Great Portland-street; I am a <rs id="t18140420-131-viclabel728" type="occupation">tea-dealer</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18140420-131-victim1181 t18140420-131-viclabel728"></join>. In consequence of suspicion, after the prisoner had left my service six weeks, I obtained a search warrant. I went with the search warrant to the Royal Oak, the corner of Circus-street, in the New-road, Marybone; the prisoner was then living there. In the prisoner's box or drawer, I found my tortoiseshell snuff-box. The prisoner was with me at the time I found it. I had not missed the box until I found it. I am sure I had it during the time she was in my service. I gave twenty-five shillings for the box. It was inlaid with gold.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BENNET. I am an officer. I executed the warrant. I found the snuff-box in a drawer with the prisoner's clothes; she said, she was very sorry she had done it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In a lumber room in Mr. Brown's house, I picked up this snuff-box; I thought it of no value, and intended to get it mended. The prosecutor came with an officer, and searched my box; he said, he had lost some silver spoons. In my drawers he found this old snuff-box. The prosecutor has declared, if he could, he would transport me; I am at a loss to know, why he should be so severe for so trivial an article. I pray I may be restored to my distressed parents, who are in great distress of mind for my unfortunate situation.</p>

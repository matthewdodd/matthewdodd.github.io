               <p>Mr. Fielding, prisoners Counsel. My Lord, under the particular circumstances of this case, I rather feel myself hurt when I address you in this stage of the business; for although what I have to say may as well be stated now, yet as this is a prosecution evidently carried on by the Fire-office, against which this party has a claim if he be innocent of the present charge; it seems to me, that if you should be of opinion that the indictment is ill conceived, that it would not be wrong to quash it at present; it seems to me that these counts exhibit a misdemeanor and felony; it seems to me, therefore, that this first count in the indictment is a misdemeanor, and for a misdemeanor only. The second count is clearly for a felony; if that be the case, then it is an objection. The substantive part of the charge is, that he unlawfully, wilfully, and maliciously, did set fire to and burn the dwelling-house of himself, with an intention feloniously to burn the house of Imray.</p>
               <p>Court. If the count stopped there; - does it stop there?</p>

               <p>Court. We shall endeavour to do you justice, you may depend on that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Counsel for the Prosecution: My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury; the charge against the two prisoners, is for setting fire to the house of one Imray, laid in one count; and in another, the house of Durham and Imray. Gentlemen, in this case, I will state the out-lines of it; but, as you must have seen, from the number of witnesses, it will go into great length; I will endeavour rather to state it generally, than particularly; the charge is, for setting fire to the house adjoining to his own; because, in point of law, a man cannot be found guilty of felony, who only burns his own house, whether as tenant at will, or whether as tenant for years; therefore, the charge is not, that his own house was burnt and consumed, though it was; but the charge is, that by so doing, he burnt the house of his neighbour; that makes this a felony, and triable before you as such. In cases of this nature, you know very well, from the nature of the crime being committed in the dead of night, when people are asleep, it must be proved by circumstantial evidence; in my mind, no evidence is so strong, as that which depends on circumstances; because, that evidence cannot be fabricated for the purpose; because, it cannot be false, but must arise from the transaction; it must arise from the conduct and demeanor of the person guilty, and charged with that offence: You will therefore consider in this case, the situation of the defendant, his conduct previous to the fire, his conduct at the fire, his conduct subsequent to the fire: if from his conduct, from the manner and behaviour, and from the different circumstances that arise from that conduct, manner, and behaviour, it convinces you that this fire was not an accidental fire, but was done for the purpose, you will then be to judge, whether these circumstances which will affect the prisoners, will not be sufficient to convince you, as honest men, on your oaths, that they, and they alone, were guilty of this offence. Gentlemen, the circumstances I shall lay before you are shortly these: The prisoner Clary is by trade a taylor, but sold ready-made clothes, in Little Poultney-street; the woman cohabited with the man, in the character of housekeeper; they had been in this house about a year and a half previous to the fire; the fire happened on Monday, the 24th of March last; they occupied the front shop, in which the clothes he sold were hung to view; the kitchen and other parts of the house were let out to lodgers, some unfurnished, most of them ready-furnished; during the year and half which he lived there, he had never once thought of insuring his property till January last, and in January last, he insured his property for the sum of 900 l. stating at that time, that the household goods were worth 136 l. his utensils in trade, 620 l. his wearing apparel, 50 l. plate 46 l. china and glass, 48 l. and that is the insurance he makes, amounting to the sum of 900 l. Gentlemen, it will be in evidence to you, that on the night of the fire, a lodger who laid in the kitchen, heard persons up in the parlor, and in the room where the warehouse was; they cried out, who was there? upon which, the man or the woman, answered, it was Clary; at eleven at night, the lodger called to the woman, Mrs. Gombert, and desired her to get her some beer, for she was not well, and could not sleep; it was brought at eleven; the woman heard the noise continued; and being asked, who was there? Mrs. Gombert said, the prisoner was doing some business with some men in the shop; at two o'clock, the woman heard a noise of the cracking of a wainscot, as if burning; she got up, and found in the parlor, the man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020017"></xptr>and the woman; the man dressed, with his coat, waistcoat, breeches, shoes, and stockings on; in that situation, he was standing without attempting or endeavouring to save any thing out of his house; there he stood, perfectly cool and indifferent, with his hands in his breeches, desiring the woman not to be frightened, but to put on her clothes and assist; this will be confirmed by several witnesses, they will state to you, that he was compleatly dressed: I wish to fix your attention to that; because, afterwards he said, he was then undressed, without his shoes or stockings; upon this, the lodgers in the house were alarmed; a neighbour smelling fire, put her head out of the window, and heard two people speak, and being asked, who they were? or what they were? no answer at all was made; but heard hush! hush! from one person to the other: Gentlemen, the neighbours were alarmed; the persons came there; the ware-room, in which he afterwards stated was all his property, was broke open; the window was burst; it was the only room which was on fire, at that time; but in that room, there was observed a chest, the lid of which was open, some loose boards joining that, and the wainscot was on fire, and the top of the chest consumed; another person came, and he observed him, and he was exceedingly anxious, that the fire came from below, from the kitchen, and frequently said, do not you see the flames come from the kitchen? no, says the man, I do not. Now it was impossible it could be so, for the floor on that very room in which the chest was, and in which the chest was partly burnt, that floor never was consumed; observations were made in the shop, that there was no goods at all, that even the small quantity of clothes that were in the window, and had been hanging up for sale, they were not there: it will be in evidence to you, that this man had no trade at all; it will be in evidence to you, that this man had only a few clothes hanging up in the shop, and those the same from the beginning to the end; that he had very few goods, a very short time before the fire; as to plate, it will be in evidence to you, that the very day before this fire happened, a person dined there, and there was only a pewter spoon. Gentlemen, these are minute circumstances; but there are other circumstances which are decisive; the man being applied to for his rent, could not pay it; and being applied to for his taxes, could not pay them; he being applied to for money at different times, put them off, and appointed them to be paid on the very day this fire happened; one man applied to whom he had given a note for 6 l. and he asked him for the money a few days before, and he said, he could not pay it; he told him, he would sue him; says he, then I will enter an appearance, and defend the action; after the fire, he said, to him, you and me have had some words, but I have insured my goods, and I shall pay all my creditors now; then the state of this man was a state of poverty, unable to pay his rent, unable to pay his taxes; and on his application for the money after the fire, he said the property came into the house a few days before; his conduct in the neighbourhood was not like a man that had lost 500 l. in bank notes, from the coolness and manner in which he behaved soon after the fire; when the surveyor and fire- fire-men were round the house, he then said he had lost property to a large amount, and that it was contained in a chest in the ware-room: I stated to you that the chest was on fire, and close to the wainscot; he then said he had left fifteen or sixteen guineas in that chest, together with 500 l. worth of bank notes, and that in that ware-room were his plate; they sent for a pickaxe to dig for his chest, knowing very well that the guineas could not be melted, the plate could not be melted, or if melted, there must be an appearance of its being consumed; on digging, they found the handle of the chest; upon which he said that was it; instead of it being consumed, only part of the chest was consumed;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020018"></xptr>instead of finding sixteen or seventeen guineas, or any plate, or any thing else, the chest was found to contain nothing but hay-bands, and pieces of paper wet with oil, stinking with oil, clear that they had been dipped in oil, both the papers and the hay-bands; the moment the man perceived that, he endeavoured to disperse the hay-bands, but was prevented by the surveyor. It will also be in evidence to you, that that part, and that part alone was on fire, in which this chest was; just the cover of it open, the boards adjoining the wainscot, which boards were burnt, but that the floor was not consumed. On examining this man to give an account of his property, he stated it had been brought to town but the Saturday, or a short time before; and that he had in this very chest 500 l. in bank notes; when I call them bank notes, I mean Bank of England notes, for those were his words. The story was incredible. What, would a man be pestered for money by his landlord and the tax-gatherers, and he possessed of 500 l.? Being asked to describe the notes; he could not describe any one of them, the drawers or acceptors, but he could exactly describe the different amounts of the different sums; he therefore described that there were five of 50 l. that was possible; six of 10 l. ten of 5 l. each, making the sum of 50 l. Now gentlemen, you would be apt to suppose that a man might be mistaken in that, but it is given under his hand, he has signed it, and it shall be produced to you to day; that he said among these notes were ten Bank of England notes of 5 l. each. Describing his property, he said, that he had lost sixty gross of buttons, twenty gross of metal coat buttons, forty gross of metal waistcoat buttons; upon which the surveyor directed the earth to be sifted, to see if in that fact the man spoke true; and instead of finding a gross of buttons, there were only six buttons found in the dust so sifted. Gentlemen, the fire could not have consumed them; if the metal had been melted, it must have been found. Gentlemen, he then described, that he himself had brought from the Portsmouth waggon, and that it was contained in this chest, two hundred pieces of nankeen; now the chest itself could not contain it; that chest will be produced to you, and you will judge from that, that it could not contain that quantity of nankeen: in regard to the plate that he stated, that he had two dozen silver spoons, not an ounce of silver was found in any part of the dust; for as he directed the surveyor to the place, they found the chest, marked the place, and nothing of this property was found whatever. Gentlemen, if I prove these facts to your satisfaction, if I prove this man was very much in debt, if I prove he could not pay even his taxes, nor his rent, nor money to different people; if I prove, that so late as January, he makes an insurance of 500 l. and when he comes to make that claim, he makes it amount to 2000 l. where could all that property be? for previous to the fire I will prove to you, from undeniable evidence, there was no property at all but a few clothes; I will prove to you that during the fire, a lamp-lighter who got in to save it, could find nothing but a few clothes. Gentlemen, after I have stated these facts to you, and likewise that they were both at the same time seen, the woman carrying out a box, which she carried to a neighbour's; the man walking out with all the coolness and composure in the world, without alarming the neighbourhood, walking away from that street, where he was going I do not know; but he walked away, and then came back complaining of this loss: when I prove these facts, and shall prove that this combustible matter was contained in this chest, is there a man of you that can have a doubt of their guilt? and when you consider likewise that I prove them up during the greatest part of that night, and when I prove a witness was heard, after calling out on the smell of fire; the answer was hush, hush, to each other; but no answer to the person calling out. When I prove to you, that after the fire was in the house, instead of endeavouring to save their<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020019"></xptr>property, they said to one of the neighbours, come down, we believe there is a fire in the next house adjoining; they themselves up, and dressed at the time, and perfectly cool, and that this man and woman had time enough to have got out their property; for there was above a quarter of an hour between the time of their being up and alarmed, and the time of the fire being so strong nothing could be saved: if I can prove this, there can be no doubt it is a very heavy charge to bring: it is a charge difficult to prove, and if proved, deserves the severest punishment. I do not say that, to urge or to inflame you against the prisoner; but I say if the facts are proved to your satisfaction, there is no mercy which they deserve; a crime of a blacker dye cannot come before a Court and a Jury; it involves every other offence of robbery and murder. It is the duty of the prosecutors, whenever there is an idea of a house being set on fire on purpose, to set about an enquiry; it is your province to judge whether the evidence which we produce will bring it home to your conviction; you know it must depend on circumstances, for no man alive sets fire to a house in the presence of another; for it is done in the dead of night: and therefore it must depend on the circumstances of the case; if these circumstances are proved, it will be your duty to pronounce them guilty of the charge, being for burning the house of

            .</p>
               <p>Where did you lodge at the time this fire happened? - At No. 1, in Little Pultney-street, in the kitchen of Clary's house.</p>
               <p>What day did this fire happen? - It began in the night of Sunday, the 23d of March, after two on Monday morning; I returned home near ten on Sunday night; I do not know that the clock had gone ten; I went to bed, I suppose, in a quarter of an hour after; my husband, I suppose was in bed half an hour before me.</p>
               <p>Did any thing particular happen? - I heard a noise up stairs; when I came in, I did not see any body.</p>
               <p>I believe the prisoners occupied the whole of the shop and parlor of the ground floor? - There were other lodgers; there was a shop, a little ware-room, a parlor, and a little bed-room; when I came in, I did not find any body was in the house, except myself and my husband; and when I went down stairs, after I had been down stairs ten minutes, I heard a noise, and I called, who is there? I heard no answer, it was a noise, like somebody opening a door; I called again, and Mr. Clary said, it is me; I said, then it is very well; that was about ten; I heard him in the shop; the next thing, I went to bed, and I was very restless; I had not slept for two or three nights; I said to my husband, I wish I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020020"></xptr>had something to make me sleep; he said, it is too late; I heard somebody come out of the back yard, I thought it was Mrs. Gombert; says Clary, no, it is me; says I, I should be very glad if Mrs. Gombert would order me a pint of beer; he said, she was gone out for her beer, and should order me a pint of beer when she came in; she brought me her pint of beer; I asked her to set it on the fire, and she said, that Mr. Clary, and the man at the Black Lion were in the parlor, about particular business; I did not ask it, for I thought in the manner she spoke, she would have wished to come down a little, and our being in bed, it was not so convenient; upon that she left my room, I got out of bed after she went, and I took my pint of beer into bed, and I drank it; the next think I believe I went to sleep; a little after two I was disturbed with the smell of something that appeared to me like a candle, that had been set under a painted board with oil.</p>
               <p>Was it a strong or faint smell? - A smell of oil, very strong and powerful; it appeared to me as if somebody had left a candle on the stairs; I sat up, and I thought to myself, this is not the smell of a candle; I got out of bed, and I went to the kitchen door, which is not close at top by about two inches; I opened the door, and sulphur and smoak came in so powerful, it suffocated me almost, and the cracking of the wainscot, cracked like a piece of deal on the fire, a cracking of wood; upon this I turned on the stairs, and my husband was in sleep; I shook him and said, pray awake; he got up, he was going up stairs, and I had a box at the foot of the bed, which all I could lay hold on I put in; he took up the box into the entry, and I returned back to the bed, and I took the bed-clothes in my arms, and went after him; my husband nor I had not a rag on; I laid down the bedclothes in Mr. Clary's room, the parlour is even with the bed-room, that is the front-room; the shop and parlour is in front, the passage is between the shop and the parlour; Mr. Clary stood with his hands on his hips, and in his pockets, he had a white night cap on, and his breeches, I believe, because I think he had his hands in his pockets; I am sure he had his breeches on, I did not take notice of any thing else; he was standing on the floor.</p>
               <p>Before you went up, had there been any alarm given by any body of fire? - Not a word, I did not hear any thing stirring, I made no alarm at all.</p>
               <p>Was there any light in Clary's room when you came up? - Yes, there was a candle lighted, and candlestick stood upon the dresser; there is a dresser with drawers in this parlour, which used to stand in the kitchen; Mrs. Gombert was standing between the bed room and the parlour; there is no passage between these two rooms only a partition; Mr. Clary said, Mrs. Gombert put on your clothes, do not alarm yourself; I know she had a petticoat on; then I says to her, Mrs. Gombert give me your light; says she, I cannot spare it; she had a candlestick in her hand, and I took the candle out, and went down stairs instantly; I said there was fire, but I believed it was at the grocer's, the corner; I did not think of a fire happening in a shop, where there was no fire-place, nor nobody worked in it.</p>

               </div1>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Sarah Bishop. Was there in fact any fire-place in the ware-room as he called it? - I never was in it.</p>
               <p>Was there a fire kept in it? - No, Sir, there was not.</p>
               <p>Was there a fire in the shop? - No, Sir, there was no fire-place in the shop; I never was in the ware-room, I went down and brought up my shoes, and what I could lay hold of, and I went down no more.</p>
               <p>At that time were either of the prisoners attempting to save any of their property? - No, Sir, I expected when I came up Mr. Clary would go into his work-shop, I begged somebody to open the door, the street door was not open then; Mr. Clary never attempted it, he stood in the parlour; when I came up again, Mrs. Gombert opened the street-door as fast as she could; when the door was open, I shoved out the boxes into the street, and my husband took them over to the milk cellar, but I stood at the door, and put on my things; I went no more to the place, I continued at the milk cellar in view of the house; I believe in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour the flame broke out.</p>
               <p>Could you observe in what part of the house the flames first broke out? - They came out of the shop window; the man broke the shutters in.</p>
               <p>That house was entirely consumed? - I believe it was, except the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure, whether the flames or the fire, came at all from the kitchen floor? - They certainly did not.</p>
               <p>How long had you lived in the house with these people? - I went some time in January; I was in the second floor about seven weeks; I was away a little while.</p>
               <p>Have you had opportunities of seeing the shop of Clary? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What business did he carry on? - A taylor.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020023"></xptr>Did he work there at all? - I once saw him at work.</p>
               <p>He sold ready-made clothes, I understand? - I do not know that he sold any; he kept them in the window.</p>
               <p>His stock consisted of a few clothes hanging in the window? - I have seen a coat laying in the window; I could not go in or come out, without having a command of the shop, because it was open; it shuts up with moving shutters at night, which were taken down in the day.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by a few clothes? - Two or three waistcoats, or there might be ten or a dozen; I do not think they did exceed that.</p>
               <p>What number of coats? - I cannot say I ever took notice of any coats; I have taken notice of the waistcoats, because there were some linen ones.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see goods in any other part of the shop? - I cannot say I did; I saw no shelves or drawers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was there the appearance of a mercer's or draper's shop, or any thing in a large way? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the shop fitted up with drawers or shelves? - I do not know; the window came intirely round; it was the corner next to Wardour-street, where the partition was down; there was nothing standing besides the window; the partition between the shop and a little ware-room, to which there was a door, and a counter on that side of the shop next the passage.</p>
               <p>Did you conceive the prisoner to be a man of large property? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>Have you ever drank tea with them, or dined? - I drank tea with them twice; nobody drank tea with them but me and the housekeeper.</p>
               <p>Their stock of plate was very small; I believe there was one tea-spoon? - I cannot say, whether there was or not; I never saw any plate but one tea-spoon, and I do not know whether that was silver or metal.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, you say, they did not appear to you to be persons of any property? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Mrs. Bishop, what business is your husband? - An upholsterer.</p>
               <p>Had you been spending that day together? - No, Sir; we were engaged to go to St. James's-place to dine; I dined out, and he dined with

             that day.</p>
               <p>He had come home in fact before you? - Yes, he was sitting on the stairs.</p>
               <p>Nobody at that time at home? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>What other lodgers may there be in this house? - One in the dining-room next the grocer's, Mrs. Harcourt, nobody but her; and there was another in one of the other rooms, on the first floor; there were four in the house altogether, me and my husband, and the two lodgers on the first floor.</p>
               <p>Had you had your fire in the kitchen all day? - There was a little fire when I went home, I stirred it up, and that fire I left when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>When you thought you heard a noise, you asked, who was there? and Clary immediately answered; you knew his voice, and he told you, Mrs. Gombert should bring you some beer, which she did? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had she left any candle up stairs when she came down to you? - I do not know; I waked about twenty minutes, or half an hour after two.</p>
               <p>You went up stairs, and observed, that Clary had said to Mrs. Gombert, do not be alarmed, put on your clothes; you saw Mrs. Gombert, she was alarmed, and stood by the bed-room door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. She appeared to be alarmed, did she? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Afterwards when you wanted to open the street door; she opened it, did she? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When the smoke had oppressed you below, and you thought there was fire at the grocer's, you saw nothing but smoke, I take it for granted in the house, and you communicated this idea to Mr. Clary, that you thought it was at the grocer's? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Court. You said so? - Yes, I said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020024"></xptr>it is not here, it is at the grocer's; somebody came to the house door while we were taking the things out, and asked where the fire was? I said, I do not think it is here, it is at the grocer's.</p>
               <p>Therefore, at that time, there was no appearance of flames in the house? - No, Sir, not then, nor I did not know the fire was there, till I saw the flames break out of that house.</p>
               <p>You have said, you never was in the ware-room? - No, never, nor in the shop, any further than I have seen it by passing.</p>
               <p>At that time you had seen these goods hanging up in the window, that are common in that sort of shop? - Yes, and they have been so ever since I have been in that house.</p>
               <p>Those that were exposed at the windows, were the signals of that sort of shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What were in the ware-room you could not tell? - No.</p>
               <p>This man, Mr. Clary, is out of town sometimes? - I do not know, Sir; he went to Portsmouth just before this accident happened; he returned on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Court. How long had he been out of town? - About a week; the housekeeper, Mrs. Gombert, told me, he had brought property with him from Portsmouth; she said, he had brought a chest of great property.</p>
               <p>Court. We cannot receive that as evidence, you must prove the fact otherwise.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You said, the window was broke open? - Yes; the men broke it open on the outside next the grocer's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Do you recollect in what manner he was dressed? - He had his breeches on, and I believe his hands were in his breeches.</p>
               <p>Had he any coat on? - No, he had not.</p>

               <p>I am husband of the last witness; I was awaked by my wife with the alarm of fire, on Sunday, the 23d of last month, which was Easter day; after my wife was gone out, Mrs. Gombert came and called me to dine with Mr. Clary, which I did, then I went out.</p>
               <p>Was there any plate at table that day? - No, Sir; there was one spoon, which was a pewter, or metal one, I cannot say which; there was no silver spoon at all. When my wife awaked me, she said, Bishop! Bishop! my dear Bishop! do not be alarmed, I am afraid there is a fire somewhere near us; with that, I jumped out of bed, and went to the kitchen door, and I heard the cracking of deal, like as if one put a piece of deal under a pot; I was going to run up stairs naked as I was, but she desired me to take a box up with me; I went up stairs, and met Mr. Clary in the passage with his white night-cap on, breeches, stockings and shoes.</p>
               <p>Court. You are sure he had the shoes and stockings on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether his shoes were buckled, or his stockings were gartered? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did you observe one way or the other? - I did not; but that Clary wanted to go by me, to open the back door, which is the yard door; I cried out, Clary, for God's sake do not open the door! for God's sake do not open the door.</p>
               <p>Why did you beg him not? - Because as soon as the air came in, I knew very well the flames would have a greater power, that was my reason; with that he made me answer, oh, it will let the smoke out; I then carried the box, and chucked it in the passage, and went to the foot of the stairs, and called, Mrs. Horford! Mrs. Horford! for God's sake come down, you will be burnt in your bed! she lodged in the one pair of stairs room; then I ran down in the kitchen, and took a small box, and brought up, and as I came up, I saw a light over the door of that little ware-room at the bottom of the stairs; I came up directly, not half a second; that was the first I saw of the fire; I mean the wainscot that parted the stairs and this little room; I took the box to the milk-seller's opposite, and I brought over the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020025"></xptr>candle and candlestick, and when I was on the stairs, Clary came to me; I says, give me a light; he says, G - d d - n me, what do you want with a light? give me the light; then I went down and brought up a wooden clock, but the smoke was so great I had no power to stay on the stairs; I took the clock over the way, but I could not return any more; then I saw the flames break out.</p>
               <p>Did Clary attempt to save any of his property? - Not at all, nor ever attempted to open his shop shutters to save any of his property, but went out of the house. I went to live there some time in January.</p>
               <p>Had you opportunity during the time you lodged there, to observe what property he had in his shop? - Yes; whatever I saw in his shop was a few waistcoats, and a few breeches, but of very little value; I have often said to my wife, I wonder how Mr. Clary lives in this manner.</p>
               <p>Was you ever in this little room, called the ware-room? - No, they were the same clothes that were there the first time I lodged there, and the second time I came back again, which was five weeks afterwards; I never saw any thing different to what I saw before.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see any plate in the house? - I saw three silver tea-spoons, which is all the silver I ever saw in the house.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see any table-spoons at all? - I never saw one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. When was it that the officers of the Insurance-company applied to you to give evidence? - On the Tuesday following.</p>
               <p>Where did they find you? - At the milk-cellar, the opposite side of the way.</p>
               <p>Who was it applied to you particularly? - It was one of the firemen of the Sun-fire-office, that desired me to come to the White Swan to the gentlemen, and me and my wife went there as soon as we could; we got there about six; we were kept there for about an hour and an half, or two hours.</p>
               <p>How many did you see when you were there, a board of them met? - No, only three or four gentlemen; I do not recollect Mr. Gubbins there.</p>
               <p>How many times have you been with them since? - Never since, not till I went to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Have you been with any attorney that has taken your evidence? - No Sir, none at all.</p>
               <p>Your wife waked first, and alarmed you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have heard what your wife said through all that transaction? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you hear her say that she thought the fire was at the grocer's? - We both imagined the fire was there; and the first time we came out of the kitchen, neither of us had any apprehension it was in the house; when I saw the light through the wainscot, then I knew it was in the house, and not till then.</p>
               <p>Why did not you go to the spot? - Because the place was shut up; I went into the kitchen again, after I had seen the light.</p>
               <p>Did you see any-body at the milk-cellar where you had left your box? - I saw Mr. and Mrs. Horford there, naked, at the milk-cellar dressing themselves; they had come down in consequence of my alarm; I do not recollect I saw any body else; the nurse was in the street; the woman had laid in a few days.</p>

               <p>Did you at all attempt to make any alarm when you got out of the door? - Yes; I called out, fire! fire! when I went out with the box.</p>
               <p>Did you communicate to Mr. and Mrs. Horford, your suspicions that the fire was in Clary's house? - No, not then, I did not.</p>
               <p>Why not? - Because I wanted to save my own property; I could not go to the spot where the fire was.</p>
               <p>Did Clary attempt to break open the place? - No Sir, he did not.</p>
               <p>Did you attempt? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him to break it open? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you communicate after this to any body before the flames broke out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020026"></xptr>house, that you supposed this fire was in that ware-room? - No Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Not a word about it? - No, never did any act whatever in order to discover, whether that was the place where the fire first began; the first time we had no apprehension that it was in the house; we thought it was at the grocer's.</p>
               <p>You told me at first you heard a cracking? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>How came it you should so easily give into the belief that the fire was at the grocer's? - Because I had no suspicion that the fire was in the house, till I saw the light.</p>
               <p>Did you communicate to any body, either to these two people that came out of the house, or to your wife, or to Clary, or to Mrs. Gombert, any suspicion that the fire was in that room? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Was there any fire in that room? - I never was in that room.</p>
               <p>Any fire-place in the shop? - I never saw one.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you the whole kitchen floor? - I slept in the kitchen, and there was a cellar on the other side; our kitchen was under the parlor and this little room, part of it was at the foot of the kitchen stairs, and run in at the back of the grocer's; the most part of the cellar was under this little room; but the upper part, a small part of the little room, was over the kitchen on one side of the shop, and the little room on the other side of the front and back parlour; the passage and the stair-case go the whole depth of the house.</p>
               <p>The passage leads to the yard? - A part of the passage goes to the back door; the stair-case is on one side facing the parlor; on the right hand side of the passage, is the shop, the ware-room, and the staircase; the passage goes strait on to the back door, and runs between the stair-case and the back parlor, the cellar runs under; the cellar was locked up, Mrs. Gombert had the key; I did not go into the cellar at all; I could not go in, because it was locked up; there was nothing but the coal-cellar under that; no place that had any fireplace.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any body in that cellar after your wife came home that night? - No Sir, there was nobody in the cellar where the coals is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did you lose any thing? - No, Sir; because the firemen got the grate up, and went down, I suppose, breast high in water; we lost nothing but one pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Court. When you saw the light through the wainscot next the stairs, that was when you came up the second time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When Clary wanted to open the yard door, was that when you came up the first time, or when you came up the second? - When I came up the first time.</p>
               <p>Why did you hinder him from opening the yard-door? - Because I knew the consequence of it, that it would make the flames burn more briskly.</p>
               <p>True, but at that time you thought the fire was not in the house, but at the grocer's? - At that part of the grocer's which comes to the back of our house; I was not willing that any air should come in; I had not at that time any suspicion it was in our house.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>(Examined by Mr. Leach.)</p>
               <p>I was a lodger in Clary's house on the 24th of March last, in the first floor over the shop, my wife is so ill she cannot come, she lays in; my bedchamber is directly over the ware-room, I have lodged there between three and four months; on the 24th of March, between two and three, I was alarmed by fire and smoke, my wife awaked me, and said there was a great smoke in the room; I then jumped out of bed instantly, having some property in my breeches, I immediately applied to them, when there was a very small rat-tat at the door, so small that if I had been in bed I could not have heard it; then the woman said, for God's sake Mr. Horford take care<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020027"></xptr>of your wife, for I believe there is a fire in the next house; in consequence of that I opened the door immediately, and the smoke poured in excessively; I desired my wife to make all the haste she could down stairs, which she did half dressed, and went across the street without her shoes; I saved almost all my property, they were ready furnished lodgings, the furniture belonged to Clary; it was Mrs. Gombert that came up stairs and said, she believed there was a fire at the next house; I went into the milk-cellars, and immediately returned into the room again, and took out another trunk; in attempting to go back the third time, the smoke was so excessive, I could not go back again; when I came down I saw Clary in the street, he said, Mr. Horford, I am undone for ever, I have lost five hundred pounds in banknotes.</p>
               <p>You are sure he said bank-notes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What more did he say? - He then parted from me, and ran up Brewer-street.</p>
               <p>Did you observe how he was dressed? - He had a coat which I took to be a green coat, or something of that colour; he had a night-cap on, and shoes and stockings, and breeches; I cannot say to the waistcoat; I perceived his buckles to be on the wrong side, I remarked that particularly, as if put on in a hurry, I took it so after he had parted from me, and ran up Brewer-street; the next time I saw him, he came round again by the other end of Little Pultney-street, then I saw him, and all that time I saw nothing but a continual smoke pouring out from all the shutters of the shop; the cry was, why do not you knock down the shop windows? the fire must be there; instantly there was a crow brought, and the window was knocked down; I saw a person jump in, and knock or break down this closet door, where there was a body of fire came out immediately; then Clary come to me and says, now Mr. Horford, do not you see the flame coming up the kitchen stairs? yes, I said, I see a great body of smoke come up, but I do not see any flame; he repeated that two or three times; I did not in fact see the flame come up from the kitchen stairs, but from the place where the window was knocked down; I saw nothing from the kitchen stairs, but a great body of smoke pouring from the closet.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the floor afterwards? - I saw a box taken out, and a person called me, and said, see, do you see this box full of hay and papers; that box seemed to me to have been in the closet.</p>
               <p>Court. That was from the ruins after the fire was over? - After the fire was over.</p>
               <p>That seemed to be where the little room was? - Yes, this was a closet in the shop, and the closet stands about the center of the shop; it was a kind of closet or cupboard in the wall of the house.</p>
               <p>Court. The shop in the day time is open to the passage? - Yes, the passage parts the shop and the parlour.</p>
               <p>Therefore in the day-time the passage makes a part of the shop? - Yes, it is shut with shutters at night.</p>
               <p>This ware-room, or closet as you call it, is in the back part of the shop, next to the staircase? - Just so.</p>
               <p>Then it goes from the staircase towards Mr. Imray's house? - The wall parts Mr. Imray's house and the closet, where the box stood; I look upon it that the closet fixes to the wall, the closet is more under the stairs; I look upon it the stairs went partly over this closet.</p>
               <p>By the little room and the closet, do you mean the same thing? - Yes, I mean that the closet was in this little room, I saw into some part of the shop, but I did not perceive any property; the smoke was very thick, that might hinder me from seeing it, if there was any.</p>
               <p>Had he time to remove any of his goods from the time you was first alarmed? - It was about a quarter of an hour after I was alarmed till I got my things out, and I did not see him attempt to go into the shop, or remove any thing at all; I saw him in the street.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020028"></xptr>Mr. Fielding. He was considerably agitated during all the time you saw him, I take it for granted? - I did not pay attention.</p>
               <p>The first alarm you had, was by the tapping at the door by Mrs. Gombert? - As I was putting on my breeches, there was a tap at the door from Mrs. Gombert.</p>
               <p>When you came out and followed your wife, and she had got out, you still suspected the fire was in the next house? - I could not pretend to say where it was, I had no suspicion either way, I was very much agitated myself; I brought down one trunk, and she brought down another, I then returned and took another.</p>
               <p>Was any alarm immediately given in order to give immediate assistance? - I did not hear much alarm given, my attention was taken up in saving my little property, knowing I was not insured.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I lodged at the house of Mr. Clary; the night of the fire I was at the Green Man in the Coal-yard, I was not there that night, I had a room on the first floor over the back parlour and the fore parlour; I know the shop perfectly well, and the ware-room.</p>
               <p>Describe what sort of a place the ware-room was? - The ware-room was a small place, and when you went into the shop, and opened a little door on the left-hand, there was a few shelves round; the first time I went in there I saw nothing but a few clothes in the ware-room, it was a little room partitioned off from the shop, at the back part of the shop, partly under the stairs; it was partitioned off next to the wall that parted Imray's house.</p>
               <p>Was there any fire-place? - None that I saw.</p>
               <p>No fire-place in it? - No, it was a small place, about four feet wide, and nearly square; not above four or five feet square, not clear of the stairs, it went under the stairs, which added something to the slant of it.</p>
               <p>When was you in it last before the fire? - I had not been in it for a month before the fire; the shelves were quite empty, I did not see any chest in it, it was not in it then, I lived there a quarter and a half at Lady-day; there used to be an old chest stand under the shop-window, in which they used to put the clothes in on Saturday night, and put them out of a Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Have you seen the chest that was found? - I have not.</p>
               <p>During the time you was in the house, did you observe much goods of Mr. Clary's in the house? - None at all of any quantity, but what were hanging in the window.</p>
               <p>Were there any shelves in the shop? - None at all; I oftentimes have heard people call for Mr. Clary, and enquire for him; I heard the officers of the parish come with their books for rates, and I heard Mrs. Gombert deny him, he was in the back-parlour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did he hear himself denied? - He must hear himself denied; I heard her go in and talk to him afterwards, that was a fortnight or three weeks before the fire; I have often heard people come for money; I never heard or saw they had got any.</p>
               <p>You lodged in the house, did they apply to you for any thing? - Yes, the week before he went into the country, I was going out, and he told me he wanted to speak to me, and he asked me if it was convenient to my husband to pay the quarter's rent; he said he was going to Portsmouth, and he wanted the money very much, and he could not go till such time as he had gathered his money together; I told him it was not convenient, but on the Saturday night, or on the Monday morning we would pay him, he asked me on the Thursday or Friday, on the Monday I believe we did pay him.</p>
               <p>Court. How much was your quarter's rent? - Two guineas.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you at that time what he was going to Portsmouth for? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did you ever observe any plate in his house? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020029"></xptr>Did you ever observe him change the apparel? - I never saw him have on but two coats during the time I was there.</p>
               <p>Had he much business there? - I never saw any thing sold in the house during the time I was there.</p>
               <p>Was any pieces of cloth, or silk, or any thing of that kind? - I never saw a piece of cloth, or half a piece, or any thing of the kind; I never saw a piece of silk; I saw a piece of Florentine that he had to cut out for breeches, about six weeks before; I never saw any nankeens.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Those things that were in the window were common things? - They were for sale? - I have often been in his apartment; I never eat nor drank with them to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>You had very little opportunity of knowing whether they had much stock or not? - All the boxes they had was very few.</p>
               <p>Did you go into their parlour frequently or their bed-room? - I have been in the bed-room many times.</p>

               <p>(Examined by Mr. Garrow.)</p>
               <p>I live opposite Mr. Clary's house; my chamber window has a compleat view of his house.</p>
               <p>What time did you go to bed on that Sunday evening? - About half after eleven; I observed nothing then.</p>
               <p>What was the first thing that happened afterwards? - About two o'clock my shop dog roused me, and I smelt fire, I threw up my chamber window, the front window directly facing his house; I saw immediately smoke at the corner of Clary's house come out at the shop windows; the windows were shut at that time; I stood at the window for some time, and in the space of about two or three minutes, I saw Mrs. Gombert come out of Clary's house.</p>
               <p>Did you know her before? - I did; she came out with a box.</p>
               <p>What sort of size box was it? - It might be about three feet in length, and two in width, it was a black box, she had it in her hand, turned herself round, and pulled the door after her; I then immediately called my wife to bring down the children, and I immediately missed Mrs. Gombert.</p>
               <p>Is the street very narrow? - Not very narrow; then I returned to the same situation, and in a small space of time I saw Clary go out and pull the door after him; whether it was shut or no I cannot say; he then turned, and walked up towards Wardour-street.</p>
               <p>Did he make any alarm of fire? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Before this time you had observed smoke coming out of the window? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed at that time? - I cannot say positively, he had clothes on; I then stood expecting to see the flames come out of the one pair of stairs window; I have known the two prisoners a year and a half, I am very clear these are the two people that came out, there is a lamp at the corner, and about twenty-four feet off another, it was a very clear night; after he was gone from the door, I went down and took my rattle, I always keep one in my bed-room; I begun rattling, the watchman came and assisted me; that got a number of people together; I said my lads, I wish you would get something, and break those shutters; somebody answered me, we dare not; I will indemnify you, says I, be the consequence what it will; in about a minute or two, somebody says, here goes, Suddenwood; and immediately they smashed away, and out came the flames.</p>
               <p>Was that on the shop side, or on the parlour side? - The shop side, next Mr. Imray's the grocer's; I did not stay at my window long, I made my wife get my writings ready, and I went out of my back-door, and I took them to my friend; when they broke the windows, I opened my other window; I had then a direct view into the shop, I could see nothing at all, no goods at all; I returned back, and observed the flames rather abating, and I contented myself.</p>
               <p>The fire afterwards consumed Imray's house? - Yes; the supervisor of the office<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020030"></xptr>came over to me, and I followed him, he was poking about with a stick.</p>
               <p>Court. How long after the fire was that? - It was about three days after the fire; he said he was looking after a large quantity of buttons; in looking after those buttons we found a steel knee-buckle, and we found a vast quantity of linen rags oiled, and oiled paper; they appeared to me as if they had been dipped in oil; we found the handle of a chest and some wood, Clary was not there, only the surveyor and us.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts was it found? - Mr. Gubbins, the surveyor, picked them out at different places, some were found under the floor, where there were joists; I did not notice any one particular spot, he was then only hunting for these buttons; he did not go over on purpose for these things.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you observe any thing particular about the spot where the handle of the chest was found? - The handle of this chest that I have in my possession, was found at the back part of the shop.</p>
               <p>Was there any rags found there? - There was, they were picked up, and some more was found in different places.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any in the place where the handle of the chest was found? - There were; I had the things in my possession, they were carried to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Have you had an opportunity of seeing how this man's shop was stocked? - I had.</p>
               <p>What quantity of goods might he have in it? - Now and then a coat and waistcoat; it appeared to be a very small stock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. When this man had followed your directions, and began breaking open these shutters, that was within a very short time from your first observation of this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long do you think this might have been altogether, from your first opening your window, to the time of the shutters being broke down? - It might be a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Where did you suspect there was any fire at the time you first opened your window and saw the smoke? - I saw it come out of the shop window.</p>
               <p>But did you suspect where it was when you first saw the smoke? - I knew the spot immediately, I saw the smoke come out from Clary's house, and suspected it was there.</p>
               <p>When you saw Clary going away, why did not you speak to him? - I did not, I do not know my reasons; I should have suspected he would have come over and have given me an alarm.</p>
               <p>In fact you did not speak to him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>For what reason? - I do not know what reason I could have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You was frightened at the alarm of fire? - I was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. At that distance over the way, you was frightened? - I was.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know Bishop and his wife? - I know them by sight.</p>
               <p>Can you tell me for a certainty, whether the people that you first saw come out of Clary's house, was not Mrs. Bishop and her husband, instead of the two prisoners? - I saw very clear the parties that came out.</p>
               <p>Was the door of Clary's house open when you first looked out of your window? - No, it was not open when Mrs. Gombert came out.</p>

               <p>Did you observe any thing on the morning of this fire? - I was up washing, and I smelt fire between two and three; I heard one or two voices speaking in Clary's yard, I opened my windows, and saw the smoke come gradually in; I clapped my hands together, and said, for God's sake tell me where the fire is? I repeated it over again; then I heard the voice say, hush! hush!</p>

               <p>After your wife called you, what did you observe? - I opened the window, and called out, where is the fire? the window that I opened was over Clary's yard, and I could hear no answer, but from two voices in Clary's yard, which called, hush! hush! I called out again, and said, if they would not tell me where it was, I would find it out; I went into the street, and called, fire! then there was plenty of smoke coming out of Mr. Clary's house, through the shutters, and where it could make its way, there was no flame then, but Mr. Barwell (my landlord) came with a crow, and broke open the shop in about five minutes; then the flames came out; I looked into the shop, and there was no goods there; I never was inside the shop; all that I saw, was, a few things hang up in the window; I saw two women in the passage; one had a band-box in her hand; I was not in the house at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You put on your clothes as hastily as you could after this alarm, and got Mr. Barwell, who was as active as you; in about five minutes he broke open these shutters? - Thereabouts; I perceived the flames soon after, from the breaking open of the shutters; I did not perceive any goods; I expected to see the goods, when I saw the place broke open.</p>
               <p>Why so? - Because I did; because as they used to be there, I thought they would be there then.</p>
               <p>What put it into your head that it should be material to speak about his having property or not? - It is the truth.</p>

               <p>Where have you been since that time? - I have been to work.</p>
               <p>When was it that they first thought you a necessary witness in this place, to apply to you? - Two gentlemen belonging to the Sun fire-office.</p>

               <p>How did they find you out? - By enquiring where I lived, and where I worked.</p>
               <p>Have they given you any thing for this loss of your time? - Nothing at all of any money; only victuals and drink perhaps.</p>
               <p>Only what? - A little refreshment was needful.</p>
               <p>How many times may that little refreshment be needful to you? - Twice.</p>

               <p>I am a milkman opposite to Clary's; on the night of the fire, I was in bed, and alarmed; I got up and went into the street, and saw the smoke coming through the shutters; I was by Barwell when he broke open the shutters; two or three people came over from the house; there was some man who appeared to me to be a lamp-lighter went into the shop and opened the little room door, I did not see any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020032"></xptr>thing at all in the little room; there I saw a box it seemed to be half way open; there was a loose board stood at the end of it, that was on fire; the box and all round it was on fire, I saw no other part on fire then.</p>
               <p>Could you by the light of this fire observe, whether there were any goods in this closet? - I could see very plain that there was nothing more than this box, nor any thing in the shop but some patterns. On the same day, between eleven and twelve in the forenoon, I was on the ruins, and a box was dug out of the same place where I had seen it on fire, and in this box was hay-bands and rolls of paper steeped in oil, or oil had been thrown over it, or something of that kind; Clary who was there, began to take some of the papers up, and break, and throw among the ruins, till he was stopped by the surveyor, or some of his officers; it was very close, and rolled together with the oil, and he began tearing it in pieces, and throwing it about the ruins.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Two or three people out of Clary's house, had been over at your house before you went and saw the shutter broke? - Yes, not half a minute before; I was in the street directly as they got in the street; I went round to the shutters, and immediately the lamp-lighter went into the shop.</p>
               <p>Then why did not the lamp-lighter get this box out, that was the only thing that was on fire? - He could not, it was on fire all round; the warehouse and all round was on fire; there was no fire on the right hand side of the room.</p>
               <p>Was all the left hand side on fire? - Yes, and no fire on the right hand.</p>
               <p>When you saw this, they had been raking among this rubbish, among the ruins? - I do not know; I was not there; I was there some time before the box was discovered.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive the surveyor, or any of the firemen raking in the rubbish? - Yes; they were asking one another where the fire began, and they told them, and they went and raked there; when Clary saw the box, he said, all his property lay in that box, 500 l. in bank notes.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - 500 l. worth of bank notes.</p>
               <p>Did he talk of any cash? - Yes, there was some cash, he said.</p>
               <p>He owned the box? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now when he took up these papers, as you call them; what he did, was seen by you and all the people standing by? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He did that publicly, there was no concealment? - There was me, and three or four more that saw him.</p>

               <p>Did you see into this little room at all? - I could not see for the smoke; I was the person that was nearest to it, and I opened the door, and I could not see any thing that was in the room, nor whereabout the fire began.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020033"></xptr>Was the whole house consumed? - No, it was not; the ground floor was pretty perfect in many places, so that I suppose, twenty people could stand on the ruins: when I went on the ground floor, I observed Mr. Clary coming in at the door; I asked him his business; (not knowing that he was the sufferer;) I was immediately answered, that he was the sufferer; I asked him, if he could recollect where any of his property lay; he pointed, just opposite to where he stood, that there was a chest, which contained fifteen or sixteen guineas; I told him, as the ground floor was good, there was an opportunity of recovering that money again; and I dare say it was not entirely lost; I cannot say he seemed to embrace the opportunity, as I should have supposed a person would have done that had money, and knowing that it must be totally lost to him, because money is uninsured; I told him, I would go and get a shovel; I could not get the shovel; on my return, I found Clary in the same place; I brought a pole-axe, and began to rake over the ruins where he represented the chest stood, and the first thing I found, was, a lock, that appeared to be the inside lock of a box; when I picked up this lock, I asked him, if he could recollect, whether that was the lock of his chest? he said, he was not certain, whether it was or no: some persons, but who I cannot say, answered, if he had the key, it would prove whether it was his lock, or not; he answered, that the key belonging to the chest, was hanging up along with the rest of the keys in the shop; I think, to the best of my knowledge, he said, on a nail inside his shop, as you enter in; I said, if so be he hung up the key where his ready money was, he might as well lock the door, and hang the key outside; I began to rake about immediately in the ruins where he represented his chest to be; I believe at that time, Mr. Gubbins, the surveyor, came in; I think, he asked me, what I was doing; I told him that was Mr. Clary, and what I was doing; he desired me to proceed; in searching a little further, I picked up the handle of a chest, and with the end of the chest with it, a part of the end of the chest; I asked him, if he could recollect, whether that was the chest, and he said, he believed it was; I think Mr. Gubbins asked him, whether he could be sure of it; I think, he said, yes, it was, he knew it by the handle; upon examining further, I came to the top of the chest, which was quite burnt off; none of the top was to be found; I did not see any; raking for the rubbish, I found a part of a chest, which Mr. Clary informed me his property was in; the bottom was perfect, and in that chest there were papers; I cannot say I had any reason to be suspicious of him at first; the first thing I observed, was a bundle, it was taken off, which I first took to be buckram, but on looking at it, it appeared to be paper, intermixed with paper and stinking oil; it appeared to be lamp oil, and the oil had changed the colour yellow; there was a quantity of hay-bands; I had such a cold, I could not undertake to say, whether the oil was intermixed with them in the same manner, but I shewed them to several persons, who said, they smelt the oil; Mr. Gubbins desired this chest might be taken up as careful as we could, and as little disturbed as possible; by his order, it was taken out; I will not be sure, whether the paper that laid at the top in a roll, was at first delivered into the hands of Clary, or whether he took it; there was another person with him; Mr. Gubbins gave an order, that he should not rake about any more in the ruins, and desired that paper might be taken care of; on my second return, I found this Clary with the papers in his hand, and unrolling a part of it, and strewing it about; and Mr. Gubbins gave the firemen there, a charge not to admit him to go away; I cannot say he denied giving me the paper, but he did not freely give it me; I took it out of his hand; Sir, says I, if there is any thing particular you can recollect, I will look<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020034"></xptr>for it; he said, there was a bill; I asked him the particulars, which he could give me no account of.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Have you any part in the principal of the Sun-fire-office? - It is my duty to inspect losses, and to manage the firemen.</p>
               <p>Have you any part in the principal capital stock? - None at all, nor I believe none of the servants of the office has; I was sent for to this fire, suspicion having arisen from various reports in the neighbourhood; I am not present at every fire; when there is a necessity, I am called for; when I came there, it was about eleven in the forenoon; I enquired of the firemen, what loss the Sun-fire-office had sustained? they informed me, the prisoner was insured in the sum of 900 l. I went into the ruins, and saw the fireman, Broughton, and some others; I enquired, what they were about? the prisoner was present, and they informed me, they were looking for property that the prisoner said he had lost; I turned to the prisoner, and asked him, what property he had lost? he said sixteen or seventeen guineas; I will not be positive, whether he mentioned any thing of the Bank notes at that time; I am not sure that I heard it first from him, but I think, I will not swear to it, that I asked him, whether he had lost any other property? and I know he afterwards told me; I took it down in writing from his own mouth, that he had lost 500 l. in Bank notes, and described them to me; that my clerk took in writing; I asked him the questions, Broughton and the sufferer was raking among the rubbish, seeming as if they were looking for something; I enquired of him, what he was looking for? he said, for the property of the insured; I desired Broughton to proceed; presently after, the prisoner had described the place where the chest was, within the ware-room, close by the stairs; I desired him to clear away that part.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you hear the prisoner describe the place where the chest stood? - I did, and he presently came to the end of the chest on the side, and afterwards cleared round the chest and came to the handle; the prisoner said, he knew the chest by the handle, that was the chest where his property was; the fireman laying hold of this handle, pulled it off, and a part of the chest with it; I was rather angry at that, I wanted it to be kept perfect; I wished it to remain, for I had my suspicions about me at that time; I afterwards caused it to be carefully dug round, and the top cleared off, and to my astonishment, I found the chest contained hay-bands, and rolls of paper, which I did not know were dipt in oil, but in a few minutes after I did; I did not take them out myself; I did not suspect they were dipt in oil, but I thought what was in the chest did not appear of any great value; (the chest produced, locked in a new chest;) this chest as I understand it, had never been examined to the bottom, not in my presence; I would not have it disturbed; (shewn to the Jury;) the upper part, and part of the sides were burnt away.</p>

               <p>I had three chests in the ware-room; one of the three belonged to a clerk of the Irish lottery; he run away, and did not pay his rent; he left a chest, and a stone bottle of oil, about a gallon; he left a vast number of printed bills; these bills are the pieces of paper which I picked up; that was the gentleman that saw me pick up the papers; I cannot write, nor read writing; I found this was all a bundle of those printed bills that seemed to be oily, or smell oily; and the stone bottle stood either under one of the shelves, or at the top of the shelves; my two chests were as full as they could hold, but in no chest that belonged to me was any oily paper, or hay-bands.</p>
               <p>Court. Let us see what is in the chest now? - (The chest shewn, containing burnt wood, straw, and oily paper;) this I think<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020035"></xptr>was the roll of lottery-papers, some burnt rags, and some coals.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gubbins. These coals never appeared to me before.</p>
               <p>Jury. We wish to look at the printed bills.</p>

               <p>(The rest of the contents of the chest appeared to be buttons not burnt, rolls of lottery papers wet with oil, rolled up.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. These papers, I understand, are most of them lottery-bills? - Yes; the chest appears to be half burnt, which had been a sea-chest.</p>
               <p>Broughton. The prisoner said the chest he was looking for was a wainscot chest, and this appears to be a wainscot chest; I did not mention that before; I did not discover it till now to be a wainscot chest.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gubbins. After finding this chest, and seeing the prisoner take out papers and strew them about the ruins, when I recovered my surprise, which was some time before I did; I desired the firemen not to let him come any more among the ruins; indeed, I first gave charge of him, without waiting for further advice; I then went to the solicitor for the Sun-fire-office, and acquainted him with my suspicions; I returned back to the place; in my return, I called at Sir Sampson's; I took with me, Mr. Clarke, who I wished to be present at my asking this man questions concerning his loss; I told the sufferer, it was my duty as an officer in the office, to enquire into his loss; this was on the same day, but in the afternoon, he was willing to give me any account; I asked him to the house, the grocer's; there was no place where I could sit down to write, except in Mr. Imray's house; he very politely gave me the use of his parlor; I went into it with the prisoner, my clerk, and Mr. Clarke; I then examined him concerning his loss, beginning with the garret to the ground story; he there described to me every thing he had, as furniture, plate, china, and stock in trade; I took them from him in writing, and he signed it, not that day; my clerk took it down in my presence; this was read over to him the next morning twice, and he agreed it was right, and signed every sheet by itself separate with his mark.</p>

               <p>This inventory I took in Mr. Gubbins's presence, I took it from what the prisoner said, as correctly as possibly I could, from himself; that is an exact copy of the original, which I copied the next morning, I have examined it, it is exactly the same, and this was read over to the prisoner the next morning, in the presence of Mr. Gubbins, and another surveyor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Where was the insurance made? - I cannot recollect the time; the insurance was 900 l.</p>
               <p>What may be the value that he gave you an account of? - He seemed not willing to tell me the particulars of his bank notes, and the goods that he said he bought.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You never insure bank notes, you know, nor cash? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Any thing that he said as evidence relating at all to the subject of his property, is admissible evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gubbins. He described in the questions that I asked him, that he had 500 l. in bank notes; the particulars I cannot exactly remember, but I remember this, that he described he had ten 5 l. bank notes, he said five of 50 l. six of 10 l. ten of 5 l. and one of 100 l. I asked him over and over, he said all notes on the Bank of England; and casting up them, I found he had been 40 l. deficient in 500 l. On the next morning when we came to read over the account to him, I asked him concerning it; he said he could not recollect whether the 40 l. was one bank note or more, but he was sure he had 500 l. I wrote it down accordingly. The account he gave me amounted to 460 l. I asked him then what he valued his goods at, that he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020036"></xptr>so lately purchased; he said he paid for them in bank notes; one of 100 l. three of 10 l. and two of 50 l. - 230 l. He said likewise that he had this property by him five years.</p>

               <p>Which property? - The bank notes; but I will do every justice that lies in my power to the prisoner; I asked him if they were the same bank notes; he said no, to be sure they were not; he had changed his property, but he could not describe the number, the date, nor of whom he took them, not any one note; I asked him how he came by such a large sum; he told me he earned it in the King's service, and in his trade as a taylor; here is a great quantity of goods, to the large amount of forty coats, &amp;c. and among the rest I see there is fifty gross of buttons; he described to me a very large quantity of apparel, forty coats, and fifty or sixty waistcoats, a large account of ready made apparel, that he had stored in this place he called his ware-room; and at the other end of it he said he had, I think it was twenty gross of coat buttons, forty gross of smaller waistcoat buttons, besides bags of mohair, and silk buttons, and other articles in the tayloring line, sewing silk, &amp;c. besides the buttons that were on the garments; he said some of them were plated; I enquired of him very particularly how he came by such a large property, for I made it out, from his own account; for he said to me, as I marked it in the margin of my account at the same time, that the goods he bought for 230 l. were worth in London 900 l. He asked first whether he had a right to give an account of them, because they were smuggled goods, indeed he confessed that; I told him no advantage would be taken of that, if the account was fair, the office would pay him; then he described to me that he had two hundred pieces of nankeen, and a large quantity of silk, I do not know how many yards, it is in the account, in this chest.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Not in that chest.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gubbins. I suppose that chest, from the description that the man gave at the time, he told me it was the chest in which his property was, and he described it as the property that he brought from the Isle of Wight; I recollect it well, I was certain the chest would not contain all these things; and he told me he put these goods after they were landed from Harwich, in a bag; I certainly took some pains to enquire the weight of two hundred pieces of nankeen, and such a quantity of silk, amounting to three hundred yards, as that bulk would be very large; he described the manner he bought them; that he bought them there, but he did not know of whom, nor his name; he bought them out of a cutter, that they brought them on shore to the house, he did not know the sign; that he afterwards conveyed them to the waggon, and he set off himself to Gosport; he then said afterwards, which I think is a contradiction, that he took with him twenty pieces of nankeen, and fifty of silk, to sell on the road, back out of his waggon, I think he said the Gosport waggon, I cannot be sure; he said he was but just arrived from Portsmouth, a few days before the fire; I understood him that they were put in a waggon, and brought somewhere in the Borough, but it was but a few days before the fire. After this hearing of such a quantity of buttons, to near nine thousand, eight thousand six hundred and forty metal buttons, I thought to be sure, some of them would be found in the ruins, as the floor was not burnt where they stood; the floor of the ware-room was not burnt through; I called in a respectable man in that neighbourhood, Mr. Haslam, a builder and surveyor, and had desired him to get a proper person to assist to screen the rubbish over, to sift it, to see if he could find any remains of buttons; but prior to that I should have said, I went myself to the opposite neighbour Mr. Suddenwood, to see if I could see any of them myself, and I could find none. Instead of finding buttons, I found a great many more oiled rags and papers, which I ordered to be taken care of, but they have been thrown away; I found other things in the rubbish<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020037"></xptr>not melted; I did not find any buttons not one, either melted or unmelted; I did not see any melted metal at all.</p>
               <p>Did he make any claim on the office? - He certainly made a claim to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You did not happen to be at the office, when this man insured with you? - No, he did not insure at the office when I attended; the claim is at the bottom of the account, regularly signed by him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord; and Gentlemen of the Jury, I never made any claim.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this part read over to him?</p>
               <p>"I do hereby certify, that by the fire yesterday, in Little Pultney-street, I suffered loss of my houshold goods, &amp;c. to the amount of 900 l. and upwards, as appears in the foregoing account, contained in this and the three foregoing sheets, to which I have set my hand; and I do by virtue of the policy demand satisfaction for my said loss. Dated the 25th of March, 1788."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not understand it was read over.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. The firemen were stooping down among the ruins at that time, the whole of the chest was not visible, not a single part of it; afterwards, when there was a handle of this chest made its appearance, then he said he knew the handle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The width of the room was but just the length of the chest; the length of the room was but four feet six? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When this handle of the chest made its appearance, and he thought he knew it, the conversation then turned principally on the cash and the notes that he said he had lost? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your conversation with him on this subject was merely pity, because you, as the officer at the Sun-fire-office, knew that they would not be responsible, for either notes or cash? - I certainly did.</p>
               <p>Did he know that the office would be answerable for this money? - I think the contrary, because he himself told me soon after, that he thought the office was not responsible either for his loss of the bank notes or the cash; I understood it so from his examination.</p>
               <p>Then whatever he might say to you on that subject was more immaterial to you? - It was not immaterial to me: if such a respectable man as yourself was to meet with a misfortune, I should ask you the same questions I did him.</p>
               <p>Court. When this chest was searching for, did he speak of his valuable property being chiefly in one chest, or being in several? - He described it to be in one, he never mentioned any more than one chest; he described every particular, table, stove, grate, furniture, tongs, and every thing.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you observe that in stating the stock in trade, he did not state what the goods that came from the Isle of Wight were in? - It is in his own account of the fire, how it happened, taken from him; this was read over to him, and signed the same as the other, on this defendant's return.</p>
               <p>Was he sworn to it it? - No, it is the word we use.</p>
               <p>Was he taken before a magistrate? - No.</p>
               <p>Then I cannot receive it as a written confession.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. We give it only as a written account taken by a witness at the time.</p>
               <p>Gubbins. He said the whole of the goods brought from the Isle of Wight, together with the bank notes, were deposited in a chest in his ware-room.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you find any more than one chest consumed or unconsumed? - I saw but one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I brought them in canvas bags, and Mr. Haslam can speak to that.</p>
               <p>From the state of the ruins, as you saw them, the floor of the ware-room was not burnt nor fallen in? - The staircase had only fallen down, no part of the ground-floor had fallen in; it had burnt through in several holes.</p>
               <p>From the state of the ruins, and your experience, if there had been that quantity of buttons, particularly in that ware-room, must not the whole, or a great part of them have appeared? - I have not the least doubt of it, and the cloth must have appeared<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020038"></xptr>in my opinion; it would frizzle up, it will not burn without a very strong fierce fire to consume it.</p>

               <p>No burnt cloth? - No, only some pieces of paper, and some burnt rags.</p>
               <p>Were there any guineas found? - No, only one farthing, that my man has; I know the house of Mr. Emmery that adjoins it; the door-post of that is burnt, and the lintel over the door, and the archichitrave round the door also, and a part of the door, and the sill of the door; the right hand sill of the door is burnt, part of it through; the shutters of the window were one of them burnt to a cinder in the front.</p>
               <p>Was any of the floor burnt? - Only the sill of the door; not the inside of the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I understand you, the flame did not get through? - Through it is, but not the floor; it is burnt a little on the inside.</p>
               <p>But there is nothing of the inside of the door on the inward side of the post? - No.</p>
               <p>It is all exterior? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The door itself, or the door-post, there is no burning on the inside? - No.</p>
               <p>You say one of the shutters was burnt? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How are these shutters fastened? - They lift out of the grove, and fasten with a bar; they are put in the day-time, a heap of them together.</p>

               <p>Did you search carefully? - I did.</p>
               <p>If there had been eight or nine hundred buttons, should you have found them? - I do not think there were twenty.</p>
               <p>What other things did you observe among the rubbish? - Iron, and some bits of cloth not burnt.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing particular about them? - Yes, there were hay-bands, bits of cloth, and paper in a state wrapped up, wet, I believe with oil.</p>
               <p>Did you find any quantity of linen,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020039"></xptr>nankeen, or such things? - None at all; I have been used to this business; I have sometimes found such things in the state in which they where lost.</p>
               <p>Court. On these buttons found, there is no appearance of any very violent degree of heat; there is one of them a thin one, and beginning to be in a state of fusion; the rest are not.</p>

               <p>I am rent-gatherer to this estate in Pultney-street, to Mr. Lee; the last time I applied to the prisoner for rent, was, for half a year up to Lady-day; about a fortnight before the fire, I applied to him.</p>
               <p>Did you receive your rent? - I did not; he told me, he was going down to Portsmouth to receive some money from his customers, at Portsmouth, and as soon as ever he returned from Portsmouth, he would pay me; I called again at the time I expected him to return, but he was not gone; but Mrs. Gombert told me, he was going that very night, and would return in five or six days.</p>
               <p>Had you applied frequently for rent? - I had.</p>
               <p>How often? - I suppose, three or four, or five times.</p>
               <p>What was the rent? - Thirty guineas per annum.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Did you ever apply to Clary for taxes? - I did, about a fortnight before the fire; the amount was 6 l. 1 s. 6 d. he had from time to time, begged me to wait, for that he had no money; but the last time he begged me to wait till the year was up, as he should have a sum of money a little after Lady-day.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Kinslow. You have been in this little back place, this closet or ware-room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You told us when you saw it there were some things in it; what were they? - I never saw any thing at all there, except a Bath stove; it was a very small one.</p>
               <p>You talk about a lottery-office keeper? - The Irish lottery was kept there, at Mr. Clary's house.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing belonging to the lottery office keeper? - I never heard of any thing but some books and some lamps that they left behind them when they went away; they were in this ware-room.</p>
               <p>Did you see a large bottle of oil? - I did not.</p>
               <p>This chest that has been shewn, that used to stand under the shop window, and the clothes used to be put in on a Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. How many lamps were there? - There were four.</p>
               <p>Then when you was in the house, the lottery office was kept there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>During this time, there was oil of course to supply these lamps? - I have seen them trim the lamps with a glass bottle; I remember the lottery-office-keeper going away; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020040"></xptr>left them things behind him; there were some trifling prizes came up, and he went away; when I took the apartment, this place had nothing but coals in it; they were cleared away for the lottery-office-keeper; they had only a bushel and a half at a time.</p>
               <p>Court to Clary. Now is your proper time, if you have any thing to say for yourself on any of these circumstances that you wish to explain, the Court will hear you? - My Lord; during the time the lottery-office-keeper was with me, they had several gallons of oil in a stone bottle, that might hold rather better than a gallon, or about a gallon; which oil-bottle and a chest the lottery-office-keeper left; a large chest he left locked, what was in it, I cannot tell; I was informed I dared not break it up, as the man had sent a man to make proposals to let him have his chest, and what things he left, and he would pay me part of the money, which I did not agree to, till he paid me part of the whole; and his numerical book and his oil remained ever since; the chest I never opened; it was a large chest, and it was under one of the shelves in the ware-room, and it stood by my two chests; he had many printed bills, and his book was a very large square book, a deal of papers he had, which I always saved, expecting he would come and take them; the fire began so soon, and I was alarmed by my housekeeper; I was very fast asleep, and it alarmed me; I immediately got up and listened a moment, and I heard a great cracking of fire; I smelt smoke, and I immediately called Mr. Horford, in the first floor, and the people in the kitchen; Mr. Horford was down stairs before I delivered the words, and I opened the yard door to look out backwards in the neighbourhood, to look if there was any thing of fire; Mr. Horford said, there was no fire in the house, it might be in the neighbourhod; it seemed to make me a great deal easier; I went to the street door, which Mrs. Gombert, the housekeeper, had opened; I looked round and could see no fire; I ran immediately to St. Ann's and St. James's, and ordered the engines, which came in about twelve minutes; I ran as fast as I could, with one arm in my coat, the other out; stockings I had none on; I buttoned my clothes by the way; the engines came, and were to the best of my knowledge, about three quarters of an hour, or I am sure about half an hour, before they played; I was running about; they say, I was very easy about it; I should, I believe, have gone into the flames, if it had not been for a customer of mine, who I was glad to see there, that stopped me, and said, do not go Clary, you can do no good, you had better lose your property than your life; my witnesses were here all day yesterday, and are here: I wish to add, concerning the insurance; when I insured, I asked the clerks at the insurance office, one and all, if it was not proper to come and inspect into the particulars, because it would be more satisfaction to me; they said, no Sir, it is a thing we never do; they took the insurance-money, and when the man came to deliver the policy and the mark, I was not out of bed; and he told me, they had made a mistake of three shillings, which I desired my housekeeper to give him, and one for the man himself, which made four.</p>
               <p>You cannot point out which of the clerks of the office with certainty, I think, to whom you said this? - I could know the gentleman if I saw him.</p>

               <p>I know Mr. Clary, and the house in which he lived; there was a lottery-office kept there; I cannot say at what time, it was during the drawing of the Irish lottery.</p>
               <p>In what manner was this office kept? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>How was it furnished at night? - Very well furnished; there were lamps, three or four, and more for what I know, but I never took great notice.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you live with the lottery-office-keeper? - Yes, I did; I lived with Mr. Clary.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the lamps trimmed; where did they keep the oil? - I do not know; I believe in some box; or some place backwards.</p>
               <p>What papers had they there? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Where did they keep their books? - I believe on the counter always.</p>
               <p>Court. I have no doubt but these papers were left by the lottery-office-keeper.</p>
               <p>How was the house furnished? - Very good furniture.</p>
               <p>What business was Clary? - He was a taylor by trade; he carried on a great deal of business while I was there, and employed a great many men.</p>
               <p>How long did you leave him before the fire? - Not a quarter of a year.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. He carried on a great deal of business, and had a great many hands? - Yes, sometimes out of doors he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020043"></xptr>carried on his work, and sometimes in doors; he had four or five men.</p>
               <p>Where was the shop? - In some of the rooms; I lived in the garret.</p>
               <p>Was the shop-board there? - No, in one of the garrets; there was while I lived there, a shop-board and two or three men working there.</p>
               <p>What time was that? - I do not know the time; he had a shop for clothes below stairs, that was in the parlor; he proposed to make a shop in the garrets; when I went away, he had great deal of cloth.</p>
               <p>Where did he use to keep this cloth? - In the back room below, the ware-room I fancy it was, adjoining to the shop where he slept, where he hung his clothes up.</p>
               <p>What part of that shop was it adjoining to? - On the side of the shop, close to the shop.</p>
               <p>Was you ever in it? - Yes; the ware-room was on the right hand; the lottery-office was kept in the shop.</p>
               <p>Then he never let the ware-room to the lottery-office? - I do not know; he emptied it for them when they took it.</p>
               <p>Where did he put his goods in? - There is room enough to put his goods in; I do not know particularly in what room; some in one room, some in another.</p>
               <p>Why this room was not very large? - Not very large; about as wide as from you to me.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the fire-place in the corner, on the side? - I do not know there was any fire-place; there is a little back room; I know there was a fireplace.</p>
               <p>How long was it? - It was square.</p>
               <p>Was there any window in it? - I believe there was, but it was at night when I was there; I could not see whether there was any window, or no; I never took any observation; in this shop, where his clothes hung, there was a great quantity of cloth, very fine cloth; I suppose five or six and twenty shillings a yard.</p>
               <p>How many pieces? - I do not know, there was a great quantity; I saw it brought in.</p>
               <p>Was there more than one? - Yes, I dare say there was a great many; it was four times as much as I could lift.</p>
               <p>Then it was brought by a cart? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>There was a roaring trade carried on? - I saw it brought in by Mr. Clary, two months before the fire.</p>
               <p>Do you remember Mrs. Bishop living there? - I was not acquainted with any of the lodgers.</p>
               <p>Did you know Mr. and Mrs. Bishop? - I cannot say I did; there was a man and his wife in the kitchen, I have seen them, but I never spoke to them.</p>
               <p>Was that the person? - I do not know whether I ever spoke to her; I do not remember Mrs. Dunn living in the second floor; I have seen Mrs. Horford; I do not know the gentleman; I know the gentlewoman.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Kinslow? - Yes; I know her; she lodged in the one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Kinslow. Was this woman in the house.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Kinslow. Yes; but she was very seldom at home; I never saw any man at work in the garret in my life.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bishop. Nor I.</p>

               <p>How many rooms had he at your house? - One room, and I put his goods into my lodger's room; he had so much furniture that served for one room; I do not know whether he took his two chests at once, or at twice; I was not at home; I visited him several times; I know he bought a great deal of furniture after he went there; I saw some feather-beds and blankets, and other things.</p>
               <p>When did he buy it? - I saw it at his house.</p>
               <p>What part of the house? - The parlor and one pair of stairs.</p>

               <p>And you could not go into the house without going into the shop? - I did not take notice of the stock.</p>

               <p>Did you at any one time see ten pounds worth? - I never was in the ware-room; I keep a shop, and I never keep 20 l. worth in my shop, but I keep hundreds of pounds worth in my ware-room.</p>
               <p>How many waistcoats might there be? - I never looked at the waistcoats; I do not know.</p>
               <p>How many pair of small clothes might there be? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Were there any boxes on the shelves? - I did not go behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, was there five pounds worth of goods at any time that you looked? - Yes; I am very sure there were more.</p>
               <p>Will you swear to 10 l.? - I will not swear to any amount at all.</p>

               <p>How many years have you been in that trade? - Twenty-two years.</p>
               <p>Now suppose them very good, fit for a clothes-shop to sell? - I cannot charge my memory.</p>
               <p>What do you think of 100 l. worth? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>What do you think of 50 l. worth? - I cannot say any thing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Who is this taylor? - His name is Pritchard.</p>
               <p>Where does he live? - In White Lion-street; I cannot say when he employed him.</p>
               <p>How lately? - He had work to do for him when he was at Portsmouth this last time.</p>
               <p>Where did he work? - At his own house; he takes in piece-work.</p>
               <p>You took this man to be a man of large property? - I do not know; I always took him to be a man of property; I never expected any such thing as a difficulty in not paying his rent and taxes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You say it is not the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020045"></xptr>custom for you to exhibit any clothes, you keep them in a ware-room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What size is your ware-room? - My ware-house is larger than a large parlour shelved all round.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a woollen-draper in Bedfordbury, I know the prisoner Clary about a year and a half, he dealt with me, I served him with any quantity he wanted; within three or four months past he has had four or five pounds worth; I served him in January and February, in October, November, and December, and his trade was for 5 l. at a time.</p>
               <p>What quantity of goods may you have supplied him with; did he come frequently for such a supply? - Yes, sometimes one cut, sometimes two, sometimes four.</p>
               <p>In short, you supplied him with goods as a taylor that had business? - Certainly, as a taylor that employed people to work, both in woollen drapery and men's mercery.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You have not got your books here? - No, I cannot pretend to say; sometimes he was a ready-money customer, and sometimes he paid the next time he came; I believe he was in the sale-way by the clothes hanging there; how can I tell what he was? I know by the appearance of the shop, he was a salesman as well as a taylor; I never was up in his work-shop; I have been at his house a good many times within these four or five months; I might call once or twice before that.</p>
               <p>How often have you called upon him? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Can you say how many cuts of cloth he had from you? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How much money have you received from him? - I cannot say, nor no draper in London.</p>
               <p>Is he your debtor now? - He owes me a few trifling things, I cannot say, may be three or four pounds, I think that not an object, some in February, some in March, about a month or six weeks before the fire.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, I confess I do not think calling these tradesmen, who had supplied him with different things, can answer any purpose.</p>
               <p>What sort of character does he bear? - I declare I know nothing scarcely of the man, but by coming to my shop.</p>
               <p>- HAWKE sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at the Black Lion in Berwick-street, I have known Mr. Clary about a year and a half, I cannot say when he did come into the neighbourhood, I never heard his character stained till now; I was at his house the evening of this accident, I was there till past eleven; I went home, and shut up my house, which I do always, precisely at eleven; I staid there half an hour I suppose, and went away; I was standing in the parlour with him.</p>
               <p>Had you seen any thing of him that evening before? - No, Sir, I never set sight of him all the day before, I called upon him at his own house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You was in the parlour, I understand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go into any other part of the house? - No other part; I have served beer when there was a lottery office, I knew the place where the lottery office was kept, I never was in the room in my life time, all was quiet and easy, and they were at supper, no smell of smoke or of fire.</p>
               <p>You had particular business to do with Mr. Clary? - So far as that he said he would assist me with a little money; I went to ask him the favour, and he answered me I was welcome to have it at seven in the morning.</p>
               <p>What time? - I did not put any time at all upon it; as far as this he did say to me, that he had some notes by him, that he could let me have 10 l. he said these notes were in his ware-room; I cannot tell how long before, it was before I spoke to him about this money.</p>
               <p>What time was you to make the payment? - That was to my own option.</p>
               <p>What reason did he give you, for not giving it you that night? - He said that he had locked them up in his wardrobe, in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020046"></xptr>the place where he put all his things, and likewise that it was not convenient for him to open it that night, but if I would come in the morning, I should have it.</p>
               <p>Did he give you any reason for that? - No reason at all.</p>
               <p>You come here to prove that you went there to borrow money of him? - I came because the gentlemen of the Sun-fire-office had been informed that I should entertain goods of their property before; but I am willing to take my oath that I never had any property of his in my house in my life.</p>
               <p>He did not shew any notes then but told you; there was a parcel that he shewed you one night, and said they were all bank notes; where was that? - In our house.</p>
               <p>How long ago? - A few days before, I cannot tell you the night; it was not so much as a week, it was a pretty largish bundle of bank notes, I cannot tell how many, folded together in a large parcel.</p>
               <p>It was not in the week; was it? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Who was present at the time? - I cannot say, it was a public-house, there might be other people.</p>
               <p>How happened he to produce them that night? - I do not know any further than he said he had been at Portsmouth, and received some money and bank notes together.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, have you never said that he did shew you bank notes on the night of the fire, at his own house, and that you would prove it? - I said that he shewed me bank notes; I never said that in my life.</p>
               <p>Have you never said you was with him in his parlour, and that he there shewed you several bank notes? - I never said any such thing in my life, I never said so since I was born, I never said so to any body, I never saw the wardrobe in my life.</p>
               <p>Some of these bank notes were 5 l. notes? - I do not know, he said he had them mostly in 10 l. notes, he never mentioned the word five to me.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you want this money for? - To pay my brewer for some beer, I had asked him before he went to Portsmouth, and he said he could help me when he came back; after he came back from Portsmouth, I put him in mind of his promise, a few days before this Sunday night; I went to him and asked him, and he said it was in his power so to do; that was in my house, I did not tell him what day I should want it, I went to him on the Sunday evening.</p>
               <p>Had you seen him at his house since he came from Portsmouth, till that Sunday evening? - No, not to the best of my knowledge, at his house.</p>
               <p>Who was present when he took out the parcel of bank notes at your house? - I cannot tell, there was my wife present, I do not know whether any body else saw him, he pulled them out in the little parlour.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was it? - I cannot tell, it was in the evening, I cannot tell the hour.</p>
               <p>Was there any body in that parlour, except you and your wife? - I cannot say, I know my wife saw them; I cannot say positively whether any body else was present.</p>
               <p>Then you do not recollect that there was? - I do not recollect that there was any body present but me and my wife.</p>
               <p>How long had you owed this money to your brewer? - That is a hard matter to know, we are very seldom out of debt, I was going that morning to have it delivered, I did not owe the money till it was delivered, I was going to have beer in, I was obliged to pay ready money for it, I was going that very morning to get in some beer, and to pay for it on delivery.</p>
               <p>What was to come of what you owed him before? - He gives me credit.</p>
               <p>How long have you been in debt to your brewer? - Ever since I have been in the house.</p>
               <p>When did you begin to pay ready money? - I began twice before.</p>
               <p>Does your wife assist you in your business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178804020047"></xptr>Who keeps the accounts, you or her? - My wife.</p>
               <p>Then she assists you in your business? - She does.</p>
               <p>Then she knows your business? - She does.</p>
               <p>She knew that you owed money to the brewer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she know that you was going to pay him on the Monday? - Yes, she knew I was going for beer, and that I intended to pay my brewer some money, I had money in the house, but not enough.</p>
               <p>Did she know what money you had in the house? - No, because I keep that myself, I lock it up in a little box, I trust her now and then to go to it, I do not think she did know what money I had in the house; I never kept it a secret from her, not of any payments that I was going to make; my wife always sees the receipts, and they are filed, my wife always sees the brewer's books.</p>
               <p>Then when you had asked this man for the money, before he came from Portsmouth, and when he came back he shewed you the bank notes, why did not you ask him for one of those bank notes? - I did not want it just at that time, not till Monday; I do not know why I did not, but I did not do it.</p>
               <p>You put him in mind after he came from Portsmouth; was that before you saw the bank notes, or after? - Oh, it was the same evening when I saw the bank notes; I said Mr. Clary, I hope it will be in your power to help me a little now; says he, it will.</p>
               <p>Was it in your house that you put him in mind of his promise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he go home after that? - No.</p>
               <p>He was only once at your house that evening? - Only once.</p>
               <p>Then he had the bank notes in his pocket? - Yes, he pulled them out of his pocket.</p>

             who gave them both a good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Clary. My reason for keeping so much money, and not parting with it, certainly was, a man that was an acquaintance of mine that kept a public house, and I had lately agreed to purchase his estate, which is a freehold estate; I saved the money to go round the buildings; while I was at Portsmouth, I went to the Isle of Wight, as I generally do; although it is not lawful, I dealt in smuggled goods; I got safe home; part I left to sell on the road, which consisted of nankeens and silks; that was my particular reason for saving my money for purchasing this estate, but lighting of this bargain, I bought the goods.</p>
               <p>Court. That would be a very good reason if you could prove the fact.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I can prove it by writing to the man of whom I was to purchase it of, his name is Mr. Kelly, agent in Plymouth dock, who formerly kept the sign of the Fourdroyant; I saved the money for that purchase; and my Lord, I leave it intirely to your Lordship, and the judgment of the Jury; I am as innocent as God in the Heavens, and the poor woman is innocent; I was fast asleep; I have been a very lucky man; I have gone through many hardships; I have gone to sea with Sir Edward Hughes; I always was caressed by my betters, and always esteemed by my betters as company for gentlemen, though I had not the education of a gentleman; I was Steward to Sir

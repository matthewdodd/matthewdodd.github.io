               <p>I live in Boddington parish.</p>
               <p>Court. How did you come by this mare? I bought her of the prisoner at the bar, at the Swan at Boxmoor, within about two miles of Boddington, I am sure it was the prisoner that sold her to me, I bought her the 9th of May in the morning, I gave 4 l. for her, I did not know the prisoner, I was going by, and the landlord at the Swan called to me, and said, there was a mare to be sold, I asked the price, he asked six guineas, I bid him 4 l. but I said, I had not the money in my pocket, I should return in three hours, and I returned, I said, I am afraid my man you did not come-honestly by the mare, and I took him to Justice Bingham, at Waterend, and he examined him, and said, I might pay for the mare before him very safe.</p>
               <p>Court. So you did it under the authority of the Justice, are you sure the prisoner is the person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever know him before? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. When the prisoner was before the Justice what did he say? - He said, he was a farmer's son, and his father was likely to be seized, and he had it to make a little money on.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the Justice satisfied with that? - He said, his father lived somewhere about Bayswater.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the true value of the mare? - I have bought and sold many a mare as good to look at for 4 l. I thought it was worth no more.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. What was the worth of her when you lost her? - I believe she might be worth 10 l. when she was stole from me, but she had been at work, I did not think she might look so well by some pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. According to your own account of her there was some defect.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When I went do wn to swear to the mare, the Justice would not deliver her on my oath, I thought it was very odd that he would not let me swear to my own property.</p>
               <p>Grover. I wish he had let you have her, I should not have had so long to have kept her.</p>

               <p>I did not steal her.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was it possible that the mare could get out of your premises? - Impossible, she was found with a pannel that belonged to me.</p>

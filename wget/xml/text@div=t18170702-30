He knew that my duty at the Docks would keep me twenty-four hours-as we always march off at ten o'clock, and stay twenty-four hours, which is the regular way. He had been to Mott's with me twice before this, and knew he was my uncle.

            . I am Mr. Keily's servant. On the day that the apartment was robbed, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming down stairs, and met the prisoner, Pitfield, on the first-floor stairs, he went to Mr. Mott's apartment-our street - door is always left open. I had seen him with Mr. Mott's nephew two or three times before, and knew him. I told him Mr. Mott was not at home - He did not ask me any questions; he then went up, and I saw no more of him. I went into the parlour, stopped there about ten minutes, and then saw him come down again and go out, I did not speak to him; before I saw him come down I went out at the side door, and saw a person standing under the gateway, very much like the prisoner, Jackson, dressed as a soldier. I am not sure it was him. I am certain Pitfield is the man that went up stairs.</p>

On the day of the robbery, between four and five o'clock, I was playing on the stairs, and saw the prisoner, Pitfield, on the staircase of the second-floor, I said nothing to him, but saw him go into Mott's room; he was pulling the door about - I do not know how he got in, he had no key; I went out for an errand, and did not see him come out. When I went out I saw a man under the gateway, I believe it was Jackson, I only looked at him as I passed him; I took notice of him because I had seen Pitfield(who is also a soldier), up stairs.</p>

            He pulled it about with his hands; when he went into the room he pulled the door to. I returned in five minutes, the soldier was still under the gateway when I came back, I heard of the robbery the same afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the magistrate that Jackson was the man - A. I could not say that it was him. I think if I had seen him with more soldiers I could have picked him out.</p>

On the evening of the 21st of May, between nine and ten o'clock, I was at the King's Head, public-house, in the Tower, with the prisoner, Pitfield - He had a silver watch with a metal chain. I saw something in his other hand, but do not know what it was. He changed a 1l. note to pay for his beer.</p>

            . I am an officer, and took the prisoner into custody; Pitfield was taken on the Friday after the robbery, and examined the next day. Hogg saw him on the 26th.</p>
               <p>PITFIELD, in his Defence, stated, that Mr. Mott took him to his lodgings, and gave him the watch to induce him to consent to certain indecencies, which so alarmed him that he ran out of the room with it, and then pledged it.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Did you, on the 21st of May, invite Pitfield to your lodgings - A. I did not; I was not out of the house all day. It was a very wet day - I did not see him at all that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time ever give him your nephew's watch - A. No; nor did I ever make any proposal to him of the nature he has alluded to, at any time whatever. Doubikin married my neice. I was at home until eleven o'clock, I then locked my door, went down, and spent the afternoon with my landlord, stopped there until about five o'clock, I then went up stairs and found my door broken open.</p>

            Then you was actually at home at the time of the robbery - A. I was in the parlour with my landlord. The prisoner has spoken falsely.</p>
               <p>JOHN KEILY (called on the part of the prisoner PIT-FIELD). I was at home all day-Mr. Mott came into my apartment between four and five o'clock, before the robbery, and stopped until it was found out. He set half an hour with me.</p>
               <p>DOUBIKIN re-examined. Mr. Mott is my wife's uncle. I never knew him at any time to have the least propensity to any such indecency.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman N</hi> 229). On Saturday morning, 9th June, about 2.45, I was on duty at the corner of Albert Terrace, and saw the prisoner, with two other young men, standing at the corner—I watched them from one street to another, and they watched me for a considerable time—I went down the next street, and saw them all three again at the corner of Russell Court—they went through there, and I lost sight of them for about ten minutes—I next saw them in Chapel Street; the prisoner was on the pavement and the other two were in the court—I concealed myself in a doorway—they all three crossed the road into White Conduit Street, and stayed there about three minutes—the prisoner came back to the corner and looked down Chapel Street—there was no other person in the street—I went back to Albert Terrace and saw the prisoner leave the doorstep of No. 2—as soon as he saw me he ran away, down Albert Street into Denmark Street—I went the reverse way and met him—I took hold of his arm, and asked him what he was loitering about for at that hour in the morning—he said "Nothing," that he lived in Elliott's Place, Essex Road, and he could not sleep for the bugs—I said "Where are those other two men that were with you a few minutes ago"—he said "Gone to work"—I said "Where"—he said "At Batey's Ginger-Beer Manufactory"—I said "Where do you work"—he said "At a milk shop in Camden Terrace"—I took him back to the corner of Albert Terrace, and discovered the fanlight of No. 2 wide open—I rang Mr. Prior up, and when he came down I took the prisoner</p>

               <p>into the shop—I noticed that the things were disarranged and the doors open—the strings supporting the fanlight were cut, which would let the fanlight drop so that a person could get in easily—there was a very strong broken bell on the side of the door; any one could easily put their feet on that and get to the fanlight—the prisoner was wearing cloth trowsers, I believe.</p>

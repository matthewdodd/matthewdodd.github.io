                  </hi>. I am a market-gardener, and live at Enfield Highway. I occupy myself a good deal in inventing new varieties of rhubarb-roots—I have done so for many years, and my father before me—previous to Feb., 1849, I had been endeavouring to cultivate one particular species—I had 200 of them, and I lost about half of them either the latter end of Feb. or the beginning of March, 1849—I inquired for them in the neighbourhood directly, and offered a reward, but heard nothing of them—last month I went, from information, to the prisoner, who has a small garden at Enfield—I there found the roots that I had lost last year: they had been cut, and planted again, and were growing—I am able to swear that they were mine—I knew them by their peculiarity, by the leaf and stalk—I had some of them dug up—I believe the number I saw growing there would correspond with what I lost—they were raised from seed; I got the seedlings from one of my own—I asked the prisoner where he got them—he said he had raised them from sorts growing in his other garden—I went to his other garden, and found nothing but quite a common root—it is quite impossible that they could have been raised from any of them.</p>

               <p>and cultivation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it is capable of being changed—there are perhaps many thousand varieties of rhubarb growing—I can say that amongst these there is none of the sort I lost—that I lost in Feb., 1849, would be the same in May, 1850—when I lost them, they were in roots, cut up, without any leaves on them—when I found them, they were growing in the garden with stems a foot long—the prisoner's garden is three or four miles from me—I have seen him before; he is a gardener—I understood afterwards that the other garden belonged to some one that he bad let it to—I will pledge my path that they were the same plants that I lost, only they had been separated afterwards—I have known different roots produced from the same seed.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARNELL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long would it take you to collect these 200 plants? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps four or five years—they came from one seed at first—from the seed we always get a variety—I never saw two alike yet.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been six years in the prisoner's service. He is a market-gardener, and deals in rhubarb—I know the rhubarb that the prose<lb></lb>cutor examined—about three years ago I helped the prisoner to take up some roots of rhubarb out of his old garden, and took them to the garden which he now holds—I have been to the old garden since, and looked carefully over it—we found two seedlings alike, the prisoner has told me he raises from seed, and I have helped him part it—I helped him to plant the very same roots that Mr. Mitchell took away—the prisoner gave up the old garden soon after Christmas—we took the roots up from there, and planted them in the other garden—his present garden is quite open; it is not far off the public road—I have lived in that neighbourhood all my life.</p>

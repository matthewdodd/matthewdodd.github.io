John Barrett. I keep the Magpie—on 15th October, about three o'clock, Eastell spoke to me—I examined the van and found a black Bag, which I examined in Butler's presence—it contained 49 shillings, which I handed to a constable.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. It is a case of mistaken identity. On 15th October went into the Horse Shoe public-house. Mr. Rawlings came in and said "What is this? you know all about it." He went out and Eastell said "This is one of them." He took away my money and gave me in charge I work for Mr. Toby, a bootmaker, of London Bridge, and for Mr. Allen, of Dover Street, Borough, and I have worked in the telegraph, Office Thread needle Street. I have been in prison five weeks, and have A wife and two young children unprovided for.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Charles Boyce, of Strath<lb></lb>more-terrace, Shadwell, in the parish of St. George's in the East. The prisoner works at Mr. Frost's rope-ground, which is nearly opposite my house—I have been in the habit of seeing him often—he comes there usually of a morning for coffee—on the 20th of Jan. I had been up stairs, and brought down a gown and a purse with it—I placed the dress on the back of a chair to air at the fire, and the purse I put on the sofa—it contained five sove<lb></lb>reigns and one half-sovereign, two half-crowns, and a shilling, a gold ring, a gold chain, and six duplicates—before I had time to change my dress the prisoner came in with other boys, Page, Pitt, and Cotton, for some coffee—hearing them come in, I picked up my dress and ran up stairs to dress myself, leaving my purse on the sofa—I forgot it—I came down in a few minutes, before the lads had left and cut some bread and butter for Page—the prisoner was sitting close to where I had laid my purse—Page sat close by him and Cotton on the opposite side, away from them—Pitt came in afterwards—he was not with them at first—they all went away in six or seven minutes after I came down, and a few minutes after they were gone I missed my purse—it did not exceed a quarter of an hour altogether—a policeman was called in—this is my purse (<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 149.) On the 20th of January, in consequence of information, I went to the house of Mr. Boyce, and from there to Frost's rope-ground, and took the prisoners Cotton, Page, and Pitt, into custody—I searched them at the station, but found nothing on them—I told them they were charged with stealing five sovereigns and one half-sovereign, two half-crowns, a shilling, a gold chain, gold ring, and some duplicates—they denied all knowledge of it—I afterwards went back to Frost's rope<lb></lb>ground, where the boys work—there is a wheel there used for turning—I there found a purse with a sovereign in it, a gold chain, and a gold ring, which I produce—it also contained two half-crowns and one shilling—I still went on searching, and found two more sovereigns under the wheel, among the dirt near where I had found the others—I saw six duplicates turned over on the ground at the side of the wheel, where Page was at work—I believe Mr. Boyce turned them over and said, "Here are the tickets"—I afterwards went to the station, where all the boys were, and showed them the purse I had found—the pri<lb></lb>soner said he thought it was the other boy's purse, he had picked it up and put it in his pocket out of a lark.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 99.) I was at the station on the morn<lb></lb>ing in question—I heard the three boys and the prisoner talking together, and asked them what they were talking about—Page said, pointing to the prisoner, "That is the boy who has got the money"—I asked Page what the prisoner had done with it—he said, "He has thrown it down under the wheel</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Sion College-gardens, London-wall, and am a parish clerk. I remember Saturday night, 12th July, I shall never forget it—I was in Foster-lane, at the back of the Post-office, returning home, at a quarter past 10 o'clock, or shortly after—I had occasion to go into a urinal there—I did not notice the prisoner until after I had come out of it—the first thing that attracted my attention was somebody behind me, kicking against my heel, ad though by accident—I turned round, and the prisoner was behind me, he had apparently come out of the urinal; I think he was on my left hand—the said, "Where are you going?"—I said "Going; going home, of course"—he said, "Sir, I am a very poor youth I am starving—I replied, "I cannot help that, you are a stranger to me I have nothing for you"—he said, "Sir, I am starving"—I replied, "I have nothing for you"—he then said, in a louder tone, "You are a gentleman, I am starving, money I want, and money I must and will have"—I replied, "You will have none from me, that is very certain"—he said, "If I do not I will bring a charge against you"—I replied, "A charge! I do not know what you mean by a charge, neither do I know who you are"—he then in<lb></lb>formed me that a policeman bad obtained fifty golden sovereigns from a</p>

               <p>person in Houndsditch by only sticking to him, but he, the prisoner, was starving, and only wanted a few shillings—I became paralysed by fear—I was walking on while this was pausing, I never stopped at all till I got to the gate of Sion College—the prisoner followed me, and kept close by my side—I had an umbrella in my hand—when I bad got within a abort dis<lb></lb>tance of the College-gate, the prisoner said, "I need not follow you any further"—while I was opening the gate, which is a heavy massive iron gate, with my right band, the prisoner sprang forward and seized my umbrella from me, exclaiming, "By God I am an honest man, I am starving, I will not give up the umbrella unless you give me two shillings"—I went into the house for the purpose of getting some money, I left him outside the gate—I came back immediately with half a crown in my pocket, and the prisoner was gone, umbrella and all—I made a communication to the police next day, but I spoke to Mr. Lincoln that stone night, be resides in the house—on Monday night, the 14th, I saw the prisoner again, near 10 o'dock; he came to the house twice, the first time I was out—Mr. Lincoln opened the door to him—I was informed I was wanted, I went out and saw the prisoner on the mat in the passage; be took off his cap, made a police bow, and said, "Good evening, Sir"—I said, "Good evening, do you wish to see me"—he said, "Yes; you remember Saturday evening, I have, called for 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," but did not say what it was for—ie asked me to walk out—I went out—during this time Mr. Lincoln went for a constable; that was by arrangement—when I went out with the prisoner, he said, "Sir, you no doubt thought my conduct strange in nut returning with the umbrella, which you entrusted to my care"—I replied, "You mean the umbrella which you forcibly took from my possession?"—he said, "Do not say so"—I said, "I do say so, and although you might he starving, such an act was very wrong"—he said, "After I left you I met my father, who asked me some questions about the umbrella, I became confused, he found me out in two lies; I than toto him all about you, and my father said you must be a b—b—"—I said, "This is strange language, I do not understand it"—at that moment the police con<lb></lb>stable shook the front gates, in London-wall, where we had arrived by that time—the gates were looked; the constable said to me, "Sir, are the gates locked?"—I said, "It appears so, have you not your key?"—the prisoner laid to me, "Sir, what do the police want here?"—I said, "They have free access here when they please"—he said, "But what do they want have now?"—I replied, "They come in and out here when they please"—he said, "Sir, it seems very strange for us to stand here talking, let us take a little walk, and I will show you where your umbrella is"—I said, "I must inform the porter that the police are locked out here"—I then went to the gate in Philip-lane, on the outside of which were Mr. Lincoln, and the police constable, and on the inside stood Mr. May, the porter; and I gave the prisoner in charge for stealing my umbrella, and endeavouring to obtain money by threats—the prisoner said nothing then that I heard, but at the station house be denied all knowledge of it, and wondered that I was not struck dead, for he had not seen any umbrella—Mr. Lincoln went with me to the station in Moor-lane—the prisoner said he did not know why he was given in charge, and wondered God had not struck me dead, that I was a wicked man—the inspector read the charge to him twice.—he took the umbrella from me by force; I held it tightly, not that it would take great force to take anything from me, because I am not strong—there is not the slightest truth in the suggestion that I committed any assault upon him—I never gave bun any money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Why did you not give me in charge when I robbed you of the umbrella, as you specify? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because you had terrified me—you said that you would bring a charge against me—you did not name the charge—you said, "A charge"—I did not say before the Magistrate that you said an "unnatural charge"—I did not use that word—I did not give you 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., nor any money—I had no money about me—I did not tell the Magistrate I had half a crown, but I had not change, or I should have given you 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said "I went up stairs and brought a half crown down in my pocket"—you did not tell me that you would give me in charge for catching hold of your person in the urinal, nor did I say "I hope you are not going to serve me as the policeman served Mr. Strange, give me in charge;" it is utterly false, every word—I did not know the name of Strange till you mentioned it—I did not say as we were going along, "Have you seen a case in the paper con<lb></lb>cerning Mr. Strange?"—I knew nothing of it, and do not to this day.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the same house with Mr. Dye. About a quarter to 10 o'clock, on the night of the 14th, the prisoner came to the door with a knock and a ring; I answered the door—he inquired if Mr. Dye was in the way—he used the name, "Mr. Dye"—I told him he was not—he inquired what time he would be in the way—I told him about 10 o'clock, or a very little after—he then asked what time he could see him in the morn<lb></lb>ing—I told him about 8 o'clock—he said, that would be rather incon<lb></lb>venient for him, he would rather see him that evening if he could—I said, "If you will leave your name or address, or your business, I will inform Mr. Dye when he comes in;" but he said he could not leave his name, nor yet his business, he must call again in about a quarter of an hour or so—he called again in about a quarter of an hour—I did not see him then—during that time Mr. Dye had come in, and I had told him about the person calling, and when he came the second time, I directly went for a constable, after desiring the porter to lock the gates—I got Lewis, the constable, and came back with him to the gate—I was present when Mr. Dye gave the prisoner in charge—the prisoner said nothing that I heard till he got to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the cashiers in the Union Bank of London, Charing-cross branch—the prisoner came there on 21st December last, and brought this cheque, dated 20th December, 1860; drawn on the Union Bank of London by Dodds and Gregg, payable to James Dodds—Messrs. Dodds and Gregg have an account at the bank—I detained the cheque and the prisoner also—I gave it to the manager, Mr. Green.</p>

I am assistant manager of the Union Bank of London, Charing-cross branch—on 21st December this cheque was brought to me by the last witness—I looked at it and felt certain the signature was not genuine—I asked who presented the cheque, and told them to show the man into my room—the prisoner was brought in to me—I asked him who gave him the cheque—he said, "A person in the street," or, "A gentleman in the street"—I asked him if he knew him—he said, "No"—I said there was something wrong in the cheque, and that I must see him, where could he be found?—he said, "At a public-house at the corner of Whitcomb-street"—I said, "Then I will go with you there"—I did go with him there—I saw a policeman first—I and the policeman, and the prisoner, went there; we did not find anyone there.</p>

I am a parliamentary agent in partnership with Mr. Dodds, 18, Abingdon-street, Westminster; we have an account at the Union Bank, Charing-cross branch—the signature to this cheque is not in my handwriting or in that of my partner—in consequence of something I heard I examined my cheque-book—I have it with me—I find this cheque has been taken out—it exactly fits with the counterfoil—the numbers are the same, and the paper fits in—I missed the cheque from this book when I received a communication from the bank—I was in my office on 21st December—my cheque-book was in a drawer in the table, the drawer was not locked—a person of the name of Richard Jordan takes care of the chambers.</p>

The prisoner came to lodge with us about January; her husband came in the evening - they had the first floor, furnished, at 10 s. a week. He lived with her but a short time, and then went to Whitecross-street Prison, and then she moved into the second floor back room. This furniture was in that room. She afterwards moved into the lower room, and left in two or three months. She was charged with the robbery before she left, and apprehended.</p>

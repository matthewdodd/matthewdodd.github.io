                  </hi> I am eight years old, and live with my father and mother in Rufford's Buildings, Islington. On Thursday in last week, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Parsley-court—there are three steps at the top of the court—I was standing at the bottom by the steps—before I had time to put my foot to the top of the step, the prisoner hit me on my head with a broom—he said, "You are one of them, and take that; I will catch you one by one like that"—it made a cut on my head—the doctor has seen it—it bled—I had not spoken to the prisoner—I live at the top of the court—I had not seen him before he came to me at the steps—there were some other boys about—they were heaving mud in the prisoner's face—I was not one of them.</p>

                  </hi> On this night I saw a few boys in Parsley-court, and some were standing at the top of the court—they all ran away—I saw Cody coming up the court—directly he got to the steps the prisoner cut him over the head with the head of the broom—the boy had not said or done anything to him—he had not time to do anything—the prisoner said, "There is one for you," and then struck him.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon. The boy was brought to me—I found an incised wound on the top of the skull—it was a jagged wound, and might have been made with the sharp edge of a broom—it was a bad wound, and reached the cranium.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I did not try to hit the boy, only to save myself from a stone; he was heaving mud in my face, and calling me a heretic rascal; I was speaking to the lads about their not going to Church on Sunday, and they began heaving mud and stones at me, and saying, "We do not want any of your religion, you are nothing but an heretic rouge;" I have been three years and a half at that crossing, and never ill-used any one.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Pitt-street, Old Kent-road; the prisoner is a cooper and lodged in the same room with me—I have missed money for the last two months—on Saturday morning I missed some—on Tues<lb></lb>day night, in consequence of suspicion, the landlord marked three shillings in my presence—I put it into my trowsers pocket—the prisoner and I went up stairs together and went to bed—I put my trowsers on a chair at the foot of his bed—at five o'clock in the morning I awoke, when I heard him up—he was partly dressed—I got up immediately and put on my clothes and went down stairs—I searched my pocket before I went down and missed a marked shilling—I told the landlord—the prisoner went out of the house—Hollowed him and gave him in charge of a policeman—he was searched in my presence and one marked shilling was found upon him—I am quite me I had put that into my pocket the evening before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How came you to suspect such a thing? did you ever find any of the clothes moved or disturbed in any way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—some<lb></lb>times I did—the shillings were missed several nights before they were marked—I had marked money in my pocket too, but you happened to take it out of my purse.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN <hi rend="smallCaps">PARSONS</hi>. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner into custody yesterday morning at half-past five o'clock—I asked if he had got any money about him—he said 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him to let me look at it—I had seen one of the marked shillings which the prosecutor showed me before—directly he saw this he said, "This is my shilling"—I took it from the prisoner—he said he knew nothing at all about it—this is the same shilling—the others he showed me before were similar to this one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You said you took it from my person—I gave it you will<lb></lb>ingly out of my hand. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> You pulled it out of your waistcoat pocket and gave it to me after you were charged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I came by it honestly—I worked hard for it—it was paid to me on Saturday night for wages, and was never in his possession.</p>

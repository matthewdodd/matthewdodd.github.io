On the evening of the 25th of August I went out for a walk with my father and mother; my mother locked the top room door, and put the key in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100044"></xptr>kitchen - my father locked the gate, and put the key into his pocket; I returned home alone at a quarter before eight o'clock, and found the top door was then open - I went into the room, and there I saw a trunk which I had left shut, but not locked; the things were all in disorder - I then went into the parlour, and missed four silver spoons from the dining-table, which I had left after dinner; when my father came home I mentioned the circumstance, and then I missed three gowns from the bed-room - the prisoner was taken up the same evening; we did not miss the seal till it was found on the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MILLER. Q. Were you at the Police-office? A. Yes, the next morning; I believe the prisoner did mention a boy named Saunders, who I think has instigated him to do it - I have known him ever since March; he had a good character: he had the key to come in, in his turn to clean the boots and shoes.</p>

            . I am a constable. I heard of the robbery, and went to the prisoner's house in Drury-lane; I found him in bed, and asked him if he knew any thing at all about this property - he said No: his mother took out of his pocket two half-crowns, a heart, and a seal, which she said he said he found in St. James'-park - I questioned him rather closely, and his father and mother told him it would be better to tell the truth; he then said he had pawned the spoons and dresses at Mr. Newby's - that he tore up the duplicates, and threw them down by a lamppost; I went there, and found the bits of them; he wanted to say something to his brother in secret, but I would not let him - he then told me there was a purse under the bed; I went and found it, it had a sovereign, two shillings, and a sixpence in it; he said a boy named Saunders had been speaking about the money, and had instigated him to do it - I could not find who he was; the things had been pawned for 1l. 11s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say Saunders instigated him to steal them? A. No, he said to do it - he did not tell me that Saunders was in the service of the surveyor of the sewers, nor do I believe he has any boys in his employ- I found this key in his pocket.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he use the word "Instigated?" A. I do not know that he did - I do not know that his statement followed the mention of the pawning.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. The prisoner pawned these things with me, between six and nine o'clock in the evening; I have known him fifteen months  - he frequently pawned things for different people in the neighbourhood; he said these things were pawned for a Mrs. Shepherd, to make up her rent - I do not know that he ever pawned plate with me before, but he has pawned very good articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know the neighbours for whom he has pawned them? A. No; he said Mrs. Shepherd lodged at No. 3, Drury-lane - I knew him, and knew his mother - I had no suspicion of him; his parents, I believe, keep a house, but I am not certain of it; the things he pawned have generally been redeemed again.</p>

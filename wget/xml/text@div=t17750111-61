            , which I had paid. From several concurrent circumstances I had reason to suspect the prisoner. I began to call to mind the story he had told me, and to observe the improbability of it, that the ship was to go from London to Portsmouth<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177501110035"></xptr> and take in cargo. I have the copy of the letter here; I did not at that time miss the particulars in the indictment; the only loss I discovered at that time was my papers, and knowing this gold seal ring lay in the same bureau, in what we call a pigeon hole, and concluded that the person who had taken the letters had taken that ring. I found the cover of the letter upon which I remembered particularly the seal ring lying, the bureau was in a private office of my own, the prisoner had no business there, he sat in the adjoining room, which we call in Scotland, a writing chamber.</p>
               <p>Upon this I enquired whether he was gone from Edinburgh, I could not find him that night, the next day I found he had gone that very night, when the rumour began to get abroad. I applied to the sheriff of the county of Edinburgh, for a warrant to apprehend him for examination. I obtained that warrant, I had information he had fled to England in a very precipetant manner, I pursued him to London; I got by the assistance of Sir

            , Esq; in Clement-street, I knew it was his hand writing. I cast my eye upon the seal, it immediately struck me, it was the seal of that gold ring that I had lost, which was esteemed an antique, among the books, there were the confession of Faith, a book of Devotions, Mairs book-keeping, Thompson's Seasons and a demonstration of the existence of God; they were left in Mr. Russell's possession.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. These books (producing them) were found in the prisoner's trunk; they have been in my custody ever since. Mayne the prisoner was recommended by an acquaintance of mine; I believe he asked leave to send the trunk.</p>
               <p>Hart. These books are my property the first book that struck me was Kelson's Devotions, I know it from a particular examination, A nephew at my house was taught to repeat the hymns, he had wore it there; there was another book that I knew, entitled, A Demonstration of the Existence of God. I had two copied of Thomson's Seasons, but this was a large copy I bought of Mr. Donaldson; I know particularly the place where it stood, and in like manner the Confession of Faith: but that I might be under no doubt, I asked the prisoner; he acknowledged the books were mine, but said, he put them up by mistake. I wrote down to Edinburgh concerning then, and they wrote me word these books were wanting. I saw the prisoner when he was apprehended, and brought to Bow-street; I asked him for that seal ring, he refused it, I said, it was in vain to refuse it, because I had seen an impression upon his trunk, that I was absolutely certain was sealed with the impression of my ring; where did you get the impression?</p>
               <p>"I got it at the Golden Cross, Charing Cross." Said I,</p>
               <p>"well, we'll soon know that, I will send to the waiter." Said he,</p>
               <p>"I got it of a gentleman there." My clerk said,</p>
               <p>"why you have a seal to your watch." Said he,</p>
               <p>"that is a small gold seal." Said he,</p>
               <p>"let us see your watch:" immediately I knew the seal he had there to belong to me: that was a small seal set in gold: when I had it, the gold was wore away and the stone was dropped out; I put the stone in a writing box, so it was not set. On looking afterwards, I immediately knew the chain to be mine: the seal is a common head, I had sometimes sealed letters with. He said, he found it upon the stairs. I said, this chain is mine; where did you find it? He said, he bought it of a packman. I knew it from this circumstance, it had lost a swivel, and one of the links of the chain was broke, I had another put in, but it is a larger than any that were in before, I had another of the same size put opposite to it, and having it a long time, I know it perfectly well, on finding that seal, and on finding them impressions.

            . I live at Edinburgh and let post-chaise; the prisoner had a post-chaise of me, on the 1st of October, he put up the blinds of the chaise and after he had got about three hundred yards, he stopt and told the driver that if he was asked who was in the chaise he should tell them, two lads going into the country.</p>

            . The prisoner lodged at my house at Edinburgh eight or nine months; I have seen him wear this seal publicly, in September and October.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not very willing that his being at your house should be known, I believe, for a day or two before he set off for London?</p>
               <p>Plarack. He desired we should keep him private for he did not chuse to see any of his acquaintance.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you think he took a journey to London at so great an expence to secure this stone seal, and these paltry books?</p>
               <p>Plarack. He must be a good deal out of pocket: I packed the things up for him, and some books.</p>
               <p>Q. from the jury. Did you see the direction sealed upon the box?</p>
               <p>Plarack. I did not see any direction upon it.</p>
               <p>- Lewin. When I was walking with the prisoner, one day last summer, he took a small white stone out of his pocket unset, and asked me if I thought it worth setting. At first I thought it not worth setting, but upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177501110037"></xptr> a nearer view I thought it might bear setting. I saw him wear it publickly to his watch, after it was set. I have been intimate with him many years: he has a very good character for what I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mr. Mayne and his fellow clerks had access to Mr. Hart's books to read them for their amusement?</p>
               <p>Lewin. I have seen books in the prisoner's room with a coat of arms on them; he told me they were Mr. Hart's, and that he had the privilege of taking them to read.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's father. I know my son had a watch chain like this produced, before he went to live with Mr. Hart.</p>
               <p>- Young. I was clerk to Mr. Hart: we used frequently to take Mr. Hart's books home to read: he shewed me a chain that he had, and said, his father intended to buy him a watch: that is the chain, to the best of my knowledge, but it is so long ago that I can 't be certain.</p>

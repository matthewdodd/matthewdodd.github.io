               <p>Had not your friends cautioned you repeatedly, that he was married? - Never a one; she linked me in the mess; she deceived me in every thing, and so did he.</p>

               <p>Did not your friends caution you not to have any thing to do with him? - I had no friends in the case; I consulted my friends as far as I could; I went and told them what sort of a man he was.</p>

               <p>And it was uppermost in your mind? - My reason was, for his ill-treatment; I had the reason which every woman has, if they are going to be married, to wish to know whether he was a single man or not: I heard

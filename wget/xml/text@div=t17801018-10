               <p>Describe what he did? - He used me very indecent, dragged me by my arms; he mauled me in the coach and left my flesh all black.</p>
               <p>What sort of rudeness; did he want to take indecent liberties with you? - He did. I had the money when I went into the coach; when I came out I told the people where I lived, that I had been ill used, and robbed of two guineas, 18 s. and my buckles.</p>
               <p>How far was you gone before he did this? - Not above a quarter of a mile; he kept me three hours with him before he took me home.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180011"></xptr>He drove you home at last? - Yes; he did not bring me to the house, but brought me to the yard, and sent me home with a woman, a friend of his.</p>
               <p>When you got out of the coach had you your buckles? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Had you your money? - I had not; he insisted on my paying 3 s. for the coach. I am friendless; he sent the buckles by some person, and throwed them into the area.</p>
               <p>Was the money in a purse or loose in your pocket? - The two guineas were rolled up in a piece of paper, between the lining of my stays and the stays, and the silver was loose in my pocket.</p>
               <p>When did you first know that you had lost your buckles and money? - In the coach. I told him if he took my buckles my name was on them, and he would suffer for it. I did not know his face.</p>
               <p>Did you miss your money while you was in the coach? - No, not till after I got out of the coach.</p>
               <p>Did the coach put up at the place where he set you down? - It belongs to Mary-le-bonne. Woodall got the coach for me.</p>
               <p>What became of the coach when you got out? - It stood there till twelve o'clock; he was drinking with a smith's wife.</p>
               <p>What time did you get home? - Between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>You had been at Mr. Woodall's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was ill in the coach? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was the matter, had you drank any thing that did not agree with you? - Indeed I had, with this Woodall and his wife.</p>
               <p>What was it? - I do not know; I believe it was not very good.</p>
               <p>Had it got into your head? - I believe it had.</p>
               <p>You do not know what passed, but you observed him take the buckles? - I observed a person take my buckles, and bid him not rob me.</p>
               <p>A person, did you know who that person was? - There is a witness saw him come into the coach and stay half an hour.</p>
               <p>Did you know it was the coachman at the time? - There was nobody else to do it; he drove me into a square and dallied about. I knew him when I came home that it was the same person.</p>
               <p>Who lives in the house with you? - Three men and their wives. The men were not at hom e; Mrs. Lockwood was.</p>
               <p>Did their husbands come home that night? - Yes, one came home and lay with his wife who had not lain with her sixteen or eighteen years before.</p>
               <p>Is there any watchman in that quarter? - I believe there is.</p>
               <p>When you was robbed, and he stayed so long there with his coach, how came you not to have him taken up? - This Mrs. Lockwood I suppose had not the presence of mind to call a watchman.</p>
               <p>When did you take him up? - Two days after.</p>
               <p>When were the buckles thrown in the area? - Two days after.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You was at Mr. Woodall's in the morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time did you leave Woodall's? - About five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Woodall keeps a publick-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a widow? - About two years.</p>
               <p>How long have you been at service? - I have not been at service yet, my husband could support me without going to service.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Woodall? - I never saw him till I saw him the night before.</p>
               <p>How came you to know him the night before? - I may say I had been led astray out of my way; I asked a gentleman's servant the way, and he took me to this Woodall's house,</p>

               <p>Two glasses of gin? - I am not very sure whether one or two, she had got three guineas in her pocket. My wife perceived she was a little in liquor, and said, young woman, you had better give me your money and sit down in the parlour and have a little sleep. For it was a shame for a woman to go out in the condition she was in. She went and slept about four hours, I believe, till about five o'clock. My wife desired her to go out then as we had company coming into that room. I gave her her money and bid her make the best of her way. She was sick and was to give one shilling for cleaning the room. I gave her in change two guineas and eighteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Was Drury with her? - No, he went away when she went into that room.</p>
               <p>Who went to the coach with her? - My daughter, I, and a gentleman's servant; Mr. Long's servant.</p>
               <p>Who was the coachman? - I do not know the man; I did not know him when I saw him at the office. She came in the morning and asked me if I had got her money. I said no; and I was glad I had substantial witnesses that I gave her her money. Then she said if you have not got it, somebody has robbed me.</p>

She was rather in liquor.</p>

            . I am in partnership with the prosecutor in another business. I found the silk, cotton, and bobbins in a box, under a quantity of waste cotton, in the shop where the prisoner worked - he was not on the premises at that time.</p>

            . I am eighteen years old, and worked for Mr. Bestow, in the same room with the prisoner. Three days before this happened I saw him put three bobbins of silk into a bag, which was in the room; I said nothing to him, and told nobody of it; he put bag and all into the waste-box - I had seen him do this before but told nobody- he used to take them out in his pocket - sometimes he used to take three or four bobbins - he told me if I told master he would give me a good hiding - Capel and others were in the room - I saw him pull out a bobbin of silk which he had planted; I told about this on the Saturday when he was taken up - not before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. They call you doctor in the shop? A. Yes, Dr. Dodd. I have told the truth; I was never suspected of any thing; I was never at Worship-street, or any police office in my life - nor ever taken up about a sovereign - I do not know Mr. Nicholson - I was never in custody. I have been with the prosecutor two months - they used to turn us out of the shop sometimes, when they were going to rob him - I did not tell as they said they would whap me, and did whap the other boys; I told Ireland, the other boy, and they said they would whap me. I never was at a police-office, I swear.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your brother? A. He was sent away from here - transported about a handkerchief. I did not tell my master till after Capel was taken up. The first time I saw master robbed was the second day I went there.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old; if I take a false oath I shall be punished in the next world - I do not know my catechism. I work in the same room with Pickering - I saw him put some silk and cotton in a bag, and put it between the boards, about a fortnight or three weeks before he was apprehended - I did not tell what I had seen before he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are fourteen years old - have you ever been to church in your life? A. No; I have been to a Catholic school - I heard there about another world - I have been to chapel - I do not know the Creed, Commandments, or Lord's Prayer.</p>

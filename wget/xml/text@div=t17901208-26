               <p>I am an officer. On Friday the 3d of this month, about six in the evening, I was going down Fleet-lane; I turned up Seacoal-lane; I got up about twenty yards, and I observed the prisoner coming along with a box on his head; I had a suspicion, and turned back, and saw the prisoner turn into Fleet-lane; I followed him; he had taken the box off his head, and put it under his arm, making off very fast; I ran up to him, and I stopped him; I asked him what he had got? says he, it is a box; I asked him the contents? he said, he knew nothing at all of them, that he was going into Fleet-market with it; he said, one Manby knew of it; I knew Manby; he asked me to go up to Manby's house with him; I went, but Manby was not at home; we saw his wife; she said she knew nothing of that box; I took the prisoner to a public house; the box was locked; he wished a person to go to Manby's again; he said he got the box in Holborn, and begged of me to be as merciful as I could; he did not say how he got it; I took the prisoner to Wood-street Compter; a person that is here carried the box; after I had put him in the Compter, I went again to Manby's; he was come home at that time; I told him what had happened; he said he knew nothing of the business.</p>

               <p>I employed Mr. Manby to move my goods from Gray's-inn-lane to Union-court, on the 3d of this month; when the cart came, he sent two men with it; the box and a picture we missed; there was D. A. on the box; it contained the articles in the indictment: (enumerates them): Newman came to me to ask me if I had lost any thing? I went the next day to Guild-hall, and I saw my box and the man; I can swear to the property: (the box produced, and the things deposed to): amongst the other things, there was the certificate of my marriage.</p>

            . My master sent me with these goods to No. 34, Kenton-street, which runs out of Compton-street, Brunswick-square - when I got there I saw the prisoner standing against the corner of some railing; he said to me, "What a hell of a while you have been gone" - I said, "I hope you will excuse me as we have been very busy; I brought them as soon as possible" - he then said, "I believe I have got to give you a yellow-boy, have not I" - I said, "Yes you have" - I gave him the change, which was 17s. 11d.; he had taken the candles and other things before I gave him the change - he then gave me this medal and ran away - I called, Stop thief, and he was caught within two or three minutes - I am sure he is the same person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. What time of night was this? A. About ten o'clock - I had not seen the prisoner till I met him in Kenton-street - he had his hat on when he gave me this yellow-boy; he then ran away.</p>

            . I was going up Kenton-street about ten o'clock; I heard the cry of, Stop thief, and saw the prisoner running - I followed him, and when he got to the corner of Great Coram-street, he threw a parcel over a railing; I still followed him and cried, Stop thief - he turned into Wilmer-street, and was stopped - I heard the money drop in the shop, and the officer took it up; we then went to the prosecutor's - I then went and found the parcel over the railing, which contained the candles.</p>

               <p>MR. DOANE to MR. APPLETON. Q. Is Mrs. Lucas a customer of yours? A. There is no such person - it was in consequence of receiving this paper that I sent the goods; I parted with them entirely in consequence of this note - people come into houses in these streets and leave them again very soon - I have inquired into the prisoner's character; it has been very good.</p>

               <p>JOHN JACKSON. I am seventeen years old, and live in Widegate-street, Bishopsgate. On Sunday, the 24th of April, about nine o'clock in the evening, I knocked at my master's door, Mr. Field's, in <placeName id="t18250519-67-crimeloc398">Widegate-street</placeName>

I answered; and after the door was opened two persons came and pushed me into the passage - the landlady had gone up stairs - the prisoner held me while the other took my watch from my fob and ran off with it; I tried to go after him, but the prisoner still held me to prevent my pursuing; I saw the other turn the corner of Sandy-street, and when he had got away I held the prisoner, and cried out Stop thief! a milk-man came and helped me to take him to the watch-house; he never got out of my hold. I charged him at the watch-house with assisting the man in robbing me of my watch - the milkman was not present when the watch was taken; I never let go of the prisoner, and am certain he is the man who held me - it was a silver hunting watch, worth 30 s., and had a chain and keys, attached to it. I have never found it.</p>

            . I am a ward officer of Bishopsgate. I got to the watch-house about two minutes after the prisoner had been brought in. The prosecutor stated the case in rather stronger terms than he has now - I do not recollect that the prisoner denied it, but there was a confusion with the people about.</p>

I am an artist, and occupy a shop and two parlours in the house of Edward M'Dermott, of No. 16, Rath<lb></lb>bone-place; he lives in the house, and sleeps there—I believe the parish is called Middlesex—on the morning of 15th Jan., I was asleep in the back parlour; I heard a noise about 1 o'clock, and got out of bed and lighted a candle—I went out of the room, but saw no one—I then returned to bed, and about an hour afterwards I heard a noise again—I went and listened, and saw the prisoner Jones coming downstairs from the first floor, passing me—I saw a light, which I suppose came from the first floor—Jones had no light—I ran into the front parlour, and came out again; Jones passed me, and went out at the street door—I did not hear any sound of his opening it, and could not say whether it was open or not—I followed him five or six yards into the street; I was undressed—I cried, "Police!" and "Thief!"—I generally go in through the shop—there are other lodgers in the house, each of whom has a latch key.</p>

On 15th Jan., about 5 minutes to 2 o'clock in the morning I was at the corner of Sutton-street, and heard a rattle springing—I saw the prisoner Kent running by the enclosure of the square—I took him into custody, and asked him why he was running—he said that he was not running, for he came in that direction, pointing to Greek-street—I had seen him running towards Greek-street, at the top of his speed, in a direction from Rathbone-place, and he was quite out of breath—Charles-street is directly opposite—about twenty minutes after<lb></lb>wards I went to the enclosure of Soho-square, and found a knife within five yards of where I apprehended him, lying on the footway—I found a lucifer match in his right hand waistcoat pocket, which corresponded with some other lucifer matches which were shown to me by the inspector—Rathbone-place is in the parish of Marylebone.</p>

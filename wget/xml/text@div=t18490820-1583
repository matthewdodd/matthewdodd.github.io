                  </hi>. I am a tailor, in Clifford-street, Bond-street. On 13th July, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I heard a knocking—I went to the door, and missed a leaden pump, which had been safe in the area, on my premises, the night before—the lead was cut which had fastened the pump to the pipe—a man told me that they bad turned up Burlington-street—I went and saw the prisoners both together—Campbell had the pump on his shoulder, and Wilson had a bag of tools—I followed them till I saw a policeman in South-row, whioh is a quarter of a mile from my house—the policeman went and spoke to them, and they told him they were employed by Mr. Lamb, a plumber, in Crown-street, St. Giles's—we went there, and he said he did not know them—Wilson said that was not the Mr. Lamb that had employed him—this is my pump—it was in an enclosed area—the door was fast—they must have lifted the pump over—they might have separated it from the pipe by tools on the outside.</p>

I was requested to take the prisoners—Campbell had the pump, and Wilson a bag of tools, such as plumbers use—I asked where they were going, and Wilson said to Crown-street, to Mr. Lamb, who had sent them to take the pump—Mr. Wyatt said it was all false—I went with the prisoners to Crown-street—Mr. Lamb's son came out and said, he did not know the prisoners; they were never in his employ—Wilson said to me before Mr. Lamb came out, "That is not the Mr. Lamb that employed us"—they did not offer to go with me to any other Mr. Lamb.</p>

On the 20th of December, at eleven o'clock in the morning, I was speaking to a neighbour over the way; I had not left the shop more than four minutes - I could see all over the shop; I left nobody there; I saw the prisoner, who is quite a stranger, come out of the shop with a bale of cloth under his arm- it measures nineteen yards, and was in my hands ten minutes before; it was just inside the door - he got about ten yards from the shop with it when I took hold of him, and asked where he got it; he said a man had asked him to carry it somewhere - he could not tell me where; no man was near; here is the cloth - the lowest value of it is 12l.; Mr. Fenwick lives there - it is his dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Has he any partner? A. No - I am certain the cloth was inside the house; I saw him come out - I did not go into the shop till I took him back; he said a man at the door gave it to him - he did not attempt to run away.</p>
               <p>EDWARD SEABORNE. I am an officer and took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down to the West India Docks, and saw a man come out of the shop - I thought he was the master; he said, "Carry this as far as the bridge, I will pay you for it" - I said I had nothing to do, and would carry it; I saw two men coming, but did not attempt to run away - I turned round, and the man who gave it to me was gone.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

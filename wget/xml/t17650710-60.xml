            . On the 27th of June I was sent to Mr. More in Chiswell-street for a silk breechespiece: I met with the prisoner going; I bid him stay at the door whilst I went in for the piece: he did; going home, I met a cooper my acquaintance; we all three went in to drink at Mr. Edwards's, in <placeName id="t17650710-60-crimeloc338">Old-street</placeName>

               <p>Mr. Notley. I live with Mr. Kates in Chandois-street; the prisoner pledged this breeches-piece with me the 27th of June, about three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. How could you think this was his property? you pawnbrokers will not rest, it is plainly seen, till some of you are brought to the bar to answer with these people. You every day of your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176507100043"></xptr> lives endanger yourselves of being convicted by this sort of practice. I hope, at least, the reprimand you have received will be of use to you; and, when you report it to your master, I hope it will be of use to him. If pawnbrokers will suffer their people to carry on their business thus, it will end, most certainly, in their going abroad.

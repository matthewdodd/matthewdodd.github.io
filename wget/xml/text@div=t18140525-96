            . I am a carver and gilder; I reside in Eagle-street, Red Lion-square. I was employed by the Solicitor of the Bank for the purpose of detecting the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner the first time - A. On the 4th of February; I saw him standing at the door of the Grapes public-house, the corner of Catherine Wheel-alley; I had nothing to say to him on that day. On the <rs id="t18140525-96-cd560" type="crimeDate">8th of February</rs>

I sat down in his parlour about two hours; he came home. I told him, I wanted to buy tokens of him; he brought me a dozen. I gave him a pound for a dozen three-shilling tokens; I did not look at them; I put them into my pocket. I immediately went, and joined Read and Matthews, two officers, that were waiting at a near public-house for me. I marked them, and delivered them to Mr. Westwood. When I marked them, I saw they were three-shilling tokens.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at them, and see whether they are the three-shilling tokens that you marked, and delivered to Mr. Westwood - A. They are the same. I saw the prisoner again on the 10th of February, between eleven and twelve in the forenoon; I told him I did not like the tokens very well; I wished he could furnish me with some better. He took me into the back yard; he produced one; he jinked it up. I told him, I thought it jinked pretty well; that I would purchase another dozen. He shewed me that one as a sample. I thought it jinked better than the others had done. I bought a dozen, and gave him the same price. When I came out of the yard back again, the son beckoned him of one-side; his father went out; they spoke to each other, and then the son brought me the twelve tokens. I paid the father for them. They were delivered to me in the presence of the father. I having received them of the son, and bargained with the father, I went and joined the officers, who were waiting at the public-house, the same as before; I told them that I had made a purchase. Then I went to the Solicitor of the Bank's office, and delivered the twelve tokens to Mr. Westwood, after I had marked them. These are the twelve tokens that I marked on the 10th.</p>

            . I am an officer. I watched Lucas to the prisoner's house; Lee was with me. I apprehended the prisoner on the 24th of February; Lucas went into the Three Pigeons public-house, and pointed the prisoner out to me. I searched the prisoner. I found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>MR. WESTWOOD. Q. Did you receive these tokens of Lucas - A. I did. I received the three different parcels, at three different times; all on the same day he purchased them. The prisoner was asked by the magistrate, whether he had ever seen Lucas before; he denied all knowledge of Lucas, and stated, that he had never seen him before.</p>

The prisoner asked me for a pen and ink, and a bit of paper, and said, if I had not got any he would send his man out for some; he said he wanted to make out a bill against one Mr. Potts, a cow-keeper; he then had sixpenny worth of rum and water, and asked me to give him change for a ten pound, or a fifteen pound note; I told him I would try what I could do, and went up stairs, and fetched four one pound notes, a half-guinea, a seven-shilling-piece, and a half-crown, which I put upon the table; he said that was of no use, for he wanted to give change for a ten, or a fifteen pound note, remarking, at the same time, to me, that these gentlefolks did not care how they served a poor fellow when they got in his debt; he then went away, leaving the change, saying, I will be back in five minutes; the man that was with him asked me where I came from; I told him I came from Deptford, and he seemed to be acquainted with every body that I knew at Deptford. The prisoner then came back, and said, what sum can you make up; I said, there is five pounds, as I told you before; he said, there is five take that; he took it up, and said he would be back in five or ten minutes, and told the other man to wait; some people came in to be served, and when the man saw me busy, he came and asked me if I could get him a bit of salmon, I called to my niece to get some; the man said, I will not trouble your niece, I will go myself if you will lend me a bason; I gave him a bason, and saw no more of either of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You laid the money down upon the table, and has no objection to his taking it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You expected he would return, and pay you? - A. Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He had not shewed you any note? - A. No; and I think I must have been berest of my senses to let him have it.</p>
               <p>Q. You expected a five pound note for it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And instead of giving you a five pound note, he took up the money and walked off with it? - A. Yes.</p>

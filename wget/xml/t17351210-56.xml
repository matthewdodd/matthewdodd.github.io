            . When he left Sr. Wolstan's, he came to my House in Covent-Garden, and had two old Shirts, and a Bob-wig, which he said Sir Wolstan gave him; they were very old Shirts, and not fit for Sir Wolstan to wear.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I lived with Sir Wolstan from May the first, to June the twenty second. And when I went into his service, I agreed to have his old Cloaths. One day as I was puting on his Shirt, he asked me why I gave him a torn Shirt, Sir, says I, they are all so bad the Maids can't mend them. Well, says he, I have got some new Cloth, and I 'll have Caps made of the best of these, and do you see that the Maids do not make Aprons af the rest. I told him I would take care of that for my own sake; but Sir, says I. you have got several old mouldy Wigs, what shall I do with them? He bid me take 'em, and do what I would with them.</p>
               <p>Sir Wolstan. I never said so.</p>
               <p>- Kynaston, Esq; Five Years ago the Prisoner left my Fathers Service, and had a very honest Character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Moore. The Prisoner has been my Servant since he left Sir Wolstan. I have trusted him with considerable Sums of Money, and found him very honest. Sir Wolstan 's Brother's Lady recommended him to my Sister.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Freer. I thought him very honest, tho' Sir Wolstan did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Griffith. Six Years ago I knew him at Oswestree, where I lived, and he served his time, and I have known him since in London. He had a very good Character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Union-terrace, in the parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. I have seen two gowns, a gown-skirt, a cloak, and a table-cloth in the possession of a policeman—they are my property—I missed them from the front parlour between six and seven o'clock on Friday night, the 1st of March—I was in the kitchen—the door was shut—I do not know how they could have entered, except by a false key—I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

On the 1st of March, a little after seven o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner in Great Union-street, forty or fifty yards from Mr. Cooper's with this bundle—I was about to stop him—he dropped it, and ran away—I picked it up, hallooed, "Stop thief," and another constable stopped him and brought him—I came up in about a minute after—I am sure he is the man that dropped the bundle.</p>

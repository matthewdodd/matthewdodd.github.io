             sworn. - I am the wife of John Dibble: Last Saturday week, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, I went to call my husband from a few doors off, and in returning home I saw two boys come out of my door, the prisoner at the bar had something under his arm, but I did not take any notice of it; I took hold of him, and said, do you want any thing, and he immediately ran past me; I then observed a handkerchief which was falling under his arm; I called to him, and told him, he would lose his things; I then saw a cap lying at the threshold of the door; my husband then came up, and ran after him, and brought him back; I am pretty sure he is the boy; he rather resisted when my husband brought him back; he had under his jacket a shirt and pillowcase; he was taken to the officer's in Shorter-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It was dusk? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And the boy had a round hat on? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.He is but a very little boy, and therefore you could not very well have seen his face, you being so much taller? - A. That is the boy that had the clothes under his arm when he went from my door, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never tell any body you did not think that was the boy you first saw at your door? - A. No; I never did.</p>
               <p>JOHN DIBBLE sworn. - In consequence of what my wife told me, I went after the prisoner; he was then about seven or eight yards from me; I came up to him, and asked him what he had been doing; he said, nothing, he was upon his master's business; I saw the shirt under his coat.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q.Was it wet? - A. Yes; just wrung out from the wash-tub; I took the shirt and pillow-case from under his jacket, and carried it with the boy to the officer.(The officer produced the property, which was deposed to by Mrs. Dibble).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going of an errand; my mistress sent me to look for my master, and I saw two boys come out of this shop and drop something, and run away; I picked it up; the gentleman came after me, and asked me what I had got; I said I had got a prize, but I did not know what it was.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18010218-20-verdict104" type="verdictDescription">

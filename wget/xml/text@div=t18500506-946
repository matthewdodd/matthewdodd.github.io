Glyn, for the purpose of being cashed—checks coming in a body are termed "a charge"(<hi rend="italic">referring to a book</hi>)—the gross amount of the charge that Mr. Hobson brought in was 4,269<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it consisted of checks on Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am deputy-chairman of the Globe Insurance Company. Mr. George Carr Glyn is the treasurer, and was so in Feb. last—Mr. Edward Goldsmid, the director, is the chairman—there are other directors, and were so in Feb.—I am a director, and also a trustee, with others, and was so in Feb.—the prisoner was a clerk to the Company—he was appointed by the directors—it is the practice to nominate by an indi<lb></lb>vidual</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185005060063"></xptr>
               <p>director, he was appointed by the directors—the directors manage the business of the Company at the office—they employ clerks and servants for that purpose—the clerks act under their direction in the management of the business—the prisoner was an assistant clerk in the accountant's-office, one of his principal duties was the checking of the payments at the bankers' with the bankers' pass-books, and once every week, on the Wednes<lb></lb>day morning, to bring down the state of the balances of cash at the bankers' to the secretary, in order that I and the secretary might see the state of the funds of the Company, and provide accordingly—that duty was imposed upon him by the direction and orders of the directors—the Company have in use three classes of checks—those checks are provided by the directors—after the pass-book has been returned to the prisoner, in the course of his duty, it contains in the pocket the checks which have been paid—it is the prisoner's duty first to verify those checks by the pass-book, then preserve them, and tie them up in bundles in the regular order of payment, so that they might remain as regular vouchers if called for—they are kept at vouchers, both for the directors and the bank, as we keep all such documents.</p>

               <p>clerk at a salary of so much a year, precisely on the same footing as the other clerks and servants in the establishment; his salary increased yearly as the other clerks, according to age—(<hi rend="italic">the letter from the prisoner to Mr. Tite was here read, as follows:</hi> "6th March, 1850. Sir, after the accusation brought against me yesterday, I have no alternative but to immediately tender my resignation, with thanks for the kindness I have received during the years I have been connected with the Company—should I be required, I shall be at the Olympic Theatre throughout the day; or should I leave, will name the hour of my return.")</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COCKBURN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long has he been in your em<lb></lb>ployment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think from 1832, I am not quite sure; more than ten years—he was always in the accountant's-office—he was paid by the Company, and was the Company's clerk—it was after I met him on the stairs that he spoke to me about sealing up his papers, and asked me to seal up other papers; I think he said the papers in the secretary's-office—I think there was some sort of specifi<lb></lb>cation, but not in his office—he said, "All the papers"—I understood him to mean all the books and papers in the cashier's, secretary's, and accountant's department—of course, the Fire and Country-office he could not mean—he did not ask me whether I had sealed up any other papers—he told me he was a proprietor—he is a shareholder, the holder of two shares—I presume he has received dividends on those shares.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the course of business when checks are drawn; I understand checks are drawn by three directors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The checks are drawn at a com<lb></lb>mittee, called the Treasury Committee—the order is that they shall be signed by the chairman or deputy-chairman, and by two directors, and countersigned by the cashier or secretary—it is the province of the Treasury Committee to sign checks—of that committee, the chairman and deputy-chairman are, <hi rend="italic">ex-officio,</hi> members—it is not necessary to have the signature of the chairman or deputy-chairman to the other warrants, but to the ordinary business it is—previous to a check of this kind being signed, it is called over, and passed at the Treasury Committee, claims and vouchers having passed previous committees—an entry is made of it—the committee-book is the primary record of it—that would contain an entry of the particulars, to whom payable, on what account, and the amount—it is entered in many other books afterwards, but no check would be drawn without that authority—it is entered when it is handed over to the party who comes for it—the checks generally received my signature, I think, with very few exceptions—it is the secretary's habit, after it has been read to the committee, and approved, to call them over to me, indi<lb></lb>vidually; or, if I am not there, which is very rarely, to the chairman; and my signature was, in point of fact, the voucher that the check drawn on the blank check was consistent with the minute of the Treasury Committee—I mean to say checks come up unsigned, and my signature, or the signature of the chairman, is the voucher that it is correct in amount and date—all that would take place before the other directors signed—when the other directors have signed, they are placed in the hands of the clerk; and as he pays them, or delivers them out to the party who calls to claim them, it is recorded in another book of the Company—we have a counterfoil to our check-books—the counterfoil is in fact a copy of the check—the clerk I give the check to is a clerk in the cashier's-office, down-stairs—a minute is made in the cashier's-office before the clerk delivers it to the person in whose favour it is drawn, and then it is handed over at the counter to the person who comes for it—our books would furnish us with a complete record of all checks which are signed by the chairman, or deputy-chairman, and the directors, in the course of their</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that the blank-check book? (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; this is the check-book which was in use, and is in use still—it is the check-book for general purposes, losses and life-losses—it is the one with the globe on it—the prisoner had not access to that check-book—it was kept in the cashier's-office—it was mainly kept in an inner department of the cashier's-office, on the ground-floor—it was brought up to the board-room, but I never knew that it ever went higher, and I do not think it ever did—the prisoner, according to the course of business, had not access to this book—the checks are filled up by a particular clerk, Mr. Meedy—the prisoner's father was the cashier—it was his duty to take care of the check when ready for delivery, to lock it up, and to countersign it—it was not his duty to keep the blank book; a gentleman named Biggs, in the same office, kept that; he sits in the inner department—I find evidences of some leaves having been ab<lb></lb>stracted from this book; I cannot tell how many, several—two or three pages evidently—I know that the door of the place where it was kept has been open—I never saw the prisoner in that office, but it was his duty to go into that office on his arrival in the morning, to enter his name, and the time at which he came there, in the time-book—he had no other duty there—I have examined the time-book, and I find he did go there—he has signed his name on his arrival.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I understand you that the book was in the proper custody of another clerk, Mr. Biggs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the office was common to other clerks—the time-book was on a table in the outer office—this book was kept in the inner office—at that time in the morning it would be in a strong room, where the prisoner certainly could not get at it in the ordinary course of business—if he had been found in that room at that time in the morning, it would have excited observation—there are seven or eight clerks, whose business calls them into the outer office—they have also access to the inner office—it is an enclosure, a kind of high partition, which shuts off this parti<lb></lb>cular department of the lower office, and Mr. Biggs' seat—the other books I have spoken of, in which the record of every check drawn is kept, was in the custody of Mr. Watts, senior—they are seen once a month by the directors—we have those books, not in their original condition; they have been altered, not by us—there have been scratchings in that book as well as in the bankers' book—there are no leaves torn out of the cash-book.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farm-servant of Mr. Stephen Sabin, of Lewisham, the prosecutor. On 7th May, about a quarter-past six o'clock in the morning, I saw Reeves come over our yard gate, followed by young Fetherstone, Gould, Toms, Tubby, and Pearson, and they went into the stable—my master came out, and ordered them off, telling them they bad no business there—I heard Gould say they were there for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. rent—about half-past six, Sabin came in towards the stable—Gould met him, and spoke to him—he turned back, and I did not see him any more that day—Gould came back again—the elder Fetherston was there next day—they remained in the stable, in and out, till eight in the evening when my master, Mr. Turner, and Wallis went in, and master asked who was the broker's son—the men pointed him out, and master took hold of his collar and turned him out—the other men got between them in a cluster, and one of them knocked master's hat off—I could not see who it was—Tubby held up a stick, and said he would knock the first man down that came near him—one of them, I do not know which, pulled off his gloves and put up his hands, as if he meant to fight—we then left the stable, and left them there all night—next morning, about eight, I heard the elder Fether<lb></lb>ston call out at the yard-gate for one of his men—Reeves went, and I saw him take up the iron tyre of a cart-wheel, and knock the padlock off, which was on a chain on the gate leading into the road, and Mr. Fetherston came in—he then came round with a paper in his hand, went into the stable as if looking at the horses—he then came to the barn where I was, looked at the pigs, cows, and heifers, and I heard him say, "There is not sufficient to pay, we will have an entrance into the house"—all the prisoners were present except Sabin—they then went towards the house, and Reeves picked up a crowbar—I went into a cart-shed, right opposite the door, to see whether I could see, and when I got there they had forced an entrance into the house—I did not see them break in—I believe my master and mistress and the female servant were in the house—I have worked for Mr. Stephen Sabin twelve years, and have known him to have possession of this place twenty years, and he remained so till 7th May—I worked for his father—I do not know how young Sabin got in—the gate was locked then.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">STEPHEN SABIN</hi>. You asked me which of your men I wished to stay in possession—I did not give you any answer, and I am not aware that Mr. Turner did—you did not say to me, "If I leave my son in possession, will you treat him as one of the family."</p>
               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">TURNER</hi>. I remember Fetherston entering the house on 8th May—Mr. Sabin did not, in my presence, consent to any man being left in possession—I remember your wishing to go up-stairs to take an inventory, and the ladies saying it was not convenient, and asked you to wait two or three minutes—you said you would wait not only two or three minutes, but three hours, and that you would not even go up at all; but when you first came in, you began to <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> round us, and I did the same to you, and then you began to <hi rend="italic">sing a little small</hi>—I did not see anything in your conduct except that of a gentleman.</p>

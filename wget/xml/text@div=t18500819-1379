                  </hi>. My husband is a licensed-victualler, in Upper Thames-street. On 24th July, the prisoner came to my house about the middle of the day, for half a pint of beer—I served him, and he gave me a bad shilling, but I did not know it was bad when 1 took it—I gave him change, and he left—I put the shilling in the till, where I had no other money—in a few minutes I took it out, wrapped it up in paper, and put it by itself in a drawer at the back of the till—I saw the prisoner again at the latter end of July or the beginning of August—he came about three o'clock in the afternoon, for half a pint of beer, and gave me a shilling—I gave him change, and put that shilling in the till; there was no other there—shortly after he left, my daughter called my attention to that shilling—I took it out of the till, looked at it, and made a cross on it—it was a bad one—I placed it in the same paper with the other—on Friday, 9th Aug., the prisoner came</p>

Hunter to this deposition—I took the prisoner on 9th Aug. at Mrs. Shinkfield's—he was given into custody for passing a counterfeit shilling, which she said he had swallowed—I asked if he had passed anything pre<lb></lb>viously—she said, "He has; here are two bad shillings, which I can swear he has passed," and she gave them to me—these are them—the prisoner made no remark—I took him to the station—I found on him this tobacco-box, one farthing, and a knife—no other money—(<hi rend="italic">Deposition read</hi>—"Caroline Wilkins on her oath, says, I am the wife of William Wilkins, and live with my mother, Mrs. Shinkfield; in the afternoon of one day last week, I went to the till, and found a bad shilling in it; it was the only shilling that was there—I gave it to my mother who was standing by; the prisoner came on Tuesday afternoon last, he had half a pint of porter, and threw down a new shilling; I took it up and bit it; I found it bad, and threw it down, and he took it up and swallowed it; he said he had only swallowed a bit of tobacco.")</p>

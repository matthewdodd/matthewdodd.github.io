               <p>ELIZABETH STOKES. On the 14th of January, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was going from Fenchurch-street to Whitechapel - I had some grocery in one hand, and a small basket, in which was a purse, containing three sovereigns and some silver - there was a stoppage of carriages at the corner of the <placeName id="t18260112-179-crimeloc1002">Minories</placeName>

I saw the prisoner put his hand into the basket - there was a shorter boy with him who ran away; I did not see the prisoner hand any thing to him, but I called Stop thief! and the prisoner was taken.</p>

            . I was at the place when there was a stoppage - the prosecutrix had a basket in her hand, and a paper parcel. I saw the prisoner's hand in her basket; I took hold of his coat before he took it out - I did not see him take the purse out - I did not see any other boy.</p>

            . I saw the prosecutrix stopping to get across; she had got a small basket, with two covers to it; she had got hold of the lad's hand so tight that he could not get it out - she had a parcel, which slipped, and she took her hand to save it; she then kept his hand down again. I saw a little boy stoop, and then run away; I did not see any thing go out of the basket to the ground, nor the boy's hand go down from the basket - his hand was held down quite tight - I did not see any thing in it.</p>

            . I took the prisoner; he had nothing about him - I did not see any other boy; he said he had no other lad with him, and knew nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH STOKES re-examined. Q. Did you see the other boy run away? A. Yes. I looked into my basket as soon as I got over to the watch-house; I took hold of the prisoner's hand while it was in my basket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There were some carriages passing, and I could not get by; as I was passing this lady she took hold of my hand, and said it was in her basket, but I had not had it there, nor had I seen the purse.</p>

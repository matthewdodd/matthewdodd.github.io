            . I live servant with Mr. Mechi. On Saturday the 29th of June, I went out on an errand at half-past eleven o'clock in the morning; I returned and unlocked the kitchen door; I heard somebody up stairs; I went up and saw the prisoner come out of the bed-room; I asked what he wanted, he said, Captain Thacker. I said it was down lower, on the second floor; I saw a bundle in his arm, and I said he had a bundle, he said he had not - I came down and opened Captain Thacker's door, and called out to them to stop him; the prisoner left the bundle on the staircase; and ran away - he had carried the bundle from the cupboard in the bed-room to the staircase - I picked it up and gave it to the porter just in the same state that I had seen it in the prisoners hands - these<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040087"></xptr>things had all been in the drawer in the room - I know them to be Mr. Mechi's.</p>

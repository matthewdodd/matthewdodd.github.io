                  </hi>. I am a clerk. On the 29th of November I had a box—it contained a coat, a pair of drawers, and the other things, I believe, but I could not swear it, as I had not opened it—it came from my relations in the north—it arrived at the Leith and Berwick wharf, and came to Mr. Davison in Cannon-street—I got it off the cart at Whitechapel church, and was carry<lb></lb>tog it down the road, when a man dressed like a porter came to me, and said I had got a very heavy load—I said I had—he said he would put me in an easier way of carrying it—he put it on his shoulder, and carried it a little way, and let it fall—we took it up, and carried it to the Anchor and Crown, in Great Garden-street, when the prisoner came and stopped me, and wanted to know the contents of the box and where I got it from—I said had he authority for stopping me—he said he would tell me that by-and-by, and it was agreed we should take the box home, and see the contents of it there—we came out, and there was another man standing by the box beside the porter-man—we carried it a little further, and went to the next public-house, to Sir George Osborne's Head, in Princess-street, to ask the landlord permission to leave it there, till I went back to the City to satisfy him where I brought it from; and when we came</p>

               <p>out, the two men were gone with the box—I had left it with this porter<lb></lb>man and another man—neither of the men I left the box with are here—the prisoner had stopped me with the box—he would not allow me to carry it—I did not see the prisoner speak to either of the two men—he did not appear to know them—the prisoner and I were gone into the house, to ask leave to let the box lie there, till I went back with him to the City, to show where I got the box from—the prisoner asked to know the contend of the box, and said he suspected I had stolen it—I went after the other two, and this man was gone when I came back.</p>

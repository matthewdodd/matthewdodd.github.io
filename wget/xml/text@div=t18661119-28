                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 199). On 3rd November I took the prisoner and charged him with stealing a quantity of umbrellas—he was taken to Moor Lane station and charged with stealing ten dozen umbrellas—he said, "Not so many as that"—I conveyed him to the cell, and as I was about closing the door he said, "I may as well make a clean breast of it; the most I ever took was about two dozen"—I asked him what he had done with them—he told me he had pledged two or three lots at Mrs. Harrison's, in Aldersgate Street, and three or four lots in Newgate Street—I searched him and found 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2;<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him and some betting cards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I admit giving instructions that the umbrellas should go out, but it was with a very different motive to that imputed to me. The parcels contained four or five each, and he is correct in saying six parcels. I took about twenty umbrellas altogether. I totally deny steal<lb></lb>ing them or pawning them, but one or two friends asked me to get them umbrellas a little cheaper than they could get them at the retail place. I said, "Yes," and took out two or three for them to choose from. In doing so I have acted wrongly, but I paid the money I received for them to the managing clerk. If I charged them anything I took it for myself, as my salary was not enough to keep me. I have been guilty of a very silly action, but nothing for which he ought to have branded me with the name of felon. He does the second largest business in London, and it is only fea<lb></lb>sible that a few of his umbrellas should get into pawnshops by other means than mine, and neither of the pawnbrokers swear to me, whereas if I had taken as many as he says I should have been pretty well known. I had six years' good character when I went to him from Messrs. Ellis, Howell, and Co. <hi rend="smallCaps">

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner a lodger there? - I don't know that, I know when I came to my lodgings that night about twelve o'clock, I cannot tell exactly the day, I think it was the latter end of October; when I came into the house the gentlewoman told me that my trunk was broke open, I found it broke open, I lost three shirts, I value them at one pound ten shillings, they cost me fifteen shillings a piece, two shirts value fourteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they your wife's shirts? - No, I had them in my charge, they were none of mine; four neckcloths, two jean waistcoats, two pair of silk stockings, two cotton napkins and a pillow case, the muslin neckcloths are worth about ten shillings, they cost me four shillings more than that, two pair of silk stockings value eight shillings they are second hand; and the napkins two shillings; I saw them the morning before I went away from the lodgings, I have not seen them at all since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This is a common lodging house? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. A great number of different lodgers continually coming and going? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many different lodgers have you in the house? - About five.</p>
               <p>Q. Any body that wants a nights lodging may come there and have one? - No, no strangers are taken in the house, nor have been for many years.</p>

               <p>I keep this house, the house was broke open between seven and eight o'clock on Tuesday night, the prisoner took the lodging on the Monday, the day before that Tuesday; on Tuesday he came in with a large bundle of straw and rubbish, and took it up stairs, and left it there, and broke open the trunk, and took away Mr. Shannon's things.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that? - I am sure of it, because I was the last person that had been up stairs, and I was the first up there again after him.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your reason for thinking this man broke open the trunk? - There was no other person up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time you saw this trunk safe? - When I was up stairs making the beds in the forenoon about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. To Shannon. What time of the morning did you go out? - About seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first discover this trunk to be broke open? - About nine o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Whiston. What makes you think it was the prisoner? - There was no other person up stairs, neither man, woman, nor child at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon yourself to swear that there was neither man, woman, nor child up stairs besides the prisoner, from eleven o'clock in the forenoon, till nine at night? - I am sure there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many lodgers had you? - Five; they were all out.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any servant? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Any children grown up? - Three two boys and a girl. The eldest boy is twenty-three; the girl is sixteen, and the youngest boy is turned of twelve. The two eldest were out at work; the eldest son was at work in Fieldgate-street, Whitechapel; the youngest son was at home, he was the only person in the house with me; my daughter was at work in Moorfields. There was a lodger up the one pair of stairs, a woman with a child, her husband was out at work, she was there all the time.</p>

            What do you know of this cloth coat of Norman Meakins? - It was in the dining room I missed it out of; I saw it when I was up making the beds.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he came with a large bundle of straw; do you know for what purpose he made use of the straw? - No; when he brought it he asked for a candle, but he did not come into the room where I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go up stairs? - Yes; he staid there about half an hour; he came down again, and blowed the candle out coming down stairs, and said he would be in about nine o'clock; but he came in no more.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the next time you saw him? - It is a fortnight ago last Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he did not break open any thing? - He broke open the trunk up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. But he did not break open any part of the house? - He did not at all. When I saw him the Monday fortnight last, he wanted to make his escape from me very much, before he was taken into custody, before I got an officer for him, and I followed him about an hour before I got a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What prevented him making his escape? - I followed him all the time; if he had set up a run he might have gone; but I might have given an alarm.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You never saw this man before in your life? - Never before he came to take the lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. And this man, whom you suppose to be the man, you did not see till about eight months after this happened?</p>
               <p>Court. How long had he been in your lodgings? - Only one night. When he came first to take the lodging, he said, he was a coachman; and at night when he came in, I said, you have not brought your clothes with you; he said, no he had not, but he should on the morrow.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. He slept that night, and went away early in the morning, and you did not see him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. And then he returned again at night? - He did.</p>

            . On the 28th of last month, as I was coming home from my master's house at Hoxton, I was met by two men, just at seven in the evening, in <placeName id="t17680114-1-crimeloc16">Hoxton field</placeName>

               <p>Burnet. That watch I took from Swinney's pocket when I searched them.</p>
               <p>Hewett. I believe the prisoners are the two men that robbed me; especially the tall one, which is Crawley, but I do not swear positively.</p>

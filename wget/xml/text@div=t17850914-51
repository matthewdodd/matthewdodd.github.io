               <p>On the 3d of July at two, I went with the watchman part of his rounds, and going up Haberdasher's-walk, at half past two, I told the watchman to take charge of that young man, because he had a bundle in his hand which I thought he had stolen, so he sprung his rattle, the prisoner set off upon a run as fast as he could; I knew him, I have worked with him; I sent the old man after him, and I went to the watch-house to tell the constable of the night; the watchman saw no more of him at that time, and I stood in the road and saw him jump into a garden, and just before his own house I took hold of him by the collar, with the bundle in his hand.</p>
               <p>What is he? - He is a gardner.</p>
               <p>Who was present when you took him? - Nobody, he then said for God's sake John let me alone, I have only been into the country for a few flowers, and I told him he should go to the watch-house; when I brought him out of the passage, I saw the constable, and one of the watchmen, and I took him into the watch-house by myself, and the bundle too; then I enquired amongst some gardners, and found out the prosecutor; we did not examine the bundle till after we came to Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Who was left at the watch-house with the bundle? - The watchman who is not here; the prisoner said before the Justice that he found them, that he saw two men drop them, and he run and picked them up,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140076"></xptr> he then called to me, and asked me if I would not give him his apron again, so if he had found them, he found them in his own apron, by his own account; I gave him the apron, the eleven bunches of flowers were tied up with green oats, twisted round and round.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any oats near Renton's garden? - Within twenty yards, at the head of the garden.</p>

               <p>I had been down to work, and coming home on Saturday night, I saw two men in the Brick-fields, standing at the gate, and when I came up to the gate, I saw them run away, then I saw these flowers lay, I took them up in my apron.</p>
               <p>Court. What sort of a night was this? - It was quite broad day light when I first saw him, it was half after two.</p>
               <p>Was it a clear morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

On Saturday the 11th of July, between six and seven in the morning, I was called down stairs by our journeyman; he told me the prisoner had stole some handkerchiefs; I took her up into the kitchen; I untied her cloak, which fell backwards into the chair; and the handkerchiefs mentioned in the indictment were in the cloak. The prisoner immediately fell on her knees, and begged I would let her go.</p>
               <p>(The handkerchiefs were produced in court, and deposed to by Mrs. Sibley.)</p>

               <p>JOHN BUNYER. I keep the Greyhound, in West Smithfield. On the 30th of May, about four o'clock in the afternoon, a man, named Hussey, came to my house with the prisoner and another young man. Hussey said he had bought two horses of them for 3l. 5s. - he asked me if I knew them; I said I knew their faces, and both of them said they had brought meat to my house often, and I must recollect them, and that they lived near Fleet-market. Hussey paid the prisoner 3l. 5s., and the other man remarked that he had got a good bargain. They had three glasses of gin, which the prisoner paid for. The next evening Hussey came and said the horses proved to be stolen. I went with him to look for the men, and found the other man, who shewed us the prisoner, and we secured him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Daniel O'Connell, and live in Shelton-court, Bedfordbury—the prisoner took a furnished lodging at our house for ten weeks from the 11th of April—she kept the key. On the 11th of April I went into the room, and missed a bolster, blanket, a coun<lb></lb>terpane, and a flat-iron—they were my husband's property, and worth 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had seen them in the room when first I let it to her—she left on the Saturday before the 11th of April—I found four pawn tickets of my pro<lb></lb>perty on the table—I found the articles at a pawnbroker's in Long-acre, and redeemed three of them—I did not see the prisoner again until the 23rd—I gave her in custody—she said if I would forgive her she would make them good to me—this is my husband's bolster.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Joseph William Clark, a pawn<lb></lb>broker, in Long-acre. I was in the shop when the prisoner pledged this bolster—I could not identify her if she was in the street—that is the only time I saw her—I have another person pledging so much like her, I could not say which of the two it was—a blanket was also pledged, which Mrs. O'Connell redeemed on Saturday night by the ticket I had given—I can<lb></lb>not say who that was pledged by—it is in the same name.</p>

                  </hi> I am a baker, at Lisson-grove, the pri<lb></lb>soner was in my service. On 21st April, about seven o'clock in the evening, he came up from the bakehouse, and through the shop into the street—he was not going on my business—I went after him, and asked what he had got that did not belong to him—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "That will not do"—his pocket bulged out—I said, "What have you got here?"—he had a piece of bread in each pocket—he said he was going to give it to a boy in the street, whom he described—I left him in the shop with a police<lb></lb>man, and went and found the boy, who had been working for me that morn<lb></lb>ing, and then went to the bakehouse and found four or five half-quarters loaves in a basket in which they put the bread which they consume—it was mine—it had no business there—the men are allowed to eat what they like on the premises, but not to have five loaves—it would not have to he carried out to my customers—those baskets were in the shop—I have two other men—I allow one of them, who is married, bread to take home—he sends one of his children to fetch it.</p>

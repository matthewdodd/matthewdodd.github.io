                  </hi>. I am a tallow-chandler, and live in High-street, Marylebone—the prisoners came to my house on the 7th of October, to take away the dust—I directed my servant, Mary Otley, to watch them, and in consequence of what she told me, I came down and went into the workshop—I found a cask of tallow disturbed, and a quantity taken from it—I did not take any notice at the time, but as soon as they had finished their work, and were going away, I gave them in charge, and taxed them with the theft—the cart was taken to the station-house with them, and ex<lb></lb>amined at the wharf, in the presence of the prisoners, and this tallow was found among the dust—they were all three together when I charged them with it—I do not think any of them made any answer, for I went immediately for a policeman to take them—they had two carts—I did not see the carts examined myself—the prisoners would not have occasion to go where the tallow was, in order to get the dust.</p>

                  </hi>. I am journeyman to Mr. Harris. I saw the cask of tallow, at about a quarter before two o'clock—it was quite safe then—I laid my apron on the tallow, and went out with our horse and cart—I came back, and changed my apron and put my clean apron on at a quarter to two o'clock—the tallow was safe then—I went to dinner, and was sent for afterwards, and missed fourteen or fifteen pounds of tallow, at about twenty minutes after two o'clock—I did not see the prisoners in the work<lb></lb>shop—they were gone before I returned—I saw nothing of them till I went to the station-house, and found them there—I went from there</p>

               <p>to Stapleton's dust-Wharf, paddingdon, and shot the dust—I found the tallow in the cart, which was full—the other cart had two or three baskets full in it, but no tallow there—the tallow was worth about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the time.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 107.) In the afternoon in question, Mr. Harris spoke to me—I saw the cart at the corner of Devonshire-street, opposite Mr. Harris's house—it removed to Beaumont-street—I asked Mr. Harris if the prisoners were the men—he said, "Yes; I give them in charge for stealing fat"—I said to Howell, "I take charge of you in stealing fat"—he said, "I have got none"—I said, "I must take you"—he said, "You shall not take me," and up with his fist to hit me, and tried to escape—Twyford said, "Do not be a b----fool, go quietly"—I took them all to the state on-house, and then went to the prosecutor's premises—I found about a quarter of a pound of tallow at the dust-hole—the dust had been taken from that spot where the tallow was.</p>

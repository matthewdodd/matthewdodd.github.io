On the 10th of January, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came there and presented this order to me, directed to John and Joseph Travers—we have a customer named Symonds—after reading the order, I asked him from whom he had it—he said, "From Mr. Symonds's shopman"—I asked where he gave it to him—he said, "In the Terrace"—Mr. Symonds lives in Wilmington-square—I knew he had no shopman—I was attending to a customer, and told him to wait—I then questioned him</p>

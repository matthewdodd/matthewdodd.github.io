In about a minute and a half afterwards I heard some one open the shop door, I had to open a middle door before I could get into the front<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090016"></xptr>shop, and when I got into the front shop I saw the front door half open, I could not see any one in the front shop, one of my younger brothers came into the shop, he said one of the trays in the window was gone; I locked and found one was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What had been in that tray - A. Thirty pebble pyramid seals, two necklaces, ear-rings and broaches, belonging to them, and in looking further I found the other tray was stripped of ten gold chains, and sixteen gold seals.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the shop was it where that tray stood - A. In the front of the shop next the door, and the other tray stood by it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any of this property since - A. Yes; about nine days afterwards, at Mr. Turner's, in Bridges-street, I saw a gold chain, and a gold seal.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the value of the chain and seals - A. The chain, thirty shillings, and the seal, a guinea and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this shop where these things were taken part of your father's dwelling-house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know in what manner the windows were closed - were the shutters shut up - A. Yes, they were closed about four o'clock; there was no way of getting into the shop but by opening the door.</p>

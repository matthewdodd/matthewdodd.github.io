                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—he is a bricklayer, living at 86, Upper Whitecross-street—on Saturday, 9th May, About half-past 9, he had gone to bed—I was in the back parlour reading—he came down and asked when I was going to bed—I said, "Presently"—he put out the gas, and I relighted it three times—I don't remember any more after that—I don't remember any blow being given me—when I became conscious again I was in the hospital—he had treated me very kindly before this, when he was not in liquor—he had been drinking that day—we had had a few words in the morning; I can't recollect what about.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live in the same house with the prisoner and prosecutrix—on 9th May, about half-past 9 o'clock, the prisoner came up to my mother's door and knocked, and told us to go down stairs for he thought he had done it this time—I went down, and saw Mrs. Banks in one corner of the room, by the fire-place—her hair was all down over her shoulders, and she was smothered in blood—I asked her if I could do any<lb></lb>thing for her, and so did the prisoner—she did not answer for a minute—she then said I could do nothing for her—I got some water, but she would not let me touch her head—I asked the prisoner what he had done it for—he said he did not know—I asked what he had done it with—he picked up the poker and gave it to me, and said, "This is what I have done it with"—I then went with Mrs. Banks to the hospital—this is the poker (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said as he threw it down it broke.</p>

I am house-surgeon at St. Barthlomew's hospital—on 9th May last the prosecutrix was brought there—her face was covered with blood, streaming down from wounds on the head—I examined her head, and found eight severe wounds—at the bottom of three the skull was broken, and in one the skull was driven in; one of her fingers was very badly bruised, and a ring on the finger was bent in—this poker would be just the sort of instrument to produce the wounds—she had no other bruises—she has been in the hospital since 9th May, and she is not now out of danger—she still has some dead bone in her head.</p>

On 9th May, about ten minutes past 11, a woman came up to me in Whitecross-street—in consequence of what she said I went to the prisoner's house—I found Mrs. Banks lying on the floor with her head against the cupboard, bleeding very much from the head—I took her to the hospital, and sent the prisoner to the station—he said he did it, and he was very sorry for it; if she died he supposed he should be hanged—he did not appear to be the worse for liquor at that time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate</hi>: "I have this statement to make, that I was not conscious of what I was doing this night, and I had not been right for some days; occasionally I am not to say answerable for my actions. On the Sunday afternoon I told my wife not to leave me, as I thought something would happen, and I cannot be left by myself, such awful things come into my mind since I tried to make away with myself, especially in the room where I committed the rash act. I bad a fall four or five years ago, and the least excitement I am not conscious of what I am doing; I am obliged to take liquor before I can go on with my work; I am very nervous; my mother was in an asylum, and my father made away with himself; my wife knows it; I have often told her never to take any notice of what I say; my son has very often found me crying, and he has asked me what I have been crying for, and all I could do I could not make it out. Since my wife hit me over the head I lost so much blood, I have been worse; while I was leaning over the basin my wife came behind me and said, 'You b----thing, I will do it for you before many hours are over; you b----, I have got you now, and I will pay you; you will faint soon, and you will want some brandy and water. 'I can't account for the action on this night, or what I did; I had been drinking in the day, and cannot recollect what I did on that day, and hardly on the next day."</p>

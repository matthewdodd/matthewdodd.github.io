                  </hi>. I am a plasterer, of 4, Reynold Street, King's Road, Chelsea—on 21st April I was in Thames Street about 3 p.m., and at the South-Eastern Railway Arch I saw a parcel of boys, who threw stones at me—I turned round with ray stick, and touched one of them in the eye—a boy in the mob laid hold of me, and said he would give me in charge, and while the policeman was hearing the story, Dorney put his hand in my pocket, and took my watch—I told the policeman, and he began to search him, but he passed it to Atkins—I did not see him pass it, but a witness did—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw Atkins drop it; a witness picked it up, and gave it to me, and I gave it to the policeman—my name is in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman to Messrs. Lemons, Old Swan Lane—on the afternoon of 21st April I was employed at the bottom of Old Swan Lane, near the railway arch, and saw a number of boys surround the pro<lb></lb>secutor—one of them threw a stone, and he put up his stick over his shoul<lb></lb>der, and hit the boy in the eye, and then I saw the prosecutor's chain hanging down, and he said, "I have lost my watch"—I said, loud enough for the prisoner to hear, "Either the big one or the little one has got it," and seized Dorney—Atkins was held by somebody else, who took him into a warehouse opposite, and when he came out I saw the watch drop from his trousers between two casks, about four yards from the prosecutor—Mr. Reid picked it up—he is not here—I saw him give it to the constable.</p>

The prisoner returned, said she could get no porter, and said, I had better stop with her to-night; I said I was short of silver; she said, never mind that, you can see me another time. I locked the door, and put the key in my pocket; she said, what property you have about you is safe with me. We went to bed. About three o'clock I awoke and found the prisoner gone, and the property likewise. I came down stairs, and met the patrol, the landlord of the house, he opened the door to come in, he said, who are you; I said I had lost my watch, and gave him my address. In a few days I got information, and took the prisoner.</p>

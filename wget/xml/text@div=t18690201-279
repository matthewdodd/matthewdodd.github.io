                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of Marlborough Road, Carnaby Street—on Monday morning, 11th January, about 6 o'clock, I was in a public-house in John Street—I saw six or seven persons there altogether—the prisoners were among them—they were sitting in the parlour—I treated them, and as I was coming away they knocked me down on a form, and put their hands on my mouth, and took 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from my trowsers pocket—I had been drinking, but was not drunk—a man of the name of Carroll, a tailor, was there—I complained to the landlord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What had you been drinking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some rum and some beer—I had had about two glasses of rum, and I don't know how much beer—they told Carroll to go out of the room while they were robbing me, and when he came back he saw them knocking me down and taking the money out of my pocket—I knew the prisoners by sight before—Mitchell I knew a good bit—I don't suppose anybody saw me with the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when I went into the room—it would have been very little good for me to call out, because they would have hindered me by putting their hands on my mouth—that prevented my screaming—they had their hands over my mouth until they had taken the money out of my pocket—as they were leaving the room I did call out, and said I knew them—that was all I said—I told the land<lb></lb>lord that I was robbed, directly it happened—I went down to him a few minutes afterwards—perhaps it was fifteen or twenty minute; afterwards.</p>

               <p>January, about 3 o'clock, I remember three gentlemen coming to my front bar—I saw the prisoners and the prosecutor—there were two or three pots of porter called for, which the prosecutor paid for—they went into the club room, and called for three pots more beer, for which the prosecutor gave me a shilling—they could only muster 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. amongst them, and the beer came to 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—the prosecutor gave me a half-sovereign, and I gave him 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., change—one of the parties said, "Give it to me; I am his brother-in-law; I can give him the change as well as you can"—I did not do so—I went down stairs again—I afterwards heard a noise up stairs, and went up—they were quiet then, and I went down again—afterwards several persons came down with a sort of rush, and went out, but I did not see either of the prisoners—some time afterwards the prosecutor came down, and made a complaint to me—he was not tipsy; he had been drinking, evidently; but he was not what I should call drunk.</p>

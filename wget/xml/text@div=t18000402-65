             sworn. - I live at No. 23, Noel-street, Soho: I have known the prisoner about three years; he has been a helper in a stable-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020063"></xptr>yard at the bottom of Swallow-street: On Sunday evening, the 16th of March, I happened to be in liquor and went into a public-house where he was, I was so intoxicated that I could hardly walk; he went, out of friendship, to see me home; that was nearly about twelve o'clock; there was another person with me whose surname I do not know, his christian name is Thomas; we went on to the corner of Marshall-street and Silver-street; we stopped round the corner, and there were the patrols coming along, and there being three of us, there was not room for them to pass, and I being in liquor interrupted one of them, and the patrol caught hold of me immediately by the collar; it seems I made some resistance, and he sprung his rattle; immediately some other watchmen came up, to prevent his striking me, as they told me afterwards; I was taken into custody both by the hands and by the collar, and hurried away among them; the prosecutor then came out of the wine-vaults, he came out without his hat, and wished to intercede for me, seeing that I was in liquor; the patrol told him I had interrupted him in his duty, and I saw no more of it till I had got near the bottom of Golden-square; one of them, in scuffing with me, I found had cut me on the head; I was not sensible of it at the time of receiving the wound; I asked the liberty to let me tie a handkerchief round my head; I was without my hat; my hands were then at liberty for the first time during the scuffle; I knew I had a watch, and as soon as my handkerchief was tied round my head, I clapped my hand down to my pocket to feel if I had got my watch, and I found my watch was gone; I instantly put my hands into my waistcoat-pocket, being frightened, and I found in this pocket a watch that seemed to be very small; I took it into my hand and felt it; I said to the patrol, surely this cannot be my watch, it is so very small; I then put it into this waistcoat-pocket, thinking no more of the matter, not being certain; and when I came to the watch-house, I said, surely gentlemen, this is not my watch that I have got in my pocket, by the size of it; I then pulled it out, and the prosecutor owned it, and at the same moment I saw my own watch lie upon the table; but how it came there I cannot tell; I asked the prisoner if he knew how that watch came to be put upon me, and he said he could not tell; he said he had taken my watch to take care of, that I should not lose it in the scuffle; I never saw this gentleman's watch till I got to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Court. I do not recollect seeing the last witness till I had got to the watch-house; I thought I had seen him in the crowd.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he appear to you to be sober? - A. No, he was not; he was very drunk.</p>
               <p>GEORGE-COURTNEY TURNER sworn. - I was going home about twelve o'clock; I heard a noise, and I heard Mr. Court's voice; I asked him what was the matter; he said the prisoner at the bar had taken his watch; I immediately secured one of his hands, and Mr. Court secured the other; Mr. Court had hold of him when I came up.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was Craighton to Mr. Court? - A. I did not see him to my knowledge till we got to the watch-house; when we got to the watch-house I opened one hand, and Mr. Court opened the other; I thought I had got a watch in the hand that I had hold of, but it was only part of a chain, with the seal to it; I said, that is not Mr. Court's watch; the prisoner said he did not know any thing at all about it; then I saw Craighton come in, with his head wounded; I asked him if he had got it, and he said he had got a watch that did not belong to him; his was a silver one; he was very much intoxicated; I questioned him how he came by the watch; he pointed to several people that were sitting there, and said, that is the man; and afterwards he pointed to the prisoner at the bar, and said that was the man that gave him the watch.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he say that was the man that had given him the watch? - A. Yes; and the prisoner did not deny it.</p>
               <p>Q. I see you gave a different account before the Magistrate; there you say, you heard Craighton say, in the presence of Etherington, that he had taken his watch out of his pocket, to which Etherington seemed to agree? - A. That was afterwards; after the prisoner was in the watch-house, the prisoner said he had taken Craighton's watch out of his pocket to take care of it; when I made enquiry after Mr. Court's watch, Craighton gave up the watch very readily.</p>

             sworn. - I am constable of the night: About half past twelve at night, on the 16th of March the prisoner was brought into the watch-house; I asked Mr. Court what offence the man had been guilty of; he said he was robbed of his gold watch; he had got hold of one of the man's arms; and in his hand he held the watch, and in the other hand he held the chain of a silver watch; I asked Mr. Court if that was his watch, and he said, no, his watch was a gold one; at the same time he said, you thief, you thief, you stole my watch; and before I had taken that charge, Craighton was brought in, and another man, one Thomas Charters; I asked what they were brought in for; Craighton replied to me, that he had been robbed of his silver watch; I then produced this watch to Craighton, which he said was his; then Craighton's hands were let go, and he put his hand into one of his waistcoat-pockets, and out he took the gold one; when the gold watch came out of his pocket, Mr. Court took hold of it, and said it was his; (produces it;) I asked Craighton, who was very much intoxicated, how he came by the gold watch in his waistcoat-pocket, and I told him, it looked very suspicious; says he, God knows how I got it, I don't know; but, says he, the person that has taken away my silver watch, must have put the gold one in my pocket; I took the charge, and kept them both in custody, and the next morning they went before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>JAMES LORN sworn. - I was going home, after twelve o'clock; I heard the rattles spring, and I came back to see what was the matter; and the patrol came up to Mr. Court's assistance; I helped to take him to the watch-house, and we were pulling and hauling, and Mr. Court came up, and said he would be his friend; the prisoner came up and said, Mr. Craighton, I have got your watch safe, do not be afraid of it; Mr. Court felt, and said, you have taken mine, you villain, stop thief, stop thief; and we took all three; the prisoner said, I have not got your watch, I have got no watch but my friend's; here it is, and I will take care of it; Mr. Court laid hold of his hand, and in it was a silver watch; the prosecutor said, that is not mine; afterwards Craighton produced a gold watch, and Mr. Court said that was his.</p>

In the crowd I took Mr. Craighton's watch to take care of, as I knew he had a good watch; somebody made a snatch at it, and broke the chain; then Mr. Court came up and said, I had got his watch; I said I had not any but Craighton's, and that I would take to the watch-house; and they took me there; if I had had the gentleman's watch I might have gone, for I was not in custody till after I had got Craighton's watch from him.(The watch was deposed to by Mr. Court.)</p>

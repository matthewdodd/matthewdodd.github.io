On the 9th of March our house was broke open in the night, which was made fast about half an hour after nine over night; we found in the morning a pane of glass taken out of the window, and the iron bar of the casement was shaken out, by which means they could put their hand in at the window, and lift up the bar, and come in; I missed the things mentioned in the indictment; as I was going down Ratcliff-highway two days after, I saw my two saucepans at

               <p>Best. No, I did not; she said they were her own, and she sold them, being in distress, having no bread for her children, and that her husband was at sea; I asked her where she lived; she said, at the top of Old Gravel-lane.</p>

About twenty minutes before eight o'clock, on the 29th of March, two women came into my shop, and gave me some information: I looked in my window, and missed a pair of boots which I had been dusting about five minutes before - I had gone towards the parlour-door and turned back, and then I heard the intelligence - I saw them next morning in the possession of the officer.</p>

            . I belong to the Thames Police. On the night of the 29th of March I saw the prisoner in Rosemary-lane with this pair of boots - he had another man with him. I asked where he got them, he said he had made them that afternoon at home - I asked where that was - he said it was of no use telling me, for if I went I should not be satisfied.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have lately returned from St. Domingo. I had been to the West India Docks, and as I returned, I met a young man with a pair of boots in his hand; he asked if I would go with him and sell them; he said he and his father had made them - I took the boots to carry, and as we were going the officer met me; I said I had made them myself - from what the young man had told me; I should not have said so, but I thought he was a gentleman who wanted to buy them.</p>

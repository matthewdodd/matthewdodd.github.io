                  </hi>. I am an optician, at 38, Chandos-street—sometimen the middle of January, my wife brought me a crown piece—I was at the back of the shop—I gave her change for it, and put it in my pocket—I had no other crown about me; I afterwards showed it to my son, and we found it to be bad—it was placed on a shelf at the back of the counter—I have not got it here, it was afterwards lost—about half-past three on 22d Feb<lb></lb>ruary, the prisoner came and asked for a sixpenny box of Pharoah's serpents—I told her I had not a sixpenny box, but I had a shilling one—she said, "I will take a shilling box"—I supplied her with it, and she gave me a crown—I examined it, and found it was bad—I called in my wife, and said, "Is this the woman that passed the bad five-shilling piece a short time ago?"—she instantly said, "Yes, that is the same woman"—my daughter, who was in the parlour, called out, "Father, that is the same woman"—I said, "Are you sure of it?" They both said, "Yes"—I sent for a police<lb></lb>man, and gave her in charge—before doing that, I said to the prisoner, "This is the second time you have come this game here"—she said, "No, not me, I have just come from Bath."</p>

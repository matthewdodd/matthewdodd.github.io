                  <hi rend="italic">objected to the witness giving in evidence the communications made to him by Bishop, they being in the nature of privileged communications; for although he was not actually engaged as his attorney at the time they were made, yet when he afterwards became so, he availed himself of the information so acquired; this was not the privilege of the attorney, but of the client, and he contended that if his evidence was admitted, the rule of law would be defeated.</hi> (See <hi rend="italic">Taylor on Evidence</hi>, p. 616). <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">contended that no privilege existed until the relation of client and attorney was established, and that relation not having commenced, the privilege did not exist, but he did not intend to ask the nature of Bishop's communication, only what the witness said to Bishop.</hi> The <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>

               <p>in the suit—he was made a party to it, after it commenced—the whole context of the will was such that no executor could safely have acted under it, except under the sanction of the Court; almost every part of the will required the consideration and decision of the Court—the assent or dissent of the Attorney-General is not on the face of the record—I have a note from the Attorney-General's solicitor telling me Mr. James' opinion—the suit was instituted, and on July 15th, 1851, a decree was made, directing a reference to the Master to inquire whether any, and what proceedings should be taken, with a view to set aside the rent charge, and by whom—under that decree I carried into the Master's Office the state of facts, which I have here, on the part of the plaintiffs, alleging the rent charge to be valid on the face of it, but under the circumstances invalid; and on the part of Dr. Burns I carried in a submission, admitting the general accuracy of the plaintiffs' state of facts, that although he was not prepared to admit the invalidity of the rent charge, yet if the Attorney-General would consent, he was prepared to release, because he deprecated any proceedings to set it aside—I have the examined copies of both the hills in the two suits, and the original decree in that suit, referring it to the Master, with the Master's own endorse<lb></lb>ment on it—in consequence of a difference of opinion on the part of the Attorney-General and Mr. Rolt, who was consulted, matters were forced to go on—the answer was filed, and on the admissions in the answer the decree was made—the answer was before the reference to the Master—I was at Bow-street on 5th April—Dr. Burns was there on two charges of perjury, one in the suit of Gwenap and Burns, and the other on his answer in Way and Burns—Mr. Bishop was present, and was examined as a witness—the case was dis<lb></lb>missed without calling on Dr. Burns—on 27th April, when leaving my office, I found this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which is in Bishop's writing.</p>

In money, and the rest consists of the leasehold premises and the rents—I do not believe there is 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in his possession, but I am not prepared to state the amount—there have been receipts and payments—under the will, three daughters are entitled to annuities, payable out of the rents annually—the other property is all disposed of—three of the grandchildren take an interest out of the income, and the rest was given for charitable purposes, which is in part void—the first half-year's annuity has been paid to the relations; the second has not, because the principal part of the premises are out of tenancy, and because there are not rents to pay them—with the exception of several small legacies which have been paid, the great bulk is for different charitable purposes connected with the chapel—the date of the endorsement of the will is 10th July, 1849—the residuary legatees are Dr. Burns and Mr. Chapman, who has renounced—I believe the case did not take much more than half an hour to an hour's investigating before the Alderman before it was dismissed—I believe some letters of mine, and this letter also, were read by him—to the beet of my belief, the case did not occupy an hour—Mr. Lewis was the attorney at Bow-street for Mrs. Way—the suit of Gwenap and Burns was instituted for the purpose of invalidating the deed—afterwards a second suit was instituted of Way and Burns—a decree was made in Gwenap and Burns, raising the question—that was a friendly suit, instituted by all the family, including the Ways—the deed is in course of invalidation now—Dr. Burns still remains trustee—it is still in course of litigation in the suit of Gwenap and Burns—I should state that it was not possible in either suit to declare the deed invalid—the only decree that could be made was the decree which was made referring to the Master—the probability is that the first suit would have been over already, if it had not been for the institution of the second suit—that was a hostile suit, which has been stayed by the order of the Court, on account of their own statement and Dr. Burns' statement—I mean distinctly to swear that the suit was instituted by me in the utter conviction that the deed was absolutely bad, and that this suit would necessarily invalidate it—the several answers were put in for the purpose of the administration of the suit, with a view to determine the validity of the deed—Dr. Burns deprecates the continuance of the deed—he has sought to got rid of it, and he will not seek in</p>

               <p>any way to establish it; so much so, that I laid the case before Mr. Rolt, and sent a copy of it to the Attorney-General's solicitor, in order that Mr. Rolt might persuade Mr. James that there was no possible chance of main<lb></lb>taining the deed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you really mean to say that you did not know anything about the contents of the deed before it was executed, or how the 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be dis<lb></lb>tributed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have already stated that Mr. Gwenap had intimated generally his purpose respecting the charities he intended to benefit—one of them is for an increase in the salary of the minister, upon certain conditions, if it did not reach a certain sum—I have never availed myself of that, or had the necessity of doing so—I wish to get rid of this deed altogether; I have sought to do so—that has been my object—hitherto I have failed in doing so—I really do not know technically whether I have put in two answers; I believe I have—I believe I knew that I was answering a bill filed for invali<lb></lb>dating the deed—I have always consented to the invalidation of the deed—I answered the bill; I believe that answer was read yesterday, and it distinctly admitted the ground of invalidity stated by the other party—the deed was certainly intended to be enforced originally, but afterwards not—the deed is not yet invalidated; I wish it was—I presume I was present at the execution of the will of Mr. Gwenap; I think he was then in his eighty-second year—he was eighty-six at the time of his death—if his will was executed in 1849, I am mistaken as to the date; I thought it was three or four years before his death—I forgot that, as I did that document—I had conversation with him about his will before—I was perfectly aware of his intentions respect<lb></lb>ing it—I was very intimate with him, and had been for sixteen years, since I had been pastor of this chapel—there was a transaction between him and me about a check—I did not in June, 1850, before his death in Nov., ask him to draw a check for the arrears of the annuity—I was present at the examina<lb></lb>tion of Miss Gwenap yesterday, painfully so—what she stated was perfectly false—the check was drawn under the impression that the whole affair, with respect to the charities, would probably be exposed to litigation—it was drawn to protect myself and the other trustee from any consequences under the deed—it was a check intended to be presented to the officers of the church—it was presented to them, and returned to Mr. Gwenap that same evening—I think the 1,045<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. represented the eleven years arrears of the annuity—I intended the officers, when they received the check, to do with it as they pleased—it had not been arranged between myself and the officers what should be done about the check—nothing had been arranged—I took the check to the trustees and officers of the church, and they returned it to Mr. Gwenap the very same evening—I do not remember that I had before that explained either to the trustees or officers anything about this check—I can certainly state on my oath, positively, that it had not been previously arranged all that was to be done—I had not mentioned anything about this check to the trustees or officers—I might have had conversation with the officers of the chapel with respect to the circumstances of the grants and the arrears; I think I did—I think it is probable—I certainly never told Mr. Gwenap when tge check was drawn, that it should not be presented, but should</p>

               <p>be returned to him—if Miss Gwenap stated that yesterday, I say it is untrue—I really do not know whether she was present—before I took the check to the chapel, I presume no person knew that I was going to get a check from Mr. Gwenap—I had given them no information about any check, certainly—I cannot at all make oath as to whether I conversed with the officers of the church on the subject of any payment of arrears—this is the check (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I did not dictate the check—I am not conscious that I dictated any paper to him that evening—I think Mr. Gwenap became aware that we, as trustees, were exposed to litigation—I have already stated that, and, there<lb></lb>fore, as we had committed no error in that matter, he was anxious we should not be exposed to personal responsibility; and, therefore, this check was written and presented to the officers of the church—I did not know that it was never intended to present the check, or to make use of it in any way, to recover the testator's money from him—there can be no mistake about that—I presumed there would be no use made of it—I did not tell Mr. Gwenap so; I could not tell him that—he voluntarily gave me the check, which he wished me to present to the officers of the church—there was no understanding, or engagement, that it should be returned to bim, or that it should not be pre<lb></lb>sented at his bankers'—he did not state that at that time he had not 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at his bankers'—I do not know that he had not; I did not know it then—I heard the bankers' clerk examined yesterday—I am not aware that the check was post dated—I do not know that Mr. Gwenap post dated it, for the purpose of protecting himself—I am not aware that I have stated that it was a post dated check.</p>

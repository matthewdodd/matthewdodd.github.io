On the 27th of May, about nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in with another coachman and two females - I served them with drink - I cannot say who paid for it - while they were there my waiter brought down a half-crown and 2d., and laid it on the bar - I was drawing some beer, and said I would take it up in a moment - the prisoner stood there, and took up the half-crown - I thought it was only a joke, and when I had drawn the beer said, "Come, give me that half-crown"- he abused me, and said he had not taken it; he went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310069"></xptr>to the door, and came in in a minute; I again asked for it- he persisted that he had not got it; I said I should send for an officer if he did not give it up - he was very abusive- I went for an officer, and returned in five minutes; he said, "Do you accuse me of taking your half-crown; I said, "Yes, but you have changed your coat since I have been gone;" he had changed coats with the other man, but I am positive he is the man; he was searched, but it was not found - I have seen his companion once or twice since.</p>

            . I was at Pearson's, and saw the prisoner with two females and a man - I saw the waiter put half-a-crown and four halfpence down - I saw the prisoner take up the half-crown - Pearson afterwards charged him with it; he denied having it; they all went to the door and returned - while Pearson was gone for an officer the prisoner exchanged coats with the other man - he had a drab coat on, but changed it for a black one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A man named Revers was with me - he accused one of us of taking the half-crown; we were searched, but nothing found on us - I changed my coat, because I did not wish to go the watch-house.</p>

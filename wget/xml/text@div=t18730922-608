I live at 22, Castle Street, Long Acre—I am a commissionaire, and I was stationed at Long's Hotel, Bond Street, in May—while I was there, Atkins came up to me and gave me an undirected envelope; he had a moustache at that time—he asked me whether I knew Mr. Farquhar's bank in St. James's Street—I said "Yes"—he said "Take this letter to Mr. Farquhar's Bank, and bring me back an answer at Verrey's Café, in Regent Street, I shall be there with two ladies"—as I was going away he said "When you get it, don't you lose it"—I said that I would not—I went to the bank and delivered the envelope to Mr. Smallman, the cashier—after waiting a little while I received an envelope in answer, addressed to "Captain Candy," I took it to Verrey's, but did not find Atkins there—I looked about for him, and as I was coming out a well<lb></lb>dressed young gentleman walked in and called for a glass of wine—that was Valero—I stood outside waiting for Captain Candy—Valero called a cab from the opposite side of the street, and when the cab came across he said to me "Have not you been to Farquhar's bank for Captain Candy?"—I said "Yes, sir, I have, I was to meet him here in company with two ladies"—he said "Captain Candy is engaged, he can't come, he sent me to fetch the note"—I gave him the letter, as he mentioned Captain Candy's name, and said "I hope it is quite correct"—he said "Oh, yes, it is quite correct"—he gave me a half-crown, got into the cab and drove towards Waterloo Place—I have not a particle of doubt about the two prisoners being the persons I have spoken of—on 31st July, I went down to Good<lb></lb>wood Races with the officers in the case—I saw Valero there, and identified him, and he was taken in custody—I had seen him again before I saw him at Goodwood, and took a letter for him to a gentleman at Shepherd's Bush, between 7 and 8 o'clock on Saturday night—at that time I knew him as the person I had seen in Regent Street.</p>

I cannot say how long I had had a banking account—I do not remember his telling me that he banked at the London and West<lb></lb>minster—I have not a very good memory, I see so many persons at races, and if they ask me for a thing in the way of business I should give it them—I always thought Atkins was a respectable man—he did not tell me what he wanted the cheques for, and I did not ask him—I thought he banked at the same bank.</p>

I am hall-porter, at the Junior United Service Club, at the corner of Pall Mall—Colonel Longley is a member of that Club—in March last Valero came and asked for Colonel Longley—I told him he was not in, and, I believed, not in town—he requested to be allowed to write a note to him—he was shown by one of the pages into the stranger's room, where there was a pen and ink and some of the club paper, in different colours—he wrote a note there, and left it for Colonel Longley, this is it, it is addressed to Major G. Longley—I afterwards gave it up to the police.</p>

I was first spoken to about this matter about the beginning of May—persons come in daily to write notes and see members—I think it was towards the end of March—I was after<lb></lb>wards taken, by Inspector Clark, to Great Marlborough Street, to see if I could identify the person who had left the note—I saw Valero there, among five or six others, and I picked him out—he had not been described to me—I did not notice how the persons were dressed, I looked at their faces—he was dressed very differently to what he was when he called at the club—I would not swear he is the man, but to the best of my belief he is—I have no doubt about it, but the lapse of time is so great I would not undertake to swear it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Poole &amp; Co., tailors, of Savile Row—on Saturday, 22nd March, a person called and brought this letter, addressed to Mr. Poole, the envelope was stamped "United Service Club," and the letter is on the club paper—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Pall Mall, S.

Sir,—Will you oblige me by cashing enclosed cheque and handing change to bearer, less 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. off the account I hope to send you the balance on my return to town, in a few weeks hence, G. Longley.") The letter contained a cheque on the London and Westminster Bank for 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to G. Longley, or bearer; drawn by Edward Hanning Lee—(<hi rend="italic">This was drawn on one of the cheques given by the witness Buchanan to Atkins.</hi>) I fail to recog<lb></lb>nise the person who brought it—we had not the money at our place of business—I promised to send out for it—I sent the cheque to our banker's, the City Bank, and got the money—the person who brought the letter went away and was to return in a few minutes—I deducted the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the rest of the money, 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I put in an envelope, and addressed it to Colonel Longley—he has been a customer of ours for some years, and there was an account owing—about two hours afterwards a commissionaire came for an answer to the note, and brought this letter: "Sir, I shall be much obliged by your handing the change of my cheque to the bearer; my friend tells me he was to have returned in a few minutes. Yours truly, G. Longley."</p>

I am a commissionaire, stationed at the Army and Navy Club, in Pall Mall—on Saturday, 22nd March, between 12. 45 and 1 o'clock, Atkins came and spoke to me outside the club—he asked if I could take a note to Poole's—I said "Yes"—he gave me the note and told me to wait for an answer; he called himself Major Longley; I was to walk there, be as quick as I could, and when I got the answer I was to take a cab to the Cremorne Restaurant Branch, Leicester Square—I went to Poole's, left the letter, and got an answer, and took it to the Cremorne Restaurant—I did not see Atkins when I arrived there, after a little time I saw him in the middle of Coventry Street, coming from Piccadilly Circus—my cab was waiting when he came up; he said "Have you got the answer?"—I said "Yes, sir," and gave it to him, and he gave me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him if I was to pay the cab—he said "Yes," and then he said "Never mind, here is a <hi rend="italic">bob</hi> for the cabman," and he gave 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the cabman—he then made his exit as quick as he could—I was afterwards brought to Newgate, and in the yard saw a number of persons, twelve or thirteen, or more, and I there picked him out—I have not the slightest doubt he is the man.</p>

               <p>I understand you wash for him? - I do.</p>

               <p>Did he dine with you the day before? - He came up stairs, and I asked him if he had had any victuals; he said no, and I told him to go to the cupboard and get some.</p>
               <p>Does he frequently dine with you? - Not always, only sometimes.</p>
               <p>Does he pay you for his dinners? - He does not pay me, because I looked upon him as a man that pays me for my washing, and I give him victuals when he is out of work.</p>
               <p>When did he dine with you since? - He has had victuals up in my room several times.</p>
               <p>Has he dined with you since that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When? - Last Saturday, for the last time.</p>
               <p>When was the next time, after that Saturday, that your brother dined with you? - On Monday, please you, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Did he dine with you on Christmas-day? - He did not; he dined with me on Monday following.</p>
               <p>Did your brother dine with you on Christmas-day? - He did.</p>
               <p>Did any body else besides? - No.</p>
               <p>Did your brother dine with you on Monday? - He did.</p>
               <p>What had you for dinner on Saturday? - To tell the truth, my Lord, we had an Irish stew, made of mutton and potatoes.</p>
               <p>That was your Saturday's dinner, on Christmas-eve? - It was, my Lord.</p>
               <p>What had you on Sunday? - A bit of roast beef and a plumb-pudding.</p>
               <p>That was the day that this Stack did not dine with you? - It was.</p>

            . Did Dawson tell you to go and see the man, and that he was there, or only for you to go and see if the man was there? - He told me to go and see whether the man was there; I went in and saw he was there, and came and told him, and then he told me to go and put my hand on his head, and he would follow me and see who it was.</p>

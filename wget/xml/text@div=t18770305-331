                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, of 2, Griffin Street, Lambeth—on Sunday, 28th January, about 12.10 a.m., I was close to my house, with my hand in my pocket taking out my key to open the door—I was not the worse for liqour, but I was ill—I said at the Mansion House, that I might be a little he worse for liquor, but not much—I was seized by Gilham, who put his muckles in my throat, and another man caught me by my arm while I <hi rend="italic">had my</hi> hand in my pocket—I struck him, and he then caught me by both arms and three men rifled my pockets of 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was safe a few minutes before—I was thrown down, and two of them ran away—after the ocurrence I was so excited that I hardly knew what happened—the third one was caught, that was Gilham—I only recognise Dawson by his height, did not see his face—I believe I ran after one of them, but I am con<lb></lb>radicted by witnesses who are better able to say than I am—I called "Stop thief"—I am sure Gilham is one of the men, he put his knuckles in my man'</p>

               <p>of us"; that would not make me reel about, but I was reeling about—this curious complaint of mine almost takes my senses away, and I am not answerable for what I do then—I ran after Gilham—he ran into a cab<lb></lb>field—I called out "Stop thief!" and did not lose sight of him till he was stopped—I had not looked at my money just before this disorder came on.</p>

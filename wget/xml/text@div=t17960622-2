               <p>Q. Did it go off? - A. It did; I still kept hold of his horse's head, and he knocked me down with his pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Which end? - A. The thin end, I don't think he had time to turn it; he then rode off, and there was a cry of murder and stop thief; he galloped about one hundred yards and then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220005"></xptr>I heard he was taken; I don't think it could be more than two minutes the whole of the time that I was at the toll-gate and his being taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You had a good horse I take it for granted in your whiskey? - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were determined to get before the carriage? - A. I made no effort whatever to overtake the carriage; I was going at the same pace that I was before.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not swerve more into the track of the carriage than before? - A. I was in the middle of the road when the prisoner passed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a sufficient light for you to observe the carriage that there was a coronet upon it; - A. No, it was not light enough to see that.</p>


               <p>Q. How long was it before you knew that this was Lord Lonsdale's carriage? - A. Not till after I was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you himself he was Lord Lonsdale's servant? - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you did happen to know that it was Lord Lonsdale's carriage, do you recollect any thing you said upon the occasion? - A. Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. At the toll-gate all that happened was of your own seeking; you laid hold of the horse's head? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect laying hold of the holster yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never happen to meet with any thing of this sort before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. No scrape with a watchman? - A. That has happened to other people besides me.</p>
               <p>Q. You were indicted by a watchman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave your wife the reins when you jumped out? - A. No; the horse walked on.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not ask any questions at the turnpike? - A. Only to know why he had struck my horse.</p>
               <p>Q. You had called him rascal and scoundrel on the road, and again when you attacked him at the turnpike? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It must have been sudden this snatching the pistol from the holster? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You received no bodily harm? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had intended to shoot you he could not well have missed you? - A. I cannot say for his intention.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any observations made there by the people? - A. I cannot say I recollect any particular observations.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the observation, that it was impossible for the man to have intended to shoot you, because the slash was on the other side of the horse's neck. - A. I don't recollect it.</p>

This man passed me the other side of Highgate, we stopped at the top of Highgate-hill to see that the breeching was tight, and he passed us while that was doing; we passed him afterwards; he whipped his horse violently, and tried every means in his power to run by the carriage; his intention was to beat the carriage; he made another attempt to do it, and ran against me very violently; if I did touch his horse, which I don't know that I did, my whole intention was to get clear of him; when I came to Tottenham-Court, I desired him repeatedly to let me go, he struck me many times, cut me very much in my arm, and several other places; I told him who I was, I pulled out my pistol to intimidate him, because I wanted to follow my Lord's carriage; he, still persevering, whether my horse pushed against him or what, I cannot say; I never saw him the whole time, it was so dark; I was abused by the people afterwards, that I don't know what I said.</p>

I am a baker, journeyman to Mr. Edkins, in Davies-street, Berkeley-square; I was at the turnpike when this happened; I was come through the turnpike, the postillion cried out, "gate,," the gate was opened, and the prisoner came up to pay the toll, and then Davis came up along side with his single horse chaise, and he fell upon him very rashly, "you villain, what did you strike my horse for upon the road;" he then laid hold of him by the side, and tried to get him off his horse by his cloaths, and immediately Mr. Robinson, in his fury, pulled out his pistol, and fired.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he near enough to have touched him if he had been so inclined? - A. The pistol went over<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220007"></xptr>the horse's head, and then he turned it round to strike Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner say any thing before he fired? - A. They were both in a great passion.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. How near were you when the pistol was fired? - A. Very near.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Fielding. I live at No. 5, Francis-street, Tottenham Court-road; I was leaning on one of the posts of the turnpike-gate at the time this happened; I saw the post-chaise and four go through the gate, and I saw the prisoner stop to pay the toll, and then Davis came up in his chaise, he went about twenty yards beyond the gate, and then he jumped out of the chaise, and took hold of the bridle of Robinson's horse; and struck him in the face with the but-end of his whip.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what words he made use of? - A. He said, damn your eyes, you rascal, what did you strike my horse for, or something of that sort; he said, if you have any thing to say to me, I live with Lord Lonsdale; after that he damned him and Lord Lonsdale too, he said, he is a bigger rascal than you are; the horse was standing close, I could not see the pistol, but I saw the slash; the turnpike-house is a small wooden house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did it go in a direction towards Davis? - A. It did not; it went from him towards the house.</p>
               <p>Q. If he intended to have shot him could he not have done it? - A. He could have put it in his mouth.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Could you perceive that Davis struck Robinson? - A. Yes; I perceived that perfectly a great many times.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You have had an opportunity of knowing the prisoner in the service of Lord Lonsdale, and know whether he was a man of humanity? - A. He was in my service for a short time; I always considered him to be a man of good nature, and most excellent temper, that was the character he had in my family; and, I believe, the two services in which he has been since.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I have known the prisoner seven years; a most universal good character, a benevolent kind man, as unlikely to do such an act as any man I ever heard of.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Davis.) Q. When you came up to this man, did you lay hold of his cloaths, and endeavour to pull him off? - A. No; I only laid hold of the bridle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you strike him with your whip? - A. I did not; I left my whip in my chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. You were, no doubt, irritated a great deal in that situation; can you take upon you to swear that you did not strike him? - A. I am very positive I did not.</p>
               <p>Court.(To Brough.) Q. You went in for change for the shilling? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you came out it was that Davis came up; did you, after that, see Davis attempt to pull the prisoner off his horse, or give a blow? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you satisfied that you should have seen it, if any such thing had passed, before the pistol was fired? - A. I am certain no such thing had passed at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Clarke.) Did you see any blow given by Davis to the prisoner? - A. No; I was not there half a moment.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Fielding. I live at Hampstead, I am a shoemaker; I was going to Hampstead at the time this happened; I was about twenty yards from the place where they were, they were on this side of the gate; when I came up, Davis had got hold of the horse, with either a stick or a whip in his hand, I am sure it was one or the other; and as he had got hold of the horse, he was striking at him; and the gentleman on the horse said, he lived with Lord Lonsdale; if he wanted any thing with him, to come there; upon which, he damned Lord Lonsdale, and said, he is as big a rascal as you are; he said, if you don't let go the horse I will shoot you; and he said, he might shoot and be damned; upon that, he fired the contrary way, when he might have put it into his mouth, and shot him dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him make any blow at Robinson? - A. No; the pistol went off, and the man fell down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Robinson strike him with the end of the pistol? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. How far might you be off? - A. It might be twenty yards, or not so much; but if you wish to know, I can measure it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a dark night? - A. No; it was moonlight.</p>

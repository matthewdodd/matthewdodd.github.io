            . On the 7th of July, I received a 20 l. bank note of the house-keeper of Lord Ligonier, No. 295; this was on a Saturday, and we missed it on the Monday following. I had the date and No. from the gentlewoman after we had lost it; I do not know it of my own knowledge: I was gone to Bare Key; when I returned, my wife told me the desk was broke, and the note lost: we had a suspicion of the prisoner, he having laid out some money, which he could not give an account how he came by. I was before the justice on two examinations: on the first he denied it; this was on the Monday, before Justice Fielding: he then said, one Toby, a black, had given him two guineas to buy the things that he had bought. The second examination was on the Thursday; then he confessed he broke open the desk, and took this 20 l. note out: his master, a gentleman lodged at our house about eight months; (the prisoner was a black) Mr. Taylor brought the bill to the Justice; we examined it, and found by the date and No. it was my note; he said, two blacks came and changed it with him, but he did not think the prisoner was one of them.</p>

             was in company with me; one of the men said to William Newman, how do you do? he answered them, how do you do? they said they must trouble him for his money; Newman said, he had none for them, and ran away; they turned to me directly, and said, they must have my cloak then, and they took the cloak, and left the ribbon that tied it round my waist.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the cloak here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. He is about the heighth; I cannot say more.</p>
               <p>JANE SWFFT sworn. - I live servant at the Catherine-Wheel, in Effex-street, Whitechapel; the prisoner Grover used our house: On Sunday, the 25th of October, the prisoner, the man that was tried this morning, and two others, came into our house, and left our house about a quarter before six.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your house from where the robbery was committed? - A. About a mile and a quarter.</p>
               <p>JOHN GRIFFITHS sworn. - I am an officer of Lambeth-street: On Sunday evening, in consequence of hearing of this robbery, I went with Coomes to Whitechapel; we waited a little while in the street, when the prisoner, in company with a sailor that has been tried, past us, and walked as far as the Hat and Plough; then a third man came up, and spoke to them, about the heighth of the prisoner; they stopped together about a minute, and then went into the Plough; we followed them in, and the moment we went in, one man slipped out at the side-door. On the Monday I heard some conversation -</p>
               <p>Mr. Bevill. Q. Before he said any thing, did you tell him it would be better for him to confess? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor threatened him? - A. No; I asked him how he came to be so foolish as to go with these men to commit this robbery; he said, it was the first time, and if he got over this, he would not do it any more; he said, they went from the Catherine-Wheel, in Catherine-Wheel-alley, about six o'clock, and going down Mile-End-road, towards Stepney-fields, he said they had neither of them, any money, and they agreed to stop the first person they met, and a young man and woman met them, and they agreed to stop them; they asked the young man for his money, but he got away from them, and then they took the young woman's cloak from her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bevill. Q. At first two persons passed you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And after that you saw them go into a public-house? - A. Yes; after a third person had come up to them.</p>
               <p>Q. And that person was about the size of the prisoner? - A. He was.</p>

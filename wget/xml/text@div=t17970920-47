             sworn - I am a commodore belonging to the East-India Company's warehouses, in <placeName id="t17970920-47-crimeloc247">New-street, Bishopsgate-street</placeName>

               <p>WESTBROOK sworn - I am an assistant elder of the East-India Company's warehouses; all I know of it is, to confirm what Mr. Bell has said; I have had some conversation with him in the Compter; he said, he should be very glad to make a discovery, if he could be admitted an evidence; I said, I could not say any thing to it; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200054"></xptr>went to ask Mr. Chetham, and he told me, that he and the other man were both fully committed; I then went back, and told the prisoner that he could not be admitted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. He was a man of very good character? - A. Yes; a man that we have been ever much indebted to as to getting goods ready for shipping and unshipping.</p>
               <p>Q. He was one of the first persons who came forward in the late militia business? - A. I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q.Has he not made discoveries very important, for preventing future depredation? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SAPWELL sworn - I am a constable,(produces the muslin); I had this from Mr. Corbett's warehouse; I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. WILLIAMS sworn. - I am one of the principal elders of the East-India Company's warehouses; this is the kind of muslin that is in our warehouses.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it to be the property of the East-India Company? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. What character has he deserved? - A. For some years a very good one; he was always the readiest man to take the hardest labour, and a very useful servant to the Company; when the India Company raised volunteers, and the names were called over, he was ready and chearful in that service.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, two of whom had known him from his infancy, and gave him a good character.</p>

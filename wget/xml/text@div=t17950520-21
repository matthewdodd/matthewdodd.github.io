             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a patrol of Bow-street; I saw the prisoner on the morning of the 12th of May, on Mount-pleasant, with the boards against a waggon.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabouts is Mount-pleasant? - Just at the end of Elm-street, the lower end of Gray's-inn-lane. He took two of the boards and laid them by the side of the fence, and left a child to mind them; I see him take them from the side of a waggon, and laid them down, and left his child to mind them, and then took the other two to carry home; I asked him where he was going? he said he was going down to the lower end of Warner-street; then I insisted on his bringing the boards back to the place where he had taken them from, which he did, he brought them back to the buildings in North-place.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it from there that you see him take them? - No, he said he took them from there himself.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is this from the place where you found him? - It may be as far as from the end of Newgate-street, of somewhere thereabouts. Then I took the boards to my own house afterwards, and made an inquiry for an owner for them, and I found that they belonged to Mr. Pitcher, he came and owned them in my yard, there is the name in full length, in two places on each board.</p>
               <p>Pitcher. They are scaffolding boards, deal; I have no doubt about them in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Why is not your brother here? - He thought it was not necessary; as I knew the boards as well as he.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you nois them? - No, we cannot, we have so many.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was taking a walk one morning, and I see two or three old boards lay down, and being a poor man who had served my King and country, I thought it no harm to pick these boards up to light a fire, to make the kettle boil, I instantly picked them up, I thought they were bits of old wood; this gentleman, Mr. Kirby knew me when my uncle was sheriff, Mr. Baker, four years ago; and they brought me away last night suddenly from Clerkenwell; I have some friends to send for to give me a character.</p>

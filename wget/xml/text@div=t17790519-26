               <p>I keep the Feathers, a publick-house in Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the prisoners coming to your house on the 28th of April? - I was not at home when they came in. When I came home, Morgan was sitting in the taproom; he said to my wife, mistress, give me change for these two pints of beer, and offered her a sixpence. She having a child in her arms, she desired me to give him change. I took the sixpence, and went to the door, and found it was a bad one. I told him it was a bad sixpence; he gave me another. I looked at that, and found it was a bad one, and told him so. He then gave me another, and said D - n them, I believe they are all bad - if my father was a coiner, I could turn

             for him and hang him. That piece was bad. He then gave me a shilling, and I changed that. I got into discourse with him, and asked him who he was; he said, he kept a chandler's shop; I said to him, Morgan, if I was to come into your house, and call for three halfpennyworth of bread and cheese, and offer you three bad sixpences; what should you think me to be? he said, a blackguard. Then I said, I must think you a blackguard, for offering me three bad sixpences. He then desired Jones to go on with the bundle he had, and bid me draw him another pint of beer. I suspected they had counterfeit money about them; I followed Jones out, and asked him what he had there; he said, that he had nothing but some tools; to the best of my knowledge he said tools; he did not tell me they were counterfeit halfpence, I am sure of that. Morgan followed me out of the door, and said, let him go, he has nothing but a few counterfeit halfpence. With that I desired Jones to come back; he did, and Morgan followed him. When he was come back, I sent for a constable, and charged him with them both. Before I charged them, I opened the bundle, and found a parcel of counterfeit halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. What else? - Nothing but counterfeit halfpence. There were three bundles: in each bundle five shillings worth, also a single shilling's worth, and twenty-six shillings worth tied up in papers. This is one of them (producing it) the others I have at home. I did not think it worth while to bring them all; they have been in my custody ever since. Mr. Burkwood, Mr. White, and myself, took them to the Compter. We searched Morgan, and found upon him a small and a large key, and about two shillings in silver. Burkwood took the keys from him. In his discourse he told me, first, he lived at Wood's Close; that he kept a chandler's shop. Then he said he lived somewhere near Wheeler-street, Cold-Bath Fields. I went, in consequence of his direction, to a chandler's shop in Wood's Close, and found he had lived there. I was there directed to a little Court in Cold-Bath-Fields; they could not tell me the name of the court. I went and found the court; I enquired at the corner, and was informed, he lived the second or third door up the court. I said to Mr. Burkwood, let us keep together. I went and rang at the bell three times; nobody answered. I took the key from Burkwood's hand, and opened the door with it; we went up stairs, and saw a candle burning in a little room.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - Between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, we then went down, and found a press and several other articles. We then, went up stairs again, and in the room where there was a bed, we found two dies for halfpence upon the floor, and in the cupboard of the room.</p>
               <p>(The dies were produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Was that in the room where you saw the light? - No; there did not appear to be any lodgers in the house; there were but two beds in the house. Jones said that he had slept in one of them a week, and Morgan and his wife lay in the other. He said, they had made no halfpence there yet. I asked him who dug the hole to fix the block in for the press; he told me himself.</p>
               <p>When did he say that, before or after you had been in the house? - After; we could not tell that there was a block there till we had been. The block was fixed in the ground, and the press lay in the cellar; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177905190037"></xptr> press was not fixed up. There were several articles, as wedges for fixing it up.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You took all the halfpence from Jones? - Yes; Morgan bid him go on with the bundle, it was on the table; he shoved it to him.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear when you came to the house that it belonged to one Edwards? - I am very certain Morgan said it was his house; Jones, who slept with him, said it was his house.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear that the implements were left there by Edwards? - I heard so from Morgan.</p>
               <p>The fly, I believe, was not in the house? - No; it was in the house of one Steel.</p>

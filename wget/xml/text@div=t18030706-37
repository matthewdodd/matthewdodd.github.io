             sworn. - Q. At what time on the 27th of May did any thing happen to you? - A. At eleven o'clock at night, I was going to Hertford; I was short of money; I wanted to follow the waggon for company.</p>

               <p>Q.Where did you come from? - A. Turnhamgreen; a man knocked me down.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was that? - A.About a mile from <placeName id="t18030706-37-crimeloc207">Hammersmith</placeName>

               <p>Q.Where was the man? - A. Up against the pales by a bush.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you before he knocked you down? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.What did he knock you down with? - A. His fist, and then he wanted to be concerned with me; he said, he would lie with me, and I cried, murder! he said, he would pull my tongue out if I cried out any more; he beat me with his fist as long as he could; you never saw such a head as I had.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did he strike you with his fist? - A. Every where; my head was as big as a peck, and he stamped upon my stomack; then he wanted to force my body; he put his hand up my petticoats, and used me terribly.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he take any thing from you? - A. Yes, a basket with some trifles that I had; he did not leave me a halfpenny worth to sell; he ran away with it.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did he go away - did any body come up to you? - A. No creature; I crawled upon my hands and knees till I met the watchman, Gibbs, and he guided me to an alehouse; the man was just gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see your basket again? - A. Yes, at the Justice's the next day.</p>

               <p>Q. It was not light enough to see the man's face? A. Not to take full observation; I saw that he was of a dark complexion.</p>

               <p>Q. What was there in this basket? - A. Books and ballads, cotton-laces, and a few sewingneedles; I had but a penny in the world; there was a pair of spectacles, some needles for making cabbage-nets, and a night-cap.</p>

               <p>RICHARD GIBBS sworn. - Q.What are you? - A. I am night constable and watchman of the parish of Hammersmith.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember at any time seeing that old woman? - A. Yes, five weeks ago last Saturday, about one o'clock in the morning, at the bottom of Hammersmith; she was crawling along on her hands and knees on the foot-path; I took her to the Chaise and Horses, a night-house, where the carts and waggons stop when they go to market; she was in a very bloody condition, and her head swelled as big as a peck; the blood ran out of her mouth; her eyes were very much swelled; she was quite frightful for any one to see; both her hands were bloody all over.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe whether that was blood that had dropped from her mouth, or from an injury done to her hands? - A.I did not; her face was cut very much.</p>

               <p>MATTHEW WELLS sworn. - Q.Were you at the Chaise and Horses at Hammersmith when Gibbs came in with the old woman? - A. Yes, last Saturday five weeks; I live there as ostler.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was it? - A.About a quarter before three o'clock, I think, in the morning, and in consequence of what they told me, I came to London in pursuit of the man; I rode with Mr. Rutter, a butcher, to Oxendon-street; then I went back into Piccadilly, and met a man with a basket three doors on the other side of Air-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was that man? - A. He said over night that his name was

               <p>Q. Had you seen him over night? - A. Yes, he had had two half pints of beer at our house.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that man the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes, that is the man; when I met him, I said, good morning to you, and he said the same to me. It rained very hard, and I asked him if he was not wet; he said, he was only a little wet at his back; I said, he had not come far; he said, he had come from Brentford; I asked him to go and have half a pint of purl; I said, I thought it would not hurt him; he said, he thought it would do him good; and when we had got about one hundred and twenty yards, I took him by the collar, and told him he was my prisoner; the watchman was in his watch-box, and we took him to Vine-street watch-house; I took the basket from him, and delivered it to the constable of the night; it contained some books and ballads, some laces, and other things.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. He asked me what I had to sell in the basket, and I said it did not belong to me, it belonged to another man.</p>

               <p>Wells. I asked him what he had got to sell, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060023"></xptr>he said he had not got any thing to sell; he did not say any thing more till he got to the watch-house, and then he said another man gave it him.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. What time did you see him at the Chaise and Horses? - A. Not till between twelve and one o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. How long before the other witness and the old woman came in? - A.About an hour and a half.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any body with him at that time? - A. Nobody.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he the basket with him at that time? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. At the Chaise and Horses? - A. Yes; the basket stood upon the table before him.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the same man? - A. I am very sure of it.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was he at the Chaise and Horses? - A.Half an hour; I dare say.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him? - A. No, I never spoke to him while he was in the house.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to take notice of him? - A. Because I saw the basket standing upon the table, and I saw him there.</p>

               <p>Q. What induced you to remark him more than any body else? - A. I always do, when any strangers come in at night; I was in and out, and saw him several times.</p>

               <p>Q. How long a time might you be in the room when the prisoner was there? - A. I suppose I might be in five or six minutes at a time, three or four different times.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you think you cannot be mistaken about the man? - A. I am sure I am not.</p>

               <p>Q.Did he say a man had given it to him before he got to the watch-house? - A. No.</p>

               <p>CHARLES LUPPINO sworn. - I am a constable; On the 27th of May last, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house at three o'clock in the morning by Wells; he gave me a basket, which I have had the care of ever since, (produces it); it contains the same articles that it contained when I first received it; I asked him his name, and he said, his name was John Kelly; but the next morning he said, at the Office, that his name was John Thompson, and that John Kelly was the man who had beat the woman.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the Magistrate take down his examination in writing? - A. No, not any thing that the prisoner said.</p>

               <p>Q. Who had charged him with beating the woman? - A.The ostler.</p>

               <p>HENRY GOUGH sworn. - I am a watchman; On the 27th of May, the ostler came to me about half after two o'clock, and made enquiry if I had seen such a man, describing him; about five minutes afterwards, I saw him again, with the prisoner, and he gave me charge of him; I took him to the watch-house, he had a basket upon his arm, which the ostler took from him, I marked it at the watch-house, I saw it delivered into the care of the constable.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Hurst.) Look at that basket? - A. It is mine; these cabbage-net needles are mine, I have had them these twenty years; here is a comb of mine, my cap, and my spectacles, these things were all covered over with paper to keep them dry; here is a pin-cushion, there were three of them.</p>

               <p>Q.How was the man dressed? - A.In a jacket.</p>

               <p>(To Luppino.) How was the man dressed when he was brought to the watch-house? - A.In a blue jacket; the next morning, as I was taking him to the watch-house, the old woman saw him, and immediately exclaimed, that is the villain.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am innocent of what is said against me; I left Brentford about ten o'clock; and as I came to Hyde Park turnpike, a sailor came up to me, and we walked together, it was very wet and dark, and in Piccadilly he gave me a glass of gin at the public-house; when we came out, he asked me to carry the basket, while he did a little job for himself, and I thought no harm of it, then this gentleman laid hold of me, I never was at the Chaise and Horses in my life.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">The, evidence of this witness was given partly in English, and partly in French, interpreted</hi>). I am an Austrian, I have been residing at the Belle Vue Hotel, Norfolk Street, Strand—I was a professor of literature at Vienna—I came to England, about 17th March, 1874——I brought with me 105 pieces of Sevres china, a complete dessert service, the property of Prince Repnine, a Russian nobleman—I was employed to sell the service, the price was fixed at Vienna, at 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and coming here at 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in English money—I was promised a commission by the prince, his word was sufficient for me; I had authority in writing to sell—the agreement with the prince was in conversation, and in a letter; it was spoken about generally, he promised me a remuneration—in August, last year, I was still in possession of the Sevres service, and with the exception of some few pieces I had the service at the hotel in Norfolk Street, where I was residing—the defendant came to me there—I had never seen him before; he came alone, without any introduction—he sent in his card by a waiter, and on going into the drawing-room I found him there—he com<lb></lb>menced speaking in English—I asked him if he spoke French—he said he was educated in France, and we then conversed in French, with several words in English—he asked me whether he could see that beautiful service of which he had heard so much—I said "With the greatest pleasure, wait a moment," because I was going to fetch the key, as I had the service in a small room, downstairs on the ground floor; I then showed him fourteen pieces which had been taken out as a sample, he examined them with great atten<lb></lb>tion and with the appearance of a great connoisseur—he asked me the price of the whole collection—I said the lowest price would be 8,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he asked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187602280004"></xptr>
               <p>me whether the collection could be divided—I said that could be done, into two groups, viz., one group for twelve persons, and the other for ten persons, the first consisting of fifty-five pieces, and the second of forty-nine pieces, and in this way one of the plates would remain over—the price I fixed for the first group was 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and for the second 4,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was looking at the pictures which were in my room, and he particularly looked at one of Nicolas Poussin, and he told me that he also had a Poussin in his pos<lb></lb>session, together with other old pictures, and he begged me to call upon him in the afternoon at 4 o'clock—he said that one of his friends, a lord, had already offered him 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that picture, but that he had asked 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and therefore he could not give it to him for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believed him to be really the son of a lord, in consequence of his way of talking, at all events that he was a distinguished person—I went to the Albany next day, but I made a mistake and went to the wrong door; I left my card—after that I had quite forgotten him, but about three weeks after he came to the hotel again and left a card; I was not at home, and he wrote for me to come to him to-morrow—I wrote to him saying I would come at 10 o'clock the following day—I then went to the rooms, I 3, on that occasion the servant I think opened the door—I do not remember if Phillips or the servant did, but the servant opened it most often when I went there, by the servant I mean, Cohen—I saw Phillips there that morn<lb></lb>ing; I don't remember the date exactly, it was between the 15th and the 20th, it was about the 15th; he received me in a large room furnished with simple elegance—there were several large pictures in it hanging on the walls—our conversation was principally in French, but also several phrases in English; after a little conversation he took me into another room, and showed me the Poussin which was hanging over his bed—he then said "I wish first of all to buy the smaller group containing forty-nine pieces for 4,500?. in this manner; I shall give you first of all the Poussin picture, and I will bring to you the lord on the day following, who no doubt will buy it for 2,000?., and on that occasion you can sell your own Poussin as well, because the lord is an amateur, and a very passionate or very great admirer of pictures by Poussin, and as to the remaining 2,500?. I shall in the mean while cede or transfer, or give to you as guarantee five other ancient pictures," without selling them, only as guarantee—he said, "When I have the smaller group in my possession I shall obtain a loan from my father of 5,000?. to 6,000?.; my father is a man of fortune and lives at the present moment at Ryde, with his family because he has the intention to go on a long tour in the Mediterranean, and has a yacht, because he is a member, of the yacht club, and the owner of one yacht," and when once he had obtained this loan he would pay me 4,000?. in cash which would make with the price for the Poussin 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for me, and as to the rest 2,500?. he should beg me to give him credit till the end of January or the commencement of February, leaving to me as a guarantee, the five other pictures—he said "To have still a larger security or guarantee you will do me the pleasure of residing at my apartments during my absence, instead of living at the hotel, and then you can make use of my servant and housekeeper"—I told him I should consider all this—he mentioned the names of the artists who had painted the pictures that were to be left as a guarantee, and the names were on the frames—he said those pictures had cost him 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he would never sell them, except the Poussin—on 22nd September, I went again to the Albany and saw Phillips, but we</p>

               <p>were together twice or three times previously, he called on me and I had been to the Albany—on the several occasions of my going there I saw Cohen, whether he was there on all occasions I can't say, but I have seen him often there—on 22nd I went to see Phillips at 10 o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing—he then told me that his mother and sisters were coming <hi rend="italic">to town</hi> from Ryde, to make purchases for the long tour, and he had also heard from the lord who was to come either that evening or the next morning, and there-fore this would be the best opportunity to give him the smaller group to show to his mother and sisters; I said why should they not come to my place, to which he replied that they had so much to do that they could only come for a few minutes or a little while to London before returning to Ryde—I told him I should bring him the smaller group; he begged me not to come before 4 o'clock—I went to the Albany after 4 o'clock, and took the box with forty-four pieces—I had prepared two agreements in French; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them, but it had not been finished at that time because I did not know the names of all the pictures, and the names that are in blue ink here were written at the Albany; I mean the description of the subjects of the pictures and the names of the artists—Phillips told me those; he dic-tated them to me, and I wrote it in his presence—I then gave it to him to copy and sign—he read it in my presence and commenced copying it. (<hi rend="italic">This was translated as follows:</hi> "London, 22nd Sept., 1875. I. 3, Albany Street, Piccadilly. I, the undersigned, declare of having received of Mr. Matthew Yehovar, of 21, Norfolk Street, Strand, the following pieces of ancient Sevres dessert service, paste tendre, turquoise, forming the first group, forty-four pieces. I declare at the same time to have given to him in gua-rantee till the payment of the sum of 4,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sterling, the price of this first group, the following pictures belonging to me: 1, the Bacchante of Nicolas Poussin; 2, the Amphion, Salvator Rosa; 3, the Triumph of Galatea, by Annibal Carracchi; 4, the Procession of Cupids, by Andrea del Sarto; 5, Sleeping Figure, by Perugini; 6, Queen Elizabeth Naming her Suc<lb></lb>cessor, by Smirke.") I also wrote this paper in blue ink there—I showed it to Phillips. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "London, 22nd Sept., 1875. I 3, Albany, Piccadilly. I, the undersigned, declare that I have bought from Mr. Vehovar, of 21, Norfolk Street, Strand, a quantity of old Sevres dessert service of 1766 and 1767, paste tendre, turquoise, birds and flowers painted by (<hi rend="italic">enumerating names</hi>), consisting of 104 pieces, belonging to his Highness the Prince Nicolas de Kieff of Russia, for the sum of 8,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and oblige myself to pay him this sum of 8,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at the handing over of the collection, in cask" Phillips said that all these contracts were useless and were too long, as it was only a question of a few days, when he would be in a position to pur<lb></lb>chase the whole collection; then he said "I shall do that much shorter," and then he sat down to write this receipt, which' I signed—the paper was on the table; there was other similar paper there—I myself copied it on another sheet of similar paper—it has a coat-of-arms and a motto on it. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I 3, Albany, Piccadilly.

And I hereby declare to buy the remaining portion of the Sevres service. Signed, Samuel C. Phillips.") He had written out a receipt also for me, which I copied and signed—I gave Phillips a receipt for the six pictures, which were described to me as a guarantee—I have not seen the</p>

Phillips the following pictures in exchange for a dessert service belonging to Prince Repnine (<hi rend="italic">naming them</hi>). Signed, Matthew Vehovar, accredited agent of the Prince Repnine.") When 1 brought the bos there I immediately took the pieces out and put them on a sideboard—Cohen was not in the room at the time; he brought the box into the room—I don't remember whether he was in the room when the china was placed out on the sideboard, I paid no attention to him—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was written by Phillips, and I copied it—he asked me to keep the service till he had received the necessary money from his father—I said "You ought to undertake to purchase it," and on that Phillips wrote and signed this paper. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "London, 22nd Sept., 1875. 21, Norfolk Street, Strand. Dear Sir,—It is at all times understood between us that the remaining portion of the dessert set of the old Sevres china is at your disposal. Matthew Vehovar, accredited agent of his Serene Highness Prince Repnine.") Phillips then said "Now, as I have the smaller group, I can now have the loan from my father, and I shall bring the lord to you to<lb></lb>morrow to buy the Poussin, and I hope in four or five days we shall have concluded the whole affair"—I was then going away, and he asked me whether I could not take the Poussin with me—I was a little surprised to see that the picture had been taken down already when I entered there—I said the picture was too large, and it was already very late, and I preferred <hi rend="italic">to call to-morrow</hi> morning at 9 o'clock to take the picture, because he could not come with the lord before 12 o'clock at noon—there never was a question about taking the other pictures with me; nothing was said about that—it had been arranged that the lord was to pay me 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. next day for the Poussin—as to the word "exchange" in that paper I have to observe that I always spoke of a provisional exchange, as I had written in my first con<lb></lb>tract and guarantee till he should have paid me—now, I well understand the word "exchange," but at that time, in the great haste in which he made me sign, I did not observe that the word "provisional" had been omitted; it never was my intention to exchange the service against the pictures—I had been authorised to give credit for one-third of the sum by selling the service against security; that was verbally—I left the box and the forty-four pieces at the Albany in the possession of Phillips—it was a wooden box covered with leather, made expressly for the china—Cohen and the workmen helped to carry the box from the cab to Phillips' rooms—after my return to the hotel, and after dinner, a waiter called me out, and to <hi rend="italic">my great</hi> surprise I saw four men with a cart, and the pictures outside—Cohen was there—I spoke to him in English—I asked him "For what reason have you brought all these pictures here?——he said "When you left Mr. Phil<lb></lb>lips, the lord arrived, and he thought it was the best to send you imme<lb></lb>diately the pictures, because he will call to-morrow between 11 and 12 o'clock with the lord"—I had only a small room for the china and for the other pictures, and I could not put all the pictures in that room—I was angry at receiving the pictures; I had not desired it, and it never was arranged between me and Phillips—Cohen left the pictures with me—I went to the Albany next day before 9 o'clock; I rang the bell many times, and nobody opened the door; I could not get in; the old housekeeper came and said that Phillips was out of town—I gave orders to the housekeeper to send Cohen immediately he returned—I saw Cohen that evening—Phil<lb></lb>lip did not come with any nobleman that morning—when Cohen came I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187602280007"></xptr>
               <p>said "How is it that your master has gone away"—he said "I do not know at all"—I said "You, as his servant, do not know anything about it?"—he said "I have passed the night at the house of one of my relations, who had some fete or party"—I said "<hi rend="italic">No</hi> doubt you will get a letter from Mr. Phil<lb></lb>lips explanatory of his sudden departure, please bring it to me"—he came next evening without any news; he said he had received no letter—the next day was Sunday—he did not return any more, but on the Monday he brought be a letter, without giving it to me; he read it to me that Mr. Phillips was at a hunting party at Beckenham, and that he charged him (Cohen) to tell me that he would be back by Tuesday or Wednesday—after that I never saw Phillips or Cohen again until they were in custody—on the Tuesday night I went to the Albany, and every day two or three times, but found nobody but the housekeeper—I also addressed a letter to Phillips, but got reply—after the prisoners were before the Magistrate I saw in the possession, of the police the box in which. I had carried the forty-four pieces to the Albany—I have some pieces of the china here now (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. I am an Austrian by birth—I know what a bankrupt is; a bankruptcy is a failure—I was a bankrupt in 1864 at Vienna—I gave up all that I possessed—I had property in Styria, the fortune of my wife—I gave up all I possessed, about 27,000 florins to my creditors—Prince Repnine entrusted me with this china at the exhibi<lb></lb>tion at Vienna; that was after my bankruptcy—I was employed at the exhibition, I was inspector of the pavilion of amateurs, where they exhibited works of ancient art and also modern—here is my document (<hi rend="italic">producing a paper</hi>)—I had the surveillance of that pavilion, it was entrusted to me—this china was exhibited there and then I had to sell it for the prince—he gave me no written directions then, but when he came to Vienna an agreement was arranged between us, he gave me his authority, I had a letter of autho<lb></lb>risation from the prince; it must be here, it was at the police-court—my duty was to sell the china—I brought it from Vienna to London in the same state in which I received it, 105 pieces—after a year I pledged several pieces—I did not pawn some of it within three months of my arrival in London, it was about a year—I cannot remember whether it was within six months—the first amount I raised was in October; I have given this explanation to Mr. Wontner—I spent the money for my own purposes and also in expenses for the service—I pawned two pieces in October to Mr. Young and some to Mr. Bierstoff—my intention was never dishonest—I pawned some of the china to Young in October, 1874, for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I spent that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for myself and my 'expenses in England and for my children in Vienna—I re<lb></lb>deemed those two pieces after two months—I pawned it afterwards at Mr. Bierstoff's for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have thirty-seven pieces of the china now in my pos<lb></lb>session—I have entrusted it to the London Joint Stock Bank—the forty-four pieces are in this box, which was seized by Sergeant Reimers in Mr. Cook's office—the manager of the bank was so kind as to receive during many months the whole service in deposit—I gave it to him to take care of—I did not get any money from the bank for it—in April last year I went to Paris and took with me fourteen pieces—I pledged one piece there by an agent, it is at Paris now—when I have the liberty to go to Paris, for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I can have it back again—I did not pawn it, it was a very bad action of the agent; he was not my agent—I did not myself pawn any in Paris; I gave a piece to a dealer in Pans and he gave me 500 francs, and I gave a receipt for it, that was to enable me to return to London—the prince has since taken out a</p>

On 15th Navember I received war<lb></lb>rants for the prisoners' apprehension—Phillips was arrested and brought to London—I did not arrest him—he was arrested by Inspector Gibbs, of the Brighton Police—he was handed over to me at Bow Street—I then read the warrant—he said nothing—Cohen said it was false—Cohen was handed to me by Detective Constable Leader of the C division—I searched Cohen and found on him some papers, a copy of a telegram to Phillips about bankruptcy, also a memorandum from G. H. Chalker, a betting book, the key of the chambers, two invoices, and some letters addressed to himself—I searched Phillips' lodging at Brighton and found these papers—I afterwards went to the Albany and searched Phillips' rooms—I there found some books of accounts relating to Ely Place—I found an I O U for 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. signed by Cohen, also an I O U for 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. signed by Sidney Jacobson &amp; Cohen, three betting books, some invoices showing dealings in trimmings, Phillips' letter book, a day book showing dealings in trimmings and fringe, a book marked" Receivable and payable cash-book" from January, 1872, to 1874, a memo<lb></lb>randum book with a number of leaves torn out and no entries, one banker's</p>

I assisted Sergeant Reimers in the case—he had to go on the Continent and he handed the warrants to me to execute—I did execute them at Bow Street—the prisoners were brought to Bow Street and I charged them there on the warrant—I had nothing to do with taking them—I saw Magner, he had been to Brighton, I heard that he came back with Phillips—it was he, with Professor Vehovar, who gave Phillips into custody—I believe Jacobson was also at Brighton—I never heard of any reward being offered for the return of the china, this is the first I have heard of it—I have heard them speak of it at Bow Street, but I heard of no reward being offered—Mr. George Lewis originally appeared for Phillips at Bow Street, Mr. Cook appeared for the prosecution—I heard that a compromise was to be effected, that a sum of money had been offered for the return of the china, we heard that Mr. Robins was going to give 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it; it was not offered as a reward for the apprehension of anybody, merely for the returning of the china—I heard from Mr. Robins that the china was to be restored to him for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I and Reimers did not agree that that should be done, we did not know where the china was—we heard that it was to be returned on 1st December—it was not returned—Mr. Cook has got it for the purpose of being returned.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. Mr. Jacobson introduced me to the prosecutor—I had known Mr. Jacobson about twelve months—I was concerned in granting a lease for him—he is a dealer in antiquities, works of art and vertu, and has a very large shop in Oxford Street—ho was here yesterday—I have not seen him here this morning—I did not know Magner till this, Jacobson introduced me to him before he introduced me to the prosecutor—the introduction was for me to attend at Judges Chambers to watch the case—things had been seized belonging to Vehovar, the china and a lot of things, in an action, upon a regular judgment ob<lb></lb>tained by a firm that call themselves Fisher &amp; Co., Mr. Levy there—an action is now pending in which I am for the prosecutor, and he is the defendant—it is an action for alleged work and labour, and also for a picture—there are two actions—the criminal charge began about a fortnight after I had first met Professor Vehovar—it was not my suggestion—I was consulted about it, it had already been suggested by Mr. Goatley another solicitor; it came out of Mr. Goatley's hands into mine—I expressed my inability to give an opinion as I was not versed in criminal law, having been the pupil of a conveying barrister—I said I was not competent to give an opinion about it, that counsel must be consulted about it—after counsel had advised what should be done, I considered myself competent to do what was necessary—I think that would be about the 2nd November; I then went with Jacobson and Magner to counsel's chambers—a statement was brought to me made by Vehovar detailing the whole of the particulars; I think I have that statement—I first took steps on the Friday—the warrant was obtained on the Satur<lb></lb>day, and I handed it over to Sergeant Reimers—one morning when I arrived at my chambers Professor Vehovar was there, and said that Phillips had been arrested, and was to be brought to Bow Street at 10 or 12 o'clock—I have heard that Magner and Jacobson went down to Brighton—the warrants had not been refused before I obtained them—I got them from Mr. Flowers at his house at Hornsey—I went there with Sergeant Reimers, Jacobson, and Magner—Mr. Magner was secretary to a prince, a member of our royal family—Vehovar being a foreigner, Magner knowing the whole of the details acted as interpreter to him—I took Jacobson because he had sworn an information as to the value of the pictures—I should think it would be about twelve days after I got the warrant that I heard there was an offer of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get back the china—during that time I, as solicitor for the prosecution, had been conducting the case against Phillips—I heard about the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by a letter that was brought to me by Magner—previously to that I beard that Phillips had said he would smash the china into athousand pieces sooner than Vehovar should have it—Jacobson told me that—a letter was brought to me by Magner on 30th November, that if the china was delivered 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be paid, they were most anxious to recover the china—I had no control over the china—it was about 12.30 when Magner brought the letter, and he said that Phillips' brother would come and leave the china at my office, and the pictures were to be exchanged—the things were to be transferred as it were; that I heard from Magner—Phillips and Magner seem to have been friendly—I don't think he was the agent—the china was delivered, on my arrival at my office I found Phillips' brother</p>

               <p>there with it—the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to come from Messrs. Robins, the prince's solicitors, they were most anxious to get back the china—they then asked me if I would withdraw from the prosecution, I said "I cannot do anything without counsel"—Phillips' brother came accompanied by Mr. Froggatt who was then the solicitor for Phillips—my mind was not troubled, but I should never dream of doing anything without the consent of counsel; there was not any compromise—the body of this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing, the signature is Vehovar's—it was written by me for Yehovar to sign, as an authority for me to put before counsel or before the Magistrate, to advise us how to act (<hi rend="italic">Read:"</hi> 1st December, 1875. To Mr. G. M. Cook, 9, Gray's Inn Square. You will please withdraw from the prosecution in this case, I do not wish to proceed with the matter, M. Yehovar.") No arrangement had been made as to what was to be done with the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it had not been spoken of at all—Jacobson and Magner had exerted themselves, and they said that if money was paid they would be able to get the china back; it was not stated to whom the money was to be paid; I understood it to be to Jacobson and Magner—the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be paid to them—nothing was said about my costs, they were not to be paid out of the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I was not to have any por<lb></lb>tion of the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nothing was said about it—I said that 1 should leave my costs to the professor—he was not to have any of the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the whole was to go to Jacobson and Magner—I am not aware of any arrangement that the professor was to have any portion of the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the money was not actually paid, I refused to pay it—it was not paid to me, I never had it—Magner asked—me to give him a cheque, Jacobson asked me to give him a cheque—Phillips was in custody at that time, and the china was then in the hands of the police, it was delivered up to Sergeant-Reimers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> This (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter that Magner brought to me—the suggestion that the china should be restored to Mr. Vehovar came from Mr. George Lewis, on the very first occasion; he was then acting as solicitor for Phillips after he was in custody—no suggestion that I know of was made of restoring the china till after Phillips was in custody; Mr. George Lewis suggested to counsel on the first occasion that the china should be given up; that was the first suggestion I heard of giving up the china—I heard of the threat to destroy the china directly after Phillips' arrest.</p>

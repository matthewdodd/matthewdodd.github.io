                  </hi>. I live at No. 17, Cambridge-street, Hyde-park; and am shopman to Mr. Smith, a grocer. On 26th May, about 7 o'clock in the morning, I was in my bedroom—the prisoner's room is between mine and that in which the little boy, my master's son, sleeps—I heard Frederick Smith calling out, "Oh, Sarah! oh, Sarah!" I got out of bed, ran into the boy's room, and saw the prisoner on the bed, with the little boy underneath the clothes; she had a large carving knife in her hand, and struck at the boy's neck with it, and he caught it with his hands—I immediately took the knife from her hand, and threw it out of the room; there was blood on it—the moment the prisoner found that somebody had interfered, she fell on the bed apparently insensible—the boy ran out of the room; I noticed that he was bleeding, he is between twelve, and thirteen years old—the prisoner said nothing whatever—this is the knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

On the morning of 27th May, I heard a noise, came out of my room, and met him on the top flight of stairs bleeding very much—I took him down stairs, wrapped him up, went up stairs into his room, and found the prisoner lying on his bed—I said, "Sarah, what have you done this for?" she made no reply—I said, "What could have induced you to commit such an act as this?"—she made no reply—she had been in my family more than three months as general servant.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon to St. Mary's Hospital. On 31st May I saw the lad Frederick Smith at his father's house—he had two wounds on the left side of his neck, one immediately under the chin, and the other close to the ear; they were then healing; they were not of any great extent, as far as I could judge—there were also wounds on his fingers and on the back of his left hand—if those wounds had gone deep enough they would have endangered his life—they were superficial wounds, and could have been caused by this knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined, Q.</hi> Did you see the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not till she was at the police-court, some days afterwards—I have been house surgeon to St. Mary's Hospital two years—I have not been in the habit of attending persons afflicted with somnambulism—I have read such cases—I have heard the evidence here to-day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose a person had had some alarming dream, and had started from bed under the influence of that dream, do you think that the condition of the prisoner could be accounted for in that way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Hardly—I have read the "Medical Jurisprudence" of Mr. Taylor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> "Two persons had been hunting during the day, and slept together at night; one of them was renewing the chase in his dream, and, imagining himself to be present at the death of the stag, cried out,' I'll kill him! I'll kill him!' the other one, awakened by the noise, got out of bed, and by the light of the moon beheld the sleeper give several deadly stabs with a knife on the part of the bed which his companion had just quitted;" do you think that the prisoner's conduct might be the effect of some terrible dream? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think it would be exceedingly improbable that a person would commit a manual act in that way—I have had no experience of somnambulism; I have read of cases similar to that which you have quoted—I am a member of the College of Surgeons, and a licentiate of the Apothecaries' Company—there are some few more cases of somnabulism in the books, and they are doubtful; I should not be disposed to believe them, unless the evidence was exceedingly good in their favour—I think it quite possible that the prisoner might have done the act in a state of phrenzy, when she was not in her right mind—I should hardly think that a state of phrenzy could be produced by any horrible dream she might have had; but taking all the facts into my mind, her starting from bed and running into the room, I would not undertake to say that it is not possible.</p>

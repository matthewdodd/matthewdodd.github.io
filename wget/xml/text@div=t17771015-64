               <p>On the 19th of September I was sent by my master to fetch some cloth from Mr. Kempson's in Fleet-street; it was wrapp'd up as it is now; I believe that is the cloth: the prisoner came behind me, and snatched it from me, and ran away; I followed him, and called, Stop thief; he ran up Paul's-court in Huggin-lane, Wood-street, and run into a house; some people went in after him, but could not see him: I fetched my master; I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

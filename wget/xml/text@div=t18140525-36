On the 26th of April last, I was in the warehouse where the glasses are kept. I saw these glasses taken from the respective places, and set of one side; suspecting they were put there by the prisoner to be taken away at dinner time, I marked each one particular. I had applied to Mr. Armstrong to attend. On the prisoner going to dinner, I sent a servant up to see if they were gone; I discovered the glasses were gone. I went with the officer, and saw the prisoner taken in custody. He had got about fifty or sixty yards from our shop. He was then taken to the public-house next to the office. These glasses were taken out of his pocket; he confessed he had stolen them; they were the first; he hoped we would forgive him on account of his poor wife. The glasses were found in his pocket. He had a basket, carrying crockery-ware. He had bought articles of me before. I never suffered him to take anything without first bringing them into the shop, and having them booked to him. These glasses were up stairs, in the warehouse.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in the habit of buying articles of Mr. Shirley. I looked my goods out before I went to dinner; some earthen ware, and them glasses. I got them together; they were basons, jugs, and them glasses. I went to fetch the jugs and glasses down; I put the glasses in my pocket. I kept one glass in my hand to shew the clerk. As he was booking them a load of crates of earthen ware came to the door; he immediately told me to make haste home, that I should help him in with the crates. When I came back I took the glasses and went away. I believe I left a memorandum of the glasses; they would have been put down when I came back.</p>
               <p>Sharp. There was a cart come with crates. I was certain the prisoner had the property about him. I would not suffer him to stop. He had not a glass in his hand. He put the earthenware on the counter to be booked, but not the glasses.</p>

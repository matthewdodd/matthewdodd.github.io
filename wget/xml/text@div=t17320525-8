On the 23d of February, being Ash-Wednesday, about 9 in the Morning, I made fast my Door, and went out with my Wife to Leaden-Hall-Market, leaving no Body in the House. I return'd about Noon, and found my Back-Door open, and the Staple was forced off, my Drawers were broke, and my Money which I had left in these 2 Mole-Skins was gone. I suspected the Prisoner, having heard that he had broke open a House before. I went to an Alehouse that he frequented, and was told, that he had that Morning chang'd half a Guinea there, to pay a Crown that he had scor'd, and that he had hir'd a Hackney-Coach to carry him to Highgate. At Highgate I met a Man that went in the Coach with him, and he told me that the Prisoner gave the Coachman a Guinea. I heard of him all along the Road to Hackney-Common, and that from thence he went in a Waggon for Bigglesworth in Bedsordshire. I follow'd him thither, and heard that he had given a Guinea for a Horse to Eston, which is 7 Miles. I got to Eaton early on Friday Morning, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173205250010"></xptr> found him at the Cock, I thought it was the best Sight that ever I had seen; he was standing at the Door with a Pint of Ale in his Hand, there's special gol Ale at the Cock! he had a Suit of Cloth on his Back that he stole at the same time as he took my Money. I asked him how he could serve me so, to take away all that I had? He paused a little and said, he was very sorry for what he had done. I went in with him, he gave me back my Mole Skins, with 45 Guineas, and some Silver, and told me, that it was all that he had left. I asked him what he had done with the rest, he said, he had spent it, and given it away; that besides the Guinea for Horse hire and a Guinea for the Hackney Coach, he gave the Man that rode with him in the Coach 6 Guineas for bearing him Company from London to Highgate. In all he had squander'd away above 19 Guineas in less than two Days.</p>

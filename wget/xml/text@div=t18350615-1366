I know the prisoner—I saw him on the 7th of June, between eight and nine o'clock In the evening, on Fresh Wharf—I never saw him before, to my knowledge—I had my little girl, who is about four years and a half old, with me—there was a great num<lb></lb>ber of people round—there were a crowd of persona looking at the steam<lb></lb>boats coming in—the prisoner lifted up my gown, and cut a hole in the corner of my pocket—I found his hand in my pocket—I had not observed him near me before—I laid hold of his hand which was in my pocket, and would not let him go—I caught hold of him by the collar of his coat with both hands, and he gave me a blow with a penknife on the side of the face—I saw the knife in his hand at the time, when he attempted to stab me with it—he cut me with the knife—I saw the knife coming towards my face—I screamed out for assistance—I received a blow from him on the neck with his fist—I had hold of him fast at this time—he made two attempts to stab me with the knife, and I pushed him from me, and he cut my shawl—my shawl is cut in two places—I have it here—Rangecroft came up, and caught hold of him—I saw him drop the knife out of his hand—I picked</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Fresh Wharf. I have seen the prisoner several times before this Sunday night, the 7th of June, when I saw him, as near nine o'clock as can be, on Fresh Wharf—I saw Mrs. Shewry there—I was within twenty paces of her—I was standing there as the passengers were coming out of the steam-boat—there was a great crowd coming out—I heard her and the child cry out—I went immediately to her assistance, and she had hold of the prisoner—I collared him, seeing her struggling with him, and the blood falling from her face—the moment I collared him there was a rush at me, by whom I do not know, but I slung my arm round, and two or three of them went away—I then looked at the prosecutrix, and knew her—she was bleeding—the blood ran very fast down her bosom, and over the child's bonnet—it had sprinkled over the child—she gave me a knife, which I produce—I saw her pick it off the ground—there was blood on the blade—it was open—she took it off the ground where I had collared the prisoner.</p>

The prisoner was in his employ as errand-boy for about five weeks—I put a piece of waistcoating in a box in the shop on the 27th of Nov.—I missed it—when the prisoner went away in the evening I followed him, and found him in a public-house in Covent-garden—I told him there was a piece of waistcoating lost, and he must come back with me and find it—he said, I "Very well," and came with me—when we got as far as St. Martin's-lane, he wanted to go and tell his mother—I refused, and took him to the shop—he denied it for some time, and then said would I forgive him—I said I could not, and asked if he had it—it was found on him—this is it</p>

            , a shoemaker, residing at No. 86, in the Strand? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, on Saturday, the 9th of March last, seeing the prisoner at the bar? - A. I cannot recollect the prisoner exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the day? - A. Yes, on the 9th of March, Saturday evening, about half past nine, a woman came to buy two pair of shoes; I served her with the shoes; she said, she had nothing less than a five pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the shoes to come to? - A. Twelve shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she produce to you a five pound Banknote? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with that Bank-note that she tendered to you? - A. I took it into the parlour where Mr. Baddeley was; Mr. Baddeley told me to go back to the woman in the shop who had brought me the note, to desire her to write her name upon it; she said, she could not write.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that what did you do with the note? - A. On receiving that answer, I took it back into the parlour to Mr. Baddeley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Baddeley and you return back into the shop? - A. He looked at the note and compared it with another.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mr. Baddeley came to the prisoner and you with him? - A. Yes; he asked her where she took that note; she said, she could not tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What then? - A. Mr. Baddeley told her,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100026"></xptr>he did not think it was a good note; then she gave him another which was a good one.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with the note that she first gave to you? - A. He kept that in his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the other being tendered by the woman what then? - A. He returned that, the good one, and with respect to the bad one, he said he should keep that.</p>
               <p>Q. Take that Bank-note in your hand and tell whether that is the note? - A. It is the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure of that? - A. Yes, I am quite certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You know it to be the note that you received? - A. I wrote the name upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. That is all you know, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her afterwards at Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you write the name upon it? - A. When she stood in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon Mr. Baddeley saying that he should keep that note, the bad one, what was said more to the woman? - A. He told her, he would enquire if it was a good one, and for her to call again on Monday, and for me to write my name upon it, that we might know it was the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come again on Monday morning. -</p>
               <p>Court. Q. She was to come again on Monday to have the note? - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. She never did call on Monday? - A. No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing during the time that she was in the shop - Did you observe any thing with respect to the manner of her conduct? - A. She was very joking, and seemed as if she was rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have said very honestly you do not know the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What do you think? - A. I believe it is her, I will not swear it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a shoe-maker living in the Strand? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the last witness Smith, the journeyman, bringing you a Bank-note, on the 9th of March? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that Bank-note - Is that the Banknote that was brought to you by Smith? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go into your shop, and see any woman in your shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round to the prisoner at the bar, and tell my Lord and the Jury whether that is the woman? - A. I have no doubt at all about it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came into the shop did you keep possession of that Bank-note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any particular reasons that caused you to be more positive to speak to the identity of the prisoner, from any thing that had happened to any part of her? - A. Her hand; I saw as she held her pocket-book in it, had one of her fingers cut across, I saw it as she opened the pocketbook.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It was not cut by opening of it? - A. No, it was an old sore.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. She took this other Bank-note out of her pocket-book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon her taking the other Bank-note out of her pocket-book, which was a good one, you looked at it? - A. Yes, I thought it was a good one.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the tendering of the good Bank-note, did you give her the good one back again? - A. Yes, I told her, I would keep the bad one and take it to Bow-street or the Bank, on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire her to come again on Monday morning? - A. I only told her, she should have either the note or the change on Monday morning when I got the answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come on the Monday morning? - A. She did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see her again till you saw her at Bow-street? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At Bow-street when you did see her again, did you observe the cut on her finger which you have described? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after she was at your shop was it that you saw her at Bow-street? - A. I cannot say; it was when I was sent for by Mr. Bliss, about a month or two after she had been at the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You observed at Bow-street that cut in her finger which you have described? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When she was desired to stand up, had you any doubt from that circumstance or from the whole appearance of her that she was the person that came to your shop? - A. No doubt, not any doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. No doubt then? - A. I had no doubt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. After you saw the cut on the finger, was it from that cut that you were positive it was the prisoner? - A. I knew her face, I had observed her features.</p>
               <p>Q. The whole of her person and features satisfied you that she was the same person, and removed all doubt if ever you had any? - A. I had not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire the last witness, Smith, to put his name on the back of that note? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I think I shewed you the note(the note handed to the witness)? - A. That is the note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It was in the early part of March that the woman was in your shop? - A. It was on the 9th.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said it was about two months after that you saw her at Bow-street? - A. I cannot rightly tell you.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100027"></xptr>Q. Then I can tell you, it was on the 7th of June, that is three months after the time that you say a person came into your shop; she was then in custody; you say you had been always positive about her - did not you express some doubt at Bow-street, which induced the Magistrate to point out the hand to you? - A. I was going to tell Mr. Carpmeal I knew her by her face and by the cut on her finger, and when I came out I had the additional evidence there was a cut on her finger.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Should you have had a doubt if you had not seen the finger? - A. Not any.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she tender or give you a five-pound note? - A. She gave me a five-pound note out of her own pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with this five-pound note? - A. I examined the note and thought it to be a good one, and accordingly I went up stairs to get her change.</p>

               <p>Q. What took place then? - A. She told me to take sixpence for the bottle; I asked her if I should send it home for her, she said, no; she only lived in Old-street; a friend of mine who was sitting in the bar, saw her very much agitated.</p>
               <p>Q. Something or or other induced you to look at the note? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean all of them? - A. No, the four and eight being particularly large.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. You were speaking of another circumstance, of the Britannia being pale, and the four and eight being large; these are the two circumstances that you noticed, by which you know this is the same note? - A. I know it is the same note.</p>

               <p>Court. In the abstract it is December, without any thing of the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. This is Bagget's after Baddeley's - look at that, Mr. Bliss, what do you say to that? - A. That is a forgery also.</p>
               <p>Q. That appears to be a forgery of the same manufacture? - A. Exactly from the same plate.</p>
               <p>Q. And the same filling up? - A. No, it is differently filled up, but with names that do not exist in the Bank as cashiers.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is there any such an entering clerk? - A. We have no persons that sign notes with these names.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Now look at Mrs. Levermore's? - A. This is a forged note, and from the same plate, but of different names; we have no such name as Keene, as cashier in the Bank; it is from the same plate, and the entering name J. Burt, I know no such name.</p>
               <p>Q. I am now giving you Mrs. Cook's, what do you say to that? - A. This is a forged note of the same texture, and a fac simile of the others, and from the same plate; it is like the other notes I saw before; we have no such entering clerks nor cashiers in the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I shew the last to you, Mr. Willats's, what do you say to that - Is that one from the same plate, and of the same manufacture? - A. The whole of this is forged, and the cashier's name here is Hill, the same as one of the other's, and no such name as we have in the Bank; the whole of them are a forgery.</p>

               <p>Q. It is from no Bank plate? - A. It is not, nor paper, nor ink, nor any part of the materials used for making or printing Bank-notes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you search the prisoner's lodgings in company with Mr. Bliss? - A. Yes, I searched, in company with Mr. Bliss, the prisoner's lodgings, No. 9, Tower-street, Westminster-road; I found this gown there.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the prisoner seen that gown since you found it? - A. She has, she acknowledged it to be her's; this bottle of lotion was in the cupboard; Mr. Bliss took it, and gave it to me; I produce them.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Cook.) Is that the gown, and is that the bottle? - A. It is one like it, and such a gown as that the woman wore.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What you mean to say is, that the gown resembled that, it was such a sort of a gown? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. (To the prisoner.) You have heard the evidence that has been given against you; your Counsel can examine your witnesses if you have any; he cannot make any speech for you, therefore if you wish to say any thing you must say it yourself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am a very remarkable person, it is very odd they cannot give a description of me; I have a particular cut on my hand, as well as on my finger; in the next place I have but one eye; that has not been observed by any of the witnesses, and as for the Gowland's lotion, a gentleman made me a present of it, and the shawl; I am an unfortunate girl.</p>

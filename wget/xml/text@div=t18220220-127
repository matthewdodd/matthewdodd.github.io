On the 23d of January, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop, with another woman, they were talking together, and while I was serving the other with a quarter of a pound of butter, the prisoner crossed over to the other side of the shop, to look at the pork, and moved a piece from one part of the window, nearer to the door. I then watched her, and kept serving other customers; the other woman talked about buying a piece of pork, and said she thought that piece too large; and while I was serving a customer, I saw the prisoner take a piece of pork, and go out with it. My boy followed, and brought her back into the shop, and said,</p>

I watched her, saw her take it away, and go out of the shop.

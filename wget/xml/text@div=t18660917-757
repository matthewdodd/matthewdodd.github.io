I am a widow—previous to the 30th July I was liv<lb></lb>ing at 5, Eagle Street, Holborn—I have known the prisoner for seven years, I think—he married my youngest daughter near on seven years ago, I think—there was the little boy, who is dead, by the marriage—there was one before, which I thought was by him, but I do not know whether it was by him or any one else—he would be eight years old—the boy that is dead would be six years old on the 22nd of November—his name was Arthur Richard Jeffery—I saw his body when I went before the coroner—he was born after the marriage—after the marriage my daughter and Jeffery lived together for two or three years, but not a very comfortable life; they were very unhappy—at the end of the two or three years he sold off all the things, and then she came to live with me, because she had no home to go to—they have not lived together since—I had the care of the boy Arthur—he had been backwards and forwards to me ever since he was born—his father brought him to me about five months before his death, and said he would pay me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, but he never did—he has not paid a farthing—for the last five months he had lived entirely with me—while he was with me his father came and took him away once or twice for a day—he did not come to see the child only when he took him away—they were the only occasions when he saw him—on Sunday 29th July the prisoner came to my house, 5, Eagle Street, Red Lion Square, at half-past eight in the evening—the</p>

               <p>might bring a cake or a bit of sweetstuff—I have seen cakes now and then, and sweetstuff that he has bought for the child—there was unkind<lb></lb>ness on his part to the child, once when he came home—there were bites on his bottom and about his legs, bitten with teeth—I told a person of the name of Mason of it—I could not help the boy going out with the prisoner, because he was the father—I might have seen Mr. Fraser, but not noticed him—(<hi rend="italic">he was called in</hi>)—I do not remember him, he might know me, but I do not know him—he never read the Bible to me, or called at my house—I do not remember the man at all—he never read the Bible to me, that I remember—I never said in his presence that I would hunt the prisoner to death—I strongly deny it—the prisoner did not bring the child any clothes on the Sunday night, or any other night—I do not think I said before the magistrate that I asked a policeman to take the boy away—I said that I did not think he was fit to have the child, and that he was drunk—he was intoxicated—I have not noticed anything queer about his manners, except when he was intoxicated, and a little after, when he was like a madman—he always seemed rational enough, except when he was intoxicated—he was often intoxicated—I can't say that I have ever seen him take a poker up, and say people were following him—he once took a knife out and sharpened it, and took the boy up and said he would cut him up, and then he would serve me the same—that was when I lived with him—he would quarrel with me for nothing—I never heard him speak of things following him, and shutting the door and say they were coming.</p>

               <p>about religion, and the little boy was put to bed—he asked the little boy if he had said his prayers, and the boy said, "Yes," and repeated the prayer, "Gentle Jesus, meek and mild," and the father asked the boy what he said them for; the boy said he wanted to go to bed; he asked him if that was all he said them for, and the boy said, "Yes," and I advised him to let the boy alone, not to bother him, and let him go to sleep, and the boy went to sleep—the boy was in bed at that time, he went to bed first—the prisoner went to bed some time afterwards, about half-past eleven o'clock—he slept with me, the boy slept between us—my wife was not well, and we pulled the mattress off, and he slept with me on the floor—the prisoner got up about one o'clock—he had a sound sleep previous to that—he had been drinking—I could see he was in drink when he came to our place—when he got up he made an observation that he could not sleep for the bugs—he told the little boy to get up and dress himself—I remonstrated with him, but he would have his own way—I said, "Richard, for God's sake, don't take the little child out at this time of night, stop till the morning at any rate"—he said, no, he should do as he liked—my wife also talked to him, and said, "Don't take the boy out at this time of night"—he swore at her and told her to mind her own b—business—he said, "You must be a bad woman yourself to think that I should do anything bad"—she had made an observation that she hoped he was not going to do anything wrong to the boy by taking him out at that time of night, and then he made that observation—he said he was going a long way in the country, the boy would never see his aunt again—he went to the cupboard, and asked the little boy if he was hungry, and the boy said, "No"—he put two potatoes in his pocket, and said the little boy might want them on the way—when he got up there was very little candle left, and he went out and bought a candle, and cut it in half, and put the half in his pocket—he got the candle at a chandler's shop, next door—I do not know whether he got the candle at that shop, but they keep open till one o'clock—he came back and cut the candle in two, and put one piece in his pocket and lit the other—he also brought a box of matches and put a few in his pocket, and threw the rest down on the floor, and seemed in a sort of passion—he then went and opened the door, and put his hand out and said, "March!" to the little boy, and went straight to the street door—I never saw the boy after—I did not see him when he was dead, my wife did—the boy said, "Good bye," and shed a few tears—it was between one and two o'clock that he left with the boy—it was after one.</p>

                  </hi> (Police Sergeant F 13). On Monday, July 30, about a quarter-past seven in the morning, I was called to a cellar in Neale's Passage—I went in at a door in Neale's Passage that is always open day and night, it is never properly closed, it is in the public thoroughfare—when you get down the stairs from the street you are in an outer cellar—I passed through the doorway into the cellar where the cistern is, and there found the body of a child hanging to the post of the cistern—at that time it had not been interfered with at all—the rope was once round the neck, and it was tied about three times round the post—I produce the rope—there was a <hi rend="italic">nick</hi> cut in the post, not recently, and this rope was tied round that—the boy's head was hanging from this part—it was not quite tight—I could get my two fingers in between the neck and the rope—the loop in the rope was larger than his neck—the face was towards the post—the knot was just at the back of the neck, rather inclined to one side; there was a dent in the neck of rather a livid hue, rather a reddish cast—it was at the back of the neck that I could put my two fingers—it was tight in front—the feet were about fifteen inches from the ground—the hands were tied behind with this handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>), not close together—I could not say positively whether the palms were outwards—the handker<lb></lb>chief was tied round both wrists—the two knots were preserved by Dr. Harvey—they are very firm—one is a weaver's knot—he was com<lb></lb>pelled to cut one—each hand was tied separately—these are the knots—from the way in which they were tied, they got tighter the more you drew them, they would not slip—the doctor took off the handkerchief—the boy was dressed in an old plaid jacket, an old black waistcoat, and old trousers, I think brown or grey, very old, a pair of old shoes, one of which had a piece of cloth stitched on it with white thread, and there was an old cap on the floor—there was a basket in the cellar, about four or five feet distant from the body, but there were no marks on it whatever—I noticed to see whether there were any marks of feet or anything on it, but there were none—it was a kind of market basket, that would hold a bushel of potatoes—I took hold of the body, and, not having a knife myself, I asked a by-stander to cut it for me—the place was very full of people at the time—he cut the rope round the boy's neck—he cut it close to the knot, and then the whole of the knot appeared to slip through, it came undone—I then sent for Dr. Harvey, and then removed the body to the dead-house, under his instructions—I afterwards examined the cellars—there was a small area grating, which admitted light to the front cellar, about three feet in length and about six inches in width, and each iron bar was about a quarter of an inch from the other—there were about fourteen or fifteen steps to descend into the cellar—as I was standing in the cellar without my hat the level of the street would be about a foot higher than my head—the grating was the only means of lighting the front cellar—that grating was in the thorough-fare—both cellars run the same way—no light is derived from this grating in the back cellar, the only light there is from the street door—when the door was shut there would be no light—in going down it looks very dark—it is a dead wall in front of you at the bottom of the stairs, quite dark—I examined the child's waistcoat, and saw two small spots of tallow on it; but two lighted candles were in the cellar at the time the doctor was examining the body, and I concluded that those two spots might have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186609170012"></xptr>
               <p>dropped from them—after the discovery of the body Inspector West had charge of the case, and he took steps to find the prisoner—I saw him at Bow Street Police Court after he was in custody—I had not seen him at all between these times—I have been on duty in this neighbourhood—I did not know the prisoner before this occurrence—I speak of the door leading to the outer cellar being always open, from my knowledge of the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood—none of those houses are ever shut—you can walk in at any time or at any hour of the night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I think you have not said before to<lb></lb>day that the rope was twisted round the post? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did say so at Bow Street to the best of my belief—I don't believe I said it was tied round two or three times, but it was—the doctor slipped one hand through one knot, but the other was so tight he was compelled to cut it—if the child had been hanged while alive I should imagine he would have struggled violently—I think, from the appearance of the child, somebody must have had their hand over his mouth; that is the best of my belief—I could not say whether he was partially or entirely dead at the time he was hung up—the palms of the hands were open, they were not clenched.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Southampton Street, Strand—on this Monday morning I was sent for to this cellar—I got there about half-past seven—I went into the cellar where the cistern was—the boy was then cut down, and lying on his back—his wrists were tied behind him—he was dressed—he was quite dead—his limbs were rigid, but he was slightly warm—I did not undo the hands then—I found that he was dead, and I sent him to the dead-house, and there made a more careful examina<lb></lb>tion—the hands were tied behind him with this handkerchief—I slipped one hand through this opening, which has not been disturbed—the other was tied more tightly, and I cut it—I believe these are the original knots—I found the mark of the cord about three parts round the neck, the anterior two-thirds coming a little behind one ear, the back part of the neck being free from the mark—it was a mark that might have been made by a rope—the jaws were clenched closely—the stomach and chest were slightly warm—I should imagine the child had been dead about four hours—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found all the organs healthy, other than there was congestion of the lungs and congestion of the brain—the heart was also full of blood—suffocation was the cause of death—the congestion would arise from that—I saw no marks on the mouth—probably the suffocation was produced by compression of the wind-pipe—the stomach contained food—I had an idea that the suffocation must</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186609170013"></xptr>
               <p>have been partial before he was hanged up—why I came to that idea was the calm expression of the countenance and the pallor—life could not have been extinct, or we should not have had the mark of the cord ecchymosed—I mean the red mark, it was a deep red—the jaws were clenched, the eyes were not protruding—in hanging that is generally the case, and the tongue is generally hanging from the mouth—there was a little dilitation of the pupil—I imagine the boy was about six years of age.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Except the signs of having been suffocated, there was none of the ordinary inditia of death by hanging? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only the mark round the neck—I judged that the child must have been alive at the time he was hung up, from the deep colour round the neck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you agree with this:—"We learn from these experiments, as well as from those performed by others, that the mark which is usually seen upon the neck in hanging during life, not ecchymosed, may be also produced by a ligature applied to the neck of a subject within two hours, or even a much longer period after death; consequently the presence of this mark on the neck is no criterion of hanging during life or after death"? (<hi rend="italic">Taylor's Medical Jurisprudence</hi>, p. 660). <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it says "not ecchy<lb></lb>mosed;" you have a scorched mark, I think Orfila mentions, but I believe the red mark I speak of here is absent; this was decidedly ecchymosed—by ecchymose, I mean the effusion of blood underneath the skin, it is simply a pouring out of the blood; that shows that the blood must have been in circulation—it is a condensation of the cellular tissue—you may get that after death, as it sets up within two hours after death—the ecchymose is not a change in the skin or in the cellular tissue, it is an effusion of blood underneath the skin—that was seen simply by the mark of the rope—that discolouration was the effusion of blood, there is no other mode of obtaining discolouration. Taylor says, "The changes in the skin beneath the mark are also destitute of any distinctive character. There is the same condensation of the cellular membrane, whether the hanging has occurred in the living subject or dead. These changes are simply the result of physical causes, mechanical compression." The parchment-like appearance that you see after death is simply produced by condensation of the tissues by pressure, there is no ecchymosis—I consider the child must have been half suffocated before he was hanged up—I should imagine you would get no ecchymosis if it was hung after death—I should think not within a minute after—if you have no circulation you get no bleeding, not through minute vessels—the circulation in the minute vessels ceases instanta<lb></lb>neously—I state it decidedly as my opinion that if you hang a body up two minutes after death the appearances would be different to what they would if it had a little life in it—I form my opinion from the outward appearances.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Ingram—we have been residing at 6, Pleydell Street, Fleet Street—I have known the prisoner for twelve months—he worked with my husband at Gravesend—previous to 26th July he lodged three weeks at our house—he left on Wednesday morning, 26th July—while he was with us I washed two shirts for him, a pocket hand-kerchief, and a pair of socks—the handkerchief was a cotton one, and the pattern was red, black, and white, mixed, and it had got like stars on it, and I noticed that it was hemmed with black silk—I noticed that when I was ironing it out on the Saturday night—he had got a drop to drink, and he dropped it in a pan of water that I washed my little boy in, and his hat too—I washed the handkerchief for him, and as I was pulling the edge out</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186609170014"></xptr>
               <p>in ironing it next morning I noticed that it was hemmed with black silk—that was on the Sunday before the Wednesday that he left—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) looks like the handkerchief—I have looked at the hemming, it is similar to it, it is done with black silk—in pattern, colours, and general appearance it resembles the handkerchief I washed out on the Sunday—I did not know where the prisoner was going when he left—the night before he left there was a dreadful riot in Hyde Park, and he came home that night from his work, and went to bed—that was on the Tuesday as he left our place on the Wednesday—he went to bed with another young man, and about an hour afterwards he got up and went out, and at two o'clock in the morning he came back with two policemen, and my husband said he could not have that—he went away about ten in the morning—I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were rather glad to get rid of him, I believe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, he used to do such funny things, I don't say when he was tipsy, but at other times as well—he had such funny ways—my husband used to say to him, "Don't talk such stuff; you are mad, you are"—he used to tell us such funny things—he would begin to sing psalms, and get up from his meals and walk about the room, and get a Bible and read in it—during the time he was in our place I never heard him make use of a bad word—he told me a long history about his wife and his mother—he appeared in grief about it—he was always saying he should like to see her, to see what she was doing, but that she did not behave well to him, she went away with another man—he appeared to suffer grief and sorrow from it—I never saw him cry—he used to sit and think for a long time—I never heard him say any-thing about his going to hell or being damned—I never heard him make use of any bad words—he has said he was unhappy about his wife—he has not said anything about what would happen to him in the other world.</p>

What do you think in foolishness I did? I went and stopped a funeral from being buried"—he would get up from meals and walk about the room, and not sit still like other people—he said he had got a boy, and he was fond of it, but he did not believe it was his own, for his wife had got a child before he was married, and it was in the Foundling—when my hus<lb></lb>band told him not to talk such stuff, he was talking about what he had done—he was quite sober then—he was only tipsy twice during the time I knew him.</p>

               <p>—I told him to be quiet, and the next public-house we got to I would give him a glass of beer, if he would come quietly on with me, so when we got to the place he sat himself down on the road, and he dressed himself there, and I could not get him on for a bit—that was at Colonel Edwards's gate, at Poyners's Walk—when we went up to the "Wellington" inn Alan Midwood, the landlord, was standing at the door—I told him to fetch this man a glass of beer out, and the prisoner said he had a halfpenny in his pocket, and he would want a gill and a half—at the same time the landlord came to the door with a glass of best ale in his hand, and that was three-halfpence—I told him not to take the halfpenny from the prisoner, I would pay it—the landlord asked me what I was taking the prisoner for—I said I did not know exactly, and the prisoner said, "I am charged with being the supposed murderer of my own child at St. Giles's, in London"—Midwood said to him, "How did you do it?" the prisoner said, "I hung him," or, "I hanged him"—Midwood said, "Then, d—you, you ought to be hung yourself, if you did such a thing"—at that time there was a crowd, and I took the prisoner away—a man of the name of Tasker was there at the time, and was present when the conversation took place—I took the prisoner on to Halifax—he was locked up there—I was sitting up with him on Tuesday morning, and he commenced talking about the murder—it was between six and seven o'clock in the morning—he said they called his child Richard Arthur Jeffery, but he said, "I have a great doubt whether it was mine or not"—he said it was a good job the child was put out of the way, as it would never have to be put in his face about his mother having gone away with another man—I reported the matter to our superintendent, and a photographic likeness of the prisoner was sent on to London—when he came to me he was under the influence of drink—I think he must have been drinking for a day or two before, from his appearance—he walked with me to Halifax, a distance of four miles—he was not what I call drunk, but like a man getting out of a drunken spree.</p>

I heard of this affair at the end of July—I endeavoured to find the prisoner—I heard of the body being found on July 30th, the same day—I was not able to find the prisoner at all, on to trace him in any way—on Monday, September 10th, from information I received, I went to Halifax, in Yorkshire, and took with me the witness William Ingram—I knew the prisoner very well by sight, and had seen him in the neighbourhood of St. Giles's for several years—I have seen him with officers connected with our division—when I got to Halifax I found the prisoner at the police-station—I was introduced to him by Superin<lb></lb>tendant Copeland, who said, "Here is an officer from London come to see you, Jeffery"—as soon as the prisoner saw me he said, "How do you do, sir? I have been expecting you down; I thought you would have been here before this"—after he was identified by Ingram I told him I charged him with wilfully murdering his son by hanging him in a cellar in Great Earl Street, Seven Dials—in answer to that he said, "But I have surrendered myself; I knew I must be taken some time or other, but I don't mean to say that I am the murderer of my own child," or, "my child," I am not sure which—he said, "It was from seeing the accounts in the newspapers that I gave myself up, charging me with having murdered my child; that was why I gave myself up, but the laws of the country must prove me guilty"—on turning round to leave the cell, the prisoner said to Ingram, "Ah! Bill, old boy, I thought it was you that gave my description that was in the papers, but shake hands, I bear you no malice"—that was all that took place—I brought him up to London in custody—as far as I saw of his manner, he was perfectly rational, and also, from what I knew of him in St. Giles's, he was a very quiet inoffensive man, I never knew anything in the least otherwise—I always took him to be so, and quite rational.</p>

               <p>the following:—at first he stated to me that he was a Jew by birth, a Jew by religion also, being extracted from Jewish parents—that was after I had been preaching—after our conversation on the subject of religion, he frequently used to visit me at my shop, and it has been frequently the case that when conversing with me for a considerable time rationally he would become incoherent and exceedingly abstruse—I mean by abstruse an in<lb></lb>coherency both of manner and expression; for instance, he would get quite off the subject on which he had been speaking to something quite irrelevant to it, as, for instance, he would say, instantly rising from the seat on which he was at the time, "Barwell, I am a lost man, I shall be sure to go to hell"—he was once living only three doors from myself—he had to pass and repass my shop to and from his business, and as he was passing perhaps he would stop short suddenly and say, "Barwell, I wish your house was a thousand miles away from me"—I said, "Why so, Jeffery?"—he said, "Because I always feel so miserable when I pass it"—in talking on religious subjects he would suddenly break into something quite different; if you wish for an instance, I will give you the following:—"Barwell, I think you are a d—rum fellow"—that was in the middle of a serious conversation—I have notes here by which I have refreshed my memory since—I did not make them at the time—at these times there used to be a very peculiar glistening of the eye, and an agitation both of mind and body—he would stamp about the shop or street and seem thoroughly agitated, and it would be some time before I could get him to be calm and sit down again, and then he would burst into a violent fit of tears and cry like a child—my wife has frequently made remarks to him—she invariably calls me "my dear" when she addresses me, and the prisoner has frequently said, with tears in his eyes, "Oh! Barwell, how miserable I am! I wish to God I was dead"—he frequently spoke to me in reference to his wife—the mention of it appeared to distress him very much—I recollect his little boy very well indeed—he frequently brought him to our house—he always seemed remarkably fond of the child—I have allowed my children to go out with it and play in the streets—he never offered to lend me money—he offered me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as premium if I would take the child as an apprentice to learn my trade—it was a child six years old—I always had an idea, from what he stated to me, that he had money in prospect for the child—he has told me that he had money in the funds belonging to the child, and when it came of age it would come into possession of it, that he was very unhappy with his wife, and she wanted to have command of the money, and he being determined they should not, it made things very unpleasant, but he was determined to see the child righted—I have often heard that the prisoner was designated as "Mad Dick"—I never heard anybody personally call him so, but I heard it said that he was usually designated so by several of his shopmates.</p>

               <p>for liquor over and over again—I never had any proof of it—I don't know that I have ever heard that he had been drinking—he used to have his work at home generally—I believe he earned his living as a tailor—I do not think the boy was living with him at all—the conversation when he spoke about being a Jew was on the first Sunday, when he introduced himself to my notice as we were walking from the Dials up Great St. Andrew Street—I could not tell whether he had been drinking then—I used to see him almost daily for a considerable period—when he said I was a d—rum fellow I had not been talking to him about being drunk—I can-not tell how he came to say it, he volunteered it—I have not seen men who are in the habit of drinking very often, perhaps once or twice during my life—at the time he said he wished he was dead and was very miserable he had been talking about his wife—I did not know from him that she was living with some other person—he wished me to take the boy as an apprentice then and there.</p>

They are following me!"—I remember his once telling me that he was the owner of a place called Cromwell Hall, an estate in Essex—he told me how many acres of ground there were connected with the estate, that he was lord of Cromwell Hall, and that I should have a suit of black to reward me for the trouble I had taken with him, which caused a deal of jealousy among the young men I was acquainted with, that they had not taken a deeper interest in him—I always believed him to be insane, so much so that, although he was very fond of my little girl, and caressed her, and took her up, and gave her pence, I told my wife not to leave her in his possession—I would not trust him, though I thought he was right in his feelings he was wrong in his mind—he said his mother-in-law told him after he had been married a few weeks that his wife had a child in the Foundling.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Barking-side—on 7th November my bar<lb></lb>maid hung a black stuff dress of mine upon the line—it was missed just about dusk—I never saw anything of it again until I saw it on the prisoner when she came into my house on 28th December—I identified it on her when she came in—I gave her into custody—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know it by the watch-pocket on the left breast, that I made myself—I have not the slightest doubt about it.</p>

On Saturday, 28th December, I was called to the Beehive public-house at Barking, and the prisoner was given into my custody by Mrs. Treadwell for stealing this black dress on 7th November—after we left the house the prisoner stated that she bought the dress at a pawnbroker's, named Hockley, three months ago, at Barking—she also stated that it had been given to her by a person she lived with, Mrs. Lake.</p>

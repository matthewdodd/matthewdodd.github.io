             placed ourselves in such a situation where we could distinctly see the window through which the goods were taken; it is a moving sash; I kept my hand upon the bolt of the door which opens within half a yard of the window, while Mr. Rigden attentively watched the transaction; and, upon his making a signal that was agreed upon, I instantly opened the door, and the prisoner at the bar was taken upon the spot; I did not see him take the cloth, nor did not see it when the prisoner was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the window broke? - A. No, it was done by shoving up the window.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of this cloth? - A. Full twelve guineas; I saw the cloth immediately before; it has never been found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You had stationed yourself at the door for the purpose of detecting any person? - A. Yes, we were there expecting such a transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Your main attention, therefore, was towords something outside of your house? - A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this property of your's was taken from an outer window? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you had not applied your attenteion to see whether it might not be half an inch or a quarter of an inch wanting to be closed? - A. No, it was a sash without weights, and therefore it was quite down.</p>

               <p>Q. You had lighted candles, I believe? - A. We had.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lighted candles a quarter of an hour before that? - A. I doubt whether it was so much, for we did not expect them quite so soon; our place is very noisy, and when it is so dark, we cannot see to do our business; we are obliged to light candles, it was not dark out of doors.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was there light enough to see the features of a man out of doors? - A. Yes, perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any of your family at home at that time? - A. Yes; myself, my wife, my children, and my shopman.</p>

             sworn. - I am a tailor, in Holborn; I was requested by Mr. Muston to assist him in watching; we placed ourselves in a passage leading into a court; there was a window looked into that court; Mr. Muston stood behind the door, and I stood where I could see the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it day-light outside? - A. It was about six o'clock; I saw a man come to the window as though he belonged to the place.</p>
               <p>Q. What man do you mean? - A. The prisoner at the bar; he came up to the window, and, I think, said, here, Tom, take this cloth; nearly as loud as I speak now; he then lifted up the sash.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the window quite close? - A. Yes, I looked at it before I stood in the passage; the prisoner at the bar pushed up the window very deliberately, as thought he had belonged to the house; I said to Mr. Muston, here are the men, do not be in a hurry, I will give you the word; there were three pieces of cloth, and he took out the middle, which was a superfine; he gave it to the other man he had called to, and said, go along; I instantly jumped by Mr. Muston, and laid hold of the prisoner; when I first ran up to him, the other man had got the cloth, and be tried to cover him; I laid hold of him; he tried to get away from me, and I tore his coat; I am postive he is the man; I saw his face when he took the cloth; he was some minutes at the window before he opened it; I delivered the prisoner to Mr. Muston's shopman; a constable was sent for, and he was taken to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You had been upon the watch with the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.These things were placed there for the purpose of giving persons an opportunity of taking them? - A. They were generally there; it is a counter that runs along.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a private passage? - A. When the shop is shut it is.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a public court? - A. Yes, the court is a public way.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that went away you did not see his face at all? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it dark? - A. It was light enough to see the features of the prisoner; I was standing within my own door, I saw the prisoner go to Mr. Muston's window, and lift it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, and say if you are certain? - A. I am very certain he is the same person; I turned round to call to my father, who was up stairs, and at that time I heard the cloth was missing, but I did not see it taken; I immediately turned round from calling my father, which was not a mintue, and saw Mr. Rigden take him; he was taken into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Were there any lights in Mr. Muston's shop? - A. I believe there were.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had they been lit? - A. They might have been lit a quarter of an hour, I cannot say.</p>

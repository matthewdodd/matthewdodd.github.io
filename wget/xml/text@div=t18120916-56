I missed my silk handkerchief by Miles's caravans. There were a great many people about the caravans. I had seen my handkerchief about five minutes before I missed it. I put it safe in my pocket again.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner took it or not - A. I did not see who took it. It was taken privately from my person, without giving me any alarm. A witness here saw him take it. His name is Greenwood. He told me. I felt, and found it was true. The prisoner then made off. Greenwood overtook him, and I saw the prisoner give the handkerchief up. I knew it to be mine.</p>
               <p>- GREENWOOD. I am a servant. I was in Smithfield with Campbell. I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of his pocket. I told Campbell, and the prisoner ran off. I pursued him, and told him, he had got Campbell's handkerchief. He went down upon his knees, and delivered the handkerchief up. This is the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am as innocent of it as you are. I will be upon my oath that man never see me take it out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

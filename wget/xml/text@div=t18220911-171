The prisoner was employed there in the Company's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110084"></xptr>service. On the 26th of July I saw him at work, lifting cases of opium out of the scale; he went off the quay, returned, and about four o'clock I saw him stoop down behind a heap of oakum, take his hat off, and put something into it, and pressed it down on his head. I called to him to stop two or three times, but he walked faster towards the warehouse door; I ran after him, and just as he got into the warehouse, I said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got here?" he said he had nothing; he pulled his hat off, and threw the opium out between the casks; I picked it up, followed, and secured him; the opium was in the Company's care on the quay.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do you mean to say it came out of his hat - A. Yes; I swear it did; I picked up the same stuff as came out of his hat; I was close to him at the time.</p>

            . I examined his hat, and produced the seeds taken out of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was not employed in cleaning the opium; I only helped the man to lift the cases out of the scale. As I came out of the warehouse I took a piece of oakum to go to the privy, put it in my hat, and that is the reason the seeds may be there. The watchman never touched me, nor did I hear him call me.</p>
               <p>- HICKS. I am a locker at the Custom-house. I stood in front of the warehouse and saw the prisoner walk in - his hat was on; the watchman went in, the prisoner was wiping his face with his handkerchief; his hat was then off; I saw nothing go out of his hat; if it had, I think I should have seen it; the watchman was nearer to him than me.</p>
               <p>MR. NORTON. Q. Have you been employed any time on the quay - A. Some years. The first I saw of it was his coming into the warehouse; I did not see him take his hat off; I only saw it off; I was called away to another warehouse; I did not hear the watchman charging him with any thing; he was looking among the casks.</p>

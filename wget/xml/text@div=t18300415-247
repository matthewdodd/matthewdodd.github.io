On the 13th of February I went to West-ham, when the two prisoners went with the carts - the horses had nose-bags on their heads at Old Ford; that was the last I saw of them; they were then taken off, and tied on the shafts - the corn was very nearly all consumed then; there were three nosebags then - I afterwards missed two bags, and when I got to Dalston-lane I missed Bishop; I stopped the team, and rode back, but could see nothing of him - I went home, and heard that the prisoners were at the watch-house; these are the bags.</p>

            . I am a solicitor and vestry clerk, of Hackney. On the 13th of February I was returning home, down Dalston-lane - I had passed Ambrose's house about thirty yards, when I saw Bishop adjusting his nose-bag full of turnips at the back of his cart- my suspicions were excited, and I walked to within ten yards of Ambrose's house, where there is a sharp angle; I saw Wood carrying into Ambrose's house another nose-bag of turnips; I walked in through the house, into the bake-house, and saw both the prisoners there - Bishop had shot his bag of turnips, and Wood shot his; I said they must put them into the bags again, and go to the watch-house, which they did, after some hesitation - I saw a large quantity of turnips under a dresser there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did they say any thing to you? A. They said they had gleaned them off the land, but did not say where.</p>
               <p>MR. LAYCOCK. I believe them to be mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are they not really quite a different kind of turnip to yours? A. They really are not; there might be two days difference in the sowing of them - I had a very high opinion of these men, till I had reason to believe to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Bishop's Defence. There were some scattered about the ground, which were not my master's; the ground was ploughed where they had been sown, and I took them up.</p>

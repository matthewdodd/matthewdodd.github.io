                  </hi>. It was the prisoner's duty to receive monies and account for them to me or my father in a book—all moneys he paid to me I always initialled in the book as a receipt—I had most unbounded confidence in the prisoner—I kept a cash-book of my own in which I entered the sums he paid me—in the magisterial cash-book under the date of May 7th, 1374, I find this entry "H. W. J., cash 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and that purports to be receipted, H. W. J. has been put to it, or rather I should say H. M. J., the middle letter is an M, there is one stroke too many, but it purports to be H. W. J.—I always receipted monies paid to me by the prisoner, with those initials as appears by the book—I certainly did not write those letters H. W. J.—I am very well acquainted with the prisoner's handwriting</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187701080074"></xptr>
               <p>—the entry is in his handwriting, and I believe the initials are in his hand-writing, I would not swear it positively; in my own mind I have very little doubt as to it—I did not receive 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the prisoner at that time—I have the means of refreshing my memory on that point, I have a cash-book in which I enter every sum I receive (<hi rend="italic">referring to it</hi>)—I always enter them at the time I receive them, at the very first opportunity, invariably—I am not aware of any occasion in which I did not—I am perfectly satisfied that I did not receive that money—the total at the bottom of the page is 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have not totalled up that column, I was just doing it; I see there is a mistake of a shilling—it ought to be 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that is including the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., taking the book as it is now—the total is written upon an erasure, the balancing line is carried up from the left hand bottom corner, and the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. entry is written over it; the balancing line goes to an item one line above it—the same total is carried forward on to the next page 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I really cannot see by this light whether there has been any alteration since it was put there; it appears to be all right—the prisoner has had credit with me for that 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the balance was struck after that on December 4th, not at the end of that year, at the end of the next year—there was no occasion to, balance this book at all, the balance was on December 18th, 1875; it goes on to then, and then a balance is struck—I tested the correctness of the entries in this book by comparing them with my cash-book—when I compared them this 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was not there—I com<lb></lb>pared that page of this book with my cash-book—when I made that compari<lb></lb>son the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was in his book, I have never seen the book in any other state than it is now—to my recollection I made the comparison when my attention was called to this particular item, within the last three or two months; I did not make it in 1874—before the prisoner left the employ I called his attention to one error in the cash-book; here it is "April 24th, 1876, H. W. J., cash 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I was looking over his book and I was surprised to find that he had debited me with 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I asked him for an explanation and his explanation was "I had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in hand which I intended to give to you, but I did not see you and I forgot to scratch it out of your book"—I said "Run your pen through it at once," and I made him do it, and here it appears so—I never had that 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think that occurred at the latter end of April, 1876, I had unbounded confidence in the prisoner at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He did not say that I owed him the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never owed him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that I swear—this is a charge in May, 1874, he left in July, 1876—I said just now that 1 constantly looked at the book once or twice a week, and so I did; that equally applies to 1874, as it does to 1873—I do not recollect of my own memory that on 7th May, 1874, I did not receive that 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I say that the initials H. W. J., are certainly not in my handwriting; I believe we have no expert here as a witness—this was a charge preferred before the Magistrates at Colchester, about a fortnight before the last session here—I have never shown this writing to Mr. Chabot, Mr. Netherclift, or any expert—(<hi rend="italic">referring to the entry</hi>), I say that the balancing line was put in first, and after that the top part of the balancing line was scratched out and the two subsequent items entered in afterwards; the last two—the top part of it seems to be scratched out, I think with a pen knife; let me look at it—it is not thoroughly scratched out, because you can see the top of the letters—I think a knife has been used; allow me to look; I thought so; I believe it has—I express that as my opinion; if you will allow me to look I will tell you in a minute.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. The balancing line is not in pencil, it is ink I believe, a very light pale ink, blotted off instantly; it is the top part of the line that I think has been erased—I thought so, looking at it cursorily in the wit<lb></lb>ness box here—I have seen it before; I don't think it ever struck me before, I saw it in the witness-box that there had been an attempt to erase; it never did—I should very much like to have the opportunity of looking at it again (<hi rend="italic">it was handed to the witness</hi>); oh, no, I don't think so now—I do not see any trace of an erasure there, or any attempt to erase—I said it struck me as being an erasure on the ground that it was some<lb></lb>what fainter at the top end; I say I formed the opinion on the ground that it is obvious that the balancing line was put in before the last two items, and on the further ground that it looks lighter—I do not mean still to say that there is an erasure; I do not think now that there is an erasure—I did not check the items of payment in this book, because I do not interfere in any way with the magisterial cash-book; it is not part of my duty to check them, all I have to do is to check my own entries—it has been left too much to the prisoner—my father does check them, he looks over the book—I never received any money from the pri<lb></lb>soner without putting my initials; I don't think there is one in the book—my father does the same thing—I always put my initials; I don't know about my father; it is the habit certainly always to put the initials; <hi rend="italic">my</hi> father as well as myself. (<hi rend="italic">The attention of the witness was called to several entries against which no initials appeared.</hi>) The rule does not apply to my father so much as to myself; as a matter of rule it does, but he was not so particular in doing it as I was—in the page where the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is entered there is a second entry of a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Superintendent Daunt; he is the super<lb></lb>intendent of police for the Magistrates' division—I don't think there is any account that would show whether that 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid to him—I believe my father asked Daunt; Daunt is not here—I believe he said he could not tell, because we pay him so many sums—that is one of the items written over the balancing line; it was properly there if it was ever paid; I don't believe it was; I believe it is purely imaginary altogether, because it has been put in subsequently, and the book does not add up with it; that is my reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Your balancing lines seem to be as irregular as the initals—I find a great many of these pages at the bottom have no balancing line at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is not his, I think—allow me the book; he has been in our ser<lb></lb>vice about three years—(<hi rend="italic">referring to the book</hi>) the initials H. W. J. to all these entries are mine; there is not a single one in the book that is not mine—I put my initials in different ways occasionally, but you will see at that time I made them alike—I did form my initials differently at some periods—I began to change, I should think, about two years ago; I could tell if I had the book again—I have altered my initials to a certain extent; I used to write them without taking my pen off, and I now write them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187701080076"></xptr>
               <p>separate, and the reason was because they were sometimes mistaken; I did not break myself of the habit at once—I think it very possible that they may be different at different times—I see they are different in July and October—in the column where the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is, I can easily detect that it is not my signature; in an instant—there is another signature immediately over that; there are very few items in that page—I did not discover this until my attention was called to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, practising at Colchester—I am the pro<lb></lb>secutor in this case—the prisoner was my clerk for about three years and a quarter up to 1st July in the present year, his leaving had no reference whatever to the present charge, or any other charge; a few words, and I gave him a month's notice, and he left on 1st July—I am clerk to the Magis<lb></lb>trates of the Lexton and Winstree division—the prisoner was my clerk in that department of my business—this book was kept by the prisoner, it was his duty to enter all receipts by him of a magisterial kind in that book, and to account for the payment on the other side—I see this entry of May 7th, 1874, it is the prisoner's writing—I say that the initails there are a forgery, they are not my son's; I am well acquainted with my son's initials; I say that, in my opinion, these decidedly differ—I did not receive 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the prisoner at or about that time—my instructions were that my son should always initial payments made to him by the prisoner, those were my instructions to the prisoner and to him, and I believe they were—when he handed money to me, very frequently, as a rule, I used to initial them; sometimes he has said I did not, and I have not questioned it, I have accepted his statement and there was end of it, as far as I was concerned—I had very great confidence in the prisoner while he was with me—these initials are certainly not in my handwriting—I very seldom looked through the book—I see an item of a shilling under the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that would be a payment to Superintendant Daunt of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the service of a summons, perhaps, or something of that sort, in the matter to which it refers, it says here "Re Fisher"—I have totalled up this page—I did not have any conservation with Superintendant Daunt about the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pri<lb></lb>soner's presence; I had a conversation with him, but the prisoner was not present.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187701080077"></xptr>
               <p>genuine one; is seems to me that the down strokes ore so close together that it would look like H in the last stroke of the W and the J, as far as my eyes enable me to judge—the genuine one is, to my mind, exactly like a genuine one, but I think the first stroke of the W is run into the stroke of the H; that is all I can say—in other respects, I think, I know of no other way of signing his initials—I do not keep a cash-book—when the prisoner pays me cash it is entered by him in his book; I have no check against it; I don't say that I have always initialled the sums he has paid me—sometimes when he has paid me money, if I have been before the Magistrates or elsewhere, I have given him a memorandum of "G. W. E." so much money, and it has been accounted for to my son in making up the books—I don't think it would be a matter of very rare occurrence that my signature was not attached to the payments made to me, it certainly would not happen week after week, or entry after entry—I have a client named Jeffreys, he was the assignee of certain policies of insurance of a man named Blomberg—I know a person of the name of Digby—I believe he was an assignee of one of those policies, a small one, on Blomberg's life; he is a solicitor at Maldon—I have heard that Blomberg went to Japan—I don't know that he died there, I have heard so, obviously I can carry it no further—the insurance companies dispute the claim—Messrs.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you advise him to pay that extra risk premium as though Blomberg were alive, when you knew that he was dead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I advised him no more than what was in the letter—I did not advise him to pay it as though Blomberg was living when I knew he was dead—at the time I wrote to Digby I did not know that Blomberg was dead; I had heard so, but I did not know it; I never disputed it—I had a doubt about it—I said "I should not tell them at present that he is dead," because I had already sent a message to him by Mr. Evans the day before; that the information I had received could not be vouched in any way—I say, when I gave that recommendation to Digby, I had been told that Blomberg was dead; had my doubts about it; I thought be might be, but I had my doubts of it—I really cannot say that I formed a belief sufficient to say either one way or the other—there was nothing authentic with regard to it, and probably would not be until the 12th October, when the mail came in—I did not conceal it; I had sent that very message the day before—I certainly recommended Digby not to mention the allegation of the death—I think that was an honest trans<lb></lb>action under the circumstances.</p>

I am engaged as solicitor in actions against insurance companies, on policies of insurance on the life of Blomberg claimed by the assignee—I have no personal interest in those policies and never had; my interest is simply as a professional man on behalf of Mr. Jeffreys as my client—I know, as the solicitor in the case that in the Spring of 1874, my client had reason to believe that the assured had gone out of the limits of Europe—I first of all heard of the existence of the policies at the latter end of April or the beginning of May, somewhere about May, and I then heard that the assured was supposed to have left England and been travelling on the Continent or gone abroad, I did not know where he was—there have been some Chancery proceedings in this matter—one of the Insurance Company's filed a bill in Chancery and made me a party to it, for the purpose of having the policies delivered up—I have been dismissed from that bill. (<hi rend="italic">A Mr. Messent here produed a letter addressed to himself from Jeffreys, dated in April</hi>, 1874; <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M. WILLIAMS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">objected to its reception, and</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">declined to admit it.</hi>) I know that my client has written a letter to the insurance office on 27th April, 1874—I can give an explanation of it: my client told me that the insurance office had agreed to consider the policies in force, and that when the movements of the life assured were ascertained they would take the extra premium, and I hold Mr. Messent's letter in my pocket to that effect; that was a letter six months before I sent this—this is Mr. Messent's letter to my client. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "24th April, 1874. Dear sir—in reply to your letter of 21st April, the directors will be happy to regard this policy as being in full force, subject to your undertaking to pay the extra premium, if any, that may have been incurred, when the movements of the life assured come to be ascertained.") I wrote to Mr. Messent undertaking to pay the premium when the movements were ascertained and my client told me that everyone of the offices had agreed—I gave my advice because of the information contained in the letter to which that is an answer, and the statement of my client.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M. WILLIAMS</hi>. This related to the letter I wrote to Mr. Digby; it did not relate to the insurance that Mr. Digby was concerned in, but I have the letter in my pocket from the insurance office that Mr. Digby was concerned in—this touches my <hi rend="italic">bond-fides</hi>, I believed my client, and gave the best advice I could under the circumstance—in the Spring of 1874 all the offices in which policies were held had communicated to them the fact that my client believed that Blomberg had gone out of England; that information was conveyed to the Liverpool and Globe Office by a person named Cooper—I was told so at that time; he is here—Digby's policy was in the Sovereign; they also agreed that they had notice in April of the life having gone, or was supposed to have gone out of the limits of the policy, out of England, and they also wrote a letter which I have got—I have two letters, this is one of 1st May, 1874, signed by the secretary of the company, addressed to my client: "Re Blomberg's policy. The board have recon<lb></lb>sidered your application and, under the circumstances, are willing to accede to your request that in the event of the assured having gone beyond the limits of Europe without license, you shall be permitted to pay such extra premium as the nature of the risk may require, yours faithfully, Charles J.</p>

               <p>Rowe"—I first knew that Blomberg had gone to Japan in September, I don't know what day in September; I heard it from Mr. Murray, a solicitor in Whitehall Place; I have understood he is solicitor to Blomberg's family, and I believe so—he said that he had had a telegram, or that a telegram had been received; I don't know that he said he had it,; he had knowledge of a telegram and he read to me what the contents of it were, it was in a very few words, but he said "You must not rely on it as authentic or authoritative, but we shall probably know something more about it by the mail which is expected on 12th October, and on 12th October I called on him again and no further information had come—the first time I heard where Blomberg had gone to was when I heard this report of his death—. we know now that he died on 25th July, and that the information conveyed in the telegram was correct—I don't know who the telegram purported to come from; I asked Mr. Murray to give me some further particulars as to who it came from, in order that I might communicate with them, and he said it came to some firm in London; it was not Messrs. Gellatley, Hankey, &amp; Co.; if he had mentioned them I should have gone to them; he did not mention the name to me I am sure, or I should have gone to the parties.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WOOD</hi>. After these letters had been received in April and May, I did not consider, with regard to keeping the insurance alive, that there was anything more to do than give them information as to where he had gone—that was the state of affairs when I wrote this letter on 25th September, 1874, to Mr. Digby; this is the letter: "Dear sir, Re Blomberg, I suppose Mr. Evans delivered my message to you yesterday"—that message was what Mr. Murray had said, that it could not be considered as authentic—"What I recommend you to do is to write and say that Blomberg has gone to Japan, and that you are ready and willing to pay the extra risk premium; I should not tell them at present that he is dead"—when I wrote that I did not refer to any other source of information except what I have told the Court, through Mr. Murray, with the proviso that he had put upon it—"We yesterday telegraphed to the Foreign Office for five certificates of death, including one for you, that you might write to Jeffreys on Saturday, as he wants to see you particularly; I will then arrange the matter."—Those were the circumstances under which I wrote that letter—the insurance companies have objected to pay this claim on the ground that Blomberg was dead at the time the extra risk premium was paid—my client and myself filed an answer in Chancery on 10th June, 1875.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M. WILLIAMS</hi>. I did not say that it was in September I first received information from Mr. Murray that Blomberg had gone abroad; the question you asked me was when I first heard that he had gone to Japan; that was in September—it was at the end of April or the beginning of May that I first heard he had gone abroad; where, I did not know—it was in September that I had the first information that he had gone to Japan—I believe 1 did not hear from Mr. Murray in May that Blomberg had gone to China—Mr. Murray has sworn that he wrote a letter in May to say that Blomberg sailed in January, for China, but that where he was located he did not know—I have looked for that letter and cannot find it, I cannot find the least trace of it, there has never been any evidence of its having been posted to me, and I cannot carry it further—I heard it suggested in May that he had sailed for China,. I cannot say what date it was that I was shown the telegram that Blomberg died.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. I believe the policy would not have been vitiated so long as he kept in Europe; the fact is it would not be vitiated by his going abroad—the extra risk premium depends upon where a man goes—I should say it would be different for Algiers or the Gold Coast, India, China, or Japan—there was another letter from the Sovereign, prior to the one that has been read—before Blomberg's death nobody had ascertained what the extra risk premium would amount to—the fact of his reported death was not made known to the office because I assumed they would demur to take the extra risk premium—I thought they had entered into a contract but that they probably would not take the money, and, perhaps, would not tell us what the rate might be, and we had no means of ascertaining—I did not mean them to be kept in the dark upon what I thought was a material piece of information—I thought my duty to my client required that I should keep the office in the dark as to the information I had received; I thought it would increase my client's difficulty in regard to the matter; I thought it would induce them to prejudice my client in not receiving the money, or telling us what the rate ought to be, or anything else; they would probably have said "The whole thing is at an end, and you may do what you like"—I thought my client's interest would be best served by not telling them that; they might demur and probably would, I thought they would.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> However, you did deem it an important piece of information to withhold from them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For the reasons I have stated. It was in April or May that I heard Blomberg had gone to China—almost the first thing I heard when I heard of these policies being in existence, was that he had gone abroad or on the Continent—Mr. Murray gives the copy of his letter as the 22nd May—I deny that I had it, but that is what Mr. Murray says; the question was put to me in cross-examination—Mr. Murray says he sent a letter on 22nd May, saying he had sailed for China, but he did not know where he was.</p>

I knew Lieutenant Peregrine Bowen—William Mus<lb></lb>grave Bowen was under my guardianship when he was last in England—I had been guardian to him fourteen years, ever since the death of his father—Peregine Bowen was his half-brother, and was older than he was—they were not on good terms—I never saw the prisoner before this transaction was brought before the Lord Mayor—the whole of this will, dated 2nd Sept., except the attestation, is in William Musgrave Bowen's writing—the other will, of 15th March, 1846, is not in his writing, not any of it—he always resided at my house when he was in England, and at my father's before me—I have known him all his life—I believe he left England, the last time, on 8th Sept., 1845, a few days after the date of the genuine will—I heard of his death in the early part of June, 1846—I obtained probate of the will early in Feb., 1847—I first heard of the other will, dated 15th March, 1846, about the 15th or 17th of Feb., 1847, and went to see it at Mr. Gwynne's, the solicitor for Peregrine Bowen, at Haverfordwest—he showed it me, after some difficulty—it is the one which has been produced—I know Peregrine Bowen's writing, and believe the whole of this will to be his, with the exception of the attesting of John Bell—"John Wood" is in his writing—Peregrine Bowen is since dead.</p>

                  </hi> I am one of the examiners at Doctors' Commons. I took the examination of witnesses in the case of "Bowen <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Richards"—in February last, a person calling himself John Wood appeared to give evi<lb></lb>dence before me—he was dressed as a sailor, and was chewing tobacco, and altogether his speaking and conversation was that of a common sailor—I took down his evidence, and he signed it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is my writing—I</p>

               <p>was afterwards present at the Mansion-house when he was examined—he was then dressed as a lieutenant, in uniform—it was the same man that I examined—I do not recollect his answering to any name then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> He spirted his tobacco all about the place, did he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and called us all <hi rend="italic">lubbers.</hi>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 20.) On 2nd Feb. I was directed to watch the movements of a person who was examined at Doctors' Commons, in the dress of a sailor—he went to Liverpool—I went by the same train, and, in consequence of what I learned, and from instructions, I took him into custody, and he was taken before the Lord Mayor on this charge—he turned out to be Peregrine Bowen—he was remanded once or twice, and on the morning of the final examination he was found to have destroyed himself in prison—on the way to Liverpool he stopped at the Edge-hill station, and gave a letter, which I had previously seen him write at Crewe, to the collector who received the tickets, to give to Mr. Dobbin—Crewe is a station on the line where we stopped an hour—that was on 3rd Feb.—on the 4th, I saw the prisoner at Edge-hill, and asked him if he would be kind enough to tell me who the gentleman was that he had received a letter from the previous night, that came from London—he studied for a moment or two, and then said, "Lieutenant Bowen"—I asked him if he knew where he lived—he said he did not know; if I wanted to know I must apply to the Admiralty; or if he wanted to know he must apply to the Admiralty—I took him into custody on 11th March—he was at Edge-hill station, collecting the tickets—I waited till he had finished them, went into the office, and I was an officer from London; that he was charged with forging the name of John Bell, the attesting witness to the will of a person of the name of William Musgrave Bowen—he said it was a very hard case for a man to be taken into custody that was innocent, or knew nothing about-it; I am not positive which he said—I went with him to his house, and found these three letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said, "These are signed J. Dobbin," and asked if they were his writing; he said, "Yes"—I asked him if the signatures were his; he said, "Yes"—I also found these other letters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you recollect when you were before the Magistrate that he said if you wanted to know Bowen's address you must ask at the Admiralty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he had a brown coat and a round sailor's hat on—after leaving Doctors' Commons, he went to the Cross Keys, and put on a light coat, similar to a watchman's.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">One of the letters was here read; it was dated Feb.</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1846, <hi rend="italic">from Mr. Wood, Chairman of the Customs, to Lieut. Bowen, relative to an application of the prisoner for the Mastership of the Pembroke Union Workhouse; and stating that he had been discharged from the Revenue Police for not having displayed sufficient activity and zeal. The deposition of Peregrine Bowen, as John Wood, is the Prerogative Court, was also read in support of the attestation to the forged will.</hi>)</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received an excellent character.)</p>

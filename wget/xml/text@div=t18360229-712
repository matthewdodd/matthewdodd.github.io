                  </hi> I am a butcher, and carry on my business at No. 124, Crawford-street. On the 13th of Febrauary, at half-past ten o'clock in the evening, a person brought the prisoner into my shop, with a piece of beef—I had lost such a piece—the man said he had caught the prisoner with it, and that he saw him take it off the board—I sent for the prisoner's father previous to my giving him into custody—I will not swear to it—it was outside on the board.</p>

                  </hi> As I was coming quickly along Crawford-street, at a little distance, I saw the prisoner take something from Mr. Coumbe's window—I thought he had stolen it, and seeing me pursue him, he ran—I followed him—he turned a corner, and was a quater of a minute out of my sight, during which time he might have thrown the meat away—he had turned another corner before I collared him, and had no meat with him—I brought him back, and picked up a piece of beef just round the corner that he had turned—when I collared him he said, "Pray let me go, as it will break my mother's heart"—I said, "You must come back with me, and hear what the butcher says about it"—I took him back—the butcher did not know he had lost a piece till he looked, and then he found he was a piece short—I could not see whether he took beef or pork, or veal; but he took something.</p>

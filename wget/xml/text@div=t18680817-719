                  </hi>. I live at 7, Arthur Street, Chelsea, and am a brick<lb></lb>layer—on the evening of 1st August, I was outside the Six Bells public-house, in King's Road, Chelsea—I saw the deceased Stephen Soper come out, and several other men—William Kingham was one of them—they all stood talking for some few minutes—I could not hear what they were talking about—I saw the prisoner strike Soper in the face with his fist, and he fell on the back of his head heavily—the prisoner walked away directly—the deceased was then taken home—on the Wednesday night I went to his house, to see how he was—I remained from 4 o'clock on Wednesday afternoon until Thursday night at 12—he was insensible, and had a great many fits the whole time—I went again on Friday, about 8.30, and he was dead—the deceased never struck the prisoner at all—I believe both of them had had a little to drink, but they knew what they were about.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 14, Arthur Street Chelsea—I was in the Six Bells, with the deceased and the prisoner, on the evening of the 1st August, between 8 and 9—a man named Street came in, and three or four others—Street began talking about his two horses, and Soper said, "The grey mare is twenty years old, I know"—he then pulled some money out of his pocket, and said, "I'll bet you five guineas the grey</p>

               <p>mare is twenty years old"—I then touched him on the shoulder, and said, "Let's go home"—I walked out of the door, and Soper followed—the pri<lb></lb>soner had said nothing—he followed out after Soper—I walked on a little way, and whether they did have any words outside I can't say—when I had got ten or twelve yards, I turned round and saw Soper on the pavement, on his back—I did not hear any challenge or preparation for a fight—I picked him up, and took him home—nobody struck him while he was in my hands—I put him on the bed, and left him for that night—I saw him on the Sunday, and asked him if he was hurt—he said, "No, not particularly," only he felt a little giddiness in his head—I saw him on the Monday evening, and he then said there was nothing the matter with him, only he felt giddy in the head—he was lying on the bed then—I believe he went out that day—I saw him on Tuesday evening, about 7 o'clock, and he said the same thing—I went on Wednesday, and sat up with him all night—he had fits then several times—he was a good deal worse then—he never spoke after he began having the fits—on the Sunday I noticed some blood on a little cut on his lip.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the deceased sober? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the betting, in the public-house, was between Street and Soper—the prisoner did not enter into it, as far as I heard—I did not see Soper shoving his fist into the prisoner's face, and making him bet against his will—it was Soper who first spoke about the betting—the prisoner seemed quiet enough—I have known Soper thirteen or fourteen years, and the prisoner seven or eight years—I don't know that he is married—he was always quiet, as far as I know.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived with the deceased for five years before his death—he was brought home, on 1st August, by Mr. Kingham, and Mr. White, a lodger—he was insensible—when he recovered his sense his head was giddy—he never complained of that before—he was a very strong man—he had a cut at the corner of his mouth, as if from a blow; it was not there before—he went out quite well, to buy a pair of wheels for a truck—he did not get up on Sunday; he complained of giddiness—he went out on Monday, and came back in about an hour, and fell in the parlour—I got him to bed—he said he was so sleepy and drowsy, and still complained of giddi<lb></lb>ness—on Tuesday night I gave him some pills—he was no better then—on Wednesday, about 2 o'clock, I went to get some chops for dinner, and while I was gone he had a fit, and fell out of bed—I found him on the floor when I came back—he never spoke after that—he had fits every half hour—as he got weaker, the fits got stronger—he died from a more violent one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, practising at 171, King's Road, Chelsea—on Wednesday, 5th August, I was called to see the deceased—he was in a state of insensibility—he was suffering from pressure on the brain—he died on Friday, the 7th—I afterwards made a post-mortem examina<lb></lb>tion—there was a bruise on the mouth, and an effusion of blood on the right side of the head—there was also a bruise on the back of the head—the effusion was very slow, as it was only a small vessel—giddiness and sickness would be constant symptoms of effusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

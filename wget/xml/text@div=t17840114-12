             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman in New Brentford; about six o'clock in the morning of the 11th of November I went to the prisoner's house, he was walking backwards and forwards just before his door, I went there after some coals; I went down to the stairs, and at the bottom of the stairs I saw the prisoner's house open, and a candle burning therein, I did not go in, I went towards the water side, and there was a boat, and facing his own door there lay five sacks of coals.</p>
               <p>Court. In what place? - I take it on the premises, he told me himself that some part of it was, and some was not, they lay on the ground.</p>
               <p>Were they in a sack, or were they loose? - All in sacks.</p>
               <p>Have you the sacks here? - No, we had them here the last sessions; the prisoner came through his house, and came out to us, he said he knew nothing about the sacks, he presently went into his house and came out again, and owned the whole.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him it should be better for him if he owned it, or that it should be worse for him, that he should be prosecuted? - No.</p>
               <p>What did he own? - He owned that some laid on the premises, and some not, and he owned that he helped out with one of the sacks out of the boat, he told me that

             had brought the boat up.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you that any body else had brought the boat up? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you what time the boat was brought up? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Councel for the Prisoner. What is West? - A fisherman.</p>
               <p>He lives close to the Wharf? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This wharf is open to the water, I or any body else may land there? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you, why what should prevent me landing, is it a private wharf; upon your oath is not it the common passage? - Nobody can land upon that piece of ground, they tell me it is his private property.</p>
               <p>Does not any body else make use of it? - I did not see any body.</p>
               <p>You do not live there perhaps? - No.</p>
               <p>Then how should you know; where were these things, were they not at the water edge? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then it was not even upon the wharf? - The boat could not come up at low water.</p>
               <p>Was it below high-water mark? - No, it was not, to be sure they could not be landed there, they were brought by tide.</p>
               <p>Was it above or below high-water mark? - It must be above.</p>
               <p>Why so? - Because I am sure it must.</p>
               <p>Was it above the edge of the river? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far, as far as you are from me? - No.</p>
               <p>Not so far from the water as that? - No.</p>

               <p>I only know what Mr. West told me, that he had helped out with the sack, this was the 11th of November.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, here is no evidence at all, to be sure it is not necessary in the trial of a receiver to give positive proof that he knew these things to be stolen; but circumstantial evidence would be sufficient, as for instance, if he had bought them at a lower price, or had bought them at an unseasonable time of night, but there is no evidence at all in this case, only, that the sacks are taken out, and that he helped out with one of them, and there they lay on the beach.</p>

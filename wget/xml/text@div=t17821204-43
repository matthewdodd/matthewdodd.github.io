               <p>Court. Then it is a disorderly house? - I cannot say but what it is; the prisoner Mary Hill, and me, went to this house, into a room, and had some pots of beer; the other two women prisoners were in the room, and two or three men came in, among whom was the prisoner Brown; they were playing and joking, one with another, every one had his own company; I did not like them, and I was going; this young body insisted I should not go that night, and upon the same terms I took off my cloaths and lay in the bed; the others went about one or two o'clock; then the other prisoner

I had five guineas and six or seven shillings in silver, I am sure I had that money going to bed, because I stuffed my neckcloth into my pocket to keep it steady; I directly accused Mary Hill, and the other woman, who were still in bed with me: they denied it bluntly: they made a great noise about it, at last she went to accuse that young boy with it.</p>
               <p>You did not see him in the room after you went to bed? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever get any of your money again? - Never a farthing, there is a little of it in view, as it might be; I left them that morning, I took them up in the evening.</p>

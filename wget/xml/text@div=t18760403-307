                  </hi>. I am a surveyor, of 34, Charles Street, Caledonian Road—on February, about 12.30 a.m., I was in the City Road, and received a kick on my legs from behind—that did not make me fall—I turned round and saw three men behind me walking deliberately after me—I was struck by one of them on my lip which cut it—I was immediately knocked, down on my face and my shoulder put out, and my right eye cut nearly across—they turned me over on my back to gel at my watch which they took, and a portion of my chain—this, other portion (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was left in my fingers—the prisoner is one of the men who was stooping over me—I did not cry out, but Mr. Clark came and shouted "Police" and "Murder," and the three men went away—a policeman came sometime afterwards—I was taken in a cab to the hospital, where my shoulder was set in half an hour—I then returned home in a cab—I remained in bed for a month, and have been ill ever since—on; 11th February, Haydon. brought four men to my bedroom and I pointed out the prisoner who was one of them—I think he said that he was not one of the men, but I am sure he is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not knocked senseless—the men were close up against the wall, and so was I—the prisoner was brought to my bedside five or six days afterwards—I do not know who the others were, but I had known, one of them by sight before—I think one of the others was something like the prisoner—the detective told me he had taken a man and was going to bring him for me to identify—they followed one another into my room, and I think the prisoner was the last—I looked very hard at him. and pointed him out saying "That is one of the three"—I may have said at first "I believe that is one of the men who knocked me down," but looked</p>

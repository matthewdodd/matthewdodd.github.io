                  </hi>. I am a sailor. On the night of the 26th of June I was going up Ratcliffe-highway, and fell in with Whalen—I went home with her, and went up stairs to her bed-room—she asked if I had got any money—I said I had got no change, I would pay her in the morning—I laid down on the bed—I did not like the place, and came down—as soon as I came down, the three prisoners fell upon me, pulled me down on the floor by the hair of my head, beat my head, tore all my clothes, my jacket and pockets, and took away my watch-pocket, with a sovereign in it—I had no watch—they then went out at the back-door—I got out, and called the police—a policeman came—I told him I had been robbed of a sovereign, and ill-used besides—he took Hall, and the other two were taken afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Whalen.</hi> He only came out of prison that day, he said he had no money, but would give me his jacket to stop all night, and call in the morning for it, <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I had no money—I came to Clerkenwell for one day for getting tipsy, because I had been sent home, went on board my ship, and got the balance of my wages, which was 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I laid out, the shillings, and the sovereign I had in my watchpocket—I did not say I would leave her the jacket—I was perfectly sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was called into this house, on hearing the alarm, between two and three o'clock on Monday morning—I found Edmonds standing outside, complaining of having been beat and robbed of a sovereign by three females and two black men—his clothes were very much torn, and he was very much beat about the head—I apprehended Hall at No. 5, Luke's-place, which was the house the prosecutor had been in, directly after the charge—I told her the charge—she said it was no such thing, he had no money—on Tuesday morning, about eleven o'clock, I apprehended Lyons—I told her she was charged with stealing a sovereign and assaulting the man—she said, "No such thing, he had no money"—the prosecutor had been drinking, but was not drunk.</p>

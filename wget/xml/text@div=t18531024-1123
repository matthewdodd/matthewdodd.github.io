                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 3, Peter-street, Berwick-street. About eleven months ago I had a little boy. I suckled him till Tuesday, 4th Oct., and then put him out to nurse to the prisoner Nash, who I have known, I should think, nearly three years—I knew her by the name of Burch at the time I put the child out to her to nurse—she was then living with the male prisoner—they passed among their neighbours as Mr. and Mrs. Burch—I was to pay her half a crown a week for nursing the child, and I was to find food for it—she was then living with Burch, at 6, Little Dean-street, Soho—the child was with them from the 4th till the 14th, when it died—I was in the habit of seeing it twice or three times a day; sometimes she brought it to me, and sometimes I went there—I last saw it well on Thursday evening, the 13th—the last time I suckled it was Wednesday, Oct. 12th, between 1 and 2 o'clock—I did not hear that anything was the matter with it till Friday morning—about 2 o'clock on Thursday the female prisoner told me that the baby looked pale and faint, and I bought a sole, and desired her to boil it, and give the baby some of the water to drink first,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185310240092"></xptr>
               <p>and then some of the sole—I took the sole myself to Little Dean-street between 6 and 7 in the evening, and saw the child fast asleep, wrapped up in a cloak; I did not disturb it, but returned home—on the following morning Nash came to me at 3, Peter-street,-and said that the baby was dead—I went directly, and saw it at 13, Bond-street, Borough-road, on a bed, in the first floor back room—I observed that it was very much bruised on the forehead; and when the person in the next room was washing it, I observed a bruise on its back and side—it had had no convulsive fits while it was in my care; its health was generally very good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Burch. Q.</hi> Were you not aware that we were going to Bond-street nearly a week before we went? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; you moved there on Thursday night, the 13th—I was willing that the child should go there with you—it was ill some<lb></lb>times while it was under my care—I cannot say what was the matter with it, but I had a doctor to it twice—he did not say each time that the child would not live—I do not remember telling the Coroner that the doctor had told me that the child would not live, on the night of the inquest—I do not think I said so; the doctor did not tell me so—I came to see the child at your house every day till the last day, Thursday—I had the child in my possession fur three or four hours of the Saturday afternoon before it died, and the whole of Sunday—previously to the Saturday I had the child home twice or three times of a night on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, the 4th, 5th, and 6th Oct.—I first observed marks on its side on the Sunday before it died.</p>

Q.</hi> Did not you tell the summoning officer that you could show two letters from two different doctors who said that the child would not live? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I told you I had two letters, one from the Dispensary, and one from the Hospital; and the remark I made was, that perhaps the medicine the child had would show what it died with—I said that on Friday morning, immediately after the child's death—you brought the child to me on the Monday night previous to its death—I did not examine it then—it was in my possession about two hours—I did not suckle it then; I was weaning it—it was brought to me about half past. 9, and remained with me till near midnight—I took it back myself, to 6, Little Dean-street—at the time it came to you it had a <hi rend="italic">snuffling</hi> at the nose.</p>

               <p>door of my room, "For God's take don't beat the baby to"—I heard the voices of both the prisoners in the room—the female prisoner said that they would do as they liked with their own; I had no business to interfere—their door was open, they opened it—I was sitting in my room—the male prisoner came to my door and gave me a great deal of abuse; and in the course of the conversation the female prisoner threatened to break my neck down the stairs if I entered there again—the male prisoner was in his shirt sleeves; he called me a great many names, which I cannot repeat—I told them that if they beat it again I would call a policeman—the male prisoner said I might fetch three—they were in the lodging about nine days after that; they left on the following Friday week—I heard the child cry several times after that, as if it was being beat, and I could hear the blows—this occurred repeatedly, daily—I afterwards saw the child in their arms twice, but not to notice it—I did not think it was so old as eleven months.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Armstrong, of 6, Little Dean-street, Soho. We occupy the second floor back—the prisoners were there about a fortnight; they occupied the room under us, the first floor back—they might have had a child with them on the Saturday night—I was not aware when I let them in whether they had one—I first beard the child cry on the Monday, I think; I am not certain—I think there was one child there before the other came; I am not sure—I saw the deceased child twice; the first time was on a Tuesday, the first week they were there—I think the first time I heard the child cry was on Tuesday—I heard nothing else besides cry<lb></lb>ing—I did not hear the child smacked on the Tuesday—on the Wednesday I heard the prisoners beat the child three times in ten minutes—I know it was them because I heard both their voices—I could not hear what was said—the next thing I heard was that Ann Dakin, who lived in the first floor front, interfered—I did not hear either of the prisoners say anything to the child oil that day; but on the Thursday afternoon I heard them beat the child again, and heard Burch call it a little devil—between 11 and 12 o'clock on that Thursday night, as I was lying in bed, I heard some one beat the child in their room, and heard Burch call it a little b——r—on the Friday, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon, I went down for a pitcher of water, and as I came up stairs I heard the child cry; I listened, and heard them beat the baby—the smacks were flat—I beard the voices of both the prisoners—there is a crack in the wainscoting; I went and looked through, and the child was lying on its belly, by the crack, and the man had hold of it by its arms, by both arms, and he knocked its bead against the wainscoting, eight times: I counted—I heard him say, "No, you little devil, I am d——d if you shall master me"—I heard the woman's voice as well—I went up stairs to my own room then, and the child was crying still—on the Saturday the child was crying, and they were beating it, but I did not hear any voice—the child was there very nearly a fortnight, during which time I heard the child beaten a great many times; I did not count—it was beaten every day—I did not make a complaint to anybody—the child was eleven months old—I did not</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and reside in London-road. About 9 o'clock on Friday morning this child was brought to me by two per<lb></lb>sons—the female prisoner was one—it was nearly dead—it died almost imme<lb></lb>diately after I saw it; about half a minute afterwards, or it might be rather more—I examined it externally, and found two or three bruises on the fore-bead—I did not take off the clothes, I merely passed my hand along the spine, and examined the arms—next day I saw it undressed—I then examined it externally, and observed bruises on the forehead—the child had laid on its back some time, which had caused the blood to gravitate, and prevented my making a proper examination there, as that had produced discoloration of the skin, which made it difficult to discern whether there were bruises there or not—on the next day, Saturday, I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I re<lb></lb>moved</p>

               <p>the upper portion of the skull, and examined the brain—I found very great congestion of the brain in its membranes, and an effusion of serum into the ventricles of the brain—I examined the viscera—they were all healthy—I found no symptoms of water on the brain, and no trace of any organic disease, no symptoms of any disease of any standing—there was no old disease—there was nothing about the state of the child to account for its death, except the appearances I observed on the brain—there was no trace of softening of the structure of the brain, nothing but the congestion and effusion—if a child of eleven months old had been beaten day after day for eight or nine days, that would be likely to produce congestion of the brain, and effusion, such as I found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think it would be likely to be produced by weaning, and sepa<lb></lb>ration from the mother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not seen that effect; but I should wish to add, that anything which would excite the passions would produce it—any excitement has a tendency to produce such a state—fits and convulsions pro<lb></lb>duce the same appearances—I have not ascertained anything to lead me to think that the appearances I saw were produced by fits and convulsions—the appearance of the child was not such as led me to suppose that it had been subject to fits or convulsions—danger to the child from beating would depend upon its age—the beating of so young a child as this would be likely to pro<lb></lb>duce a dangerous state of excitement—the beating of a very young infant, eleven months old, such as has been described, would be liable to produce congestion of its brain—congestion is an engorgement of the blood-vessels of the brain—they would be over-filled with blood, an unnatural fulness; and when the blood is too plentiful, then the serum pours out, and that causes death—the serum is the watery portion of the blood—congestion might have lasted for several days—I cannot say the exact time—it might have been only twenty-four hours—in my opinion it could only have been twenty-four hours, to the extent I saw it—there might have been a less degree of congestion for two or three hours, and an intense degree for twenty-four hours; in my judgment effusion had taken place seven or eight hours, or it might have been to a small extent more—the effect of a great degree of congestion or effusion is to produce a state of stupor—a person suffering from an intense degree of congestion or effusion appears to be in a state of heavy sleep, so that it is possible that a mother, seeing a child under such circumstances, may have supposed that it was fast asleep—I suppose that, if the mother had seen the child asleep at 7 o'clock in the evening, and it died between 8 and 9 o'clock the following morning, that it was suffering from congestion at the time she saw it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Burch. Q.</hi> The only question is, whether congestion of the brain might not have been coming on for some days previous to the death of the child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have stated that it might—taking the child away from the mother at such a period might add to the congestion still more—I think I have stated that a convulsive fit is sufficient to cause the death of a child when it is suffering under congestion.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>open hand, that could be done without leaving marks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would depend on the severity—it would produce a redness of the skin in a child of that age, but would not produce marks of bruises, unless it was very severe—I observed two or three bruises on the forehead—judging from my experi<lb></lb>ence, I should say that they had existed four or five days, or it might have been more; it is very difficult to ascertain—I should say they must have been there four days at the least—it is very uncertain how long marks of bruises remain—it depends on the severity, and on the degree of effusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Burch's Defence.</hi> The child was brought to me on Tuesday, 4th Oct., by the mother herself; she has been in the habit of seeing it three or four times a day; sometimes she had it three or four hours at a stretch of a morn<lb></lb>ing; it was labouring under a severe cold, and had a dreadful <hi rend="italic">snuffling</hi> of the nose, which produced a very unpleasant noise; on the Tuesday, as I was washing myself to go out to work, there was a button off my shirt; the female prisoner, who was nursing the child, put it down to put the button on my shirt; the child made a noise; I took it up, and it dirtied me, and I gave it two or three smart pats on the bottom; Mrs. Dakin then came, and the female prisoner spoke to her; she gave me abuse, and of course I gave her the same—I found it was getting too hot for the female prisoner, and I went out, and told Mrs. Dakin to mind her own business, and attend to her own children; she said she would fetch a policeman; I told her to fetch three; she used bad language to me, and I thought it was high time to retaliate; on the Wednesday we went out to tea at the female prisoner's sister in law's; we returned at half past 7 o'clock; on the Thursday I went out in the morning into the city, and did not return till past 8 o'clock; I went to my uncle's, and stopped there, and it was during that time, they say, that she heard me beat the child, and call it unnatural names; on the Friday, when the woman says she was listening through the wainscot, I was at my brother's in the Borough-road, and from there I went to my mother's, in the Artillery-road, Westminster, who had heard of a place for me; it was then half past 6 o'clock—I wrote a letter there, and did not get borne till past 8 or 9 o'clock; on the Monday we both went over to my brother's, about 8 o'clock in the afternoon; we were living in Dean-street, Soho, and he in Bond-street, in the Borough; my brother is a costermonger; he had cut the quick of his toe nail, and he asked me if I would go round with him and push his barrow, for which purpose I went to his house again on the Tuesday, at 6 o'clock, and did not return home till half past 8 o'clock at night; on the Wednesday I did the same, and the female prisoner came to me at 6 o'clock, and returned with me at a quarter to 10 o'clock; on the Friday I left Dean-street, Soho, between 6 and 7 o'clock, and have not been in the house since, therefore it is utter perjury for the woman to say she heard my voice in the room, beating the child; my brother is here to prove what I assert; on the Thursday night in question the child would not eat its supper; I took it down to my sister in law, and gave it a spoonful of castor oil, as its bowels had not been opened; on the Thursday I went to my brother's, and when I returned the child bad got out of bed; but it could get no blow, because we sleep on the floor; I went on my rounds again with the barrow, and the female prisoner sent for me, and I found the child in a convulsive fit; the women came and advised her to take it to a doctor, and when she brought it back it was dead; it stands to reason, that if I had hit the child eight times against the wall, it would have hurt the skull; if I had beaten the child, it stands to reason that the women would have told the mother.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Bond-street, the house to which the prisoners removed. They came there on the Friday afternoon, about half past 4 o'clock, with the child—I sent my brother to my mother's about getting a situation for him in a public-house, and she was to tell him where to go—he came again to me on Monday, the 10th, about a quarter past 7 o'clock in the morning, and I wished him to take the barrow round for me, as I had got a bad foot, and was not able to take it myself, to serve my customers with greens—I left home, at a quarter past 0 o'clock in the evening, and left him there—my house is, I should say, a couple of miles from Dean-street—on the Wednesday morning, the 12th, he came, about the same time, with a box—Nash was at my house on the Wednesday night—it must have been about half past 7 o'clock in the evening when she came—my brother was still there, and I left him at the Surrey Theatre at 9 o'clock that night—on Thursday morning, the 13th, he came again, it might be about 7 o'clock, and brought a couple of beds with him—he did not go home at all that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. On Friday, the 7th, Nash came over to me with the child—it appeared very poorly, and was snuffling at the nose—the prisoners both came together, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and from my house they went over the water—on Monday, the 10th, they came again together; I cannot say at what time, but, as near as I can guess, it was in the evening; and Joseph came over again on Tuesday, the 11th, by himself, about half past 7 o'clock in the morning—on the Wednesday he came again, about half past 7 o'clock in the morning, and went and worked with my husband—on Wednesday night they stopped with us late, and I left them at 9 o'clock, by the Surrey Theatre, both together—on the Thursday morning Joseph came again alone, about 7 o'clock, and that night they slept at our house—I know that, because I live under<lb></lb>neath, down stairs—that was the first night they slept there, and I saw the child that night; that was Thursday, the 13th, but I saw the child first on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185310240098"></xptr>
               <p>Friday, the 7th—when I saw it on the 13th it had a severe cold, and I said "If I were Nash I would take it home to its mother"—Joseph brought it down to my room that day, and gave it some castor oil; and on Friday, the 14th, Nash called Joseph up stairs, and I followed up after him, and saw the child dying—I said she had better go across to Mr. Wakem's, the parish doctor, with it—we took it to him, and he said it was dead.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

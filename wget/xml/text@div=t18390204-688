                  </hi>. I am the son of Charles Thompson, a far<lb></lb>mer, at Luton, in Bedfordshire, which is thirty-one miles from London. On the 28th of January his mare was safe in the stable, which was not locked—I missed her next morning about four o'clock, and found her the same morning about nine o'clock at the Cock, at Holloway, behind a hay cart—I am sure it was the same mare—my father had hid her four or five years—she was seven or eight years old—I had seen her safe about two o'clock the previous afternoon.</p>

On the morning of the 29th of January, about eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner near Holloway, with a mare—I did not know him before—he asked me if I would take her through the double gates at Islington, as he wanted to go somewhere and could not take her with him—I took her, and he promised to meet me at the double gates—I cabled at the Cock, at Holloway—I tied the mare behind my cart and there it stood—when I got to St. John-street I saw the prisoner, and he nodded his head to me to go on—he was apprehended directly afterwards.</p>

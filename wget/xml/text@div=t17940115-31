               <p>I washed for Mr. Huggins. On the 30th of December last I remember putting some pin clothes in the washhouse over night, there were eleven in the bill, and one I found in the morning, some stall clothes, what the butchers lay across the stalls, there were nine of them, and I found five in the morning at the lower end of the garden, there were some aprons, and I found two in the yard, among the stall cloths, there were some shists belonging to the children, I don't know how many, there was a night gown, a cotton waistcoat, some night shirts, they are put down as shists, there is collars on them like shirts, there were some table cloths, but I don't know how many there were of them, I look upon it they were made of cotton and some breakfasts cloths, I think three.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put these on the night of the 30th of December? - I left them in the wash-house in a clothes-basket, meaning to come in the morning to finish them, I came in the morning and found the property gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know who had them at Worship-street? - Mr. Ferris and Mr. Ray.</p>

               <p>Q. Persons who you should not suspect of letting persons coming through their houses to rob you? - No. I looked at the wall, and I could not see any marks of dirt, by getting over, which way they got in I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the things that Ray had with him just now? - On the 2d of January Mr. Ray and I were going up Golden-lane, we met the two prisoners at the bar, with each of them a bundle; I says to Mr. Ray here are two women, each of them has got a bundle, we will go over and see what they have got, before we came up to them they both of them turned down a place, which leads towards Arthur-street, they knowed me, it struck me that they did it to avoid me, I knew one before, but I did not recollect the other, I crossed the way and catched hold of them, and asked them what they had got? and examined the bundles, and they at last told me it was linen, I took a bundle from Allen, I asked then where they had got it? she said she did not know, some man gave it to her to carry, I asked her where I she said she did not know, I said they should go before a magistrate, and I took them into custody, and carried them before the magistrate, we examined the linen there at the office, and we found there were marks on them that corresponded with the hand-bill that we had got, there were not marks on all the linen, there was on some of it, but a great many had been picked out, there is one marked the same as on the bill, that I took from them, one of the table cloths.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you could see where the marks were picked out? - We could see where they had been picked out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what passed between Smith, and

               <p>Some of this linen belongs to my master, and we sent it to Mr. Huggins's to be washed.</p>
               <p>Court to Huggins. Do you know the marks of any of the linen, that was brought to be washed? - I cannot swear to the marks.</p>
               <p>Hannab Baynham. This table cloth is Mr. Markham's property, and my master had it to wash; these other things belong to Mr. Hemmings, a coal merchant in Hermitage-bridge. I know this stall cloth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Allen. My father and mother live in that court, it is a thoroughfare; a tall man came by with that bundle, and the side of his coat was thrown over it, and he asked us to take the bundle to the Crown and Sceptre, in Ball-yard; and these gentlemen came, and stopped us immediately; they did not ask us any thing; they put irons on our hands, and took us away; we told them, perhaps, if they would go up to the public house, they might see the man; but they would not go up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith. I have nothing more to say, than what the other prisoner has said.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Allen. I should know the tall man, was I to see him; the Crown and Sceptre was about five or six doors down further than where they stopped us.</p>
               <p>Ferris. The Crown and Sceptre is not quite a hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the place you met them, from the place where they live.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Allen. I live with my mother in Rose-alley, Golden lane, just by there.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you both live together? - Smith had been a little while out of place, and she was with me while I was out of place; my father is not in constant work, or else I should not have been so long with him at home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coffee house keeper in Cross-street, Hatton Garden. I know the White Horse Chambers in Fetter-lane—I am con<lb></lb>nected with them—on 30th Jan. I was on the back part of those chambers in the afternoon—I saw Richard Fleming cutting the lead off the sky light—he was on the roof of the chambers—I raised the window and asked him what he was doing—he said, "I am going to take this lead off and put new on, and going to take these tiles off and put new coating round here "—I said, "That is all nonsense, it has only just been repaired; what is your name?"—he said, "We are employed here for Chaplin, and have been for some years past" (we took these premises of Chaplin)—I went and spoke to Mr. Evans, who is the superintendent and manager, and when I returned with him, I saw Richard Fleming going across the roofs of the houses with the lead on his shoulder—Mr. Evans said to him, "Hey! where are you going with that lead?"—he said, "It is all right"—Mr. Evans said, "No, it is not all right, it is all wrong"—I then ran into Norwich-court and Mr. Evans into White Horse yard—when I got into Norwich-court I saw Richard Fleming with the lead on his shoulder on the top of the houses—I saw a policeman, and took him into one of the houses that I thought Richard Fleming was on the roof of—we came out of Norwich-court, and I saw Richard Fleming again in White Horse yard and gave him in charge—these pieces of lead were lying on the ground in the White Horse yard—this piece is like the lead that came from our premises—myself and Mr. Charles Pine are the proprietors of them—Richard Fleming had no authority to take any lead from our premises—I have not the least doubt that he is the man I saw on the roof cutting the lead—I examined the place the next morning, and all the lead had been removed from there—the lead had been cut all round a weathercock that was there.</p>

On 13th Jan., my attention was called, in the afternoon, and I saw Richard Fleming with this long piece of lead on his shoulder—he was going along the roof, towards the end of the White Horse yard—I said, "Halloo, what are you going to do with that lead?—he said, "It is all right"—I said, "It is all wrong; put it down, you have no business with it"—he continued with it, and I went into White Horse yard, and saw Keys standing by a track which was close by a ladder there—he had a short ladder in his hand, which he was going to put on the truck—the other ladder was placed against the wall of the house leading towards our premises—they could get there by getting over four or five houses—I skid to Keys, "Who is on the roof?"—he replied, "Two of my mates "—I looked up the ladder, and I saw Alfred Fleming coming down it—I said to Keys, "Do you know that man?"—he said, "Yes, he is my mate"—I asked, "Who else are there?"—he replied, "Two of my mates"—knowing that Alfred Fleming was not the man I had seen with the lead, I ran up the ladder as fast as I could, and found a large piece of lead on the roof, close by the spot where Alfred Fleming came from—I am not certain which of these three pieces it was—I came down and saw Keys move the truck—I said, "You shall not go away; where is your mate "—he said, "He is in the loft "—the policemen came—I sent one policeman to the loft after him, and gave Keys and Alfred Fleming into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN SIZAR</hi>. I am a lighterman, of Henrietta Terrace, Deptford—on 10th January I was in Commercial Road—the prisoner walked on my left side—he then struck me a blow in the chest and knocked me down—a man seized me from behind—I saw two men behind—the prisoner put his hand in my left-hand trousers pocket and took a florin, sixpence, and some pence, nearly 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he then jumped off me—I saw him pass the money to a man at my back.</p>

On January 10th I saw Sizar in the Commercial Road followed by three men, the prisoner was one—I concealed myself in a doorway—near Flower Street I saw the prisoner strike Sizar a blow on the chest—he fell on his back and the prisoner fell on him and drew something from Sizar's trousers-pocket and handed it to a tall man not in custody—the two men ran along Flower Street and the prisoner ran along Commercial Road into my arms—I told him I should take him in custody for assaulting and robbing the prosecutor—he said "I know nothing about it"—on the way to the station he got quiet, and then I was thrown down by some one in the mob, and he escaped—I gave chase after him and apprehended him again in Ada Street—I never lost sight of him.</p>

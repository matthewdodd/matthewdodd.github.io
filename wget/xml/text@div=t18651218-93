                  </hi>. I carry on business as a wholesale jeweller and watchmaker, 6, John-street, Bedford-row—I have known the prisoner for some years—in April, 1864, he was selling goods for me on commission—he remained with me on those terms, till August, 1865—an arrangement was then made that every month we were to have a settlement of the accounts; that he was to return the goods that were unsold, and the goods that were sold were to be entered accordingly—I could not get any settlement from him of the goods that were unsold; but a fresh arrangement was made—before entering into that new arrangement, he tendered to me a number of deposit notes and other things for the goods which he did not return—he said the goods were in pledge at Mr. Allison's—about 136<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.'s worth of goods were unaccounted for, and l,128<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.'s worth in respect of which I held the deposit notes—it was at Mr. Lewis's office that the new arrangement was made.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the arrangement, whatever it was, reduced to writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect that it was, I never saw it—there was some mention made that an arrangement was to be drawn up, but I believe it never was drawn up—I cannot call to mind that an arrangement was read to me by Messrs. Lewis in the presence of the prisoner—I believe an arrangement was drawn up, which was submitted to me, and was returned to Messrs. Lewis; but it was never signed, and I never saw it afterwards.</p>

               <p>of October—it was a portion of the goods that he had received before he entered into the new arrangement—he said that if I would redeem that bracelet, he thought he had a good chance of selling it—I did redeem it, and I also handed him a pair of turquoise and diamond ear-rings to sell with it—they represented part of the new stock—he brought the ear-rings, but not the bracelet, and said that he had shown the ear-rings to Mr. Johnson, of Threadneedle-street, that he admired them very much, and would have purchased them as ear-rings, but one of the young men put one of them into his scarf, and it looked so pretty as a pin, that if I would have them converted into pins, he would give me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the bracelet—I said, "Very well, I will accept the offer"—I had the ear-rings converted into pins, and they were given to the prisoner to take to Mr. Johnson's, about 4th November—I cannot call to mind whether the prisoner returned that evening; but in Oxford-street I asked him once or twice whether he had delivered the ear-rings to Mr. Johnson, and he said "Yes"—here is an entry in the day-book of 4th November, 1865, in the prisoner's writings, "Mr. Johnson, Threadneedle-street, 2 brilliant and turquose pins, 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; one brilliant enamelled horse-shoe bracelet, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—in the ledger I find Mr. Johnson's name also carried forward, in the prisoner's writing, as a debtor to the amount of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Johnson had not previously been any customer of mine—about the 16th November, I saw Mr. Johnson, and, in consequence of what he told me, I saw the prisoner—I had before that consulted my solicitor, and I saw the prisoner in his presence, and in the presence of Mr. Buchanan, the prisoner's solicitor, or his clerk—I asked him, if he had sold that bracelet and pins to Mr. Johnson, of Threadneedle-street; after a little hesitation, he said, "No, Sir, I have not; but I have sold them to somebody else; I have received the money for them, and have appropriated it to my own use, and now you may do what you like—it was not said defiantly, but almost despairingly—I then asked him about the sale of a bracelet to Mr. Moses, in Oxford-street—I found an entry in the prisoner's handwriting on 15th September, 1865, of a carbuncle and brilliant bracelet, value 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., sold to Mr. Moses, of Oxford-street, and he is also brought forward in the same way, as a debtor, in the ledger—I asked the prisoner if he had sold the bracelet to Mr. Moses—he said "No, Sir"—I then gave him into custody—I found an entry on 16th September, of a turquoise suite and case for twelve guineas, sold to Mr. Bennett, of Blackheath—that was also carried forward in the ledger—I did not ask the prisoner as to that—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the ear-rings—I have not been able to hear of the other property—this letter is in the prisoner's writing—I received it after I had instituted proceedings before the Lord Mayor, (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Sir, I once more ask you to have mercy, not for me, but for my poor little children; if you will only withdraw, I will do all in my power to refund, and assist you—do, for heaven's sake, release; I have suffered much, and without benefiting you one farthing; do not refuse my prayer, or my only comfort on earth will not survive the blow."</p>

               <p>of Mr. Benson's in payment of the jewellery he had been selling—he never offered me a bill of Mr. Benson's, or of any other person—he did not tell me he had received one—I did not know that the ear-rings were sold to Mr. Benson—I had not the remotest idea where they were sold, till afterwards—he might have mentioned that he had received a bill of exchange from Mr. Benson, but he never offered it to me—he asked me one day if I would take Mr. Benson's bill in part payment, and I said no, I did not care about it I wanted the money—that was after the new arrangement and after the sale of the pins to Mr. Johnson—it was not in payment of that that he offered me the bill—he never came to my office, told me he got the bill discounted, and handed me the proceeds, 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—all the moneys that were handed over to me are entered in the cash-book, in his own handwriting—he paid me 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 4th November, but nothing referring to these particular things—it was made up with small items—this includes the whole of the amount he paid me—it amounts to about 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he paid me a sum of 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in a lump—this sum of 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was handed over to me in one sum—this sum did not include the ear-rings or the bracelet—they are for other goods—it was to be paid by the proceeds of the sales, not by a commission—he was to reduce the old debt by the proceeds of the sales—I had redeemed the property which had been previously pledged, and intrusted it to him to sell, and by that means he was to reduce the former debt till it was discharged—he would be paid a salary—there was none agreed on that I remember, or any fixed commission—he was to be my servant to make the entries in the day-book, every day, of goods sold, and to enter the cash received, and to return the goods every night that were not sold—he was not to sell these goods for the best prices he could obtain—they were marked at my selling prices, and he was to sell them at that price, and was to hand over to me the whole of the cash he received—it was not until the old debt should be liquidated that he was to receive a salary, but in the meantime he was carrying on his own business—he filed a petition in bankruptcy and came to announce that fact to Mr. Lewis the very afternoon that I gave him into custody—I happened to be at Mr. Lewis's office when he came to say that he had made himself a bankrupt, and I then put the question to him whether he had sold those goods to Mr. Johnson.</p>

                  </hi>.

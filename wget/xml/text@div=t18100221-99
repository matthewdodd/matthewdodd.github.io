               <p>Prisoner's Defence. During the five months of my being employed with the prosecutor, I was in the constant habit of paying and receiving money, and during the absence of my master I settled with my mistress. In January last the prosecutor informed me he had no occasion for me. I replied, I was sorry for it. I demanded a settlement for the last week; he said he should not give me any. He said, William, how am I to procure the money from Mr. Masterman? I told him if he would give me a bill and receipt, I would give him the money immediately. I never had a bill and receipt; I thought it proper as I had left him; and I having bought a horse and cart to maintain my wife and family, he has taken these steps against me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Had he a horse and cart. - A. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210057"></xptr>believe so; I saw a horse and cart. He has set up the carting business after he left me, and every time he comes by the place he abuses my men, and said, he should see me without a cow; he has abused me ever since he has left me.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you took him up upon Mr. Mead's business - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take him up before - A. No; I thought it was hardly worth while.</p>
               <p>Q. When he had set up a horse and cart, and told you he should see you without a cow, you took him up - A. Yes.</p>

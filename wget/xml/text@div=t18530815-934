                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and use fourteen acres of land at Langley Marsh, Buckinghamshire. I have lived there nearly five years—it is nearly three-quarters of a mile from Gerrard's-cross—I was at Gerrard's<lb></lb>cross on 10th June; it was about 10 o'clock in the morning when I got there—I went to the Bull about 11 o'clock, and drank some beer there, with a person named George—I stopped an hour or an hour and a half, and left between 12 and 1 o'clock, leaving him there—we had eight pints of beer between three or four of us; George took part of it—I then wanted to go home—I knew what I was about when I left, and I went straight down the road towards home—the Bull is about a mile from the defendant's house, which is next door to a public-house called the French Horn—as I came along the road, I picked up a small cask, with the name of "Taylor, Uxbridge," on it—knowing the Taylor's, I took it into the French Horn, which was about 100 yards, and left it there, with directions about it—I saw a great many people there, one of whom was a man whose name I have since ascertained to be Wilson—I had one pint of beer at the French Horn, of which Wilson took part—(<hi rend="italic">Wilson was here brought into the Court</hi>)—that is the man—I was about half an hour in the French Horn, or not quite so long, and then came out and pursued my walk home—there is a wall there which encloses the defendant's garden; that is on the side of his shop, farthest away from the French Horn—when I got opposite the wall, the defendant came over the wall, knocked me down, and I fell on my shoulder; be then said, "I told you how I would serve you," and walked away—no words had passed first—he struck me on my nose and my eye; ray nose bled very much—I got up, followed him into his shop, and asked him what he had done it for; he said he had done it, and he would do it again—his wife then pulled him indoors, and shut the door—I then went to the French Horn, and they washed the blood off; and then I walked home by myself, and saw my wife—I told her what had happened, and she washed my face again; it was bleeding then—about 4 o'clock that day I went to Mr. Gaskill, the Magistrate, who lives three-quarters of a mile off—I saw somebody there—I was told I had better come to-morrow—I then went home, and went the same day to Uxbridge, to the doctor's; that is four miles—my wife drove me in a cart—I saw the doctor, Mr. M'Namara, and then went home again—I went the same night to the lawyer's, Mr. Woodbridge, the clerk of the County Court, and applied for a summons—it was either the night I went to Mr. M'Namara's or the next day—I had had a difference with the defendant a long time ago, about a cow, and we were not on good terms When this happened.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Uxbridge. On 10th June, about 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening, Mr. Grove came to my house, with a wound on the bridge of his nose and his right eyebrow—the eyelids were much swollen, and closed—he had blood on him, from his nose and eyes—his eye was getting black—he also complained of his shoulder—I should say that the injuries could not have been caused by a fall; it is very improbable—a severe blow with a fist would account for the injury; it was an injury that a severe blow might have caused—there must have been a rupture of the vessels of the nose, and it must have been a very severe blow—his losing a quantity of blood would make him very weak, and unable to support himself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So ordinary that you did not order a plaister? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We do not order plaisters for blows; there was no letting of blood from a wound—copious bleeding from the nose sometimes happens from drinking, and is a very safe thing to save people from apoplexy.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Haddenham, in Buckinghamshire, thirty-one miles from Uxbridge. Uxbridge is four or four and a quarter miles from Gerrard's-cross—I, and my wife, and James Lee, came up to the grass country, to assist in the hay making—Wilson was residing in the same place—on 10th June I was at Gerrard's-cross—I was in the taproom with my wife, Wilson, and some others—I do not know what time it was, but it was not night—I had some drink, and was eating some victuals—I saw Grove there; he had some beer in the taproom, two pints—I saw him pay his reckoning, and after that be went out of doors—I next saw him opposite the window; the taproom window looks into the road—I and my party remained in the room the whole time he was absent—John Wilson was in the taproom when Grove went out—a man named William Rose was sitting next to the fireplace, and Wilson was next to him—he did not go out at all during the time that Grove was absent—when Grove went away Small got up, and said, "Let us pay our reckoning while the house is still"—there had been a noise before—Wilson was in the room at that time, and paid his reckoning—he threw down half a crown—I cannot say whether he sat down again after that, or whether Mr. Grove came back bleeding or not—I beard some one say Grove was outside, bleeding; upon that being said, Wilson jumped up, and looked over my wife's shoulder, out of the window—at that time Grove was in sight of the window, bleeding—after Wilson had looked through the window, he went out of doors; and when he was outside the door, he said, "Where is the b——r that hit him; if he wants to fight a man, let him come and fight me"—I did not hear Wilson say anything at that time about Wingrove having struck him—Grove was very intoxicated.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Haddenham, in Buckinghamshire. I came up with the other witnesses to the grass country in June—I was at Gerrard's Cross at the French Horn on 10th June—Wilson was then with our party—he is my own first cousin—I saw Grove there—he took a share of a pint of beer—I should not like to say he was sober, and I should not on my oath say he was drunk—I saw him go out of the house—he was talking very loud before he went out—when he went out I asked our company if they were willing to settle the reckoning while the house was quiet—that was done—Wilson was in the house at that time—he threw half a crown down on the table to pay his reckoning—shortly after paying the reckoning, not five minutes after, I saw Grove come up to the taproom window, bleeding—Wilson was then in the house—Wilson was not perfectly sober—in the service I have been in, the army, if we see a man take a glass of anything to drink, we are not allowed to say that be is sober—Wilson bad certainly been drinking; he <hi rend="italic">was fresh</hi>—I did not hear him say anything when Grove came up to the window in that way—I did not see hint go out of the room—I saw nothing—I cannot say whether he went out or not—I did net go outside—I went out while the woman was washing Grove, and so did Wilson—I beard Wilson say it was a scandalous action to use a man as he appeared to have been used, and he said if he was any man he was to come out, and he would fight him—I do not know that he said that to anybody in particular—there were some words between one of the carters and the ostler's son—as far as I could see they were accusing the ostler's son of it—I heard Wilson say that if he had seen it he would have knocked the man down if he was as big at a horse—I did not bear him say that if he lad seen Wingrove hit him, he would have knocked him down—I did net hear any name mentioned—I believe I was the first who said so, I said that if I bad seen any man serve him in that way, I would take his part, be he who he would, and immediately Wilson said, "If I had seen it I would have knocked the man down if he had been as big as a bullock or a horse," or some such words.</p>

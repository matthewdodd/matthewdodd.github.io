            . I am clerk in the house of Cox, Merle, and Co. gold and silver refiners, Little Britain. On Friday the 28th of February last, the prisoner brought these pieces of gold to me, and offered them for sale; seeing it was unmanufactured gold I asked him if they were his own; he said he found it in Red Lion-street, Clerkenwell; I told him I was sure it was the property of some workmen, I should make enquiries, and by that means I should find the owner; I said I should go to Goldsmith's Hall, and make enquiries if he would come the next day they would be glad to reward him, he said he would come the next day; he did not come, he was brought there; I have no doubt in the world about the prisoner's person, nor never had; he told me that he lived at No. 33, Goswell-street, he gave me the name of Watson.</p>

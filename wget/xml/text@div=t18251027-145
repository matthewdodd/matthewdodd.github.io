About ten o'clock, on the 20th of October, I was in the kitchen - I had a full view of the street - I saw two persons go to the corner of the steps at the shop-door - I presently saw one of them with a piece of flannel under his arm - I went up stairs, and they were out of sight; but judging they had gone down King's-row towards London I gave chase, and overtook the prisoner with the flannel under his arm - I called Stop thief! and a man stopped him - he then dropped it - I cannot swear that he is one of the persons I saw about the shop door, but I believe him to be one of them.</p>

            . I live at Hackney. I was going by Mr. Kettlewell's shop, and saw a man in a blue jacket take the flannel out of the rail on the steps - there was no one with him - the prisoner was about the middle of King's-road, about a dozen yards from the shop - he beckoned the other man twice, and said "Come on:" the man in the blue jacket gave the flannel to the prisoner, and they both ran up King's-road.</p>

               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother, at 34, King Street, Clerkenwell, as Davenes Brothers, wholesale provision merchants, and the prisoner was for 18 months or two years employed at a weekly salary as salesman—we take stock on Wednesdays and Saturdays—he takes goods out, and calls them off to the man who enters them as they are put into the van—he is provided with a delivery book, and takes the receipt of the customer on the counterfoil—this counterfoil, 3381, is written in pencil, "3rd June, 1879, S. Hoskins, 34 A 61 80," and "Hoskins" across the counter<lb></lb>foil—I have the book in which the entry is made—he took four tubs on that day—I did not check that with him personally—I compared the stock the following day—when we took stock the stock was right—on the same day my collector went to Mr. Hoskins, and this charge was made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first heard of this through the collector sending a telegram on 3rd July—Hoskins paid 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 27th June, and it is entered in this ledger—the collector is not here—in the ordinary course this butter which Hoskins is stated to have received on 3rd June would be included in the account of the 19th—he paid on 4th July, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 19th, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 25th, 1ft on 5th September there is entered for the first time as not paid by Hawkins, after this amount had been charged, for goods sold on 5th September, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it is not yet due—in this stock book there is an entry on 3rd June of tubs returned—it is entered in our books on 3rd June, he was taken in charge on 3rd July, this is the only charge upon which he has been committed—two other charges were made against him and dismissed—we had a solicitor in the case in July—the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is entered in the ledger in the proper way, but when the bill was delivered Mr. Hoskins said he had not received the butter—I do not keep my own books—there are some balances in pencil in the books, the return book is all in pencil—ours is a very large business—the prisoner has sold some 26,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods for us in the last nine months—he is a servant, and we pay him so much a week—he is responsible for all debts, and receives so much for what he sells—this (produced) is a statement of the accounts between us.</p>

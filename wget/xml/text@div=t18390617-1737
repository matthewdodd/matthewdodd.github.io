                  </hi>. I live at Wells House, Acton. I saw my cow safe in the paddock, near the house, at nine o'clock on Thursday evening, the 6th of June—between five and eight o'clock that evening I saw the prisoner loitering about the common—I believe it was him—he was within thirty yards of the cow—it was an Alderney cow, worth full 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I missed it on the morning of the 7th of June—I saw it at Paddington sta<lb></lb>tion-house, in custody of the officer, about eleven o'clock—it was my cow.</p>

At three o'clock in the morning of the 7th of June I was at Wells farm, in the neighbour<lb></lb>hood of Mr. Church, and saw the prisoner go by with a cow—I thought it looked like Mr. Church's cow, and followed him—I jumped out of my cart in Bayswater, and gave him into custody for stealing the cow—he never spoke a word to me—I left the cow with the policeman, who asked him</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. About a quarter past four o'clock in the morning of the 7th of June, in consequence of what Biggs told me, I took the prisoner in charge, and asked where he brought the cow from—he said, from Acton Common, and was going to take it to the Red Lion at Paddington—I said, "Direct to the Red Lion?"—he said, "No, I am to meet a man on the road, who told me to drive it there"—I said, "Where does he live? what is his name?"—he said he did not know—I said, "Did you sleep at Acton last night?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "In a house?"—he said, "No, in a shed, because I have no money to pay for a lodging;" but at the station-house I found on him a purse containing a half-crown and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and also a rope or cord.</p>

               <p>HANNAH MURPHY. I am the wife of James Murphy. On the night of the 4th of January I went out for about half an hour; the prisoner lodged in the same house with me on <placeName id="t18300114-216-crimeloc1155">Saffron-hill</placeName>

               <p>MR. LEE. Q. Are you married? A. Yes; I sometimes have my doors locked; I never authorized her to pawn any thing, nor suspected her.</p>
               <p>GEORGE MOXON. I am a pawnbroker; I have a pair of trousers, a silk handkerchief, seven yards of cotton, a gown, a pair of shoes, and a waistcoat, pawned on the 5th of January; the cotton, handkerchief, and trousers, by the prisoner, two in the prosecutor's name, and one in the name of Donnahue.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Do you know the prisoner? A. No; she pawned some of these at a quarter before eight o'clock on the 5th of January; she was in the shop five minutes - there were other persons there; I can swear she is the same woman.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She brought up two Police-men, and one of them asked if she suspected this woman; she said she is the stoutest woman I can find - I took them into my bed-room, and overhauled every thing; I then went with them to this pawnbroker's, and he said I pawned them- "Look back to your conscience (says I) and do not say that I ever was in your place."</p>

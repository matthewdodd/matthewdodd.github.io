I am assistant accountant and cashier to the Metro<lb></lb>politan Board of Works—I was in the same office with the prisoner, and was under his direction—he was the chief accountant—there were other gentlemen in the same office—my duties were to keep accounts of what took place—the minutes of the Board were brought into the accountiot's office weekly; every resolution of the Board—a copy of those resolutions was kept by the prisoner—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one volume of them, which I took out of the accountant's book-case, and was used by the prisoner up to the time of his apprehension—his bankers' pass-books were given to me—they are here—one is of the Bank of London—there are two different accounts with the Union Bank, one with the National Bank, and one with the Consolidated Bank—all these accounts were opened in the prisoner's own name, and all are headed in the same way—thus, "Bank of London, in account with Edward Hughes, Esq.;" "Union Bank of London, Charing Cross Branch, in account with Mr. Edward Hughes"—the first account of the Bank of London commenced on 14th May, 1864, up to May, 1866, the date of the prisoner's appointment being April, 1864—the Board at that time had an account at the main office of the Bank of London, in the City—afterwards, when the Bank of London closed their accounts, it was transferred to the London and Westminster—the account at the Union Bank was opened on 25th July, 1864, and continued open till March 6th, 1868—the second Union Bank account commenced on December 23rd, 1867, and con<lb></lb>tinued till the time of this investigation—the Consolidated Bank account opened on January 1st, 1868, and continued open until this investigation—from March 5th, 1868, the National, the Union, and the Consolidated accounts were running—I believe that was not known to the Board, and I never heard it spoken of by the prisoner—I had nothing to do with the prisoner's cash matters—a sum of money was given him in the first instance, out of which he had to pay different sums, and that was settled fortnightly, so that he always had a sum to draw upon.</p>

SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This counterfoil book does not relate to the Union Bank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; to the Bank of London—it has no relation to these two cheques—all the counterfoils relating to the Metro<lb></lb>politan Board of Works are here—I have investigated accurately—I do not say that there are not some cheques here which relate to the prisoner's private matters—those relating to his private matters have not been destroyed, they were cut out—this book did not go into the biscuit box, it was outside it, but inside the other box, which was an ordinary deal box, used by Mr. Hughes for his own purposes—he left it there when he left—it was not my idea to open it—I found some counterfoils were missing, and applied to the solicitor, and he took steps about the latter end of December—it was done while we were investigating the accounts—I am not sure whether it was before he was arrested—I do not know that the account at the Union Bank was opened with the express sanction of Sir John Thwaites—I do not know that to be untrue—I knew there was an account at the Bank of London, but I did not know that there was one at the Union Bank at the same time—it was absolutely essential to him to have, one banking account to carry on his duties—the Bank of London stopped in May, 1866, but the prisoner lost no money; the Consolidated Bank paid him the money, and he drew four cheques for it, 418<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether—one of those is for</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have not you found in those bankers' books, with the exception, in round numbers, of 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., two cheques not traced, every farthing accounted for which he has received from the Board of Works? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—this is not his writing at all—I have his writing on the backs of the cheques—every fathing he received is not accounted for in these books with the exception of the 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—here is 261<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 13th May, 1864, and 245<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 27th May, 1864—I believe that is all—these two cheques have not been made the subject of a criminal charge against him—with the exception of these two cheques I believe every sum of money is accounted for in his bankers' pass-books, which he has received from the Board of Works—I do not expect to be appointed accountant, they have already appointed one—those two cheques were cashed the day afterwards, over the counter, on the 14th, and the other on the 28th—they are the Board cheques, payable to Mr. Hughes—cheques were drawn to his name by the Board, and in that way the money came into his hands rightly and lawfully—I do not know under what circumstances these two cheques were paid over the counter, that was scarcely a month after his appointment—this 665<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was not on deposit during Mr. Hatton's acting as accountant, it was handed over to Mr. Hughes as a satisfaction of the claim against Mr. Hatton, and deposited by Mr. Hughes in the name of Sir John Thwaites, then Mr. Thwaites, and himself—it was drawn out of the Bank of London, and paid into the Union Bank—Sir John Thwaites knew of one account—I don't know whether Sir John Thwaites was aware that this money was going into the Union Bank, and I never knew that it was drawn out—I do not know how it happened that it was paid into the Union Bank on August 5th, 1865—by the Union Bank pass-books he drew out, "Self; 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he paid that into the new account, and balanced up the old one—the new and the old accounts were concurrent for a time—I do not know how that was 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid into the National Bank, I made a mistake—he—the secured his balance from the Bank of London, and paid it into the Union Bank—he suggests by this report that the bank should furnish him with cheques to the amount of 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, that would complete the sum of 694<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—these four small cheques, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., make altogether 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Those cheques were never drawn? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were never asked for; I can swear that, because I was in the habit of preparing the list of cheques that were required, under his direction—they never were drawn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you able to say that the prisoner's attention was never called to that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It came on in the ordinary way with the printed minutes—there was nothing standing over in reference to this cheque for 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186904050030"></xptr>
               <p>whole of it was agreed—the accounts of the Board were audited each year by the government auditor, but the prisoner's pass-books were not audited—it was never ascertained, I believe, by anybody, what balance he had in hand; but I am only speaking of my own knowledge—I do not know whether I should have known if any examination of his balance had been made—we had three rooms, and I was in one of them—I do not know that it has been complained of that no audit was made—I know of no such audit—besides myself, no outsider or professional accountant was employed to examine the accounts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know of instances in which Mr. Hughes has advanced money on behalf of the Board, which has been paid by him out of funds which have not been placed in his possession by the Board, I will give you a, sum, a cheque for 429<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on 28th May, 1864? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember such an amount—yes, here it is; that sum consists of ten cheques—they all bear the same date—I do not know whether 228<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd had been previously paid by Mr. Hughes—I have a cheque for 222<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that may have been given to pay 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., disbursed on 4th April, and 97<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on 1st May; I do not know—Mr. Broome is here, he is still in the service of the Board of Works—I do not know that these two cheques were handed to Mr. Broome to pay wages; but they are for wages—it says, "Pay E. Hughes, wages."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked about the audit, is there a finance committee part of the Board? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they recommend the cheques to be paid by the prisoner; they examine the vouchers, and order payment—they examined the vouchers, and recouped the prisoner what he had paid every fortnight—besides that, there was an audit of the books kept by me, showing the cheques paid out and the disbursements—the 4291<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. one single cheque—those two sums are money belonging to the Board—the first money the prisoner paid into this account was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 1st January—he commenced drawing out on the 18th May, and on the 19th and 21st—this 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was, I believe, for a Brighton Railway season ticket—122<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid out from the Bank of London, for his own purposes, before he paid in a single farthing of his own money—the first item at the Union Bank of London is 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on July 25th, 1864—that is a transfer from the Bank of London pf 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these two cheques purport, upon the face of them, to be paid by the Board for wages—I find Hughes' endrose<lb></lb>ment on them—they are not entered in the pass-books—I do not know whether Mr. Broome cashed them for wages—if Mr. Broome actually received the money and paid the wages, that would not relieve the prisoner, as he would be credited with the amount of wages paid—he is not debited in the bankers' books—when I went into my own books, I should find the two sums debited against the prisoner, and wages credited against them—they are set against so much wages paid by the prisoner, and relieve the pass-books to that amount—taking them as cheques paid to the prisoner, and the amount paid in wages, I still find the total amount in my books 2005<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as a deficiency.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was it that the prisoner was always kept amply in funds, all these sums were for fractional amounts, therefore there were the exact amount of vouchers before the finance committee? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the finance committee orders the payment of the sums, and a cheque was drawn for the exact amount—in the first instance he recommended that 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should be paid to him to draw upon, and subsequently that was increased very largely</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186904050031"></xptr>
               <p>as the works of the Board increased—this audit showed the exact state of the account every year—the only thing they failed to do was to test the amount that ought to have been in the prisoner's hands—these cheques ought not to have been passed to the accounts they were passed to.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she bridled or saddled at that time - A. She had an altar and a bridle on, and a great coat and a bag strapped on her back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing - A. He asked me to give him the coat and the bag which was on the mare.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who they belonged to - A. He called them his; I gave him the coat, he put it on; I gave the bag to the watchman, and desired him to take care of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure the mare was that which you lost - A. Yes; I took possession of the mare immediately; and the prisoner I sent to the watchhouse. The mare was a black mare, with white legs and white face.</p>

            . Q. I believe you are watchman to lord Holland - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a field near Holland Park that was in possession of Mr. Lomas - A. Yes. On the evening of the 19th of this month I was on duty, it is a regular rule to fire a piece off at eleven o'clock; I got there a few minutes before the time; when I got out of Holland house, I heard something crushing like wood a breaking; I fired the piece off at eleven o'clock as usual; I went nearer and nearer to where I heard the noise, to the gate that leads out of Mr. Lomas's field; I was on the other side, I heard a person or persons talking to a horse or mare; there was an hedge and a gate to it that leads to Mr. Lomas's field, I found that gate unlocked; I went on forward, where I knew there was another gate, that gate I locked on the 19th of this month, there I found the lock as I put it on; there was another gate that leads into the Hammersmith or Bath road, that gate I saw shut, I live just at the point of it. I went into my own yard, I had not been there a few minutes before I heard the chain of this gate unloosed; I heard a horse coming along, I did not see it; I shut my own gate and rather hid myself behind the paling, I expected the horse would be brought through the gate by my house; instead of that it turned off to Kensington, I expected that gate to be locked; I heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260007"></xptr>the gate shut after the horse went through; then I went after it as quick as possibly I could do, and when I met the gentleman with the horse it had an halter and a bridle on, and a coat and bag strapped on his back.</p>
               <p>Q. At last you found the person with the horse - A. Yes, about twenty or thirty yards off the gate that leads into the Hammersmith road.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a lane that led from the place where you found the gate open - A. Yes; I went up to him, I asked him where he was going that way, he said he had lost his way, he wanted to go to Uxbridge; he made a stop, I asked him whose horse he had got there, he said it was his own; I told him I thought it was Mr. Lomas's, therefore I could not let him go until I knew whether it was Mr. Lomas's or not. The gentleman said he was very agreeable to go with me to Mr. Lomas, and he led the horse or mare down the road very quietly. I hollaoed out to the watchman, I could not make him hear; I hollaoed out again as hard as I could, two men came to me; I told them what I thought. One of the men took the mare out of the gentleman's hands, and I took hold of the gentleman by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who it was took hold of the mare - A. No; two men came up, I could not see which of them it was, the person led the mare; I had hold of the man and followed; the man and the mare were taken to Mr. Lomas. I had the mare in sight all the time before we came to Mr. Lomas's; in Kensington-street we met the watchman, I told him, he went with us to Mr. Lomas's.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man that had the mare when you first saw her - A. This

               <p>Q. Had you known the mare before - A. Yes; I saw her on the evening before go into the field.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Monday June the 19th, 1809, I was coming from Kensington road to Uxbridge road, in the way to Camden Town about ten o'clock; in the common path for travellers, and at the time people were passing and repassing, I met with a horse with an haltar on his head, and the other end entangled about his legs; I foolishly took the halter from under his feet, and led him towards the houses at Kensington, some man behind me told me to stop, I did, and gave him the horse without a word. It was in a common road, and many people were passing at the time; I had no thought of stealing the horse. I am a native of Plymouth; the time I have been here is so short, I have no friends in this part of the county.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman—I have been cook on board the ship, <hi rend="italic">Shantung</hi>, for the last three years—she is a British ship—in August last we were on our voyage from China to London—we arrived in St. Katherine's Dock on 18th September—the prisoner was the master of that ship—there was an ordinary seaman on board of the name of John Riley—he died on board on 12th September—at that time the ship was between the Western Islands and the Land's End—Riley complained of being ill at that time, and I believe he was ill—he had been ill for a twelvemonth before, Off and on—I was a shipmate with him on board for two years and three months—I was with him all the time he was on board—he shipped in China—at the latter part of August, I remember some punishment being inflicted upon him—I cannot exactly say the date—the ship was then between the Western Islands and St Helena—Riley complained of being ill, and was lying down in his bed—the captain sent the chief-mate for him—Riley told the chief-mate that he could not go aft, that he could not work—I heard the mate say to him, "Get up, and come on deck"—the mate went aft—I did not hear what he said to the captain—the mate was sent to him a second time, and Riley then went aft to the captain—the mate went down into the cabin, and the captain asked Riley what was the matter with him—the captain was standing on the poop, and Riley was on the main-deck—Riley said he was not well—the captain said be would make him well if he would not go to work, and told him to come up on the poop, and during the time that he was ascending the poop, the captain struck him with a rope several times—it was a piece of lanyard rope, between two and a half and three inches in circumference, and about four and a half feet long—Riley went on to the poop, and the captain beat him for several minutes, still asking him would be go to work—Riley still replied that he was not well, that he was not able to work—the captain said he would beat him till he would work, and daring the time the captain was beating him, Riley fell down on the poop out <hi rend="italic">sang</hi>, out for mercy, while the captain was beating him—the captain said be would have no mercy on him, that he would make him work or have his life; so the man gave in, and he said he would go to work—the captain ordered the steward to give him some bath-brick and some oil to clean the brass-work with—while the captain was beating him with the rope he put two knots in it, and the man was down at the time—all this took place on the poop—it was after he had beaten him with the knotted rope that Riley cried out for mercy—the steward gave him some oil and brick, and be used it in cleaning the ship's bell and several other little things that afternoon-be seemed very slow—he did not complain much that afternoon to any of us—he never moved smartly at any time; I did not particularly observe how he moved on this occasion—he continued working at the brass-work the remainder of that day—I saw him next day at work—he was put to tarring by order of the captain—the carpenter was keeping the captain's watch at the time—he was tarring the fore and aft stays—he continued doing that one day—he went below in the afternoon and began to complain about the beating he had got from the captain—he seemed if anything to be worse than he was the day before—he did nothing the next day—he came on deck at 8 o'clock in the morning, but he was not able to work—he did not try—I saw him stripped that afternoon, and his body was black and blue from head to foot—his hands and knuckles were all cut, both his right</p>

               <p>and left hand, and bleeding—he asked me if I would wash him, but I did not, another man did it—he went to his birth that afternoon, and was confined to his berth, not exactly till he died—he took to his bed that afternoon, and the next morning part of the crew found out that he had been taking their sugar, and they proposed to turn him out of the forecastle, and they did so—he was agreeable to it, he said, very well, he would go on deck if they wished, and he took his chest on deck and all his clothes and effects, and went and slept under the mocker top-gallant forecastle for two nights after this—that is a place that is only sheltered from the weather at the top—it is close to the bows—the after-part is exposed to the air—he had his bed there and all his effects on deck—he remained there two days—it was fine weather—after that the captain sent for him and put him into his own cabin—he remained there that afternoon, and the next morning he came forward again into the forecastle, into his own berth—the captain did not lend him anything, or show him any attention during this time that I know of—the steward was forward to him several times, asking him if he wanted anything to eat or drink; any arrowroot or rice, or anything of that sort—he did not come on deck again—three of us brought him on deck once after that; we were obliged to lift him up, he could not get up by himself—we kid him on deck—it was a fine warm afternoon—he stunk so that we could not stud it in the forecastle, and we brought him on deck thinking that would take the smell off him—he remained on the deck that afternoon till it became cool, and then we took him down below again, and he remained below after that—we brought him up dead next time—it was between fifteen and twenty days from the time he got the beating till he died—about five or six days previous to his death he sent for the captain—the captain went to him, and he asked the captain if he would ever forgive himself for not putting him ashore at St. Helena as he wished—the captain replied that he had never asked him to go ashore at St. Helena—Riley said he did; and he said, "Captain Baldry, you have given me a beating, and that has killed me; you are my murderer"—the captain said, "You deserved it"—Riley made no reply to that—in about two minutes he spoke again, and asked the captain if he could make a will out—the captain said, "Pooh, nonsense, what do you want with a will?" and he smiled—he asked the captain if he could give him a few sweet biscuits that he bad on board, and some preserved ginger—the captain said that he had not got any; that all the sweet biscuits he had the rats had eaten, and all he bad was for his own child; but it appears that that afternoon he did send him a few biscuits, at least the steward took some forward to him—he told him he might have some arrowroot, or sago rice, and the steward gave him some—he also sent him some brandy and water, am an old jacket, and a pair of drawers, as he complained of belief cold in the feet—during the latter part of his life he was not able to eat at all—he would drink any amount of water—he suffered from diarrhoea, or something that appeared to be similar to that—he was buried on the 13th low—I assisted in putting him overboard.</p>

SERJEANT BALL AN TINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any dysentery on board the vessel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there were two men very bad with it—I could not say that it was that that Riley died of—for two or three days at a stretch he would eat and drink, and it would go through him as fast as he ate and drank it—that was the last few days of his death—(at other times his bowels would not net at all)—I believe that is one of the symptoms of dysentery—he did not complain of pain, only in the feet—he wanted warm</p>

               <p>water the last few days of his life—I should say it was about thirteen days before Ins death that he was turned out of the forecastle to sleep on deck—he remained out for two nights—there is an expression on board ship called being "moonblind"—I do not know what it is—Riley complained of being moonblind, but that was three months before this—I do not know that the steward complained of his stealing everything he could lay his fingers on—he did not do so to me—the forecastle was the proper place for him to sleep in—it was not blowing hard at the time he was turned out, it was fine weather—we were then between St. Thomas's island and the Land's End—I think it was Simmonds who complained of his stealing—I cannot say that all the men insisted on his going on deck, most of them did—they did not insist—he said if they did not like him he would go on deck—it was not after he had been on deck that his victuals passed through him as I have described; not till after the captain had taken him into his cabin, and we had taken him back into the forecastle again, two or three days before his death—he had never been turned out of the forecastle before for being so dirty—he was a dirty man, taking all in all, all through toe voyage—he had very dirty habits with him—he would not wash himself—he washed himself about once a fortnight, and the like of that—I should say he was a drunkard—I have seen him several times come on board intoxicated—I never called him a skulker—sometimes we drew the conclu<lb></lb>sion that he was a skulker, and sometimes we said the opposite—sometimes we thought he was skulking, and sometimes that he really had something the matter with him—in China I complained to the captain that he was a skulker, and not doing his work—that was eighteen months previous to his death—the first time I spoke to the captain about him, I said, "He com<lb></lb>plains of being ill, and wants to see a doctor; but there is no more the matter with him than there is with me"—he was not then as apparently ill at he was latterly—he said he was ill—for the last few months he was very much inclined to avoid work if he could—not so much formerly as he was for the last four months—I cannot say that he always avoided his work if be could—sometimes he would work for a month or six weeks, and never complain; at other times he would complain—I never saw him put his fingers down his throat to make it appear that he was sick—I never told the captain so—I only spoke to the captain once about him—I don't know that he has bought drink with the boots and things that the captain has given him—on one occasion he had a pair of shoes—they were too small for him—that was in China, eighteen or nineteen months previous to his death, and he traded those boots away for spirits with one of the China boats coming alongside; that is all I know about his trading his clothes away for liquor—he has gone on shore several times, and come hack without his jacket or boots; but I never saw him sell them—his clothes were gone and he had a good deal of liquor in his body—the ship came up the river to St Katherine's dock—I came ashore on thel 9th—the crew consisted of nine, including myself—I cannot say whether myself and two others are all the crew remaining in this country at present—one man went to the hospital—I cannot say when a complaint was first made against the captain; the first time I made a complaint was at the shipping office, on 26th or 27th—I did not make a complaint—three other men had made a complaint before me—Peter McEvoy, and Samuel Johnson were two of them, they are not here; and Thomas Simmonds, and William Fensom, they are here—the captain never refused to pay our wages that I know of—we took out out a summons to compel him to pay, but he never refused—he,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186110210056"></xptr>
               <p>said he was quite willing to pay if his owners were agreeable to advance the money—we had to take out the summons against him; there had been a complaint before that—we took out the summons on the Friday, and the case did not come on till the ensuing Monday, and during those three days, it appears that some of the men stated the case at the Sailors' Home, and they forwarded a complaint to the Seamen's registry, and they communi<lb></lb>cated it to the Board of Trade—I was not with them at that time—the complaint was not made after the summons—I am quite sure that it was not so much as five weeks after the beating that the deceased died—I am sure it was not before the 14th August that the beating occurred—there was only one mate from St. Helena—I have seen him here to-day—I saw him rope's-end the deceased before his death; I should say it was five or six weeks previous to his death, I cannot say exactly—I did not see him rope's-end him after the captain had done so—I cannot swear that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BEASLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> About what time did you sail from China? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can not say exactly—the last place at which the deceased went ashore was Batavia; I went with him—he did not go ashore at St. Helena—St Helena was the next place after Batavia that we put in at—we were about four months going from Batavia to St. Helena, and from St. Helena till when the beating took place, was about thirty-five or forty days—that was the last beating the man got on board the ship—he was ashore at Batavia, and saw a doctor there, that was the last place—I did not hear him ask to go ashore at St Helena; I heard him talk about it in the forecastle—he had been on board the ship two years and three months and some odd days under the same captain—we arrived at St Katharine's dock on the Wednesday—I saw the captain on the Friday following, and he told me if it was possible he would pay us off on Saturday—he left 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on board the ship for me till we were paid off; I went and received that—I saw the chief mate and the captain's wife, and asked them if they could tell me what time I should get paid off—it was the Friday week after we arrived in London that the summons was taken out—I had spoken to the captain about it before—he knew we were going to take out a summons, he advised us to do it—I said to him, "It is a strange thing you cannot settle with us now"—and he said, "I cannot help it; if you like to sue me for your wages, do so; but go to the owner"—I said, "I engaged under you, and I look to you for my wages"—he. said, "Well, I cannot help it, you had better sue me, and that will bring things to a conclusion very shortly"—there was no dispute between us as to what was due to me—he made a alight mistake of six days, that was nothing to speak of, and he said he would make it all right—I was paid for those six days—I was paid the whole amount—I first mentioned about the beating at the Sailors' Home.</p>

               <p>and the captain took up that and struck him with it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) is some of it—he commenced striking him with that rope—Riley sung out for mercy—the captain said, "I will give you no mercy; I will either have you at work, or I will have your life"—was then standing at the wheel—one of the strands has been taken from this rope—that was done on board the ship—put it in my bunk, and have brought it here to-day—the captain struck him more than once—had to stay two hours at the wheel, and as soon as the captain had done flogging him, the captain himself struck four bells, and I was relieved from the wheel—was about ten yards from the captain at the time he was beating the man—saw Riley' shack when he was stripped—he had stripes right across his shoulders on both sides, and right in the middle of his back—saw him after he was dead, and I saw him before—we washed him before he died, when he was very ill, and put some clean clothes on him—his back was blue then—after he had been beaten on this day he went to his work, and worked I suppose for about two hours—he was not able to do any work after that—he was bid from the time he joined the snip, with dysentery—joined in Batavia—he was ill all the time I was in the ship, which was five months—shortly before his death, I heard him call the captain to him—was in the fore-castle the time the captain came down—he asked the captain to make him out a will for him—the captain told him no, and as he was going up the forecastle-ladder he said to him, "Pooh! what do you want with a will made out?"—Riley said, "Captain Baldry, you are the cause of my death," and the captain went; he said he would soon get well, he would soon get over it—this is a piece of the rope the captain used—do not know who took the strand out—t was a piece about four feet long.</p>

               <p>captain said, "Pooh, nonsense, I will give you all the medicine you require when I get you to sea"—Riley had been poorly a long time, and he looked very ill then; as far as my judgment went he appeared unwell—he was not allowed to go ashore—I remember something taking place between him and the captain after leaving St. Helena on the way home, somewhere at the latter end of August—the chief officer came down into the cabin and told the captain that the man was unfit for work—I was in the cabin—told the captain said, "Oh, nonsense, pooh! give him a rope's-ending and he will work; it is only an old dodge of his, he will work"—the chief officer said, "No, I cannot rope's-end him, I shall get into trouble if I do when I get home"—the captain said, "Then send him aft to to me"—with that the chief officer went on deck, and the captain went up a minute, or half a minute after him—I went on deck directly after the captain, and I saw Riley coming aft, as I was going forward to the galley on the port side of the deck, and as he went up the ladder, I saw the captain strike him with the rope three or four times, with a piece of the running gear of the main-royal, and after he got up on the poop, he picked up another piece of rope abort two and a half inches—this is the rope; but that is not the rope he struck him with when he was coming up the ladder; this is part of the royal clew<lb></lb>lines—I was standing by the galley at the time, with the remainder of the ship's company, for I should say four minutes, while the captain was beating him, and he crying out for mercy—he cried out a great many times—I then went aft, he was still beating him, when I went on the poop; and he was crying out for mercy, would no one come and save him from being murdered—the captain said, "There is no mercy for you; I will either have your work, or I will have your life"—he was standing at this time—I saw him down on the deck afterwards, after the captain had put the over-hand knob in the rope—I saw the captain put those knots in the rope—I went to the companion and stood looking at him a second or two, and then I went down into the cabin, and when I came up he was still beating him; he was still standing up then—when I got forwards to the galley I saw him down on the deck, and the captain still beating him—I did not see him fall; I then came aft again—I left him lying on the deck, and the captain still beating him—then I believe Riley said he would give in and clean the brass-work—I did not hear him say so—the captain sent me for the bath-brick and oil for Riley to clean it, and when I got on deck again, Riley was sitting on one of the guns on the poop—I did not give it him, I put it on the hen-coop, and he went to work with it, cleaning the brass-work—I did not take much notice of the state in which he was at that time; he appeared to be very ill and very sore about his bones, which he must have been I know from the severe beating he got from the captain—I saw him cleaning the brass-work afterwards, but I did not see him again that day-how long he was cleaning the brass-work I do not know—I do not know whether it was that day or the next day that I saw him lying forward the windlass—I believe he was set to tarring—I saw him next day with the w tar-pot or something in his hand, but what he was going to do with it I do not know—I did not see him do any work after that tarring; I did not see him again for some days—the first time I saw him afterwards was in the captain's cabin—the captain ordered me to clear a berth out for him, and said he would take him down into the cabin—I did so—he told me to go and fetch his things aft—I did not—they were brought aft by some one; whether it was the chief officer or not I cannot say—he slept in the cabin that night—next morning I went down into the cabin, and saw Riley</p>

               <p>coming out of my pantry with a sugar-basin in his band—asked him what he did in there—he said he was going to put a little sugar in his tea—i said, "Why not ask roe for it, and I would give it you"—then went and made it known to the captain, that he was taking the sugar out of the pantry, and the captain said, "We will turn him out of the cabin," and he was turned out there and then, or half au Hour after that—he was up and down three or four times in the night—was watching him; I had a berth next to him—do not think he slept all night—he went back to the forecastle—that was the first place I saw him in afterwards—think that was seven or eight days after this occurrence, or something like that; I could not say within a day or two—he was getting much worse—he asked for Moe brandy—'went aft and said to the captain, "Riley wants some brandy"—he said, "That is the only thing that will do him good"—said, "I do not think it is good for him, you had better give him a little wine"—he amid, "No, the d—d rascal shall not have wine"—gave him a little weak brandy and water by the captain's orders—saw the man a few hours before be died—saw his body at that time—t was black from the head to the foot—he was lying naked in his bed—they had been washing him, and had not covered his clothes over him, and I could not see three fingers' breadth bat was black and blue from the beating he had had with the rope—he was lying on his right side—after seeing the man's state, I felt very timid—i went aft and said to the captain, "If you have got a drop of wine, out of charity give it to that poor man, he won't lire twenty-four hours"—he said, "Pooh, nonsense! you have said that so many times before, steward"—he would give me no answer whether I should give him wine or not—went out, and in a few minutes he called me in' and told me to give him some wine, and I gave him a little—put my right arm round his neck, and held it up while I poured it down his throat—he had not strength to swallow it—some went down Jus throat, and some down the sides of his mouth—i aid then that the roan would not live till to-morrow morning—this was between 2 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon—between 6 and 7 o'clock, the chief officer came down and called the captain out of the after cabin, and said the man was dead—the captain came into the fore cabin and said, "What had we better do with him?" and the mate said, "We had better get him on deck, wrap him up in a tarpaulin and bury him to-morrow morning—after I came home I summoned the captain for wages—t was I who made the statement of this matter at the Sailors' Home—made a statement first to the owner—that was before the summons—he told us to meet him next morning at 10 o'clock, and he would take us to the Board of Trade, and make it come to light—he said we must go to the Sailors' Home first, and we went there.</p>

               <p>ordered me to give him everything that he required, hot not wine—he would not allow me to give him wine—I asked for wine, and he would not give it me—I believe the captain had him down into his own cabin in consequence of the state of his health—I don't know that he did—I was not present at the time he was tamed out of the forecastle; I heard of it—I do not know that he was turned out—I saw him lying on the deck—I should think that was a very improper place for him to be in, after the beating he had got; sometimes in warm weather it is more agreeable to sleep on deck than it is below—I do not know whether it is a proper place for him to have been in; I cannot say—the captain asked me to go and fetch his clothes into his cabin—I fancied he was not in very good healt hat the time—I had not seen his state at that time—I did not see his state until the day before he died—I did not notice anything the matter with him till the day he died—I did not see the bruises—I saw he was very poorly, and that he was getting worse every day—I made a complaint to the captain about his stealing the sugar—it was my duty to do so, when I saw him taking things—I said it would not be safe for the man to be going into the pantry and taking things out—the captain had him removed, not at my complaint—I lodged a complaint to the captain—what he was removed for I do not know—I think he was removed about half an hour after my complaint—how can I swear as to what cause the captain might have to turn him out—I do not know that that was the cause—I have complained of him over and over again; not for taking things out of the cabin, because he never was there—I have said I believed he was not so ill as he seemed—that was a long time before we came to St Helena—I had been on board the ship seven months and some days.</p>

                  </hi>. I was mate of this vessel—I joined at Batavia, and worked from thence home—I remember Riley quite well—he was always a dirty, slovenly fellow in his habits—he was not ashore at all while I was with the vessel—I had, at times, reason to complain of his not working—I remember the time when the captain rope's-ended him—up to that time I thought that there was something like skulking about him most part of the time—I was not present when the rope's-end was applied—I went forward to know the reason that the man was not up at his work on this occasion, and he told me he was sick—I told the captain what he told me—that was in the beginning of August—I cannot say the day—I do not recollect the date—I saw the man at his work after that, for about a week as nearly as I can recollect—I had occasion to find fault with him after that, and I certainly did strike him once or twice, with the rope's-end, my self. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON MARTI</hi>. <hi rend="italic">informed the witness that he was not compelled to give evidence which might criminate himself.</hi>) I have nothing more to say in that case—I saw the man stripped after the captain had rope's-ended him on this occasion—it was either the third or fourth day after—I cannot say which—there was a slight mark or two upon his back, but nothing more than a schoolboy might have after the chastisement of a master—I have had opportunities of observing the conduct of the captain to him—he was in no ways harsh to the man—he had him into his cabin because, he thought he would be better there than in the forecastle—that was after he was turned out of the fore<lb></lb>castle—he was lying on the deck—he did not remain in the captain's cabin</p>

               <p>because he could not keep his fingers to himself—he walked into the pantry and, I believe, helped himself to sugar, and bread and butter, and different things—that wan the charge that was made—while he was ill things were supplied to him by the captain, as far as my knowledge extends—I have no fault to find with the captain in any respect—he was a very mild man, too easy; in fact, he was lenient—he was not a hard or a harsh man, or an ill tempered man; far from it—his conduct was kind and considerate to the crew in general—I never knew him rope's-end any other man.</p>

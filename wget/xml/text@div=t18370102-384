                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Charles Cooper, a draper of Tottenham. On Tuesday the 20th of December, about two o'clock, I went with sixty yards of merino to the Rev. Mr. Wallis, at Edmonton, for the house-maid to examine—I left it as she was engaged—I went for it again between four and five o'clock, it was then getting darkish—it was rather a large parcel—I carried it on my shoulder, and got as far as wag-on house-lane, about halfway home, when I saw three or four boys stand<lb></lb>ing at the corner—I did not know them before—one of them pushed against me—I turned round, and he ran away—my bundle was still on my shoul<lb></lb>der I stood still—I walked on again, and was pushed against again, but not by more than one at a time—I looked round, and recognised the pri<lb></lb>soner Buckley—I am quite sure of him—I kept going on, and in a minute or so after I heard steps behind me, and before I could turn round, my</p>

               <p>parcel was thrown off my shoulder from behind—somebody <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> it off it was pulled from behind me, and the measure which at that time I hid in, my hand, was twisted from me—I turned quickly round, and placed my foot on the parcel, which was on the ground—the road was dirty—I called, "Stop thief" as they all three ran away—I took up the parcel, and took it into a pastry-cook's just by—when I was coming from the shop, Carter came up to me with the measure and said, "Is this your measure, Sir, I got it from the boy?"—I cannot say Carter was one of the three boys—Mrs. Goodman helped me to pick up the parcel, which had come open, and the merino had get dirty—a person went home with me—the parcel was lifted forcibly from me behind—it is quite impossible it could have fallen—I had hold of it light—this is it—I was not struck at all.</p>

On the Tuesday in question I had been to the baker's, and as I returned, near the pastry-cook's shop I saw Prince with a parcel on his shoulder, and a yard measure in his hand—I saw only Buckley and Carter there—I knew them before—I saw Buckley pull the parcel off Prince's shoulder behind him—it did not fall from him—I saw Carter push up against him, but did not see him take any thing—Buckley took the yard measure as well as the parcel—I saw Prince pick of the parcel and go into the pastry-cook's, and Buckley ran away with the yard measure—I saw him give it to Carter, and saw Carter afterwards bring it to Prince.</p>

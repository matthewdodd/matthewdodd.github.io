                  </hi>. I am porter at the Baytree public-house, St. Swithin's-lane, King William-street. The prisoner was at my master's house on the night of the 27th of December—a person had come in before that rather drank—I knew that person before, by his coming in occasionally—I did not knew his name before he gave it at the station-house, as Henry Mortimer—he was not very drunk, but a little fresh—he had one glass of brandy and water at the bar, and then went into the tap-room—I was at work down in the cellar, and about half an hour afterwards master rang the bell for me, and I went into the tap-room—I found the man there but not the prisoner—I staid in the tap-room about half an hour, and then the prisoner came into the tap-room, and called for a pint of half-and-half—she had a young man with her—there were three of them—I fetched the half-and-half—the prisoner was sitting alongside the gentleman—she asked him to drink out of the pint, and he did so—they sat there together above half an hour—a man named Murphy, who was sitting in the tap-room, before the prisoner came in, told me she had taken the pin from the gentleman's bosom—she went out of the tap-room, I followed, and the gentleman came after me—I asked him to unbutton his coat to see whether he had lost anything—he did so, and said he had lost his pin—I said to the prisoner, "If you do not give that gentleman his pin I will give you in charge"—she put her hand in her bosom directly, and dropped the pin on my shoe—I stooped down, took it up directly, and gave her to the policeman.</p>

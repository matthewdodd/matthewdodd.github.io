He put his Hand into my Pocket, and took 18 d. which I had put in a Pocket by it self to pa the Coachman; and I believe he took a half Guinea likewise, for I miss'd it the next Day. The Witness demanded my Watch, but I wrench'd the Pistol out of his Hand, and then he ran away. Upon this Hardesty came up to me with another Pistol; I threw myself half out of the Coach, and snapp'd this Pistol at him, calling out, Watch! Watch! and then he ran away too. I can't say I saw any other than Hardesty and the Evidence, though the Witness says, that Piper was concern'd. They were taken up for another Robbery, and I went to see them; Hardesty own'd the whole Affair, and I shew'd the Pistol: Hardesty confess'd the Robbery, and ask'd Piper if he did not know that Pistol? I had no Discourse with Piper that was any Thing to the Purpose.</p>

            . I was one of the Persons that robb'd Mr. Clark on the 23d of October in a Coach, the upper End of Holborn by the Bars; the two Prisoners were with me. Piper was on the off side of the Horses Heads in the Highway: Hardesty and I walk'd on one side, and Piper walk'd on the other side of the Way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clark. The Wind was on the left side of the Coach, therefore I drew up that Window.</p>
               <p>James. Piper went to the Horses Heads, while I robb'd the Gentleman, and Hardesty stood at the other side of the Coach. I open'd the Door on the right side, and put my Hand into his Pocket: I took out three Pieces, one of which I dropp'd, and there remain'd but a Shilling and a Six-pence. The Prisoners had Pistols, as well as I, and that which the Gentleman has produc'd I had from Piper; he bought it about three Days before. The 18 d. was shar'd in my Room, and the two Prisoners had 6 d. each, which we spent at an Alehouse facing Drury-lane.</p>

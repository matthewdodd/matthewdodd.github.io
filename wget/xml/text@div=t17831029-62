               <p>Prisoner. Was not it a guinea to buy some buttons to put on some clothes, with stags and foxes on them? - I asked him before that to get me some buttons, but not at the time he borrowed the guinea; if he had proved an honest man, he should have made me a suit of clothes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. What was your complaint before Justice Blackborough? - I told him the same as I have told my Lord Judge.</p>
               <p>Was not the prisoner committed for a fraud? - Yes; but at Hick's Hall they said it was a forgery.</p>
               <p>He had been in prison first of all for a fraud? - Yes; then he bailed it, and afterwards came to Hick's Hall to discharge his recognizance.</p>
               <p>You did not discount the note for the prisoner at the bar, but for Harrison, and you gave the money to Harrison; the note was in your hands, and in your wife's hands, before it came to him for his opinion? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Harrison lived in some credit, then? - Yes; the prisoner went away before Harrison.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether Harrison did not contract a fresh debt afterwards, and pay him every halfpenny? - Yes, but I did not know that this was a bad note; he paid me and overpaid me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You would have trusted Harrison when you gave him cash for this bill, without the bill? - Yes, with a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Court. You have said more than once, if I understand you, that you took the bill on the faith and credit of the prisoner? - Yes, I would not have taken it on the faith of Harrison.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Was any thing more than his opinion of it that you asked? - Only his opinion.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you ever at Horsham to enquire after Aris? - A gentleman sent to Horsham to enquire after him: I put the note into the Swindling Office, for 2 months.</p>

             the bill, I knew well before he left town; I trusted him five guineas, and I had no suspicion of either of the parties being bad men; and upon their behaving well, I never expected nor suspected that the note could have been a bad one, upon the faith that I had in them. I knew Aris when I made him the clothes; he lived at No. 17. New-street Square; from there he moved down to Horsham, and he told me he was going on a smuggling party. As to value, I never had any in my life of them for it, so help me God. Harrison was a housekeeper in the same street, and lived in credit, as they both did at that time, and I worked for Harrison. Mr. Butler, the Justice, was the other man that told me such a thing as this was against me. I went to withdraw-my recognizance; I appeared every day last sessions; I withdrew my recognizance. If I had ever been guilty of the forgery of that bill, I would never have gone into Court to have withdrawn my recognizance. Here is the accepter of the note.</p>

               <p>"The difficulties which always attend</p>

               <p>"me behind when I was to have seen you</p>

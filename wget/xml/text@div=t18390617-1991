                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called on between ten and eleven o'clock, and saw the prosecutor in his own parlour—I found two severe lacerated wounds on the left side of the temple, made by some blunt instrument—they were of a dangerous character—one branch of the tem<lb></lb>poral artery was divided—he was a week before he recovered entirely—the wounds were nearly healed then, but he was very nervous and ill after that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer. On the Saturday night in question I went to the prisoner's house, about ten o'clock, to call for Mr. Harwood, who lodges there, to go to an Odd Fellows' lodge with me—I went in at the shop-door (there is no private entrance,) and saw Mr. Daley at work at the stone, or imposing-stone, as we call it—he is a master printer—he had a mallet in his hand, which is obliged to be used in the business—he requested me to remain at his shop-door, whilst he went to a neighbour's next door—it is Mr. Daley's own house, but Mr. Shears, a lodger, occupies the back part—he went out, taking the mallet in his hand, forgetting it—it was not wrapped in a handkerchief, but bare—I saw him knock at Shears's door—Mr. Godfrey came by me as I stood at the prisoner's door—he rushed past me in a state of fury—I heard him exclaim something about Irish as he went down the court, but what it was I cannot say—he made up to Daley at full speed, in a fighting attitude, and hit him right and</p>

               <p>left, while he stood at the door—Daley made no answer or resentment, till two Jews, Emanuel and Barnett, came down, and <hi rend="italic">pitched</hi> into him there and then, as he stood, all three of them—I cannot say where Godfrey struck him—I went away upon this, for I had been held to bail to keep the peace towards Mr. Emanuel and the witness Barnett, not towards Godfrey—I called "Police," and went into the Lower Marsh—the prisoner did not strike Godfrey with the mallet before Godfrey struck him—he was struck first—the court was soon full of people.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Mount-row, Westminster-road. On the night in question, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was standing at the coal-shed, next door but one to Daley's house, and next door to Shears's—I saw the prisoner standing at Shears's door—I saw Godfrey come down from the end of the place, go up to Daley, and strike him in the face—after that I saw two or three men rush up, but what occurred afterwards I can<lb></lb>not say—a mob collected, but I did not go from where I was standing—Daley did not strike Godfrey at all, before Godfrey and the other men struck him.</p>

On this Saturday night, about half-past ten o'clock, I saw Daley and Godfrey struggling together, about six yards from my master's door—there were no others there at that time, but two or three minutes afterwards, two or three came from the corner, and a general struggle ensued—the confusion was so great that is all I saw.</p>

                  </hi>. I and my husband lodge in the prisoner's house. On the Saturday night this occurred I was at the shop between ten and eleven o'clock—I was coming out of Daley's shop-door, and saw Daley standing a few doors off, and Godfrey at the corner of the court—all of a sudden, Godfrey rushed towards Daley, apparently in a very great pas<lb></lb>sion' and used the words, "You Irish b—, I will serve you out"—he then rushed on him, and hit him violently with both his hands—two or three other men then came up, and fell on him also—I screamed "Mur<lb></lb>der," being very much frightened, and in about five minutes the police came up—he was then taken to the station-house, and I went with him, at his wife's request, seeing the whole occurrence—I did not see Daley strike Godfrey at all.</p>

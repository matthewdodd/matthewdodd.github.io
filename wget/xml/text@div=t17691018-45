               <p>Court. Give an account of what you know, and of what happened about the death of your father.</p>
               <p>M. Wooderow. William Elder came up in the morning, between six and seven o'clock, and knocked at our door: he staid a little time, and said, Very well, you will not let me in. Then he went down stairs again. After that he came again, about eight, and knocked at the door, and my father bid me let him in. I did. He is my uncle, he married my father's sister. We lodge at Mr. Mitchell's, at the White-Swan in Chandois-street. My uncle came about my aunt. When he came in, he said, So, you have got your sister concealed here. He went to the closet, opened the door, and said, I wish she was here, I would well broomstick her. My dadda and he had a good many words. I do now remember the words. He said to my dadda, Pay me what money you owe me. My dadda was in bed. He said, I have paid you the money, and above. My dadda got out, and said he would show him the bill. He put his coat and waistcoat on, and went round the bed, and pulled out a pocket-book, and came to the other side of the bed, took a key out of his pocket, and opened the drawer. My dadda called him Irish dog, and he called my dadda Scotch dog. My uncle gave my dadda two or three blows with his double fist. My dadda said, Very well; I shall not strike you. My uncle said, I suppose you will take the law of me. My dadda said, I will. Then my dadda fell upon him. Mrs. Breaden, that lives above us, came down, hearing a noise; then came our landlord, Mr. Mitchell, and took my uncle, and turned him out of the room. He was without his hat. I got it, and gave it to him. My dadda went to the glass, and looked in it, and said my uncle had given him a blow on his eye. He went and lay down on the bed, and said to me, O Polly! my head achs, and he never moved or stirred after, nor ever spoke more. This was on the Thursday morning, and he died on the Sunday morning after.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any thing in his hand?</p>
               <p>M. Wooderow. No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any scratch on your dadda's face?</p>
               <p>M. Wooderow. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your aunt?</p>
               <p>M. Wooderow. She hid herself in the closet. There was only me with my dadda.</p>

            . I lodged over the deceased in the same house. I heard a noise in the room about eight o'clock that morning. The child screamed out. I went down to the deceased's room; the prisoner and the deceased were standing pretty close together, but no blows passed. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180045"></xptr> begged they would not fight. The deceased said he would not fight; but it was a hard case to be struck. He asked the little girl for a key, and went to a drawer and took out some writings. He fell in a passion upon taking out the papers, and struck Mr. Elder on the left side the face, and Elder fell against the door. I begged of Mr. Elder that he would not strike him again; he said he would not, and I did not see him lift his hand up at all. The deceased seemed to be very much in a passion, and the prisoner quite calm. Mr. Mitchell came; then the deceased had his two hands in Mr. Elder's hair. Mr. Mitchell took Mr. Elder by the shoulders, and turned him out; and said he would not have a disturbance in his house. Elder said, Give me my hat, and I'll go. And he went away. When he went out of the room, I went also. I saw the deceased about two hours after; he could not speak. The child came up to me, and desired me to come down, saying she believed he was in a fit: he lay, and neither spoke nor stirred. Mrs. Elder was there. She asked what must be done. I desired her to send for a surgeon, for I thought him in a very dangerous way. She was his sister.</p>
               <p>Q. How did Elder and his wife use to live together?</p>
               <p>J. Breaden. That I can't tell. I have seen them come backwards and forwards; they behaved themselves well. She came home with her brother over-night, and had been in the room all night. I cannot tell what this was owing to. I did not see them come home. They came about one in the night. I believe I saw the deceased strike Mr. Elder twice, but did not see Mr. Elder strike the deceased. As far as ever I saw, Mr. Elder was always a quiet, peaceable man; he always was very agreeable. So was the deceased a quiet man, when sober; but very quarrelsome when in liquor. The deceased had lately been in a good deal of trouble, and had hardly been sober for a fortnight.</p>

            . I am the landlord of the house, where this unfortunate thing happened. I saw Elder go up stairs, and heard him knock at the door. He came down again presently, and said, Mr. Mitchell, they will not let me in. I said, I dare say they are gone out; he said, I heard somebody stir in the bed; he said his wife went to Bartholomew-fair, and got drunk, and came home with her brother; and I have been used very ill by him. He says he does not owe me above 3 l. and he owes me 6 or 7 l. I will go up again and see whether they will let me in: He went up and knocked at the door again; what he said I do not know. Presently came the lodger and called me up stairs, and said, There will be murder in the house. This was in about three minutes time. I ran up, and saw the deceased have the prisoner by the hair of the head, beating him in the face with his fist. I got myself in between them, and parted them. I took both the deceased's hands out of the prisoner's hair; and took Elder in my arms and brought him out at the door, and said, You dirty rascal, what business have you in my house, to come to make such a disturbance in a morning? He said, If you please to give me my hat out of the room, I'll go out of your house. He had used to come there, and he came very civily. I never before this heard them any otherways than as brothers to each other. Elder went away, and I did not see the deceased from that time till after twelve o'clock.</p>

            . I am uncle to the deceased. This was on a Thursday, and a man came to me on the Friday morning, for me to come to the deceased, saying he could not speak. That man asked me to go and drink. I went with him to the sign of the Sun, in Russel-street. There was the prisoner. This was about eleven o'clock. He offered his hand to me, and said, Will you shake hands with me? I hope you are not angry. I said my kinsman is not well used; the prisoner answered, D - n his Irish stomach. If I was to do it, I would do it again; he only shams Abraham; that is, to extort money from me. Said he, I hit him a tap, and gave him right and left, taylor fashion. After he got up to struggle, he put his head up, and said he, I could have twisted his head off, but I would not; he could not resist me, but he put his hand up, and catched me by my hair: that was all he could do to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What size man was the deceased?</p>
               <p>Wooderow. He was a small man, and very weak.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing of the deceased striking him?</p>
               <p>Wooderow. No, he never said a word of that. We spent an hour or two together, and he said the deceased scratched him on his forehead. He said the deceased arose up to resent his being struck; and he put his head under his arm, and could have twisted it off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they used to quarrel?</p>

            . I did live in the same house at the time of this, but I do not now. The prisoner came up stairs and swore a great many oaths, and wanted to get into the room. He went from the door down stairs, and said, D - n you, I'll wait all day, but I'll do for you. Whether he meant Wooderow, or his own wife, I do not know.

               <p>M. Crow. I cannot tell which. I heard the prisoner say to Mr. Mitchell they had been at Bartholomew-fair, and had been pawning some things; in about five minutes or less he went up stairs again, and presently I heard the door open. I heard blows, but who struck them I do not know. They were very soon after the door was open. Then I heard the deceased say, I will not strike you; the prisoner answered, No, d - n you, you will take the law of me. Then they went to fighting again, and calling names. The child cried out Murder! murder! you Scotch thief, you will murder my dadda! then I called to Mr. Mitchell: he ran up stairs, and said, You villain, how dare you come to make this disturbance in my house? He brought the prisoner out to the landing-place; then the prisoner said, Give me my hat, and I'll go. He took it, and went away. Mr. Mitchell said to Mr. Wooderow, Must I always have this disturbance in my house? Said the deceased, He struck me, as I was in my bed: you would think it very hard to be struck so. I was in the room when the deceased died. The prisoner surrendered himself to Sir

I saw him go across the room to a drawer in only his coat and waistcoat. As he was putting the key in the drawer, he said, D - n you, I can't forbear you no longer, and fell upon Mr. Elder. The door clapt too, and I heard no more. There were a great many bad names called on both sides. I called Mr. Mitchell up: he came. The child called Mr. Elder Scotch thief, and said he was murdering her dadda. The deceased and his wife were always a quarrelling. I was afraid of murder often with them. After that I saw the deceased go across the room to the glass, and I saw no more of him till about twelve o'clock.

            . On Thursday the 7th of September, about twelve o'clock, I was sent for to the deceased. I found him speechless, senseless, and motionless. He was alive. I examined him, and concluded from the symptoms there was something of the apoplexy. At that time they had no told me what had happened. I treated it as an apoplexy, or a pressure on the brain. I bleeded him. He bled freely, but that did not ease him. He was able to take very little. The second visit was about five or six hours after, then I was informed he had had some words with some relation, and that there had been some blows. I examined his head with great accuracy, but I could not find any external symptoms of bruise or wound that had done him any injury at that time. I attended him, and treated it as a concussion on the brain for the three days he lived. I declared to people about, that it was a case that I believed would prove mortal: that I concluded from the first. The second visit I thought it might proceed from some blows he had received. He died on the Sunday morning, and on the Monday I opened him. I raised the scalp. I could not find the least fracture, or the least injury in the bones of the scull in any part. The temporal muscle had a duskish appearance, as though it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180047"></xptr> had been bruised on the left temple muscle: the muscle on the other side appeared in a found state. I raised that muscle, and examined the scull; but could not find the bone had received any injury at all. I then opened the scull immediately under the left temple, where this appearance of a bruise was in the muscle, and I found a great quantity of extravasated blood lying between the pia and the dura mater.</p>
               <p>Q. Might he not have a vessel broke there without a blow?</p>
               <p>Rowley. Most certainly. I found he had been drinking about a fortnight or three weeks very hard. The muscle appeared, as if there had been some bruise, but the scull was perfectly found underneath it. I examined it in the presence of three or four surgeons.</p>
               <p>Q. If a blow had occasioned a rupture of a vessel, so as to occasion such an extravasation of blood, would he not have immediately grown senseless?</p>
               <p>Rowley. He most undoubtedly would have been senseless immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he, after he had received such a blow as to occasion this rupture, have been able to have pulled the hair, and fought five minutes after?</p>

               <p>Rowley. For a few minutes he might. It might be five, ten, or twenty minutes before the blood emptied in that part.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not known in the course of your practice such a vessel burst merely through passion?</p>
               <p>Rowley. After eating a great meal it has been done. I concluded it must arise from this cause. The man had been drinking very freely, and had not been accustomed to drinking, being in a violent passion might force the blood in such great rapidity to the head, as to occasion these circumstances.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you upon your oath say some external injury was the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Mr. Rowley. I should imagine so, but it is impossible to determine that it was. I cannot be quite positive. I am a little doubtful. A cough, or any violent passion, or strain, might occasion it. To the best of my knowledge it was owing to an external injury. After I had opened the head, I did conclude there might be some external injury. It might be by a fall.</p>

               <p>I was drinking a pint of porter on Wednesday evening at Bartholomew-fair; my wife had been out. She and the deceased both came to the fair. They were both in liquor; she more than he. I told him he had better pay me my money, than to go to

             up with a stick and swore he would knock me down. I made no resistance. I understood he had been to a great man; pawnbrokers to release his wife's things out of pawn, in order to sell them. I went home about eleven, and went to bed. The next morning I got up about seven; I found I had no wife come home. My boy said his mother went home with his uncle and Polly. I went there, without any mischief in my heart, in order to see whether my wife was there. I knocked at the door. I had no answer. I came down again, staid in the passage and asked Mr. Mitchell what time Mr. Wooderow came home; he said between eleven and twelve. It was almost one. I said, Did you see any body come with him? No. said he, I did not. I went up a second time, and knocked at the door again, then the door was admitted to be opened. My wife was got in a small closet. I opened the closet door, and saw the bed folded up. I thought she was not there. He jumped out of his bed, and put his coat and waistcoat on, and said, You Scotch son of a b - h, there is your wife; why don't you find her? I said, She is not there. He repeated Scotch son of a b - h. I said, If he said so again, I would give him a knock on the head. I gave him a blow on his right cheek bone, under his eye. He flew to the drawer, and said he had paid me 3 l. more than my due. I said, You shall not use me so, knowing you had my money. He owed me pretty near 7 l. I was going: he said, I should not go; he would fight it out. He ran his head against me, pulled me about the room, and threw me on a chair. I catched his head under my left arm, and twisted his head about, which I allow might hurt him. The gentlewoman that live in the garret came down, and said, Pray do not strike him. I said, I will not, I will only hinder him from hurting of me. Then Mr. Mitchell came up, and said, You have no business to come to make a noise here. I said, I did not come to make any, but only to look for my wife. The deceased had his hand then in my hair. Mr. Mitchell released me. After I got home, half my hair came off.</p>

            . I am a master taylor,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180048"></xptr> and live in Russel-street, Covent-Garden. I have known the prisoner eleven years. He has behaved extremely well. I never found him ill-natured. He has worked for me. He is a remarkably peaceable and quiet man; no ways addicted to quarrelling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the deceased?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. I did. He has worked with me. He was a leading man on the board.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he for temper?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. When he got a little in liquor, he was rather peevish and ill-natured. The prisoner worked with me about seven years, and the deceased about as long.</p>
               <p>Q. What size man was the deceased?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. He was a little man, much less than the prisoner, and he had had a fit of illness.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a greengrocer's shop in Pindar-place, Gray's-inn-road. On Tuesday morning 28th Jan. I went out to market about six o'clock or a quarter past—I left my shop-door quite safe—I pulled it to by the knocker, pushed it with my hand, and then with my knee—it had a spring lock inside—I left the gas burning in the shop—a person going by could only see it through the key-hole; there was no glass<lb></lb>door—I had seen a dressing-case that morning on the drawers in the back<lb></lb>parlour before I went out; there were no clothes on the parlour floor then—there were when, I came back.</p>

                  </hi>. I came down that morning about half-past six o'clock—my husband had gone out before—I went to the back<lb></lb>parlour and saw some clothes lying on the floor—there were two men in the back-parlour; one was at the drawers taking the things out—the gas was lighted; partly turned up—one of the men had a long dark sleeve jacket—he was at the door—I could almost swear it was the prisoner—I did not see his face—he was dressed as the prisoner, and his appearance was the same—when I came into the back-parlour the two men ran into the shop and out at the front-door, which was partly open—I had seen the man packing the clothes in a red handkerchief; that was not the man like the prisoner; it was not my handkerchief—I ran to the street-door but could see nothing of the men—in about an hour I missed a dressing-case—the clothes were all about the back-parlour ready to take away—they had left the red handkerchief there with linen of different kinds in it—nearly every thing was taken out of the drawers—nothing was taken away except the dressing-case.</p>

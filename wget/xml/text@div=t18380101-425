                  </hi>. I am the son of the deceased Bridget Coffey. I am aware of her having a black eye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know how it was occasioned? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One night, when I was in bed, and my father was not in, I was asleep, and my mother got out of bed—I do not know what for exactly—she tumbled down over the milk-pails which stood by the side of the door—she called out to me, and I got up to help her—I found her on the floor, and one of the pails turned over—I said, "Mother, what is the matter?"—she said, "I have fallen down and hurt my face, help me into bed again," and I did so—I do not know on what day this was—it was after she had taken to her bed—when I helped her into bed she put her hand to her face—that is the way the injury to the face was occasioned.</p>

                  </hi>. I knew the deceased—I remember her taking to her bed on the 26th of November—she had been very poorly for a week before that—I never asked her particularly how she came to take to her bed—she took to it on the Sunday—I went down to take my milk of her, and she seemed very pale—she continued to get worse till she died—she had a doctor to attend her—I know nothing of any violence being used to her by her husband—she never complained to me of any thing but his kicking her out of bed—I never saw her the worse for liquor.</p>

               <p>the seven weeks before—I am not able to state any accident that happened to her—when I came to her, I observed some marks, or bruises, on her body—I showed them to the doctor when I changed her linen—they were on the right side—how they occurred I am not able to say—when I first saw her black eye I asked her how it came, and whether the prisoner did it—she said "No"—she took my two hands and squeezed them very much and said, "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Anny</hi>, he did not do it, but he will be blamed for it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I saw the deceased after death, but not during her lifetime—I examined her body, and found a mark over the right eye, one on the back, and under the lower part of the belly a dis<lb></lb>colouration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were they marks apparently from injuries inflicted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Exactly so—they were such as might occur from blows or kicks—they might have occurred from a fall, or from getting up, and falling over milk pails—that might produce such marks—I examined the internal parts of the body—on removing the scalp from the skull, a quantity of effused blood was seen under the part of the eye that was bruised—it was extravasated blood-there was no fracture of the bone—the vessels of the brain were much dis<lb></lb>tended with blood—the substance of the brain itself was otherwise healthy—there was no disease in the chest—the lungs were healthy, and no disease was formed in any other organ—on examining the abdomen, or belly, there was a considerable effusion of blood, corresponding to the discolouration I mentioned, on the right side—the intestines adhered to the sides of the belly—that was the result of old inflammation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you able to say what was the cause of death from your inspec<lb></lb>tion of the body? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My opinion is, that these bruises were not in them<lb></lb>selves mortal, but they might have accelerated the death, in the situation she was in—I did not see her during her life.</p>

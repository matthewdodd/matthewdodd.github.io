                  </hi>. About one o'clock in. the morning, on the 12th of April, I met the prisoner near Temple-bar—she wanted me to go home with her—I went to Shire-lane, and agreed to give her half-a-crown—while I was on the bed I felt her hand in my pocket—I had a purse con<lb></lb>taining one sovereign, one half-sovereign, and two groats—I then felt, and missed it—I told her she had taken it, and at the same moment I saw her arm move, and heard it fall on the floor—it could not have got on the floor without her taking it out of my pocket—I got up, took the purse, and desired to leave the room—she put herself before the door, and would not let me go except I gave her half-a-crown extra—I said we did not agree for that, and I tried to move her from the door—while I was trying I missed my pin from my shirt—I am sure it was safe before that—I came back and told her she had got it—she said she had not, and we looked in every part of the room—she searched as well as I—it could not be found—I went down stairs with her, and while I was at the door the constable came up—I told him she had taken my pin—he looked for it—he re<lb></lb>moved her from a corner of the room, and I saw him pick up my pin at the same moment—it could not have fallen out in any way.</p>

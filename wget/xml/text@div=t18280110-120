On the 2d of January I was going home at a quarter-past three o'clock in the afternoon - I met the prisoner in the street; she was quite a stranger: I had a large parcel of paper - she said she was going to Chelsea, and would help me to carry it; she carried it as far as the Bag of Nails public-house, Charing-cross; I said I was going to Smith's, a pawnbroker: she said she knew him well; we went into the Bag of Nails, and called for some rum; I had no money, and said to her,"Take my watch, and leave it at the bar for a shilling" - the pot-boy said he would lend me a shilling, and she gave me the watch back; we went on to Mr. Smith's, and left the paper: he gave me 1s. 6d. - we then went on to the Cheshire Cheese public-house, and afterwards went into the Three Compasses public-house; they would not let us have any liquor there; I laid my head down on the table, and she once or twice rather thumped me; I put up my hand, and said, "Go along - you are not my wife," and I think she was taking my watch then - it was in my fob; she particularly wanted to see me home before that, but then she went out. I was half-and-half; she did not wish me good night; I missed my watch when I got home.</p>

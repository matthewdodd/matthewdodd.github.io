             came to me about three o'clock in the afternoon on Friday the 5th of April, 1811; he said there was a horse to sell in Petticoat-lane; I went to the prisoner in Petticoat-lane, he said he wanted to sell the horse; I said if he would let me ride him, I would try and buy it of him. I rode the horse to the turnpike, and came back again, I asked him what he wanted for him; he said twenty pounds; I told him I would give him sixteen pounds for the horse, and the saddle and bridle; he said no, the saddle and bridle is not my own. I bought the horse, and got the receipt of him for the horse and bridle; I gave him sixteen pounds for the horse and bridle. Here is the receipt the prisoner gave me, and then in thirteen days time the horse and bridle was owned by Mr. Robson; Mr. Robson had the horse and bridle, and the saddle he got of some Jews in Petticoat-lane.</p>

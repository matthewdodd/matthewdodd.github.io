On the 25th of May, I left my house about half-past twelve o'clock, and left nobody in it. I fastened both the doors and windows - my house stands by itself. I returned in about half an hour, and found the door half open - I am certain I had locked it. I think it had been opened by a picklock-key, as no force had been used. Two boxes in the bed-room were broken open, and all the things strewed about; my wife was at work at Bayswater Tea Gardens, just by. I missed the articles stated in the indictment, 25 s. in money, and other things. I saw the money safe, and both boxes locked, about half an hour before.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 25th of April, about one o'clock, I saw the prisoner and Price, who was convicted last Session, come out of Harper's fields, which lead from Bayswater into the Edgware-road; the prisoner carried a large bag across his shoulder, the other man walked at a distance behind; they turned down John-street, Edgware-road, and walked very fast - I suspected them, and followed at a little distance. Harper's fields is in almost a straight line from the prosecutor's. Price looked back to see if any one was watching them; they crossed the end of Cato-street, the prisoner returned back, and went into Cato-street; I then got up to Cato-street, and saw the prisoner turn into a house, Price looked back, ran by the door, and ran out at Queen-street end; by the time I got to the door the prisoner was in the passage; he rebounded back out of the passage, with the bag behind him, and dropped it - I secured it, and he ran into John-street again; I called stop thief, he ran into Mitcham-street, through a house, got out on Lisson-green, and escaped. I can positively swear he is the man. I kept the property till Price's trial, and then returned it the prosecutor.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 641.) On the 16th of Dec., about ten o'clock at night, I was on duty in Petticoat-lane, which is on the boundary between the City and the County—I was in the City, and saw the prisoner there with a bundle on his back—I followed him—he looked back, saw me following him, and crossed the road—I pursued him—he dropped the bundle as soon as I got close to him, and ran away—I ran after him, and took him in Bell-lane—a scuffle took place, and we fell, I on the top of the prisoner—while on the ground, some woman said, "Shame! the man will kill the policeman; take his part"—I saw the prisoner take a knife out of his pocket after he got up—he had done nothing before that—I saw him put his hand into his pocket, after a person came to assist me on pretence—he got the prisoner on his legs—then he let go of him and walked away—it was then I saw him put his hand into his pocket, and I felt him <hi rend="italic">jobbing</hi> at my body immediately after that—I defended myself with my arm—I was standing at the time, and endeavoured to protect myself by my arm, and I received eight wounds on my arm—I am quite sure they were inflicted by the prisoner—they could not have been inflicted by anybody else—I cried out at the time, "He is stabbing me"—we had a struggle after he stabbed me —I threw him down again—he fell on his belly, and I on his back—I held his collar, with my legs round him, and M'Michen came up and secured him—I got no further stabbing while on the ground—we were standing up at the time—I thought if I had nor thrown him down, I should not have taken him at all, or got away from him—I went to Mr. Mear's, the surgeon's, and had my arm dressed, and since then to Mr. Child—I have not been able to go on duty since—my arm is still disabled.</p>

                  </hi> I am a follow of the Royal College of Surgeons; I am also surgeon to the City police force. On the evening of the 16th of Dec., at eleven o'clock, Pettet called on me—from what he stated I examined his left arm, and found it had been previously dressed by a surgeon—on re-moving the dressing I discovered he had received eight punctured wounds in The fore-arm, one about an inch below and on a line with the inner part of the elbow, which I considered important as regards its depth—a second was situated about the middle of the inner side of the fore-arm, which I considered still more important, form the injury sustained by the nerve which supplies the inner part of the arm—there was another wound over the anterior surface of the wrist, another on the ball of the thumb, which I considered important from their locality, being situated over the principal arteries of the hand—they all appeared to have been done by some small-pointed sharp instrument, such as a penknife—he has been under my care till the present time—the wounds have healed, but he still suffers form loss of sensation in the inner part of the</p>

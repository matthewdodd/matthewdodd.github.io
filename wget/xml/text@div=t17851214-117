               <p>I lost a horse in the night between the 3d and 4th of November, a black horse, I had it, I believe, between four and five months, I knew the horse as soon as I saw him, I lost him from my stable, which is distant from my house about twenty or thirty yards, in consequence of being informed the horse was gone, I had two advertisements made out, and sent one to Oxford, and the other to Reading, on the Saturday I had it cried by the common crier, at Wallingford; on Monday following I went to London on private business, not on account of the horse, I had given it over for lost; I went to Bow-street and requested to see the horse, as soon as I saw it, I knew it directly, it was shewn me at a stable near to Bow-street, one of the men belonging to the office shewed it me, I know nothing of the prisoner of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did not you know one of the prisoners before? - I understand there is one of them lived in the town of Wallingford, that is Simmonds, but I did dot know him.</p>
               <p>Was you present at the first examination in Bow-street? - Yes, Sir, he said, he was on Friday, and Saturday, and Sunday, at Wallingford, and he referred us to several persons whom he was shaving, I went down to several persons, and enquired of them, and they said, they had been shaved by him on those days.</p>
               <p>Did you lose a saddle and bridle? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you find the horse with a bridle and a saddle? - The people that took the the horse up, said, there was a saddle and bridle.</p>
               <p>Frewen told you he found the horse on Clapham-common? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That he had found it with a bridle and saddle, and suspected it had thrown its rider, and brought it to town to be owned? - I believe he did, I lost the horse the 4th of November, the next time I saw him was in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court to Carpmeal. What stable was the horse at, it was at one Froome's stable, in Hart-street, I brought the horse there on the 8th of November, on a Tuesday, I brought him from a stable of one Mr. West in White-cross-street.</p>
               <p>Is the horse that Mr. Felwell saw the horse that you brought from West's? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I keep stables in White-cross-street, to let out saddle horses, I remember the horse that Carpmeal took from my stables, on the 8th of November, the prisoner Frewen brought him to my stable.</p>
               <p>When did he bring him there? - On the 4th day of November, about three in the afternoon; he asked me if I could take care of him, and I said, yes, he begged I would give him a mash, I told him I was very busy and begged he would assist, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140133"></xptr> he staid and assisted to give him a mash, he left him there, and I was admiring the good shape of the horse, and I told him I should like to buy him, if he was for sale.</p>
               <p>What answer did he make to that? - He said, he was not for sale, I more than once told him, I should like to give thirteen guineas for him, which I thought was his full value, he refused it.</p>
               <p>Do you think that was his value? - That was more than the gentleman himself gave for him, as I found since; Frewen came there every morning.</p>
               <p>Where was Frewen when the officer from Bow-street came? - I believe they had got him in custody then.</p>
               <p>Did he at any time say how he came by the horse? - I was under some apprehensions that there was something of a note or money mentioned, as I told the Justice, but I do not distinctly recollect.</p>

               <p>Where did you see him last? - Here, I believe.</p>
               <p>That was when you was convicted, was not it? - Yes, I was convicted, and burnt the hand.</p>
               <p>Court. Then there is an end of your objection.</p>
               <p>Walmslay. On the 17th of last month I saw Frewen up in Aldersgate-street, he told me he had got a nice horse, I asked him where he had him, he told me he stole him out of a gentleman's stable in the country, I desired him to let me look at him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Short-hand Writer. Did you observe this witness when he was sworn? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I beg your Lordship will direct this witness to be re-sworn, in order that Mr. Hodgson may see him sworn, that he may be able to prove it on a future day.</p>
               <p>(The witness was re-sworn)</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder to Walmslay. You was sworn before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You asked him if he would let you look at him? - Yes, and he told me if I would come in the morning I should see him, he told me to come up to Simmons's Inn, in Aldersgate-street, which is a china shop, where he lodges, I went there, but he was gone out, and I went down Beech-lane, and at the corner of Beech-lane, I met him and the prisoner

             together, to the best of my remembrance it was the Tuesday after, I first met him on the Monday, I asked him to let me look at him, he told me he durst not let me look at him, for Simmons was come up to give the gentleman information, or to put him in the papers; he told me Simmons had put him up where to get him, and he durst not let me look at him.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by put him up where to get him? - To the stable where he was, I understood him he told him where he was, and he was to take him out of it.</p>
               <p>What that Simmons had told him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was what he told you, was it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then Frewen did not know where he was himself? - He told me not, but the other had told him, he did not know himself, he said, 'till Simmons told him, and he told me; he went and undid the stable door, and took him out.</p>
               <p>When did he say this had happened? - He told me he got him a night or two before, but justly, I cannot say; that Simmons had told him where he was in the country to steal him, and he had gone and undone the stable door, and taken him out, as he told me; I asked him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140134"></xptr> where the horse was, and he told me, the horse was down in West's stables; we went and had something to drink together, and he told me after that, he and Simmons were going down to the Pitt's Head in the Old Bailey, and I went and told Mr. Carpmeal and Jealous of it; I went to Bow-street, and gave information.</p>
               <p>Then, though this man was afraid to shew you the horse, he was not afraid to tell you he had stole him? - He said that Simmons was come up to sell him; that the gentleman was come to town.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was you an intimate acquaintance of Frewen's? - Not much acquainted, only drinking with him several times; he told me in Beech-lane, that Simmons was come up, to let him know, that the gentleman was come to town.</p>
               <p>Look towards the Jury, and tell them who you are? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where have you been, since you was convicted here, what have you been doing since? - I have been hard at work, I suppose.</p>
               <p>What sort of work? - Several sorts.</p>

            ? - I was not the cause of his apprehension.</p>
               <p>How much blood money have you had since, my friend? - I never had none in my life.</p>
               <p>You deny giving any information against the others? - Yes, I will.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Frewen tell you what he intended to do with this horse? - He did not tell me any thing about it, whether he was for sale or not.</p>
               <p>Then he spoke to you merely for the purpose of informing you, that he had stole the horse? - I do not know for what purpose it was, I was to see him in the morning.</p>
               <p>For what purpose, did you conceive, that he told you he had this horse? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>You have no idea of what reason he had for telling you that he had stolen this horse, unless he wanted to dispose of the horse? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>PRISONER FREWEN's DEFENCE</p>
               <p>I was in Gracechurch-street, I heard of a coachman's place, I went to Clapham-common, after the place, there I saw a horse with a bridle and saddle on the common and nobody near him, I supposed him to have thrown his rider, I brought him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140135"></xptr> into the road, I perceived he was a little lame, he had one shoe on, I rode him gently to town, and brought to Spencer, I asked him to give him a mash, I stood and helped him, I left the horse in his care.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Frewen called two witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

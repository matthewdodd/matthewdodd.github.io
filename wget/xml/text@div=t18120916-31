            . I am a servant to Titus Deane, at Knowle, about a mile from Bristol. I saw the horse the day after it was put in the field. I missed it on Thursday morning</p>
               <p>SAMUEL PALMER. I live in the parish of Sison, five miles from Bristol and six from Knowle. I keep a public-house. I saw the prisoner at my house on Sunday evening, the 26th of July he staid about an hour in my house, I am quite sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. He went down to an election, did not he - A. I do not know that; there was an election there about a fortnight before that.</p>
               <p>DAVID SADLER. I keep a repository in Goswell-street, on the 11th of August the prisoner brought a bay gelding to my repository for sale I asked him to walk in and book the horse, which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. In what name did he tell you to book it - A. Jerry Booth. I asked him what he had to say about the horse with regard to soundness; he said he wished it to be sold to the best bidder. I put the horse up at the auction and sold it for seventeen guineas. I got a friend to buy it; after the sale was over I saw the horse was only three years old. I told my servants to be careful before they paid him to get his address. On the Thursday I saw him again; he put an address into my hand I told him that would not do, he must go and get the publican to come to me; he walked away directly, he went out of the yard; my friend took the horse home with him. The prisoner never had the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the horse that has been since claimed by Mr. Powell - A. Yes, the prisoner was at last taken up and charged by my son.</p>

I asked him if he had so much money about him; he said he had not, he had given six pounds in part. I asked him where George Woods lived, he said he did not know, he had paid him the remaining ten pounds at the Frying-pan. I asked how he came to meet him there, he gave no direct answer, but affected to be in liquor. He appeared to me to be sober. He said

                  </hi> I am a jeweller, and live at 23, Church Street, Hackney—on the night of 29th August I locked up my shop at a quarter-past eleven, before I went to bed—all my property was safe at that time; tie windows and doors were closed and fastened—about a quarter to seven in the morning I was called by my daughter—I found the place in a dis<lb></lb>ordered state, and all my house plate was gone; the silver was dissected</p>

               <p>from the plated goods, and taken away from the plate basket in the sitting-room—I went immediately into the shop, which opens from the sitting-room by glass doors—I saw the glass case on the counter open, and missed a number of gold chains, earrings, ten watches, a gold brooch, and other articles—I then examined the premises—I found a pane of glass had been cut in the kitchen window level with the garden, the glass cut out, the latch pushed back, and the window open—the garden door was open; they had passed out that way—I found some footmarks alongside the wall, and a pair of my own boots stood alongside—the persons committing the robbery had to get over a wall six feet high in passing out—I have since seen some of the property—here are two pairs of earrings which were in my case that night; here are also two other pairs of earrings which were found upon the prisoner Leicester; they were also in the case that evening—there is also a ring here that was in my possession that evening.</p>

About one o'clock in the mor<lb></lb>ning of 3rd September I went with Venables to No. 7, Russell Street, Stepney—I knocked at the door—Gibbons and Catherine Atkins looked out of Window—I said, "Tom, come down, I want to speak to you"—he came down in a minute or two and opened the door—I went straight through the house, and saw Catherine Atkins go into the back yard—Gibbons turned round and went up stairs, Venables followed him—I went into the yard, and found both the female prisoners in the closet—I waited there till they went up stairs, I followed them—when they got into the room Mary Ann Atkins said, "I know nothing about any rings; what I have got I bought, and here is the receipt"—I had not asked her any question—she produced this paper, Gibbons took it out of her hand, and I took it from him.

I then asked her for the rings out of her ears; she gave them to me, and Catherine also gave me hers—I asked Mary Ann where she got them from—she said she bought them on Friday at Mr. Upsall's, in the Whitechapel Road—Catherine said hers were only common ones, and they were given to her by a young man who had gone for a soldier—Mary Ann fell on her knees and said, "Oh, pray Mr. Brydon don't lock mo up"—she then turned round to Gibbons and said, "Oh Tom,</p>

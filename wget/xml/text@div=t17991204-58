             sworn. - I am a porkman; I live next door to Mr. Barnfield; Last Wednesday evening, about half past five, I had a message from Mr. Barnfield, to take a situation in my two pair of stairs back room, that I might have a full sight of his yard and warehouse, who went in and out after that time; I was there about a minute; Mr. Barnfield and his shopman, and a young man came into the yard to borrow a pulley; about five or six minutes after that, the prisoner at the bar, Loftus, came out of the house; she was servant to Mr. Barnfield, he is an oilman; I saw her, followed by another woman, I cannot say who it was, and go into the warehouse; Loftus said to the other person, shut the door; it appeared to me that they had shut the warehouse-door, because I lost the light; I saw them go in; I gave information to Mr. Duffield, a friend of Mr. Barnfield's; I staid a little longer, and saw the prisoner Loftus come out, and another woman, but whether it was the other prisoner I cannot say; they came along the yard and went into the house, and I saw no more of them; the prisoner Loftus has lived four years in Mr.Barnfield's place, and I never heard any thing disrespectful of her till this time.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: on Wednesday night; about six o'clock. I perceived the prisoner Edwards come out of Mr. Barnfield's shop; I watched her some way up Bishopsgate-street, and I stopped her; I felt something hard in her pocket, and I took her into Messrs. Barnet and Cookson's, haberdashers; I there searched her, and in her right-hand pocket I found two cakes of soap; under her left arm I found a shirt, and some more things in her left-hand pocket, which are not mentioned in the indictment; I have had them in my possession ever since. (Produces them).</p>

             sworn. - I am an oilman in Bishopsgate-street; the prisoner Loftus was my servant, the other prisoner is her cousin: I had some reason to think that I was losing my property, but I had so much confidence that I could not bring myself to think those parties were concerned; I had information, however, which made me think it necessary to take means to detect; I had been given to understand that the article of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040044"></xptr>soap was meant to be conveyed away, and I went and cut a notch in the soap, and put some peppercorns in, and closed the aperture up; when the soap was produced before my Lord Mayor, there were the pepper-corns in it. I sent a friend to ask Mr. Osborne to watch up stairs who went into my warehouse; I went to Mr. Duffield's house till Mr. Osborne sent over to inform Mr. Duffield of it. I then went out to watch her coming out, and I had Mr. Sapwell there ready, and he stopped the prisoner Edwards; this is my soap, here are the pepper-corns in it; I know the shirt by the initials of my name.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Sapwell.) Did you find any thing upon the other prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Loftus's defence. I have nothing to say, but to beg for mercy.</p>
               <p>Edwards's defence. I beg the mercy of the Court, and leave the rest to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Edwards called four witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

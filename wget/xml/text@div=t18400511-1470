                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Carter, and live at New-end, Hampstead. I hung these articles in Hampstead-square to dry, on the 12th of March, about two o'clock—I missed them between four and five o'clock—on the 16th the prisoner brought the baby's bed-gown, and said she had picked it up in Duke's-square, that Lowe, the gardener, saw her pick it up, and cried, "Halves"—I said I did not care about the old bed-gown, but I wished I could get the other things, as, after I had been laying the young man's money by to do me good, I must now lose half of it, to pay for these things—she said the better way would be to search the pawn-shops—I said I had not time, neither did I understand it—she said she was going to town, and if I liked, she would do it, and call and tell me the next day—she did not come the next day—I went to where she worked, and saw her—she turned round and said, "Ah, mother Carter, 1 have no luck for you"—this shirt and shift are mine—(<hi rend="italic">examining them</hi>)—the drawers I have not got.</p>

I took the prisoner—I told her I wanted her for stealing a shirt and other articles of Mrs. Carter's—she said she had heard something about it—I took her to Mrs. Carter's to sign the charge, and she said, "MRS. Carter, if you won't give charge I will pay you double the money of the things"—when she got to the station-house she said she had picked tip a shirt, shift, and pair of drawers, in Duke's Head-alley.</p>

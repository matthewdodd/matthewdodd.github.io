            . I am a partnership with the last witness. A box containing two hundred weight and two quarters of composition nails was delivered to me - there were other nails, and some copper nails, but not in the same warehouse as these were; I locked the door five minutes before six o'clock on the evening of the 28th - it was customary with me to lock the outer-gate, and no person could get in till I came the next morning; I went in the morning, between six and seven o'clock - the outer gate was burst open; I then went to the warehouse these nails had been in, and found the lock broken to atoms - the nails which I had taken in were missing, and a few strewed on the floor; a bag of iron nails had the nails emptied out, and the bag was gone - the 28th was on a Thursday.</p>

On Friday morning, the 29th, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was out, and saw Sullivan coming across the marshes, about half a mile from the prosecutor's ware-house - he had a small loaf and a piece of cheese in his hand; Greenbough was standing near Mr. Hudson's hedge, waiting for Sullivan, as I suppose - Sullivan gave him a slice of bread and cheese, and they proceeded on to Mr. Lambert's gate; I waited about five minutes, when I saw Moore in a green bodied cart - he passed my cart, and went on to the other two prisoners; I then saw Moore and Sullivan drag a bag out of a ditch, but what it contained I could not tell - I proceeded on towards Blackwall, and saw Moore coming in his cart to meet me, but he turned aside on the grass plot that I might not see what was in the cart; I had not passed above four hundred yards when Moore turned his cart again, and took in a second bag, which Greenbough brought out on his shoulder, but I did not see from whence he brought it; Sullivan took it from him, and put it into the cart - it appeared to be heavy; I gave information to the Police.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What time was this? A. Between ten and eleven o'clock; I suppose there was abundance of time to have got a cart - I have seen the horse to-day, and he appears to be blind.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. In consequence of information I stopped the cart, on the 29th of October, with my brother officer; about a quarter of a mile before we met the cart, Moore, who was driving, turned, and went very near half a mile - we went in chase of him, and overtook him; we found this bag of nails in the cart, and some bed-ticking over them - I got into the cart, and Moore drove to the station-house; in going along he put his hand into the bag, and said, "I should like to see what they are, and how soon an innocent man may be brought into trouble;" as we were taking him to the office the following night, he said he knew Sullivan, but did not know the other, only by his dress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe he gave what direction he could, as to finding Sullivan? A. Yes, and he said he had seen him two or three times - that he came to his house and employed him to take these things; I did not know Moore - he took out two or three nails from the bag when he put his hand in, and I told him to leave them alone - I weighed them; there are 474 lbs.</p>

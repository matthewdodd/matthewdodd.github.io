I had a candle by me, which occasioned my not seeing him. He went out. A man ran out, to see if he could catch him, and in the mean time my maid and I went up stairs. We found the prisoner concealed in a two pair of stairs room, behind a folding-board and a horse, on which were some stockings; he lay round like a dog; I could see nothing but the soles of his shoes; this was about seven in the evening.

The things laid in the indictment ( mentioning them ) were found on the stairs going up, about five stairs up, which were taken from a little place which I call my store-room; they hung about six feet high; the little boy could not have taken them down. The prisoner said, he came to enquire for one Mr. Jones, a watch-finisher. There were people enough to have informed him, had he asked. There is a back-door to come in at, by which the boy and he must come in. The prisoner begged for mercy at first, and after that he behaved very insolently to every one that came near him.</p>

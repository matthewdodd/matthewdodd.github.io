                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Samuel Sadler, a pawnbroker, of 79, Snow-hill—about ten minutes to 1 o'clock, in the afternoon of February 4th, the prisoner came in, and asked me to show him some rings—he asked to look at a ring that was in the window—I asked him if it was was a keeper—he said, "No"—lie went outside, and pointed out the ring, which was a keeper—I got it out of the window, took it off the card, and gave it to him to look at—he asked me if I would warrant it gold—I said, "Yes; you will find it Hall-marked inside"—he took it to the gas to look at it, and then said, "Good morning," and walked of with it—there was a woman with a child outside, pointing to the ring—I followed the prisoner, and within three minutes gave him into custody—I am satisfied he is the man.</p>

The prisoner was given into my custody for stealing a gold ring—I told him the charge—he said he was never near the shop, and knew nothing about it, and he was a respectable man, and could prove it—I only found a pin, a pair of spectacles, and an empty domino-box on him—he refused his name and address.</p>

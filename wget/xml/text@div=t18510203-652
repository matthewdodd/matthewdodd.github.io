                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Union-road, St. George's, in the Borough. The prisoner and deceased lived at 4, Surrey-row, Black-friars-road—I only knew them by working twice in the house—on the day this occurred I was at work there; the prisoner and her husband were quarrelling during the day—about three o'clock in the afternoon, the pri<lb></lb>soner went out—I did not see her come in again, but I heard her—it was as near as possible about four—she went out again about half-past four, and did not return till about six—I had heard them having words before she went out—I was in the kitchen, and about five or ten minutes past six, she came running down into the kitchen without her bonnet and shawl, and seated herself on some matting—her husband came down; she had a short-sleeved gown, and he gave her a slap on the arm with his open band, and said she should not go out again—she followed him up-stairs, and</p>

               <p>said, "I will mark you for this"—(she had the key of the street-door in the course of the afternoon, and he wanted to get it away from her)—in a few minutes I heard him call "Murder!" three times, in the parlour; and she said, "Mrs. Charman bring up a light"—I took up a light, and found them both in the parlour; he was bleeding from the temple—he said, "For God's sake, fetch somebody"—I went out for a doctor—there was a great crowd, and a female named Dyer, who was then a stranger to me, got into the house; she opened the door to me on my return—the doctor came directly, and I did not go into the parlour, but went down to my work—I did not hear the deceased say who had done it—the prisoner was perfectly sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I live next door to this house. I heard cries of "Murder!" there—I knew Mr. Brown, it was his voice—Mrs. Charman opened the door, and I went in into the front parlour, and found John Brown standing near the door bleeding from a wound in the forehead—the prisoner was there—I said, "Lor, Jane, how could you do this?" and asked her to give me some water—she said nothing, but fetched it, and I washed the blood off—he went and picked up this poker (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and said, "This is the d—d poker that Jane did it with," and that she had given him his death blow—she said, "You should be quiet"—the doctor then came; I left, and saw no more of the man till the night before he died, which was five or six weeks afterwards—the prisoner and her husband often quarrelled.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called, and found the deceased with a lacerated punctured wound on the forehead; it was bleeding—he gave me an account of how it was inflicted—I think the prisoner heard it from the short distance she was off in the back-room—be said, "Jane has struck me with a poker"—she then came into the room and said, "He has threatened to murder me"—I took up the poker which laid in the fender, and said, "Is this the poker?"—he said, "Yes," in her presence—I then left—I attended him for a fortnight, and then the parish-surgeon was called in—during the time I attended him the prisoner was very atten<lb></lb>tive and kind—I had no idea at first of any fatal result from the wound; there was no fracture to be detected externally.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the Union. I took charge of the deceased after Mr. Evans ceased to attend him, and attended him till his death—he told me, in the presence of his wife, that he had received a blow with a piece of iron about a pound in weight some weeks before, and that he had been very ill ever since—he did not say then who struck</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185102030171"></xptr>
               <p>the blow, but he afterwards said it was "That person there;" his wife was in front of him—I think that was the second day I attended him—she was near enough to hear what was said, but the said nothing—he gradually sunk, and died on the 16th—I examined his body by the Coroner's direc<lb></lb>tion, and found a small aperture in the forehead, and also in the bone, under the covering of the brain, about an inch over the right eye-brow, about an inch in diameter—externally it did not appear as if it went through the skull, but when I removed the skull I found the internal plate lacerated and splintered, and the internal membrane of the brain in a very highly inflamed state; the consequence of which was abscesses, and inflammation of the brain, which caused death—the point of this poker would inflict such in injury; it must have been thrust with intense force.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the deceased a man of very full habit of body? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I presume not from what I saw—I could not tell whether he was addicted to drink—I do not think the abcesses in the brain could proceed from internal causes connected with the wound; the inflammation was not over the whole brain; it was local—he wandered a little at times—he was not wandering when be said, "That person there" did it.</p>

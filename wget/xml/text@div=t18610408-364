I am a detective—the prisoner Whiter lived at 20, Great Mitchell-street, Brick-lane, St. Luke's—the prisoners were acquainted—I have not seen them together—I have seen Sturt go to her house many times—I had seen him go there about 3 or 4 months previous to his apprehension—the last time was about a week before—on 9th March, about 1 o'clock in the day, I and Foulger were in Wood-street, and Sturt passed us, carrying this bag, with something in it, (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) over his shoulder—we followed him to No. 20, Great Mitchell-street, Winter's house—he remained there about three-quarters of an hour, and then came out with the bag over his shoulder, apparently empty, and went down Mitchell-street, into Brick-lane, towards Old-street; Foulger and I followed him—Foulger called him by name, and said, "Sturt, we are officers"—I said, "You have been into 20, Great Mitchell-street"—he said, "I have not"—I said, "You have left a parcel there"—he said, "I have left no parcel there"—I think Foulger an I spoke at the same time; I said, "Do you live there?—he said, "No, I do not"—he was very much confused—we took him to 20, Great Mitchell-street; I made inquiries of a woman who was cleaning in the passage, at the bottom of the stairs, whether the prisoner had been up stairs, and she said that he had not—I opened the parlour door and saw—Winter in the front room—I asked her whether she knew who Sturt was, and whether he had been in there—she said she did not know him, and he had not been in there—I turned to Foulger and Sturt, with my back to the female prisoner, and as I turned again, I saw her with her back to me, and her face to the sideboard; she then went towards the back room—it is divided by a partition, with a door in the centre—I caught hold of her, and said, "What have you there? we are officers"—she had these 2 watches and this chain in her hand (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took them from her—I found these 6 duplicates in this box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in a drawer in the front room</p>

               <p>—after finding these, I said to her, "Sturt has brought a parcel here"—she said, "He has not"—I said that he had just left, and she denied it, and continued to deny it all the time we ware there—we searched the place, and found a great quantity of Berlin wool, worsted, netted handkerchiefs, neckties, beads, and about 50 bundles of coloured wool—we found these two parasols (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) hanging up in the front parlour—I examined a box, and found some more duplicates—some of them are made out in Winter's name—they relate to new dresses and new shawls—Winter said that a man left them there—I told her that I should take her into custody—I asked her whether she occupied those two rooms—she said that she did—I asked her whether she knew Sturt—she said, "Yes"—I said, "Do you know that he worked at Hutton's, in Newgate-street?"—she said, "Yes, I know that Mr. Sturt worked there"—she made no statement about how she became possessed of the property till after the examination—I asked her her occupation, and she said she was a charwoman, and took in washing—I said, "How long is it since you have done any charing?"—she said, "Twelve months ago"—I asked her how long ago it was she had done washing—she said she had washed 6 shirts for Sturt's boys—while we were in the house, I took from her a savings' bank book—she went into the back room, and I followed her—I saw her put her hand in her pocket—I took her hand from her pocket, and she had a savings' bank book—it showed a deposit in her favour of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have not got it here; it was given up to Mr. Wontner, on application of the prisoner Winter, by order of the Magistrate—I afterwards took the female prisoner to Clerkenwell police-court—she made a statement to me on the way, and had done so previous to that—I did not say anything to her first—it was after she had been examined before the Magistrate—after the final hearing of this case, and before the other case came on at Clerkenwell (her premises were robbed while she was in prison), she said, "I wish I had told the truth"—I said, "You may say what you like;" and she said, "You brought three parcels from my place, how is it you have only brought two here"—I said, "Because we could only identify two"—she said, "One I bought myself, and the other two Sturt brought to me" and she said, "On the Saturday that you took us, he brought five bundles of worsted"—these large hanks—I said, "How did he bring the Berlin wool? you need not answer the question unless you like"—she said, "Two or three bundles at a time"—I said, "How did he bring the silk braid?"—she said, "Wrapped up in his handkerchief"—I said, "Your father says this has been going on for some time, and that you were about to be married, and keep a little shop"—she said, "Yes;" and she repeated many times, "I wish I had told the truth."</p>

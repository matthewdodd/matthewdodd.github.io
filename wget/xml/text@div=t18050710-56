               <p>Q. Where does Mrs. Wayland live? - A. In a court at the back of the White Swan; I went there, and went to bed along with the girl; I had five notes of one pound each, three seven-shilling pieces, four five-shilling pieces, and two pounds in loose silver about me in my pockets; at ten o'clock I was turned out of that bed, and put into another; there was no distance between the two beds, they were both in one room; she told me, when she turned me out of the bed, that her son was coming home, and if the suffered me to be in that bed, she should suffer for it and me too.</p>
               <p>Q. She got you to go from one bed to the other - were you sober? - A. Yes, I was perfectly sober at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you with her from four o'clock till ten? - A. Yes, I was in the other bed from four o'clock till ten; when I got into the other bed I paid her for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you pay for the first bed? - A. A shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. You paid then two shillings? - A. Yes; I was afraid of my money, and I sent her down for some liquor and beer while I put my money by.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she dress herself? - A. She was dressed, she never went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a young woman with you? - A. Yes, she went out of doors at the same time; I counted my money up, and put it in my waistcoat pocket, and put it under the bed; while they were gone, the woman came in, and Mrs. Wayland directly after her.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the girl? - A. She was along-side of me in the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What liquor had you? - A. Half a pint of gin and half a gallon of beer; I had a drink of beer, then I told her never to mind me, but to help herself; I laid on the bed, and Mrs. Wayland came to the bed looking for something; I asked her what she wanted; she said, never mind me, child, mind yourself; I turned to the girl alongside of me, I never had any thoughts of her taking my money till about eighteen minutes afterwards; then I started up in the bed, and looked for my waistcoat and my money, and neither could be found; I challenged her for my money, and I demanded my money of her, and no money could be found, but a deal of abuse; she went to the bed, and sat on it; I searched for my waistcoat, and my waistcoat was found where she was sitting; she sat up all this time with a great coat on; I never found my money nor my notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the young woman that was lying with you? - A. She could not take it.</p>

About a fortnight before we knew of the prisoner being taken up we missed two pieces of printed cotton; about the time he was taken up we missed two pieces more; they lay in the day time near the door; we lay them on the counters at night. I can identify part of the pieces which were found at a pawnbroker's.</p>

               <p>On the 1st of June, about three in the afternoon Justice Blackborough received a letter in consequence of which I went with Isaacs, to search the prisoner's lodging, and we found a parcel of pawnbroker's duplicates. He was taken and examined before the justice in the evening. He said the duplicates were his property; that he bought this linen in the city of Dorset, and that he gave them to a young woman to pawn for him (who is to be indicted for receiving them in Middlesex) I found two pieces of linen in the drawer in his lodging.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you that he had them in change for goods at Dorset? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you one of what the people call thief-takers? - I am not; I am a constable of Clerkenwell. I should think it no disgrace to take a thief.</p>

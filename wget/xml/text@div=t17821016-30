               <p>I was constable of the night, about ten or eleven I was sent for to take charge of that gentleman in the red waistcoat, I asked him what he had been about, he said my partner has been about somewhat, he has got a woman's handkerchief; he said he only told him to smutch it: this is the account they gave themselves, they cannot deny it. That chap I took to the compter, the other I took him along side his cart, he said, I was fuddled, I took to the handkerchief off undoubtedly, but says he, I do not know what I did with it, but if I could find what I did with it, I would give it to the woman again; he acknowledged his having it, but he said he did not know what he did with it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Who gave you intelligence where to find this man? - I knew the man very well when I found who he was, there is never a neighbour but what knows him, he is well known I assure you; the handkerchief was never found.</p>

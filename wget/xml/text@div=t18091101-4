            , ESQ. On Wednesday the 18th of October, the laundry belonging to my house, at the foot of the garden was robbed of a large wash, soon after I was informed of it; on Thursday morning, the 19th, I went to Bow-street, I took with me a list of the articles; they told me they had the goods; I fancy there was one basket which they had not recovered.</p>
               <p>Q. It is your dwelling house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How is the laundry connected to your dwelling house - A. A wall goes down on each side, to the foot of the garden from my house in <placeName id="t18091101-4-crimeloc24">Gower-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Are they in the same enclosure - A. Yes, I go down the garden between two walls.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no intermediate passage to it - A. No, there is an outlet; there is a door to the laundry, and there is a door that goes into the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that door in the fields open - A. No, it was seldom used the lock was rusty, we had no communication with the fields; it was barricadoed with old boxes and trunks because we had no occasion to open it.</p>

               <p>Q. If any body had come in they must have opened the window and shut it down again - A. We found the back door open.</p>

I have no doubt of him, he had a brown coat on when he was brought back, he appeared to me to be the same person who had dropped the bundle; I have had the custody of the things ever since, except the articles that were delivered up.</p>

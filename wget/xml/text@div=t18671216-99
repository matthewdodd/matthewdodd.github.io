               <p>not till next morning—I observed nothing that night, except the bruise on the forehead, and that was not very large then—about the size of a shil<lb></lb>ling—next morning between eleven and twelve, when I washed it, I saw that the bruise was getting much larger and darker, and I observed what looked like finger-marks upon the arm, like the check of finger-marks on both arms—there was no one in the room at that time but myself—the child eat a good breakfast that morning—about half-past one she took a fit, and died about two o'clock—I don't know whether it was a fit or a convulsion—I never saw any one like it before—I went for Dr. Pearl, who had attended me off and on since I have been at Woolwich—I went again at six o'clock and saw him; and I and Mrs. Barrett, my landlady, went to the police—Mrs. Boyce lives in the next room to me—I heard nothing from her about the child when I came home that day, not till seven or eight hours after it was dead, between eight and nine in the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the police at Woolwich. On Thursday night, the 10th October, about half-past ten, I was called to see the child of Mrs. Golding; it had been dead, I should say, several hours—I examined it—I ascertained its age, a year and nine months—it was rather small for that age, a badly-nourished child—the greater part of its trunk, and limbs, and head were bruised all over; there were bruises on all the upper extremities, I mean the forehead and arms—a severe slap might occasion the bruises on the extremities and trunk, but not the one on the forehead which I saw, I remarked that particularly at the time; it was a prominent swelling, and was discoloured, like an ordinary bruise—it was about the size of half an egg—it appeared to be recent—they were all recent bruises—the child was in an atrophete condition, I found subse<lb></lb>quently that it was diseased—I made a post-mortem examination in con<lb></lb>junction with my assistant—I first opened the head—I pulled down the scalp on to the face and found that the bruise that I had observed on the surface of the forehead permeated through all the textures to the bone—I removed the skull-cap, and on a portion of the brain, corresponding to the frontal bone and to the bruise, there was another bruise of a similar kind, corresponding to the external bruise—I found the brain generally gorged with black liquid blood, I would not call it extravasation, it is a condition that you frequently find in children, from growing development going on—on the first night of the examination I passed my finger into the windpipe to ascertain if any foreigu body had been lodged there, I did not discover any—I then took out the trachea and lungs together—I found the lungs in a very engorged condition, which is called hepatisation, that would assimilate it more to the condition of liver—the inference I drew from my examination was that the child died from irritation of the brain, the consequence of the bruise on the forehead; that I bef ieve to have been the direct cause of death; it would be sufficient to account for it—I could not see any other cause to account for death; I must qualify that to a cer<lb></lb>tain extent; there was disease in the lungs of a very dangerous character, the result of inflammation either acute or chronic, I should say it was of a chronic character—I should think the cause of death was the bruise on the brain; had I not found that bruise, I might, in the absence of other symptoms, have been led to suppose that the hepatised condition of the lungs might have occasioned death, but the bruise was such an apparent cause that I naturally seized hold of that as the cause of death—I could not account for the death in any other manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Suppose you had found no bruise on the head, would you have attributed the death to the condition of the lungs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can scarcely bring myself to think so in so sudden a case—there is no doubt on my mind that the bruise on the head caused death—that might be caused by a fall from a chair—the skin is tender in children—a slight thing would leave a bruise in so thin a child—I don't think the bruises I saw were caused by the child falling about the floor; if it was standing up and fell on the floor that portion of the body that came in contact with the</p>

               <p>ground might have a bruise, not such as I saw on the forehead, but the others—there were several bruises all over—it would necessitate six, seven, or eight successive falls, or more, to produce them—some of them might have been produced by a fall or falls.</p>

I never ill-used the child, I only slapped it once or twice on the arms and legs; it fell off of the chair; it had been bad for some time"—on the way to the station he said, "The child was very dirty and often had fits."</p>

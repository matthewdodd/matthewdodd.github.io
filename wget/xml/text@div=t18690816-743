                  </hi> I live at 4, Sherborne Street, Islington, and, until Saturday, the 24th July, I was in the employ of Messrs. Pantin, wholesale drysaltery of Upper Thames Street—they have twine on the pre<lb></lb>mises, but do not manufacture it—I was under-warehouseman, and had to pack parcels—I have been there about twenty years—I have known the prisoner about eighteen years—I have taken twine from my master's place; stolen it—I took some twine in June—it is done up in eight pound parcels, containing two dozen—after I took them I gave them to the errand boy to take to the Parcels' Delivery Office—I directed them to "Chas. Catherall, 8, George Road, Bunhill Row, St. Luke's"—on 27th May, I packed a parcel containing two dozen, directed to that place—I gave the parcel to the errand boy named Banting to take to the Parcels' Delivery Office—I also</p>

               <p>packed a parcel containing two dozen on 17th June—I addressed that in the same way, and sent it by the same boy—on 23rd June I packed another parcel, containing twenty-four pounds; addressed it in the same way, and pave it to the same boy to take to the Parcels' Delivery Company—on the 1st July I did the same—I think I had a conversation with the prisoner before I sent the parcel on 17th June—he asked me to send things to him—he knew in whose service I was—Messrs. Pantin carried on business first iu Smithfield—the prisoner had been there—ho did not come to the present warehouse—he paid me for the twine—he paid me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 17th and 23rd of Juue, for the twenty-four pounds—he paid me at the Coach and Horses, Graham's Buildings, Bunhill Row—that is about five minutes' walk from his place—he is a horsehair manufacturer—I met him at the Coach and Horses sometimes once a week, sometimes twice—just about the 1st July he said there was someone watching in the street, that he did not know whether they were watching him, but it would be best not to send anything else—that was shortly after I sent the last parcel, on 1st July—the next day, I believe—previous to that I sent parcels to him, sometimes once a month, sometimes once a fortnight—he has paid for those—on most occasions I met him at the Coach and Horses—I have been to his place of business—very seldom—I have not seen him there for a long time.</p>

Pantin are supplied with twins, they do not make it—I am not in the habit of doing a little commission business on my own account—I never sold anything besides twice to the prisoner—I might occasionally have got him a brush or two at various intervals—they belonged to my employers—I have got brushes for other persons, and I have got the invoices for them here—they were charged to me in the usual way—I might have obliged various friends in that way, not above two or three—there were not a dozen—I may have obliged as many as that in the course of three or four years—they were not members of the Loan Society—I have not supplied anything else but brushes and twine out of my masters warehouse—I have six children—I said at the Police Court that I received on an average 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week from the prisoner, but I corrected it afterwards to 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I charged him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—they were worth about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the average price of the twine is from 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner used to buy horsehair from my employers—he used to go to the factory for it—that was four or five years ago—he told me about five years ago that he was hard up for some string for tying up his goods, and he asked me if I could get him some cheap—that was when we were at Smithfield—I recollect when he came for some bristles that I asked him to buy some old rope and gummy bags—he did buy them, and paid for them afterwards—they belonged to</p>

               <p>on several other occasions—I have seen the prisoner in Bunhill Row, and have seen him and Marchant together frequently, six or seven times during the three weeks I have Urn watching them—on one occasion, in the bar of the Coach and Hones, I saw the prisoner put his hand in his pocket and pass to Marchant, as if there was something in it—I was too far away to see what it was—on the 9th July I was watching in Bunhill Row—the prisoner came to me and asked if I had got a job on there, and asked what I was waiting for—I said I was waiting for a friend—I had communicated with Messrs. Pantin before that—I afterwards went to the prisoner's house with Mr. William Patin—I said to him, "Catherall, do you know a man named Marchant?"—he said he knew him by being secretary to a club that he belonged to—I nuked him if he had seen him lately—he said, "No, it is some time ago since I saw him"—I then asked him if he had been in the habit of receiving parcels from Marchant by the Parcels' Delivery Company—he said, "No"—I said, "On 23rd June did you receive one," and then I asked him to account for one on the 1st July—he said at first he did not receive one, and afterwards he said, "Oh yes. I had one from the New Kent Road"—I then referred to the 23rd June and some other dates, and he said he had never received them—I said, "I know better than that, because I have seen you together frequently, and I have been to booking-offices which have delivered parcels to you"—he still said he had not received any—I did not take him into custody then, I took him on 29th July, the Monday following—he then said he was perfectly innocent of it, and never had the string of Marchant.</p>

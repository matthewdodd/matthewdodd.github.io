               <p>Q. That was the other man? - A. Yes; I then asked him, where the bills of exchange were; he told me, in the book; I turned round to look in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100016"></xptr>the book, and he took the advantage of that, and whipped out of the shop in an instant.</p>

               <p>Q. Then the prisoner was apprehended? - A. I came in and found the bill for 180 l. was wanting; I asked him what became of it; he told me that it was at Mr. Gray's, in Billiter-square; I asked him to go with me to Mr. Gray's; he consented very readily to go with me; he went with me then and I found the bill there; and Mr. Duce followed me with an officer, and he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bolland. Q. The other man that delivered the pocket-book ran out of the shop; I believe the reason why you did not take him was, that some of the Royal Family were going to the India-house, and he got into the crowd? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You then asked him where the other bill was, the 180 l. and he very readily told you, and he went with you to Mr. Gray's? - A. Yes, he did.</p>

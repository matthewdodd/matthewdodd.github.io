            . I am a watchman of Kingsland-road. This building is about one quarter of a mile from my beat. On the morning of the robbery, about half-past five o'clock, after I had been to the watch-house and left my coat, I met the prisoner in Kingsland-road, about half a mile from the watch-house, going towards London, in a direction from the prosecutor's house, with something in a bag on his shoulder - he was alone: I collared him, and enquired what he had got; he said</p>
               <p>"What is that to you" - I took him the watch-house: the bag had some lead in it, which weighed 53 lbs.: the edges were bright, as if fresh cut - it was afterwards claimed by Mr. Honeysett: I saw it placed in the gutter, and it fitted exactly: the prisoner gave no account how he came by it: there was some more lead found that morning; I had seen the prisoner at twelve o'clock, and again at three, with two others, coming from a ditch where some lead was afterwards found.</p>

I am an officer; the watchman called<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160062"></xptr>on me with the prisoner - I searched him, and found a knife in his pocket, which appeared to have been cutting lead: he told me that a milk boy was going along, and told him there was a bit of lead, and told him to take it up, which he did.</p>

               <p>"Here is some lead which has been here this half hour, take it up, and come along with me to the watch-house." I took it up, and walked a little way; the watchman met me, and took me.</p>

            . I live with my father and mother in Queen-square. I came home on this Sunday night, but I cannot tell at what time; my brother was in bed first. When I came home I let myself in, and asked my mother whether I should fasten the door - she was in her bed-room, but awoke, and answered,</p>
               <p>"Yes, they are all in." I had been at Hoxton Academy-chapel, and then went with some young men to take a walk, and then met some young women, and went home with them; but I am certain I got home before twelve o'clock. I awoke the next morning, when my brother was dressing, and asked him what time it was: he looked at the watch, and said it was not five. I cannot tell whether he had been out before; I did not know of his being taken up till Wednesday or Thursday. I think it was my sister who told me, when I enquired on Tuesday morning why he had not come, she said he had slept at his master's. I came home on Tuesday night, they were all in bed: I did not enquire on Wednesday morning, because they were not up when I went out. On Wednesday night I asked where Samuel was; they began to cry, and then told me he had been taken up. I think it was impossible he could have gone out without my seeing him - I had double-locked the door, and put the key in my coat pocket; there are not two keys to the door.</p>

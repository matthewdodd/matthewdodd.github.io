I live at the Kent Waterworks, Mill Lane, Deptford, where I am foreman—my house is about thirty yards from the office—on the morning of 8th August I was called up by the police; in consequence of what they told me I went to the back of the premises, and round to the side, and saw three men in the office, down on their knees, overhauling the things in a drawer—I can't speak to either of them but Ingram—I looked at them—I was afraid to move away, and I sang out to the police, "Look out I" and I smashed a pane of glass in the office, to make the men start, to get away—they moved sharply, and made all manner of ways, and went to the back, through the board room, to the back window—I had noticed that that win<lb></lb>dow was shut as I passed it to go round; but as I went to the back, they came and pulled down the top sash, and as Ingram came out I floored him, and threw him on the pavement, not by a blow, by hand and foot, tripped him up—I am a Cornish man—he climbed over the bottom sash, and got out in that way—the second man was after him, as quick as lightning almost, out of the same window, and I floored him alongside of Ingram—I then had both of them on the ground—I then received a blow on the head; I don't know from whom—it cut my head—I was obliged to let go of one of them, but I stuck to Ingram—he struggled and kicked and bit all he knew, to get away—he bit my hand severely—I have got poultices on four places now—it broke the skin, and blood flowed—I also got a severe wound on the wrist. I suppose from a chisel or screw driver—I got that during the struggle—the other men made their escape—the police then came to my assistance—in my struggle with the second man, I suppose I tore this coat, but I can't swear anything about the other man at all—I know I floored two, and had them under me by each collar for a certain time—I can't say whether the second man bit or kicked me.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ, and had slept in my house for about six weeks. On the evening of the 4th of December, between five and six o'clock, he came to the bar and asked for a light, to go up stairs; I thought it was to go and clean himself, as usual; he took the light, went up stairs, and I never saw him afterwards; in about an hour I went up stairs to clean myself, and found my bed-room door open - I went in - my wife followed me, to give me some clean linen - she opened the drawer, and missed her gowns; I then looked with her, and we missed the sheets and some damask table-cloths - she then missed some shifts; the prisoner never came back; next day we got most of our things back; I think no one of them is worth 5l. - the pelisse cost six guineas, when new, but is not worth that now.</p>

            . I am apprentice to a butcher, of Tottenham-court-road. The prisoner came to my master's shop about nine o'clock on Tuesday night, the 4th of December, with a bundle; he called me out of the shop, and asked me if Phoebe Joyce was at home - she is my master's servant - he said he was her brother, and had come out of the country, and he would be obliged if I would give her that bundle; he pulled out a handful of silver from his pocket, and gave me 6d. for myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Were your door and window fastened before you went to bed? - A. Yes, I saw all fast; I did not get up till eight o'clock; I heard nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the first up? - A. No, one of my lodgers, her name is Lewin; when I got up, I saw my little back wash-house had been broke open, it is a part of my house; I missed two saucepans.</p>
               <p>Q. You said your window was broke open - was it a casement or a sash? - A. It had two lights in it; one light was broke, and the other was whole, and the one broke was taken out; there was room enough for a person to get through; I missed a plumb-pudding in a dish, a bit of salted beef undressed, and a bit of bread, they were standing in the pantry adjoining.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen these things there the night before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner? - A. Yes; he was born in the neighbourhood, I believe, he has been working about there some time; I had seen him a few days before.</p>
               <p>Q. He does not lodge in your house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see your dish, and your other things? - A. On Sunday morning; they were brought to me, that is all I know.</p>

               <p>Q. Which way did those footsteps lead, to or from the house? - A. They led into another great garden, were there was a ladder that he might get over the pales; we found the ladder standing there against the pales; we traced him to a barn, about half a mile off, where we found the prisoner lying, and the property in the barn, in a sack.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he asleep? - A. No, he was not asleep; he said he came there by reason of the water being so high he could not get over to his own lodgings; we searched the sack, and there we found the property lost, he was lying near the sack; I asked him how the sack came there; he said he knew nothing of it; we took him back to the woman.</p>

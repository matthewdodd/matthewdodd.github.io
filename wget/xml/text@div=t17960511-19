               <p>On the 22d day of March, I went to the prisoner's house, I never saw her before; I went to her house along with another person, and the other person asked where Mrs. Joyce was, they said, she was not at home; we staid till she came in; in the mean time, a man, in a brown coat came in, and asked for her, and when she came in, the man asked her if she had got any thing, and then she put her hand to her pocket, and pulled out a brown paper; she laid it on the table, and that same man picked out fifteen little ones, as he called them, and he gave her 3s. for them, and then the person that was with me, said to her, let this good woman have some, and she said, how many, I said, a shilling's worth, and she said, a very poor customer, indeed; she picked me out five, and the woman told me to let her have some French ones, upon that I took the five and gave her 1s. (produces them).</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any other man there? - A. Yes; a man with a fore leg.</p>

               <p>I apprehended the prisoner, and found twenty-one counterfeit shillings, and twenty-four sixpences in a cupboard in the room; I found nothing on the person of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those five sixpences, and say whether they are counterfeits? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know whether this woman is a married woman or not? - A. I believe she is, I have not a doubt of it; I told her husband that I must search the place.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know if any body else lodges in this place? - A. I heard her say, there was a man lodged there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she tell you, that this very room was let out to somebody else? - A. She did not, nor I never heard it.</p>

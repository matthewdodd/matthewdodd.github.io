               <p>N. B. On the application of the constable in this last trial, who was a housekeeper in Wellclose-square, for his expences, the Court wished it to be generally understood that all witnesses that attend are not necessarily to be allowed for their attendance, but only those poor persons that lose their time, and daily labour; and that where a great number of witnesses, and constables, for instance, were bound over, such would not, in future, be allowed their expences. Mr. Alderman Watson observing, that himself, and the Jury, and every man that attended there, on the business of the sessions, were taken from their employments; but in doing what they could to protect society, their reward was with themselves.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer's labourer, and live in Lambeth. On the 28th of April the prisoner, who lived next door, came to my door, and called out that she would break the door, or else have me out of the house—I went up stairs to get my hat, and when I came down my wife told me not to open the door, as she had something in her hand <hi rend="italic">to</hi> hit me with, but I opened the door, and she was on the railing between her own door and mine—she let go of the knocker—I asked what she was <hi rend="italic">kicking up a row</hi> about, and told her to go in doors—she drew the arm of a chair from her side, and aimed a blow at me—I put up my right arm and parried it—she struck again, and I saved that; but the third blow struck me over the eye, and stunned me—I was taken to the hospital—my head was only cut in one place—the sight of my eye was affected a little—I cannot open it yet—I had not given her any cause to attack me—I had complained to the landlord that she <hi rend="italic">kicked up rows</hi>, and I could not sleep there, and when he came for her rent the door was always locked—she has lived next door seven or eight months, and has been complained of by the neighbours as well as me—she is single.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I lived there twelve months—before Christmas, the prosecutor robbed me of two sovereigns; I went in with a young woman, and said to Mrs. O'Brien, "You took my money;" she said, "I did not;" on the Friday night before this happened the prosecutor went up the court in a new flannel jacket bought out of my money; in the afternoon his wife was washing, and made a mess before my door; I wiped it away, and she got the door-mat and slapped it in my face; next morning she bad a large Irish woman, who struck me with a stick; on Sunday morning she called me a w——, and all the names she could think of, and next morning also; "I said, "If I am a w——, I will never be such a w——as your sister;" the prosecutor made a blow at me; I ran into my own place, took up the back of the chair, and struck him twice. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I had not struck at her, and never did, nor was I ever present when anybody did so; my wife never struck her in my pre<lb></lb>sence—they have had a few words, but I was not there.</p>

On the Sunday morning in question I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner at her own door—she reached over the railing which separates the two houses, and knocked at O'Brien's door—he came out, and asked what made her do it—she went in, and ran out with the back of a chair, and made two or three blows at him—he put up his right hand to save the two blows, and the third blow she hit him in the eye—he was in a senseless state, and bled—he was taken to a surgeon's, and then to the hospital, in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he had not given her the least provocation—she locked herself in her own house after she had done it.</p>

I met the prosecutor, bleeding—I afterwards went to the prisoner's house—she refused to open the door—I called to her—she tapped at the door, and would not open it—I then took the prosecutor to the doctor's—he was dressed, and sent home, and fainted away—I took him to another surgeon's, and he sent him to the hospital—I returned to the prisoner's house, and asked her to open the door—she would not—I got the shutters open—she was lying in bed—I told her she must go with me for what she had done—she said, "Very well," and took some time to dress herself—she said she did not care a d——if she had killed him—I saw a broken chair lying on the bed by her side, and asked what the did that</p>

                  </hi>. I was assistant in the Eye Infirmary at Guy's Hospital. The prosecutor was brought there on Sunday, the 28th of April, with a jagged wound over the right eye-brow, about an inch and a half long—the interior of the eye bad also been injured, and some loss of vision had resulted in consequence—he remained under my care till Monday—symp<lb></lb>toms of inflammation had then begun to show themselves—the eye is now in a state to recover, I believe—it appeared to have been a violent blow—such an instrument as this would produce it—he was not bleeding when I saw him—it was not a dangerous wound, but there was danger of erysipelas.</p>

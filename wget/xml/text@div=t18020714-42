               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. Do you mean to say the prisoner had not frequented your house? - A. I had seen him twice before.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury - With that submission and respect which I am aware is due from a person in my situation to this Court, and that candid impartiality which is the characteristic of an English Jury, I presume to state some facts which may take off some degree of the weight which my prosecutor wishes to impress upon your minds with respect to me; I have been brought up under a rigid, but respectable, worthy, and honest, parent, who has ever taught me the paths of rectitude, honour, and propriety, and given me a liberal education; at a certain period, I was placed under the care of an affectionate uncle, who gave me an extensive property, with a house of forty guineas a year; having met with the greatest duplicity from those whom I have called my friends, and particularly that society which was held at Mr. Knight's house, as well as others, I had lost between four and five hundred pounds; those injuries I could have borne without regret, but this last injury has stung me to the quick; with these repeated losses I left business, and retired with the remainder of my property, which I had carefully deposited in the hands of an honest relation; the book in question, which the prosecutor alludes to, I had under my arm on the afternoon of the evening I went to his house, for the purpose of getting some little money due to me at Black wall, and to a house of the same description; I went there, and drank several pints of porter, and some shares of sixpenny-worths of rum and water; in passing this house, I knew the house, and I can bring respectable witnesses to prove that I have been many times at his house, I went into the house, and in that state in which a young man of my description ought not to have appeared; I was in a state of some intoxication, and from the admonition of my friends I had made a now not to go into a lodge-room again, having sustained so much injury from these clubs; I went in, expecting to see some persons who owed me money; I asked the girl for Mr. such a one; the girl said, she did not know the names of the persons who were there; I waited till the lodge was closed, and after it was closed, I went up stairs, and met with some persons that I knew; I went up, and had some rum and water with them; it was proposed by them to go down stairs; I went down stairs, and I know not why we should be introduced into the bar, in preference to any other part of the house - a part of the house which I should not have presumed to have entered, and there we had more rum and water; they wanted to drink some ale, but I gave my negative to that, chusing rather to drink porter, and I know not from that time who came in, or what time they went out; by this time I was in a great state of in oxication, I found that I was so, and as a proof of it, if I were placed upon an oath, which I would not forfeit, I should say I did not know the time of the night, whether it was eleven, twelve, one, or two, nor did I, upon my oath, were I put to it, know in what manner these people, whom they may call my friends, left me; I was accossed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180207140032"></xptr>by Mr. Knight, telling me it was time to go home; I got up, and knowing I had this book, I asked for it, he said, I had left it up stairs probably; he went up stairs, and said, it was not there; I told him it was of great consequence to me; they begged of him to look for it, as being at a publichouse, it was the more likely to be lost in the morning; I begged of him, and he was, as I then though, kind enough to go to several parts of the house, but his endeavours were fruitless; in coming down stairs, he said, I will take care of it if I find it, and wished me to go home; I went out for the purpose of going home, and he said, I have to speak to a watchman to call some one up, and, says he, you can go along with me; I went with him, and took hold of his arm, thinking him a friend, and walked with him; but instead of being in my own road to go home, I actually crossed a road almost uninhabited, which was the direct contrary way to my own home: My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I did not know that I had any thing in my pocket at the time, and when I came up with him to the watchman, he said, you have a pot of mine in your pocket; when I offered to wish him good night, I was astonished, and asked him if he was serious; I put my hand in my pocket, and found one, I put my hand in my other pocket, and found another; the measure was in my waistcoat-pocket, there was a large hole in it, and the measure went through.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

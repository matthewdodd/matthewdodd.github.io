            . I lost fifteen guineas and a-half. I was exceeding drunk last Saturday night, that is true; and coming home, in Long Acre, two women met me, and inveigled me to go home with them, that was the prisoner and another woman; I am sure I did not know what I did.</p>
               <p>Jury. Dont treat it with levity.</p>
               <p>Stone. I do not treat it with levity; I went to bed; I waked in a quarter of an hour; and finding myself in a room by myself, with my cloaths gone (for I could find none,) I ran down stairs, I laid hold of somebody, and called out, I have been robbed of a great sum of money. There was somebody there, said, what do you want? another voice said, what do you want? like a woman's voice. I thought Lord Jesus Christ, I shall be murdered here; for I was pretty well sobered. I got near the sash, thinking, I had better jump out of the window than be killed by them. I there cried out. Watch, murder and thieves! as loud as I could. The watchman came at last; though there were lights all round, nobody would open a window, or come out; at last the watchman came. I said, for God sake, assist me, for I shall be murdered in this place, I have unhappily come into. I ran down to him; I came up again to the door where I had been sitting at the window, the door was fast against me; the watchman threatened to break the door open. I had nothing but my shirt on; I found my gold watch upon the table. I said to the watchman, I have saved my gold watch, thank God: he said, I must have that. He took it, he produced it at the watch-house, and before the justice, without the outside case. In about five minutes, he went away with the watch; to call assistance, and brought a whole possey of watchmen. They broke open the door, and found two men and two women. I described the person that was with me, as being without a tooth; here is the girl that went home with her: the two girls went home together. I said, do you go about your business; and away she went. She is here, and will prove, that the prisoner is the same person that was with me. The money was in my breeches pocket, and a bank note for fifteen pounds: they did not take that. When the watchmen broke into the room where the two men and two women were; they said, go up stairs. I went up into the two pair of stairs room; there I found my cloaths and the bank note in my pocket, and sixteen shillings worth of silver in the other; the fifteen guineas and an half were taken away.</p>
               <p>Court. As you was very drunk, are you positive you had the fifteen guineas in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Stone. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Court. How came they to spare your bank note, do you think?</p>
               <p>Stone. Because I imagine they supposed it to be waste paper, and did not know the value of it.</p>
               <p>Court. What are you, Mr. Stone?</p>
               <p>Stone. In the building way.</p>

            . I went home with the prisoner and the gentleman; he desired me to go with him; I went. The gentleman desired I would go out of the room, which I did; I heard nothing of it till next morning: the gentleman was very much in liquor.</p>

            . One Lyon, a constable, and I, went to look for the prisoner, from an information the gentleman gave of her, we heard she had been at the Bull and gate, at Holborn. We heard she had been at a night cellar where people drink beer; we sat at the door till it was dark; by and by the prisoner came down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177507120035"></xptr> with a man; we did not know her, then till the landlord of the house told us. She had been there before with a black capuchin; she had none on then. I went into the box, I did not know her then. I put my finger to her tooth; I saw her tooth was broke; I said, this must be the woman: we had better search her. We searched her, she had five shillings in her pocket. I asked her, if she lived in such a place, or knew one Scott that kept the house: she said, no. Then as she went along, we desired Mr. Lyons to search her. Mr. Lyons took her into a room; we could not find any thing more upon her. Mr. Lyons talked to her some time, and then she acknowledged she had six guineas and a half of the gentleman's; she said she took it from his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any promises made to induce her to confess?</p>
               <p>Hide. Yes, he said he would forgive her.</p>

               <p>Court. Are they here?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She owned it to this girl.</p>
               <p>Jones. She owned it in Mr. Welche's office.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was present?</p>
               <p>Jones. One of Mr. Welche's clerks.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he promise her any mercy in case she confessed?</p>
               <p>Jones. She did not say where she took it, nor how, only that she took six guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Court to the prosecutor. How long was you in bed before you discovered this?</p>
               <p>Stone. Not above a quarter or half an hour. I apprehend, for I was frightened out of my wits almost.</p>
               <p>Court. You was drunk at the time.</p>
               <p>Stone. I growed very fresh; I growed very sober when I found I had lost my money.</p>
               <p>Jury. Where did you put your breeches?</p>
               <p>Stone. Upon the side of the bed?</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I do not know any thing of this affair laid to my charge; I have no witnesses; I have no friends in the world.</p>
               <p>Jury. Where did she make this confession?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. In the round house, before four or five people: I did not hear her confess.</p>

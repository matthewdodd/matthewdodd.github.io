On Sunday morning, the 2d of May, about eight o'clock, I was informed that my premises were broken open and robbed; and at 12 o'clock the officers came, and said they had taken some men. I had a sow and nine pigs in a stable adjoining my house; it is all in one range of building under one roof; you go from the house to the granary, then into the barn, and from there into the stable, without going into the air.</p>

            . I am gardener to Mr. Sherwood. On the 1st of May, my master had a sow and nine pigs. I locked them up safe in the stable at half-past seven o'clock in the evening; there was also some fowls and rabbits in the stable, and in the morning, about half-past seven, I missed three rabbits and five pigs, and found the stable door forced open by a chisel or some instrument, and a great coat of mine was stolen; I saw two of the pigs that evening. I thoroughly examined them at the watchhouse, and am sure they are two of the five pigs.</p>

            . I am keeper of Pentonville watch-house. On Sunday morning, the 2d of May, at little after four o'clock, I was standing at the top of Chapel-street, Penton-street, talking to the watchman - it was daylight, and had been so for half an hour - two persons passed me. I suspected them, and went down the road; and nearly opposite the Belvidere I caught hold of one of them, whose name is Jerdan - he got from me, and threw down a pig, and then a rabbit, and sprang from me, but was eventually taken, and put into the watchhouse. I returned, and picked up the rabbit and pig - they were dead. I was returning to the watchhouse, and nearly on the spot where Jerdan ran from; I saw the prisoner; he was not one of the two; but suspecting him from his appearance I collared him, and said he was my prisoner - he raised his arm. I said if he raised his arm I would break it. I called two watchmen, took him to the watchhouse, and found a pig under his smock frock. Jerdon afterwards got away - they were both taken from the watchhouse, and fully committed. I shewed the two pigs to Daniels; they were not quite cold. The prosecutor shewed me his live pigs - they appeared of the same litter.</p>

               <p>Q. That is the letter that came with the bill, is it not - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Do you never receive letters at any other place than at Charing Cross - A. No, sir. If they came through Ramsbottom I might have received them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you received letters from Ramsbottom - A, Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you know of ever receiving any letters from Ramsbottom - A. I never recollect ever of receiving of any one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alleys Bills - A. I have received bills, certainly. I am certain this letter was not received from Ramsbottom. I perfectly recollect receiving this letter, and this bill. I am certain it was not received from Ramsbottom. This bill, if it came through Ramsbottom, Ramsbottom's endorsement would be upon the bill. I perfectly recollect receiving<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181301130028"></xptr>this bill, and, namely, at the office, another clerk entered it. It was received with several others, no doubt, that day. It is made payable to

It was replaced by some other bills to the amount of seven hundred and seventy pounds.</p>

               <p>Mr. Solicitor General, Q. to Mr. Daniel. Look at that letter, Mr. Daniel, it bears your name; is that letter written by you - A. It is not, any part of it, nor by my authority.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hand writing is it - A. It is the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>Q. Part of it are observations in red ink; are they as the rest, the prisoner's hand writing - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the introductory part; it supposes to be an answer to a letter; what date is it - A. The 17th instant.</p>
               <p>Q. What is instant - A. July, 1812.</p>
               <p>COURT. What is the date of that - A. 21st of July, 1812. It purports to be an answer to the 17th instant, and dated the 21st.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General Had you, upon the 21st of July, seen or had any letter of the 17th refered to, by it - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. Now, I propose this being proved to be the hand-writing of the prisoner, and not by the authority of Mr. Daniel. I mean to give by Mr. Ridge's book the letter of the 17th. I do not mean that as a proof by itself; that letter came to the hand of the prisoner, it shows that the prisoner, by some means, was the principal that became acquainted with that letter. I therefore propose to give your lordship, by Mr. Ridge's book, that letter of the 21st.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The original must be produced.</p>
               <p>Mr. Solicitor General. Where is it. Captain Daniel said he received no such letter. This must be the prisoner's hand-writing, and this must have been in the posession of the prisoner. I gave him notice to produce it; he does not produce it. My learned friend says, I admit it. Supposing this letter came to the hands of Mr. Daniel, before I could go into the copy I must shew the original was destroyed or lost, that is enough. If Mr. Daniel say, I received a letter on the 17th, I have destroyed it or lost it, than the copy becomes evidence here. I do not want it in this case, because of that letter. The prisoner raises all the inference that I want I do not want to press that he opened that letter; it is enough that such a letter was known to the prisoner, and if it appears to the Court that the original is not produced, then I will read the prisoner's letter to Mr. Ridge, in the name of Daniel, 21st of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Daniel. Look at this; this is a letter of the 15th of July; it is writen in Mr. Daniel's name. Is that the prisoner's writing - A. It is. It was not written by me, or by my authority.</p>

I went away, and in half an Hour she cry'd, Murder, worse than before. I ran down again, and found her in the Entry, but no Body meddled with her then, tho' presently after, the Prisoner open'd the Door, and threw half a Pint of Water on her, and with that she lean 'd her Head, as if she was going to sleep.

There was a large Fracture in the Skull, which began over the Right-ear, ron to the Orbit of the Eye, and thence to the upper Jaw-bone, and in two or three Places of it, small Pieces of the Skull were beat in. The Skull being remov'd, I found 8 Ounces of extravasated Blood, part between the first Skin and the Skull, another part between the first Skin and the Second, and the rest in the two lateral Ventricles of the Brain. The Skull being broke in, was the Occasion of her Death.</p>

Whitehouse going to help her up, Arnot gave him a Push, and down fell he and the old Woman together. The Prisoner coming in, she struck at him with a Stick, and thereupon he took it from her, broke it across his Knee, and threw it upon the Fire. Says I, That's my Stick Then I'll give you another for it, says he, but I took it for the old Woman's Keffel - We call'd it her Keffel because she was a Welsh-woman. Then he got her Stick and burnt that too; and while it was burning, Alcroft came in for a Candle. Says I, Let's go, for we can't be at quiet here. No don't, says the Prisoner, and I'll turn her out. So he took her out into the Entry, and left her there, and fasten'd the Door.

            . She cry'd Murder, as she frequently did when she was drunk - I went into the Kitchen in the Afternoon, when she took up a Poker, and cry'd, God damn you all, I'll do some of you: Mischief - I came at Night and found her in the Entry, she was neither up nor down, but tapping against the Door, and cry'd, You Dogs, you Sons of Bitches; open the Door, God damn you, and let me come in. Mr. Box answer'd, God damn you, for a noisy Bitch, you shan't come in here. I went to Market, and when I return'd, she was still crying Murder, and my Husband told me, she had been crying Murder ever since - I saw one Gethings helping her up a Stair or two, and afterwards I saw her rowling about the Entry, and crying, Curse you, curse you all. She had not a Drop of Blood on her then, tho' she was bloody when I saw her dead in the Kitchen.</p>
               <p>Box. The Prisoner was not out of our Company, but when he carry'd her into the Entry.</p>
               <p>Court. Why did you not appear and give Evidence before the Lord Mayor and the Coroner ?</p>
               <p>Box. No Body gave me Orders to appear.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said he heard there was a Warrant against him, and he was afraid to appear.</p>

            . I saw the Deceas'd drunk at 2 a Clock, I went to the Prisoner's several times from 8 till 9, and she was still crying Murder, tho' no Body was with her. At half an Hour past 8, she went up 2 Stairs and fell down with the Right side of her Head against the Post of the Stairs. She was mortal drunk, and could not get up again, and she was dead in a Quarter of an Hour after.</p>

            . Ann Johnson told me, she was not in the Kitchen, but saw what past thro' the Window and Key-hole of the Door.</p>
               <p>Ann Johnson. I never spoke to this Man, and besides, I could not tell him any such thing, for there is no Key-hole thro' the Door, and the Window is always shut at 7 a Clock. Indeed I was not in the Kitchen, and I never said I was; but that I stood in the Entry. I had no business in the House, but hearing Murder cry'd, I went out of Curiosity to see what was the Matter.</p>
               <p>Juryman. Did the Prisoner strike her with Violence.</p>
               <p>Alcroft. I can't say I thought it so violent as to murder her - He call'd her an old troublesome Bitch.</p>

               <p>Several other Witnesses swore that the Deceas'd was very often drunk, and very noisy and troublesome, and several others gave the Prisoner the Character of a civil quiet Man. The Jury found him <rs id="t17340227-51-verdict226" type="verdictDescription">

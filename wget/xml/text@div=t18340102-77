               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. What time of day was it? A. Half-past eight o'clock in the evening - it was moonlight - I do not swear to the prisoner, but I have not a shadow of a doubt he is the man - the money has not been found - I cannot say how long I had had the sovereigns, - I had them for my rent and taxes, which were due on Christmas-day - I have not paid my rent - I had had twelve sovereigns just before, and gave my husband one - I will swear I had them in my purse all that week; as near as I can recollect there were three half-crowns in my purse - the prisoner wanted two shillings - I said, "I do not think I have two shillings, but I will see;" - when my husband came home he said they were all half-crowns in the purse.</p>

            . I was in the shop when the prisoner came in for a quarter of an ounce of tobacco - I served him - he put down half-a-crown - I gave him five pence farthing change, but there was no silver in the till, and I called my mother to give him two shillings - she took out her purse, and the prisoner snatched it and ran out of the shop - there was money in the purse wrapped in paper, and some silver - I had before seen twelve sovereigns in the purse, but she gave my father one sovereign - I pursued the prisoner, and cried "Stop thief;" he was at first within a yard of me, but he ran faster than I could - I did not see him do anything with the purse; but as I was coming out at the door, there was a man who stopped me, and put his hands to my breast - the prisoner was stopped by Mr. Custance, who came out of his door and turned him back - he passed me again, and Mr. Newbiggin put out his hands and stopped him, and they all fell down together - I am sure the prisoner is the man - he had time to have given the purse to the man at the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many were running? A. Only the prisoner ran out of the shop - there were more persons running in the street, but I was the first after the prisoner - I was not more than two yards from him - I never lost sight of him - I did not see him give anything away, but he might have done it by some artful means - I heard some halfpence fall when they all fell down.</p>

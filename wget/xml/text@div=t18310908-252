On the 13th of August, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came in and bought two pairs of stockings, which came to 3s. 6d.; he gave me a 5s. piece, which the officer (Harrison) has - I saw him searched; another crown-piece was found in the lining of his hat, and a good shilling in his trousers pocket.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had gone to a pablic-house with a person and fallen asleep, during which time somebody must have changed his hat - and that upon putting the hat on a crown-piece fell out, which he thought was good.</p>

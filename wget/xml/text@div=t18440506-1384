                  </hi>. I live in John-street. On the 6th of May, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I went to Finsbury-square—I returned between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening, to my sister's—they had gone to bed, and I did not wish to disturb them—I went into a public-house in Ratcliff-highway—the prisoner was there—I asked her if she could recommend me to a quiet clean bed for the night, as I was locked out of my sister's house—she said she could recommend me to the house where she lodged—I asked her what the charge was, she said, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I had no objection to give that, provided it was clean and quiet—she took me across the road into a narrow court—I do not know the name of it, I never was there before—when I was a little distance up the court, I received a blow in the mouth from the pri<lb></lb>soner—before I could recover myself there were two men by her side—I do not know where they came from—I did not see them come out of any house—one of them gave me a violent blow in the eye, which knocked me down—then one man struck me with his fist, the other kicked me—while I was in that state the prisoner took a ring from my finger—she leant over me, and hurt my finger very much—she tore the bonnet off my head, my shawl off my back, and my shoes off my feet, and commenced tearing my gown—it was torn into ribbons—they beat me about the head till I was nearly insensible—then a man held me by the throat, and dragged me some distance up the court—I had a pocket-book in my lap in the house where I first met her—she saw it—she asked me if I could assure her I could pay for the bed, before she took me, and I opened my pocket-book to show her I could—I had three half-crowns—I put it back again—a female standing by said, "If you are not careful you will be robbed "—the prisoner said, "Put the pocket-book safe,"—I put it into my pocket, and there it remained till the following morning, and then I missed my money.</p>

On the morning of the 7th of May, about three o'clock, I found the prosecutrix in a privy, in Twine-court—her things were completely torn off her—she was nearly naked—two or three women, who informed me of her being there, got some pins, and pinned her things together, and one, for decency, even lent her an apron—she seemed insensible, from kicks, blows, and ill-usage—her neck was all blood, her eye black, and her face cut, and covered with blood—I took her to the station, and in consequence of information I received from Hordey, I apprehended the prisoner in bed, in a house in Twine-court—I told her what I wanted her for—she said she never saw the woman—I searched her, and only found a penny on her.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner put in a written defence, declaring her innocence, stating that the prosecutrix had treated her at two public-houses with ale and rum, and had afterwards slept at a house of ill-fame; that the witness Hordey was a common prostitute, and unworthy of belief, having been in prison for felony; that she did not know what money the prosecutrix had.</hi>)</p>

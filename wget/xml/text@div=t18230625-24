On Sunday evening, the 22d of December, I went out at half-past five o'clock, to go to chapel, and left the house in care of Kenaley and Griffiths - Griffiths had to go to Duke-street, to feed the horse, and would then go home. When I went out my doors and windows were safe. I gave the boys leave to sit in the middle parlour to tea; but the inner parlour, where this property was, was locked, and the key in my pocket. I had twenty sovereigns and two cheques in a drawer, with the key of the iron chest. The iron chest was enclosed in a cupboard by the fire place in the same room, and had a vast quantity of silver, crown pieces, and guineas in it; some of them light - also a great many sovereigns, seven shilling pieces, half-guineas, and Bank notes; all the money together amounted to above 600 l., cheques and all. I was fetched from my brother's about nine o'clock, went home immediately, and found my daughter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250012"></xptr>and Mrs. Broadfield, the lodger. The inner room door was open; a piece of a picklock key was afterwards found in the lock - the drawer was wrenched open, and the lock hanging to it; the cheques and money were gone - they amounted to 70 l. together. The cheques were for 18 l. and 30 l. odd. The key of the iron chest was in the drawer. I unlocked the chest, and every farthing was gone and my market clothes which laid on the top of it were thrown into the middle of the room - the drawer had a patent lock upon it. An enquiry took place at Marlborough-street; I charged Kenaley with it, and about the 11th of February published bills, offering a reward for the apprehension of Chandler, and

I afterwards went to a house where I understood he lived, but could not find him - I saw him at Marlborough-street afterwards, charged with an assault, and asked him if his name was not Bob Whitbread; he said it was not, that it was Jenkins, and he was a gentleman's servant - the constable said, "Your name is

I found out on the Monday following that he lived at No. 28, Bett-street, New-road, Commercial-road - I went there with two officers, and saw them find a tool which appeared to have been made out of a shoemaker's rasp (a piece of which was broken off,) and a rent book. I afterwards saw the tool tried to my drawer, which I have here; the marks appear exactly to fit the tool. I am positive the prisoner is the man who called himself Jenkins. Griffiths has since left me, and I cannot find him.</p>

The number and distance of the notches on the rasp, and the impression are the same.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In the center of that lock is there not an impression of a smaller tool - A. Yes; there must have been more than one tool applied.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Two tools have been applied, but this must be one of them - A. Yes.</p>

            . I live in Bird-street. In December last I lived in James-street, near Grosvenor-square; the prisoner lodged in the next room to me. On the Sunday before Christmas-day, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, he came home in a great hustle with two or three more; they came up to his room together, and afterwards went down together, and about half past eight o'clock the prisoner came in again with two young men: I heard them very merry, and thought they were going to cards; I heard money jingling, and curiosity led me to get on the top of my bedstead and look through a hole in the wainscoat; I could see into his room, and saw money on the table as if they were paying the money down; I saw a good bit of gold and a quantity of silver, but cannot say how much; the silver was five shilling pieces; there seemed a good many. The prisoner was one of the men, and I think

             was another of them. I saw no cards; I could see all over the table, if there had been any I must have seen them. I know that before this the prisoner was very low in circumstances; his bed lay on a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182306250013"></xptr>mattress on the floor; and a day or two afterwards he seemed very prosperous; I saw his little boy playing with a five shilling piece; his wife came to pay Clayton 1 s., and I saw she had a large purse of gold; this was between the Sunday and Christmas day; they appeared very well off then, and lived well, and on Christmas day had a turkey, pork, and a large plumb pudding for dinner, and in that week bought a set of china, and bedding and bedstead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You nursed his wife with a child - A. Yes; in April - I told the Magistrate what I knew of this. I believe I told him about the gold and five shilling pieces, but I was so overcome, I do not know; there were three men with him in the room; he had gone out about six or seven o'clock that evening and came in with them. I peeped through the hole, because I suspected they were at cards.</p>

            . I live in Brown's-court, Green-street, Grosvenor-square. When the prisoner lived in James-street, I lodged in the room above him; he was very poor indeed before Christmas, they had borrowed sixpence of me on the Tuesday before Sunday the 22d of December, and my little girl pawned a good many clothes for them. On the Monday morning after the Sunday, his wife gave my daughter a sovereign, to fetch things out of pawn - she gave me two sovereigns to buy a bed tick with, and they lived in the greatest splendour. On the Christmas day, they had turkey, and on the Sunday following a goose. He left on the Sunday morning after the bills were posted; one was posted opposite the door, and that morning, some things were moved away, and next morning all the furniture was moved. The bills appeared on Wednesday or Thursday. I never saw him after that. His wife also gave my daughter a light guinea to redeem some things.</p>

            . The prisoner lodged with my husband, to the best of my knowledge, but he is a very altered man. I think he is the man - mine are weekly lodgers. He lodged with us four or five months, and left about four months ago; it was before Lady day. I did not see him after the bills were posted. He sometimes paid a fortnight's rent, and sometimes three weeks together. I believe this rent book to be my husband's writing.</p>

I do not know of their buying anything.</p>

I did not see them talk together.</p>

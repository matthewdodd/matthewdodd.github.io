Last Sunday I was at Mr. Plumb's, I had seen them in the stable on the Friday. On the Sunday, the prisoner and another man were at Mr. Plumb's, in the tap-room, I had never seen them before, to my knowledge, it was between twelve and one o'clock; one of them said, it is time we should go; he said, we may as well go the back way; there is a back way leads up a passage by the stable, where my quicksets were; I had a suspicion they might take some of them, as I had lost a great many at different times; they went the back way, I went out at the fore door, where I could command the passage; I stopped there, they did not come out of the passage while I stood there; I saw the prisoner come across the lane, with a bundle of quicksets under his arm; I am sure the prisoner is the man; I called to him, and told him he had got my property; I desired him to carry them back, and put them where he had them from, which he did; he then turned to go about his business; I said, no, friend, you are not to go off so; we went down the yard together, and he said, call Mr. Plumb out; I asked Mr. Plumb his name, and he told me; the prisoner said, he took them out to look at, to see if they were as good as his own; I saw nothing more of the other man; they were close together when I saw the prisoner with the quicksets, about six yards from the stable-door; there were twenty-nine bundles in the place; this was only part of a bundle; he could have carried a great deal more, I should suppose half a dozen bundles; each bundle generally contains one thousand; it is worth one shilling a hundred; it was part of two bundles.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am in the same line as he is; I went with another man through the stable, both doors were open; I took them out to the other man to shew them to him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

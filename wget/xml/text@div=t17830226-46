            , on Monday last, I shewed them several, and the other bought one, and paid for it, I suspected the prisoner, and they went to the door, and they hesitated at the door, whether they should keep the coat the other had bought, or change it for a green one; however the prisoner at the bar said, our time is short, let us be going, I went after her, and brought her back, and in presence of the other two customers that were in the shop, she dropped it down from under her cloak.</p>

               <p>What sort of one was it that the other woman bought? - A black stuff petticoat.</p>
               <p>Had they two, or only one between them? - The lady had the other.</p>
               <p>How do you know that is not the other petticoat that the other woman bought and paid for? - The other was a larger one, a great deal, and it was wrapped up in paper at the time we took them both before the justice; then the prisoner was apprehended.</p>

               <p>I went into the shop, the prisoner and the other woman was there before me; the gentleman asked me to sit down till he served them first, so I did: The gentleman served them, and he went after the prisoner; I did not see the prisoner take it, he brought the prisoner back again, and I saw it drop down.</p>
               <p>Where did it drop from? - From the prisoner, from under her cloak.</p>
               <p>Court to Rogers. Do you know you had such a petticoat as that before; can you swear it was Mr. Steel's? - Yes, my Lord, I am positive it is.</p>

               <p>I never took the petticoat, nor he could not swear at the Justices that I took it, I have no witnesses, the other woman is gone, I have people to my character sufficient: there were many petticoats on the counter.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that petticoat on the counter, at the time when she came in? - Yes, the prisoner said at the Justices, that that was the first offence she ever committed.</p>

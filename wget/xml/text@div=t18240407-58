He was stopped, and I came up immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not instantly say,</p>

               <p>"he has taken my bundle of linen;" the prisoner was then running down the street - I immediately attempted to lay hold of him - he pushed on the right hand side, but I caught him by the tail of his coat, and kept hold of him with the bundle.</p>

            . I was coming out of my father's door which is close to this spot; I heard a woman cry out before I opened the door - I ran, and saw a man turn the corner running, he was stopped in a moment with the bundle, and said he had picked it up. The prosecutrix fainted away the moment she saw that he was taken. I heard a tremendous blow, as if a head was knocked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070026"></xptr>against the shutter, as I was in the passage, and then I heard her cry out,</p>
               <p>"Oh!" and then</p>
               <p>"Stop thief!"</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. A push against the shutter might make that noise - A. It might; I went out instantly, and lost sight of the person, as I slipped - the prosecutrix was behind me.</p>

               <p>Q. If you lost sight of him, she must have done the same - A. I should think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you believe that it was some other man who took it, and not the prisoner - A. I thought so when I came to see him with the bundle, as he had an apron on, and I did not think that the man I saw running had an apron on.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What coloured apron was it - A. A blue butcher's apron. He said he had picked it up, and went quietly to the Compter; the prosecutrix fainted the moment he was taken; she was much agitated, and cried out</p>

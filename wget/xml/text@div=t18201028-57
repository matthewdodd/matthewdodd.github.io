               <p>"I will go." In about two minutes I was assaulted by sixteen or twenty desperate characters, who cried out,</p>
               <p>"Tom, don't go; muzzle the b - g - rs, chiv 'em!" (which means to cut.) I was knocked down, and my head beat in a most dreadful manner. Marsh was rescued. As I was rising up again I was struck above my eye with something sharp, and was covered with blood. One of the girls lent me an apron, and that was soaked through immediately. I am sure Powers was one of them - I cannot say that he struck me. I saw Parsons the width of the street off. On recovering myself I saw Parry kicked and beat in a dreadful manner. I went to the doctor's, who dressed my head and gave me some stuff.</p>

               <p>"Kill the b - g - rs, chiv'em!" I saw some of them hit Shires on the back of his head; the blow appeared to come from Powers.

                  </hi>. My father is a wholesale and retail ironmonger, in Bishopsgate-street Without—his name is Henry—the prisoner was his housekeeper, and had been so about three years—in consequence of infor<lb></lb>mation I examined the book which she kept of the goods furnished to the house—in the book kept by Bannister, the butcher, there is a leg of pork and a leg of mutton entered as ordered on the 26th of September—the prisoner was permitted to order the goods for the house, and pay for them—Mary Whitfield came to char for us—in consequence of what I discovered, I asked the prisoner what she had done with the leg of pork and leg of mut<lb></lb>ton—she said in my presence, and that of the policeman, that she had had them from the butcher's as a wedding present for her daughter, who was going to be married, and she intended to pay for them when she had her wages—I know they have been paid for by my father—here is his cheque which he paid for them—I have the butcher's book, by which I know of the payment of these articles—we paid our butcher's bill at different times, whenever the prisoner came for the money—she came to my father for money after this—I was not present—this cheque of my father's, with the butcher's name at the back, has been given to her—she had no authority from my father, or any one in the house, to part with the goods.</p>

I am in the habit of charing at Mr. Sanford's—I know Princes-place, Blackfriars—the prisoner had a son living there—in the month of September her daughter was about to be married, and in that month, by the prisoner's direction, I took a leg of pork and a leg of mutton to Princes-place, from Mr. Sanford's house—the prisoner packed them up in a basket, and covered it over with a tea-cloth, and desired me to take it to her son's in Princes-place, Blackfriars-road—she told me they were intended for her daughter's wedding, which was to take place on the following day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with James Philip and live at 67, St. James's-street—we are surgical-instrument makers—I know the prisoner Graves. On the 9th of Feb. he came in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to our shop, and offered me the check produced—he said he called to pay for the catheter supplied✗ to him by our young man, and he would give this check if I would give him the difference; which I did—it was 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the amount of his bill being 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him a five-pound note, four sovereigns, a half-sovereign two half-crows, and three shillings—I endorsed the check, and paid it into our banker's—it came back dishonoured.</p>

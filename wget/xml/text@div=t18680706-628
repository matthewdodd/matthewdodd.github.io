                  </hi>. I reside at 5, Pullen Street, Hanover Square, and am a solicitor's clerk—on Monday afternoon, July 6th, I was looking into a shop window in Holborn, when three young men came behind me—I had my watch and guard safe in a pocket on my left side—I heard a little clicking, felt my coat going back, and turned and saw the prisoner and one of the men, the prisoner was attempting to hand my watch to him—I thought he had the watch, and I caught hold of the prisoner and held him until a gentleman came up—he resisted and tried to throw me—the other men ran across the road.</p>

                  </hi>. M.D. I live at 32, Great Nelson Street, City Road—I saw the prosecutor looking into a shop in Holborn on Monday last—he was standing sideways to me—I saw the prisoner take the watch from his pocket, and pass it to another man, who ran across the road with it—I collared the prisoner and held him until a constable came up—I am quite certain I saw the prisoner take the watch—it was a silver watch and I saw it pass—there were other people round us, I cannot say how many—the prisoner was in the company of two other men.</p>

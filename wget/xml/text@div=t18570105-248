                  </hi>. I live at No. 21, Gloucester-street, Lambeth, and am a shoe-maker. I have known the prisoner about two years—on Friday night, 26th Dec, about 7 o'clock, his brother took me to his house—some words passed between him and his brother, and I interfered—when I came out, the prisoner followed me, and struck me, and knocked me down at his brother's door—I came away home with my wife, and sat down in my own place at my own fire, I, and my wife, and my daughter, and in twenty minutes or half an hour's time a party came and hit the door and the shut<lb></lb>ters with stones or bricks, enough to shake the house down—I got up and went out to see what it was, and as soon as I got out I was knocked down by the prisoner with a <hi rend="italic">clam</hi>—this is the <hi rend="italic">clam</hi>—he struck me on the head with it—I had no hat on—it was a hard blow, it knocked</p>

               <p>me down and cut my head—I bled very severely—after I was down, I was kicked by the prisoner's wife and this party—I had the thumb of my left hand injured—I do not recollect any further—I did not strike the prisoner first with the <hi rend="italic">clam</hi>—my wife did not strike him with the poker or a pot—she did not strike him before he struck me—I was outside, and she was inside—I never called him a cuckold, nor said that I had had his wife on the stairs.</p>

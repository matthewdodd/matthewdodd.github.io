             - A. Yes; he was a helper in my dyehouse; the first time he worked for me was about ten years ago; then he lived with me three years; then he left me, he went to Manchester and was drawn for a soldier; I think he returned to us about a twelvemonth ago, then he was to serve with us three years. On Wednesday the 30th of August I sent for the prisoner, hearing that he had enticed Hutchinson to go to America; he came; I charged him with the act of seducing Hutchinson to go to America with him; I told him our contract was for a term of years not expired, and that he was an artificer in the cotton line, I believed it to be an illegal act, and that if he continued in doing it I would prosecute him; he told me that he had agreed to pay his passage, and was to pay it that day, but from my information of his being an artificer, and also being my contract servant, he would not do it. On the 1st of September I went before the magistrate, Hewitt told the justice that he had paid the passage that day, and produced the mates receipt for the money, and also a note from Hutchinson to him for the passage, and money advanced to him. The receipt and note read.</p>

            . I am a journeyman dyer, I work for Messrs. Hughes and Lewis. I was at the Yorkminster public house about seven or eight days before Hewitt and Hutchinson was taken up. Hewitt and Hutchinson were there; I heard Hutchinson say that if Hewitt would pay his passage to America he would go, he was tired of his situation; I am a journeyman, Hewitt is a <rs id="t18090920-187-viclabel1096" type="occupation">labourer</rs>; I asked Hewitt what motive he had in it; he said he was only taking him in a friendly way; Hewitt said he would pay if he would trust to his honour in paying him back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the conversation originate with Hewitt - A. I believe Hutchinson began it to get Hewitt's consent to pay the passage. About two days after that I heard Hutchinson say he would stick to Hewitt as long as he had a button to his coat. I thought Hutchinson was imposing upon the old man; I am positive that he was no workman; I told the old man it was of no use to take such a man; I knew he was no tradesman in our line; I told the old man so because he might not be robbed of his property.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I have only to tell you that you are full as bad as that man is, and ought to be indicted; you wished he would take an able manufacturer out of the country - A. No; I did not make use of any such word.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Albert Terrace, Hackney—on 17th April, about 11.30, I was coming along the Hackney Road—the prisoner came up in front of me at the corner of a public-house in Union Street, when within two or three feet of me he made a snatch at my chain—I turned round and caught him by the collar—we struggled, I pulled him to the light of the public-house, that I might be able to see his face to identify him at any future time—he succeeded in snatching a portion of my chain—I saved my watch by my hand, and while I had my hand on his collar another man came up from behind me and struck me a heavy blow—I was</p>

               <p>then compelled to let the prisoner go—the blow broke my arm in two places, and fractured the centre bone in three places, and blood flowed—both the men escaped—I next saw the prisoner on 5th May, in the Wor<lb></lb>ship Street Court-yard—he was amongst a number of others—I identified him, and picked him out readily.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were seven or eight men placed in the yard—I don't know whether there were any policemen amongst them—I can't say whether the officer in the case was present—the men were all of the same height as near as possible—I did not indentify the prisoner by his clothes—he had light clothes on then—when I was attacked he had dark clothes—there were several officers there when I picked him out, five or six in uniform—they were not standing near me, they were at the door—I walked down the row of men once, he was in the centre—I was perfectly sober on the night I was attacked—the transaction might have occupied half a minute, or a minute—we struggled—it was just in front of the public-house window.</p>

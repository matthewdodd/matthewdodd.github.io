                  </hi>. I live at 430, New-cross-road, and am the wife of George Willis Moore—in 1863 I was living in my husband's house—he had left me then for a twelvemonth—he did not sleep in his house—in June, 1863, I pre<lb></lb>sented a petition to the Divorce Court for a judicial separation on the ground of cruelty, and in November, 1864, that decree was made—the things in the house were advertised for sale—my husband sold everything—I picked out and deposited with the defendant that list of articles (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—there was an Indian card-box, some china cups, an ormulu clock, and other things, some of which had been my grandfather's, and some were a little endeared to me as my husband's gifts—I packed them in six packages and deposited them with the prisoner in August, 1863—I said, "Mr. Haynes, I give them to you for your safe custody; will you take them to Mr. Richardson and warehouse them for me"—I paid him 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for doing that—he brought them to my lodgings in the New-cross-road—other things were placed on the cart, and they were warehoused at Mr. Richardson's—prior to that they were taken to a shed at Lewisham—I took them at various times in my carriage to the defendant's house—thinking they would not be safe, I had them removed to a shed at Lewisham, and I paid 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the prisoner for the rent of the shed, and then he took them to Mr. Richardson—I never saw them there—he told me he had taken them—they went in the cart to go there—I think it was in March, 1864, that I demanded my goods of the prisoner—I went to his house at Lewisham and said, "Mr. Haynes, I will relieve you of those goods," and he said, "Very well,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186511200058"></xptr>
               <p>Mrs. Moore"—I said, "You have many things in your house besides those that are at Mr. Richardson's"—he said, "It is useless to take one thing without the others, I will hire a cart and bring them to you to-morrow morning"—he did not bring them—I waited two or three hours—it was a very wet day, and I thought that might detain him; but I went to his house in the evening and found he had absconded—I saw him again the following Sunday—I traced him to Brastead in Kent, to his father's house—they said they did not know where he was, and could not give the slightest informa<lb></lb>tion—I then went to the back-door of the house, and saw him jumping over the hedge—I took him by the collar and said, "You are the fellow I want for robbing me"—he said, "What do you want"—I said, "I want my furniture and goods deposited with you"—he said, "Come in, come in"—I led him in, and he then placed a written document in ray hand—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>): "London, March 10th. Sir, will you deliver up the goods warehoused on your premises to a lady of the name of Mrs. Moore, if called for G. A. Haynes. There was an iron bedstead sent away by mistake, will you please make it all right"—that was addressed in an envelope to Mr. Richardson—on the Monday I took it to Richardson and found the goods were gone—I next saw them, last week, at Mr. Massingham's, at Blackheath—I saw the parcels there that I had deposited with the defendant—until I found the goods at Massingham's I could hear nothing of them.</p>

Q.</hi> At the time you deposited those goods with the prisoner was there any other arrangement except that he was to keep them for you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I never received any money from him, I will swear that—these documents (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), are in my handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "June 1st, 1863. Received of Mr. Haynes, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Eliza Moore." "Received of Mr. Haynes, 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for goods delivered. Eliza Moore. June 12th, 1863")—I removed those goods during the suit that was pending between my husband and my self—the defendant told me he ran a great risk in receiving them, and if Mr. Moore came to him perhaps he would have to pay a very heavy penalty, and so I gave him those acknowledgments to cover any expenses he should be put to, to save him from any penalty that my husband could bring against him for receiving my goods—I will swear I never received one penny from the prisoner—some of the goods were delivered to the prisoner in July just two days before the sale—my husband was a very vindictive man and I knew if he traced the goods there he would not have cared what he did to ruin the man, and I gave him those to cover any risk he might incur—perhaps I was wrong—I persist in saying that I did not receive any money from him,—I never authorized the prisoner to sell my things—I know a person named Edwards—of course I considered this property mine when I removed it, or I should not have taken it—I told my husband I had taken it—I said, "Mr. Moore, what little souvenirs I want I have taken; the rest you are welcome to"—I did not tell him where I had removed the property to.</p>

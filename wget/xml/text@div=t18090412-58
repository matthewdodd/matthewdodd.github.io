Clark, the constable, was sent for, the mate gave charge of him; the plush has remained in my hands ever since. Deneefe was given in custody at the same time, he said he was innocent; we took them to the police office and returned to the ship; we found the piece in the hold where it had been cut off, and the next morning we found the case where it had been, broken open.</p>

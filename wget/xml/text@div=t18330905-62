The prisoner was in my employ - I have a partner; on the night of the 16th of August, I marked a quantity of silver money, and placed it in a till in the shop - I had sent the prisoner home previously; he returned about seven o'clock the next morning, and I afterwards saw him go round to the side where there was a till, and heard the till drawn out - I ran down the stairs and charged him with having robbed me; he at first denied it; I said I was certain of it - I asked him what he had done with all the money he had taken from us at different times; he said he had spent it - I went to the till to see what was missing, and then he pulled 2s. out of his pocket, laid them on the counter, and said that was all - I examined them, and found my mark on them which I had put on the night before; the till had not been locked - the prisoner made no application to me; the marks are under the head, it is a figure of 7 - I had marked some money on the night of the 15th; I had marked money two nights, but I can distinguish the marks, because what we marked on the night of the 16th was a different mark - I made the figure 6 before that- he had not been in the shop five minutes when I charged him with this.</p>

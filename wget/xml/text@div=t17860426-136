               <p>I am a constable of St. Giles's, I stopped Minton with a pewter pot under his coat, on the 21st of March, I think it was on a Tuesday; I marked the pot at the bottom, the prisoner Minton told me where he was going to sell it, the Magistrate<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260187"></xptr> sent us with the prisoner Minton to see where he sold it, I was at the door, I stopped him as he came out; he said he sold it for sixpenny-worth of halfpence, there are the halfpence that he sold it for.</p>
               <p>Into whose house did he go? - Into the house of the prisoner Fletcher; and as soon as he came out, I went in; he carried in the pot, and brought out sixpenny worth of halfpence, and said he had sold it for them; Fletcher keeps an old iron shop.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The value is sixteen-pence.</p>
               <p>Lucas. I went to Fletcher, and told him I believed he had got the pewter pot that the boy had brought in just now; he said he had not; I said, I am afraid you have; and looking to the fire, I found this shovel on the fire; not seeing the pewter pot, I searched the wife, and found this pint pot; there was a kind of a forge, and I found the quart pot in the fire; I took him to the Magistrate, and left him there, and came back to search the house further, and found these pieces of pewter; I left a man that assisted me, till I returned; the Magistrate said to Minton, that he would shew him all the favour he could, if he would find the receiver.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Fletcher. Whether he did not ask me what money I would give him to make up this affair? - No such thing; no conversation of that kind.</p>
               <p>Who was the Magistrate? - Mr. Walker, in Hyde-street, Bloomsbury.</p>

               <p>I belong to Mr. Walker's; I was with Lucas, and we met Minton, and took this quart pot from under his coat; we took him to the office, and Mr. Walker said he should like to find out the people that bought these things; and the prisoner Minton said, I will tell you where; and we went with him to the prisoner Fletcher, in Newtoner's-lane; he went to Fletcher's, and was in about a couple of minutes, and came out with sixpenny worth of halfpence in his hand; he shewed them to me, and I gave them to Lucas; Mr. Walker promised the prisoner Minton some favour, on account of discovering the receiver; I saw him take in the pot under his coat; we watched at some distance; then Lucas and I went into the back yard, and there I saw a forge, and a frying-pan atop of it; I did not find any thing in the fire; I staid in the shop, while Lucas searched in the backyard, and I saw Lucas take a pint pot out of the woman's pocket; I believe this is the same; then Lucas called out to me, I have found a quart pot; I looked, and I saw it was the same pot that the boy had in his hand before; and in a basket in the shop was this melted pewter; and I took Fletcher up to the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Do you know any thing of the value of this pewter pot? - I cannot say that I do.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Fletcher. Ask him what passed when Mr. Lucas took me into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Did you, or Lucas, offer to make it up for a sum of money? - God bless you, it is totally false; nothing of the kind; Mr. Lucas called him in, and told him the Justice was going to take it up on a particular act of parliament, and the penalty was twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>(The pot deposed to.)</p>
               <p>What do you give for such a pot, when it is new? - Seventeen-pence.</p>
               <p>Is that the same value as a new pot? - It is as good as a new one.</p>
               <p>What do you value it at? - At sixteen pence.</p>
               <p>Court. Now, upon the oath you have taken, what is the value of that, to be sold? - It is worth that to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Fletcher. What did you first value it at? - At ten-pence; but the Justice told me I must value it at more.</p>
               <p>PRISONER MINTON'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I found the pot in the street, on the side of the pavement; nobody was by.</p>
               <p>PRISONER FLETCHER'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>This young man will tell you, how they promised him; this other prisoner came into my house; I was going up stairs to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178604260188"></xptr> work; I did not know any thing about it; Lucas promised him his liberty, provided he would sell this pot to me; so the men went backwards, unknown to me; I never bought it, nor saw it, nor any thing of the kind; they promised the prisoner Minton his pardon, and a reward, or he would not have done it; he will tell you so.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 11). On 14th January about 4 in the afternoon I saw the prisoner with another woman, at the bottom of Holborn-hill—they passed by me, and rather hurriedly went up Plum-tree-court—I remained and watched them—I saw the other woman give some-thing to the prisoner about the size of this parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I walked up Plum-tree-court after them—the other woman turned round, and on seeing me, walked towards me—the prisoner went further up the court—I stopped the other woman and raised her shawl—I saw that she had nothing there, and I was compelled to let her go—I then went after the prisoner—on getting about a yard or two from her, I said, "Hi! stop"—she turned round, and I then distinctly saw her drop these shawls on the ground—I picked them up, and I dragged her with me out of the—court, and called out "Stop thief!" in reference to the other woman, who had crossed the road—the other woman ran through a house in Field-lane, got out of the back door and escaped—I asked the prisoner how she accounted for the possession of these, I did not say, shawls—she said, u I don't know what you have; I bow nothing about it; what the other woman had has nothing to do with me," or words very similar to those—I then took her to the station—the shawls were not tied up—she could see them.</p>

I am assistant to George Emery, 79, Holborn-hill, draper—on 14th January the prisoner came to our shop in company with another woman, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I was called forwards to show them some mantles—I went with them up to the show room, and showed them some mantles of different styles—nothing suited them—the other woman put her mantle or shawl on a pile of shawls, and whilst I was on the table she put her mantle on again and said, "There is nothing to suit me"—they both walked down stairs, and walked out of the shop together—about half-an-hour after they had left, the policeman came to me with these shawls—I knew them again—they all have our marks on them—they are the property of Mr. Emery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a travelling watch and dock maker. On the 17th of Nov. I was in Harefield parish—I had a clock, and a box with brooches and other things in it—I called at the prisoner's house to receive some money for a clock—it was to be 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she had paid me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a ring—she could not make the payment good—I gave the money and the ring back, and took the clock—I left my box behind me, containing the property stated—I went back the next morning and asked her for it—she said she never saw the box, then she said she saw it, but that 1 had put it in my pocket—a part of the property has been found—this ring is not mine—it is what I gave her back when I took the clock—these three rings and this brooch I can swear to—they were safe in the box I left at her house, and they are mine.</p>

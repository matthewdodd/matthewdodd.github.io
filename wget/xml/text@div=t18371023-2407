                  </hi>. I drive a fish van for my brother, Thomas French. The prisoner was in his employ—my brother keeps horses at Chadwell—purchase all the corn for his horses there—I have compared some oats which Weston has with others which I keep of my brother's—I will not swear to them—they are white oats and very good—they are just like what was in the sack taken from the prisoner—we did not grow them—I did not authorise him to take any oats to London for my brother.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the horse patrol stationed at Rom<lb></lb>ford. About a quarter past three o'clock in the morning of the 5th of October I saw the prisoner at Chadwell in Barking parish—he had a quantity of oats in a sack—I went across to him and asked what he had got there—he said, "Some oats"—I said, "What are you going to do with them?"—he said, "I brought them from master's stable for the van to take up"—I said, "Whose van?"—he said, "My master's, Thomas French"—I said, "Did your master give you orders to take the oats?"—he said, Yes he did"—I said, Does your master drive the van"—he said he did—I said should remain with him until I ascertained the truth—before French came he said it was not his master, but his brother who drove the van, and he had ordered him to take the oats to feed the horses—when Robert French</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183710230202"></xptr>
               <p>came I asked him if he had given him instructions to bring the corn—he was he had not—the prisoner then said it was not Robert French, but it not James Mooss—I then remained until Mooss came—he said he did said give them to him—the prisoner said he had brought them from his master's stable to take to London for his masters horses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You saw him on the highroad, where the was would pass? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—French would have seen him if he had come up at the time—he came up about half an hour after—the prisoner was not waiting in the road—he had the oats on his back, going down the road—he went in the same direction as the van would come—the van was coming from Chelmsford, and he was going towards Chelmsford—he would have met the van if he had gone on—he was passing the public-house—he was just by the corner of the public-house—the van stops there, but he had nearly passed the house—he had passed the door—they change horses on the contrary side to where he was carrying the oats—the horses stop on the London side, and he was carrying them on the contrary side, away from where the horses would be—the prisoner said before Moss that Moss had authorized him to take them—he at first said French had sent him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Thomas French, of Chelmsford—I never gave the prisoner orders to have the corn ready for the van—I change horses at Chadwell, on the London side of the house—the place the prisoner was stopped at was right by the house, not where we stop—he had no business to bring corn out of the stable—we always feed our horses with chaff and beans mixed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you have corn at the stable? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—we send it from Romford to Chadwell on our way to London—we never feed the horses in London, except we put them up a bit, and then what we give them is at our own expense—I have told the prisoner that I paid 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of my own pocket for corn to give the horses—he knew they always charge us 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in London—I never complained to him that there ought to be corn in London—master said if we put the horses up it must be at our own expense—we give them water and hay sometimes at White<lb></lb>chapel.</p>

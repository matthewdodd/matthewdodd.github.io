On Friday afternoon I locked the area gate, and delivered the key to my mistress at eleven o'clock on Friday night. I went to the gate at eleven o'clock the next morning and found it locked; about half an hour afterwards I heard that the candlestick was lost. I am sure that the gate was not opened with our key between the time that I locked it, and the time that the candlestick was missed.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Porteus. On the 21st of December, I was in the back-kitchen, I heard somebody go up the area steps, I ran out, and found the candlestick was gone; I looked up, and the area-gate was half open; I went out, and saw the prisoner, Davis, very near it. I passed him, and looked at him. I met a man, who told me that a man had ran round the corner. I followed the prisoner, Davis, he went towards Lausdown-passage. I then met a man of the name of Barrow, and he went with me. I overtook the prisoner, and laid hold of him, and accused him of taking the candlestick; he looked at me, and said, he was quite struck. A person then came up, and the prisoner unbuttoned his coat, and said, he had nothing about him. Mr. Barrow heard some keys rattle, and asked him to let him look at the keys which were in his pocket; he pulled out, I think, five keys in the whole - I am not sure. Barrow gave them to him again. I asked the prisoner to go back to the house, and walked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150004"></xptr>by the side of him; as he went along he dropped one of the keys, and I picked it up (producing it), this is the key which he dropped-it is a picklock key. I saw the officer open the area-gate with one of the keys which were found on the prisoner Davis.</p>
               <p>Prisoner DAVIS. Was I the first person that you saw when you came out of the area - A. You was.</p>
               <p>JOHN BARROW. On the 21st of December, I saw the prisoner, Davis, about thirty yards from the area-gate; he was going towards Cousin-street. I and Mazey followed him. The boy asked the prisoner if he had the candlestick. I demanded the keys, and he pulled out one or two, one of which was a latch-key. I said, you have more, and he pulled out three; I returned them to him; and asked him to give them back to me - He was not willing; he dropped one of them, and we picked it up. The officer, Jeffries, has the keys.</p>

            . I am an officer; I tried the keys to the area-gate, and one of them, which was a skeleton-key, opened the gate; there were three skeleton keys in the whole. The keys were given to me, and the candlestick, I produce them. I took the prisoner into custody.</p>

            . On the 21st of December I was in Half-Moon-street; the prisoner, Lemon, ran past me, about a quarter past eleven o'clock, I saw he had something in his bosom; the two witnesses asked me if I had seen any person, and I told them of it. I looked round and saw him again, standing and looking round the corner of Half-Moon-street, leading to Cousin-street, when the servant said he had been robbed. I went on; and as I was going into Piccadilly, I saw the same boy again, he must have gone through Sheppard's-market, he was running under the wall of the Green-park, towards Bond-street. I took hold of him, and asked him what he had got, he said, nothing. I told him he had got a candlestick; he said, no. I opened his jacket, and found the candlestick wrapped up in his apron, under his jacket. I delivered him, and the candlestick, to Mr. Porteus's servant, at his house. The candlestick produced is the same which I took from him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner LEMON. Did you ask me what I had got - A. I did.</p>
               <p>WM. TUSON. I was in Lansdown-passage, Barrow asked me to look at the keys; I desired the prisoner to go back, and in his way he dropped the key-Mazey picked it up. When Lemon was brought back, I asked the prisoner, Davis, for the keys to try the area-gate; he gave them to me. I took them, and then he demanded them back as his property. He gave me the three skeleton keys very willingly. He did not give me the latch key. I refused to give them up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's, DAVIS, Defence. On the 21st of December, about eight o'clock in the morning, as I was coming from Kensington I saw the keys in the road, and I picked them up. I passed the house; the servant ran past me, and I walked slowly on, when I came to Lansdown-passage, the footman asked to search me. I gave the gentleman the keys. I went back, and the other prisoner was in the passage.</p>
               <p>LEMON'S Defence. A young man came to me by the Park, and asked me to carry the candlestick to Bond-street.</p>
               <p>DAVIS - GUILTY. Aged 17.</p>
               <p>LEMON - GUILTY. Aged 15.</p>

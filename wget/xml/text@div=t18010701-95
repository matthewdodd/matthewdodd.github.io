             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I filled up this affidavit; it is an affidavit that some person made in the name of the prisoner; but it is impossible for me to identify the person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp (To Rance.) Q. Do you know the prisoner's hand-writing? - A. I believe it to be his hand-writing; I have seen his writing, but I never saw him write.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you received letters from him, which by any act that he has done, he has acknowledged it to be his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010085"></xptr>hand-writing? - A. I had forgot, I have seen him write; I saw him write when he took out the licence for his first marriage, and I saw him write at the church.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q.You have seen him twice write John-Willian Bishop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You are not to take other things into your consideration; do you mean to say, that from the knowledge you derived from seeing him write the words John-Willian Bishop twice, that that is his hand-writing? - A. I should be very sorry to swear that it is his writing, but I think I may venture to say it is his writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.Have you had any applications from the prisoner for money by writing, and you have lent him money in consequence of it? - A.Not in writing.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any doubt that that is his signature? - A. No; I have no doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the signature to that bond, is that his hand-writing? - A. I think it is. (The affidavit and the bond read.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Rance.) Q.Where did Bishop live? - A. In Red-Lion-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that in the parish of St. James, Clerkenwell? - A. Yes it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Birkwood.) When an oath of this sort is administered, where is it administered? - A. Sometimes at the Surrogate's Chambers, and sometimes in the Common Hall or the Dining Room.</p>
               <p>Q. And sometimes in the Proctor's house? - A. No; unless people are infirm, and then the Surrogate attends out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that the oath is never taken but in the presence of the Surrogate? - A. The Surrogate always administers the oath himself.</p>

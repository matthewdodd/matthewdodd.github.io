               <p>Just before ten, on the 8th of November, I met with the prisoner in the back lane, near the new theatre.</p>
               <p>How near is that to Glass-house-yard? - About a quarter of a mile; I asked him what he had the bundle, and he told me they were his own; I asked him what, and he could not tell; I suspected from that they were not his own; I took him into custody, and put him in the watch-house, and the next day I advertised the things; nobody was with me; these are the things I found on the prisoner; I told him if he would tell me what the bundle contained, I would give it to him; in the scuffle a flap of a waistcoat appeared, and then he said there was a waistcoat, and the next day he told me his wife and he had parted, and she was gone to live with another man; the bundle was tied up in the sheet, as it is now; I asked him if he had any children, he said no.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say any thing afterwards, how he came by them? - Would your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120071"></xptr>lordship have me say what he said, after the things were swore to?.</p>
               <p>Was there any promise of favour made to him if he would tell the truth, or any threat? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Was any examination taken in writing? - No; he said after the things were swore to, he begged the prosecutor would recommend him to be transported, for he had been guilty of doing it; there was a boy with him, but I could not take them both; they were going into a shop, in the back lane, of old clothes and old iron.</p>
               <p>(The things produced and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>One of the runers came to me in the place and I told them I had picked them up in the place; and he said, do not say any such thing, but say they are your wife's things, and it will bring you through the piece; he had seen the bundle, I had not; I happened to go along the lane, and found them in a corner; I belong to the India warehouse.</p>

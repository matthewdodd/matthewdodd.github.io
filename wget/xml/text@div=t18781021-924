                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman P</hi>). On Saturday evening, 5th October, I went with Robinson to 23, James Street, Southampton Street, Camberwell, where Phillips has lived for the last four years—the two prisoners were then in custody—we found in a back room some broken plaster-of-paris moulds, which appeared to have been used for coining—I then went to 5, Royal Road, the address Nye gave at the station, and in the first-floor front room found a galvanic battery, some copper wire, a board with marks of coins on it, some metal, a spoon with metal in it, some silver sand, a brooch, a runner, a file and pliers, and a packet of plaster-of-paris (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—most of these were in a cupboard which was open—I went to the station and said to Nye, "I searched your place last night and found all the implements for making counterfeit coin;" she said, "They don't belong to me, they belong to Charley Phillips; he asked me if he might leave them there, much to my sorrow; all you have found belong to him",—the landlord showed me the room.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Phillips</hi>. I found various other tools in your room; it was fitted up as a work-room—I found this mould (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the mantel<lb></lb>piece; it is for a scarf pin—here are some other moulds, but they have been cut and destroyed—the impressions have been cut out, here is half a cart-load of them—here is the impression of various coins on</p>

I am a painter, of 5, Royal Road, Kennington—Nye occupied the list-floor front room in my house for about 12 months—that was the room the police searched—Phillips used to come there—I let him in, once or twice about 9 o'clock—he sometimes stayed there all day, and twice a week he stayed all night—if I had not thought he was her husband, I should not have let him in.</p>

I am a draper's assistant, of 200, Old Kent Road—on 5th October, about 2 p.m., Nye came and bought a tea-cloth and gave me a shilling—I gave her the change, and she left—a policeman directly spoke to me, and I found the shilling was bad—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the policeman marked it with his teeth in my presence.</p>

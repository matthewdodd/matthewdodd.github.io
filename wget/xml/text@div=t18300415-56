On the 6th of March, between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner with a piece of beef in his hand; he was looking at it, and kept looking round at me, to see if I was looking at him - he then wrapped it in a handkerchief and went out of the shop with it; I sent my man who brought him back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many persons were in your shop? A. There might be from twenty to thirty; my son was the only person who was taking money at the other scale - I am sure the beef was not weighed; I was on the opposite side of the shop taking money with my second son - I could not hear what the prisoner said; I heard him afterwards say it weighed 6lbs. 9ozs., which was within an ounce of its real weight; he was brought back to the door, but I did not hear him say any thing.</p>

            . I was serving in the shop; I saw the prisoner standing by the scale looking at the beef; I asked him if I should weigh it, he said he did not know yet - I did not weigh it; I did not see him leave the shop; I saw him brought back - he said he had paid 1s. 3d. for it; I suppose it was worth 2s. 6d. - it was part of a buttock, there were 6lbs. or 7lbs. of it; we should sell it at 5d. or 6d. a pound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far had he got from the shop? A. I do not know; he was brought back in four or five minutes - I did not weigh any beef for him; there were ten or twelve people in the shop, he was brought into the shop and up to the scale, which is two or three yards within the shop; I suppose Mrs. Somers must have made a mistake, when she said he came to the door - she was at the other scale two or three yards off; I do not know whether she heard what was said - he took the beef to the watch o se with him; the beef was not weighed by me, or by my orders; he did mention some weight before the Magistrae.</p>
               <p>COURT to MRS. SOMERS. Q. Was the beef weighed afterwards? A. It was by the Magistrate's orders; the prisoner had before said it weighed 6lbs. 9 ozs. - and it weighed 6 1/2lbs.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were before the Magistrate? A. I was on the Wednesday; I asked him at the watch-house the weight of the beef in the presence of all who were there - I asked him because he had said he had paid me 1s. 3d. for it; there might be twenty or thirty people in our shop - we had about a dozen of our people there.</p>

No, I should not know him; I did not buy any thing - I was interrupted; I spoke to the master of the shop, and asked him the price of it - and then this happened; Mrs. Somers was not at that side of the shop -I did not hear what it weighed; I went before the Magistrate on Monday, and told him what I saw - I said I saw the man weigh it, and throw it down by the side of the scale.</p>

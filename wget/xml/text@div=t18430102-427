                  </hi>. I live in Great Tower-street; I have also a small house and garden in Church-passage, Stepney; it has four rooms in it; my sitting-room is on the ground-floor, and there is a small bed-room over it. On the 30th of December I slept there—my wife and one of my children were with me—we were the only persons in the house that night—the house was fast<lb></lb>ened up when I went to bed between twelve and one o'clock—I was dis<lb></lb>turbed by a noise, just before nine in the morning, underneath where I slept, at a door which opens into the lower room from the garden—thinking it was my daughter who slept at Tower-street, coming to get breakfast for me, I looked out of window to call to her to wait till I came down, and saw the figure of a lad—I could not see the whole of his person—I came down stairs, and came in at the other door on the opposite side to where he was breaking in, thinking I should get down before he broke in; but when I got in I found that, while I had been coming down, he had opened the door and got in—my opening the other door caused him to run away—I looked out, and saw him running along the garden, and out of there into a passage, and then into Church-passage—that door had been fastened with a padlock on the outside—there are two doors, a front and a back—the entrance was made at what we call the front door—the padlock was wrenched off—when I saw him I shouted out, "I know you, my lad, I shall know you again," and called, "Stop thief" two or three times—I lost sight of him by his turning into Church-passage—I exa<lb></lb>mined, and missed a hat, my wife's bonnet, my child's bonnet, and a small shawl from the lower room.</p>

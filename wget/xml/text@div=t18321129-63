On the 6th of September, I and my family arrived at St. Katherine's-dock, from Broadstairs; a friend of mine provided us with a coach and a chariot - Smith drove the coach, and Stevens the chariot, and Spiers I afterwards found rode behind Stevens' chariot; there were six females in the coach, and my footman rode with Smith - I, my female servant, and the boxes went in the chariot; when we arrived, the coaches were unloaded - I did not attend to it, as I was very ill, but going into the garden, I observed my trunk (which I had given to my footman, while on board, and told him to take particular care of) standing on the grass plot, leading from the house to the gate; in a few minutes after I got into the house, my wife asked me for the keys, as we wanted some tea-spoons, and the trunk was gone - I sent out 11s. to pay the <rs id="t18321129-63-deflabel358" type="occupation">coachman</rs>

            . I am footman to the prosecutor. I returned with him from Broadstairs; I rode on the box with Smith, who drove the coach - the trunk of plate was put on the foot-board of Stevens' chariot; Spiers rode behind Smith's coach; when we arrived home the trunk was put on the grass plot, that I positively swear - I saw Spiers place it there; Smith afterwards asked me for 11s. which he said was his fare - I got it of my master, and paid it to him; he and Stevens were both then at the gate - Stevens then said he waited for his fare, and I went to my master for that; I left all the three prisoners then at the gate, but the trunk was not then on the grass plot - I thought some of the servants had taken it in; I had seen it when I paid the 11s., and before I went in again for the 6s. 6d. it was gone - I went in about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you examined at Marylebone-office? A. Yes; I did not swear that Smith drove off as soon as he had got his fare - I did not see him do so; there were three other trunks beside the one which was missed - that and one of the others were covered with brown holland; I saw Stevens the next night at Great Ormond-yard, where he puts up - I rode on the coach which went first; this trunk was on the foot-board of the chariot.</p>

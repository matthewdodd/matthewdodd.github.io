On Saturday evening, the 19th of December, I left my man to pay the other men, and he was not there. On the Sunday morning I received a letter from the prisoner at the bar, and the contents of it were: '' That he '' had met a man that had work'd with me, with '' a little piece of lead on his shoulder, and he '' clap'd his hand upon it, and asked him where '' he came from. The man threw it down, '' ran away, and he took it up; that he was taken '' up with it upon him, and was sent to New-Prison.'' I went to him there, and he told me the same that his letter contained. I asked him why he had not brought the lead back again? He said he designed to bring it again on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to the lead?</p>
               <p>Pearce. No, I cannot. He told me it was mine. There was a soldier that detected him. I have been with him, and he says he will not come.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Blockley, of No. 22, Little Brook-street, Regent's-park. On the 11th of March I left my room for three or four minutes, and on returning missed the articles stated in the indictment, which were quite safe when I left the room at a few minutes before two o'clock—I went to the station to give information, and found them, and the prisoner was in custody—they belong to my husband.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The prosecutrix knew me years ago—I paid her a visit sup<lb></lb>posing her to be a single woman. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He never visited me—I do not know him at all—I was married in 1838, and have my certificate.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 11th of March I was in the Hampstead-road, and met the prisoner with a shawl, a gown, a four cape, and two caps in his possession—I asked where he got them—he said, "They are my woman's"—I said, "That won't do for me, where did you bring them from?—he said," "I picked them up"—I took him to the sta<lb></lb>tion, and found these other things on him—while I was searching him</p>

               <p>Mrs. Blockley came in to give information, and saw her things lying there—there are parties about the neighbourhood who keep disreputable houses, but I know nothing against the prosecutrix—her husband is at sea—I think the prisoner's statement quite wrong.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> It is five years since I visited her—when I came to Newgate I was scarcely sober. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He might have been drinking, but he knew perfectly well what he was about—he was brought to Newgate within an hour almost of the time—his pocket was full of things takes from the room.</p>

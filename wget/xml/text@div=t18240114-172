I asked if she had opened the bundle; she said not; and next morning, I wished to discharge her - she would not leave me. This property was found in a bundle under the water-butt, in the back kitchen - she coloured up when I asked if it was her's - she said No. I asked when she put the things there; she would not answer. I said,</p>

            . Between one and two in the Morning, I was sent for to take the Prisoner up for picking 2 s. 6 d. out of a Gentleman's Pocket; said I, this is a sad Thing in a Watchman; says he I will tell you the Truth; the Gentleman was in Liquor , he was to give me Six-pence for lighting him Home, and I laid hold of two Shillings, but I had not the two Shillings and Six-pence which the Chamberlain charged me with.</p>
               <p>The Watchman in his Defence said, that the Gentleman was in Liquor, and wanted him to help him to a Lodging, and he carried him to the Checquer Inn , that when he came in he said, Can I have a Whore to Night; that the Chamberlain said, yes , with all my Heart ; that the Gentleman being fuddled, pulled out two Shillings, and dropped it upon his Knee, that he took it in his Hand to keep it from falling down, and the Chamberlain came and insisted upon seeing what he had, and charged him with stealing it.</p>

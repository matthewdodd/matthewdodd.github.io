             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. On Saturday the 27th of October, I was sent for by Messrs. Cox and Merle; I went there, and after I had been there a quarter of an hour, the prisoner was introduced into the parlour, I did not know that he was charged with the robbery; when the prisoner had been in about three minutes, Mr. Merle came in, and said nothing; but presently Mr. Hallifax came in, and gave charge of the prisoner for robbing him of a Bank bill; I then searched him, but found nothing, except a few trifles, and a little cash that he had in his pocket; I then asked him where he lodged; and he told me at No. 15, Princes-street, Barbican; I then asked him in what manner I could get admittance to his apartments; and he told me then where the key of his room was to be found, and likewise, when I had got into his room, where I might find the key of his drawers; I left him in charge of the Wardbeadle while I went to his lodgings, No. 6, Princes-street, and I found the key according to his directions, hanging up under a boot-jack; and in the first drawer I opened, in a single chest of drawers, I found this pocket-book, containing two 20l. Bank-notes, one of 1l and a seven-shilling-piece, and likewise a foreign Bank-bill for 35l. upon Masterman's house, of which I took possession, in the presence of Mr. Hallifax, and another gentleman; and in a book, when I lifted up the corner, I found three guineas and a half, and eight penny-pieces; I produced them before the Lord-Mayor, I received them again, after he was committed, from Mr. Newman, the clerk of the Lord-Mayor; this bill,(producing it), was delivered to me by Mr. Newman, the Lord-Mayor's clerk.(The bill in question).</p>
               <p>Q. This was not found in the pocket-book? - A. No; I heard the prisoner say, when I had the charge of him first, that he was very sorry for what he had done, and he hoped Mr. Merle would shew him mercy; there was one of the clerks charged with the theft, and Mr. Merle said, if he had then stepped forward at the time that the other clerk was charged with it, and said he was guilty, he would have done something for him.</p>

               <p>Q. And that passed without any thing said by Mr. Merle to induce him to confess? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the first examination? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing at that examination? - A. No; he was all the while crying, we could hardly get a word out of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You were sent for to Mr. Merle's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you that, at his lodgings, you would find a pocket-book, and you would find some Bank-notes there? - A. He told me where the key was.</p>

               <p>Q. You know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes; he was a clerk in our house to take care of bills for acceptance, and numbering bills for acceptance; this bill has the acceptance of Mr. Cox upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore must have been in your house? - A. Of course.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you whether you had any conversation with the prisoner at the bar relative to this bill, and when? - A. I do not know exactly when, but it was on a Saturday that he was taken into custody; I had another clerk in custody at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This young man had been entrusted with some hundreds of pounds property of your's? - A. Yes, millions.</p>
               <p>Q. When this charge was made against him, did you not tell him you would do all you could to shew him favour? - A. I did; I had another clerk in custody, and there has been a person that said they thought they would know him, and they had fixed upon him, and he seemed, during the whole time of his being in custody, without fear, and appeared with perfect innocence; and it being a matter of importance to me to know who the man was, as they had such opportunities of taking property to a very large amount, I took him into the accompting-house, and told him, if he would confess whether he was the man or not, I would shew him all the favour I possibly could.</p>
               <p>Q. That was before he was taken into custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not believe, that in consequence of expecting favour from you, he ingenuously confessed it? - A. It gave me a great satisfaction upon this confession, when he assured me that he had never injured me but in this particular; he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179812050018"></xptr>thirty thousand pounds of property out with him that day; I had lent him ninety pounds that very morning to pay for furniture; he might have put his hand into the drawer and taken out thirty thousand pounds without my missing it for a fortnight; since that time, I have had all my bills marked off, and I do not find one missing besides this.</p>

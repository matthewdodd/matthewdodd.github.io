               <p>Reeves. He worked at Isleworth three quarters of a year. I heard of her again, on Monday the 14th. I had got some hand bills printed, and I took some to Kingston fair. Going there, I met a gentleman's servant, who told me she was seen at the fair, but was gone. The prisoner was taken on the Monday night, and I saw my mare again on the Tuesday, my servant brought her home; I heard the prisoner make a voluntary confession before the Justice, he acknowledged that he took her and turned her loose upon Hounslow heath.</p>

            . I was going to Kingston fair, on the Monday. I saw the prisoner coming over Kingston bridge, on the prosecutor's mare. I live by the prosecutor, and know the mare well. I rode after him about half a mile. My horse flung a shoe, so I went no farther. This was about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was he going?</p>
               <p>Dore. He was going towards Hampton Court.</p>

            . I overtook the prisoner on the road, on the 14th of November, about three o'clock in the afternoon, between the Powder Mills and Stretham. He was on the prosecutor's mare. I know her. She had a bridle and pannel on. I said to him, you have got Mr. Reeves's mare. He said he had; he said Mr. Reeves had lost her three days, and he had sent him after her, and he had found her. I asked him how he came by the pannel, he said a butcher had sent it him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you where he was going with her?</p>
               <p>Staining. No, he did not. He said Mr. Reeves told him not to go through Hounslow. He asked the nearest way to Isleworth.</p>

            . I am constable at Isleworth. On the 14th of Nov. I had information the prosecutor was come home. I went to look for him. I met him and his wife, coming to lay in a barn. I took him, and found this pistol upon him; (producing a small horse pistol) there was powder in the pan, but it was not loaded. I put him in the watch house that night. He told me he took the mare out of Mr. Lucy's field, adjoining to Mr. Reeves's field. He said he would not bring any innocent man in, and owned he was the man that took the mare out of the field on the Saturday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176812070016"></xptr> morning, about one o'clock; and went away for Reading, in Berkshire, and staid there till Sunday night between ten and eleven o'clock; then he came away for Kingston. I asked him how he came by the pistol, he said he found it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is a gate in the fence where Mr. Lewis's horses and mine run one among another, and he could better take the mare out of Mr. Lewis's gate, than mine.</p>

            . I did not know the prisoner was in custody till I saw him at the bar. He once lived with a relation of mine, in Berkshire, near Reading. I generally go there once a year. I remember seeing the prisoner there several times. I have said to my uncle, you have your old servant still, he said, I have, and he is a good servant. I know he bore a good character there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him last</p>
               <p>Montague. It is pretty near twelve months ago. I was surprised to see him at the bar.</p>

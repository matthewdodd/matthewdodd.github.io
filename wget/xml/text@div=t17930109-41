               <p>I belong to the store-keeper's office at Deptford, Dock-yard; the prosecutor, Woodford, is employed in that Dockyard, I have been acquainted with him fifteen or twenty years; I have frequently seen him write, there is a resemblance; but there wants something in it, the last letter of his name is not turned as I usually see him do it. (Another paper shewn him.) This is the manner; but it is something fuller than this.</p>
               <p>Q. From the whole observation of that paper do you believe that is his signature? - As it appears to me now, I believe it not to be his hand writing, there is a great resemblance in the other letters; but for want of that turn I cannot say that it is his writing particularly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Feilding. The first bond that you have seen, you say that that, bears a resemblance, but you think there is some difference on the turn of the D? - There is.</p>
               <p>Q. You think there is also some difference in the turn of the D, in the second instrument that is shewn to you by Mr. Garrow? - I think it is not so full.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. In general you say that the stroke of the D was fuller than in the first instrument? - It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Feilding. Be so good as to look at any of these signatures, and see if any one is the hand writing of Woodford's. (Looks at some more signatures.) - The first is.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the second and third; - The third D is not turned up, I think the second is his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the hand. - I think it is his hand writing, but it is not as I have seen him write.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at all his writing, and see what you think about it. - I think it is all his writing, except the D is not turned in the usual way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Look at this name, (another signature shewn him.) Do you think this is his hand writing? - I believe it is, this is in the manner I have been used to see him write.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Smith, the prisoner? - I know nothing of the transaction.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at this. (Looks at another.) - Not quite so full as this, but similar.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this. (Looks at another.) - Something like this.</p>
               <p>Q. Now on the whole of the signature to that bond, looking at it, and examining it, do you or do you not, believe it is Woodford's writing? - It bears such a similitude, I cannot be on my oath.</p>

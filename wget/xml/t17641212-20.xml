On the 3rd of November, the prisoner came to fetch out a handkerchief she had pledged before; she said, her name was Monk, and I delivered it to her: she then wanted to see some gold ear-rings; I reached down twenty-two, linked together, some with knobs, and some only wires, she bid me weigh a pair, which I did; they came to 5 s. 6 d. she reached to me, and took the whole link; then she said, weigh another pair, and kept the link in her hand. While I was looking down to tell her the price, she said, I'll give you 5 s. for the first pair: she laid the link down, and said, I have no money to pay for them, put them in a paper, and I'll call for them presently, and away she went: I looked at the link, and found there were but 18 pair; I ran to the door, but she was out of sight. As we set down in a book where every body lives that use our shop, we looked, and found her by the name Monk, and lived in Kingstreet, New Gravel-lane. I and our little boy went there; and, on enquiring at the third door, she came to the door herself: I took her by the petticoat, and said, you jade, you have robbed me. She said, she did not know me: I was in the street, and she on the threshold; her mother came, and said, you vile jade, you shall not hold my child: she tore my handkerchief, and threw me down, and both of them used me in a very bad manner: she shoved her daughter into the house, and I kept hold of her: she got her into a great chair, and sat upon her: the girl took something out of her pocket in a paper, and delivered it to her mother: I said, let me see it; she said I should not. My husband came, and staid by her, while I went for a constable: I never found my ear-rings: both the mother and daughter offered to pay for them, or to make me any satisfaction. She was taken before Justice Berry, who committed the mother to New Prison, and the daughter to Bridewell.</p>

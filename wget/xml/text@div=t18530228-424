                  </hi>. I am a Custom-house officer, and live at Gravesend, On 25th Jan. I went on board a brig from Dantzic, called the <hi rend="italic">Employ—</hi> I took a bed, bedding, and a box with me—I went with the ship to the Baltic Wharf in the Surrey Canal, which is a part of the port of London—I remained there till 27th, my bed and bedding were on the quarter deck—I missed them about 9 o'clock on the evening of 27th—I had seen them safe at half past 6 o'clock—in consequence of information from the night watchman I saw the prisoner next morning, and he told me he had been sent by some sailors who had left the vessel the previous morning, to take this bag con<lb></lb>taining the bedding to take it across the water to them—I considered they might have left a package behind, and did not like to lock up an innocent man—I afterwards made inquiries of the sailors, and in consequence gave the prisoner in custody—some sailors had left the vessel that day—my bed and bedding were packed up in a bag, it was a considerable size, about half a hundred weight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am night watchman at the Surrey Canal Docks. On 27th Jan., between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening I stopped the prisoner as he was going out of the dock with a canvass bag on his back, containing bed and bedding which he said belonged to the sailors—I took it from him, and Mr. Goodman saw it afterwards, and identified it as his—I told the prisoner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185302280115"></xptr>
               <p>I should not allow him to take it out, that I would take charge of it till the rooming, and if all was right he might then take it out, and he said he would come for it at 8 o'clock—he came the next morning between 6 and 7 o'clock; he did not ask for the property, but re-asserted the statement he had made the previous night, that he was employed by the men to fetch a parcel they had left behind on the wharf, and when he returned with it he was to be paid for his trouble—I had not seen him take any luggage that day, I only came on duty at 6 o'clock that evening—I had not seen any sailors going out before that time, but sailors are continually passing in and out during the evening—as soon as I found out who the things belonged to, the prisoner was taken into custody, but Goodman believing his statement to be true let him go—when the sailors came on Friday to receive their pay some inquiry was made, and the prisoner was taken in charge.</p>

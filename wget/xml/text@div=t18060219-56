            . - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. You have lately removed from that house to another, still retaining that house I have mentioned. - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go occasionally to visit this house, to see that every thing was right. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there on the 27th of January last. - A. Yes, I think about the 27th, I was there all was right then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go there on the 30th. - A. On the 30th I cannot swear to; went I went again, the lead was gone from the roof of the frontispiece of the school room, it was affixed to the building.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the lead was gone, in consequence of that you gave some information to Mr. Brown, who had put it up for you seven years ago. - A. Yes, Mr. Brown was working for me at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner. - A. I did, he worked for a mason whom I employed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. If I understand you Mr. Thomas, you had altogether left this house. - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody inhabited it at that time. - A. No, I was still paying rent for it; I have the lease in my pocket, my term is unexpired.</p>
               <p>- BROWN sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I believe you are a plumber and glazier, living at Enfield. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. In the evening of the Friday, the 7th of this month, did the prisoner at the bar come to your shop. - A. He did, about seven o'clock in the evening, he told me he had about an hundred weight of lead to sell, he had it with him in a sack; I thought it did not look well that a man of his description should have that lead to sell, I knew his resources, and what wages he had; I told him I had not an opportunity of weighing the lead then, I desired him to leave it till the following morning, if he would call then, I would weigh it, and pay him for it, he went away and left the lead in my premises; the next morning he came again, the lead was weighed, I think it weighed ninety-four pounds, I think I paid him one pound, four shillings, and sixpence for it, at the rate of thirty shillings a hundred; I had previously ordered a man of mine, to be upon the spot, that he might be a witness, that it was the identical lead that I bought of him.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, you had received some information from Mr. Thomas. - A. I had; as soon as the prisoner was gone, I examined the lead, I found it to be lead of that description, I fitted it to the place of the school room where the lead had been taken off, it fitted; I am perfectly sure it was the lead of that school room, every nail hole corresponded together, it was cut in four pieces, they all tallied together; the lead is here present under my seal, I delivered it to Mr. Jerry, the officer; I produce the lead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you have lived in that neighbourhood a long while; you are the last man in the world that should have been suspected of receiving stolen goods; did not you know the prisoner. - A. He had occasionally worked for me.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner left the lead with you, and agreed to call the next morning. - A. Yes, he called again the next morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found this lead as I was going home, I picked it up.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

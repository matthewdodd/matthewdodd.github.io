            , at their shop at Knightsbridge; the prisoner was in their service. On Thursday, the 15th of December, I sent him to Mrs. Constable's with some table-cloths, and as soon as he returned I asked him if they would suit - he said the lady could not give a deoided answer till the following morning; he afterwards told me the cloths were returned, that the lady objected to the price, and would not keep them; the cloths produced are the two which I sent him with to Mrs. Constable's - they came to 27s.; he should have accounted to Mr. Challacomb if he was paid for them.</p>

I was formerly in business in Bond-street and in Coventry-street for twenty-four years - my son has been in a bad state of health some years, from a violent fever; we consider him of very weak intellect - he left several situations on account of his intellects.</p>

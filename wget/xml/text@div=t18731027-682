                  </hi>. I am Inspector of Police at the East India Docks—on Friday, 24th October, about 10 o'clock, a. m., I saw the two prisoners in a shed on the South Quay, each of them had just completed filling two large bags of wheat from two different sacks—I went up and said "Are you sampling here?"—Mallett said "yes"—I said "Who for?" and Mallett replied "Mr. Palmer's foreman, for Home, Son, &amp; Mclnnes"—I said "Have you an order?"—he said "No, Mr. Whitby has it on board the ship," pointing to the <hi rend="italic">Charlotte Gladstone</hi>—I went with Mallett on board the ship, Jones remained with the samples—Mr. Whitby is the clerk to Home &amp; Co.—he came back with me and I asked him if he knew the men—he said Mallett was almost always employed by Mr. Palmer, and he knew that Jones was employed occasionally by Mr. Palmer—I asked Mr. Whitby if they had any right to take those samples, and he said he could not tell whether Mr. Palmer had sent them or not—I took Mallett's name and address first, and then asked Jones his name and address, and he said his name was William Jones—he said he was the sampler's man, that he was employed by Mr. Palmer, and his address was 77, Paradise Street, Rother-hithe—about 1 or 2 the same day Mallett brought this note—I made an objection and returned it to him; he afterwards brought it back crossed with the words "Two samples, C. Norris"—I was just outside the police-office door when I received it—Jones was standing there when Mallett gave me the name the second time, not the first time—I handed them the samples out, one to Mallett and one to Jones—Jones said "There has been a rare bother about this, they have lost the market, and it will cost about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the value of the wheat is about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Norris was the warehousekeeper of the Docks at the time that was signed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mallett gave the order into my hands, Jones might have been a yard or two off—men are employed in casual work at the Docks—I don't know that Jones has been employed there—I may have seen him there, but I did not recognise him as a Dock labourer—I don't know how Jones saw the order.</p>

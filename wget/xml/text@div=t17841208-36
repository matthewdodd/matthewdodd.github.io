               <p>Was it alive when you found it again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long after you missed it? - I missed it the next morning, when I wanted it to go to work, and Mr. Minshall sent his boy up our way to know who had lost it, because he thought it was some poor person's that could not afford to lose, and I went down there and saw it.</p>

               <p>I am a dustman, I tied up my mother's mare over night, and I missed it in the morning; I went to Mr. Minshall's when he sent for us, and I found my mother's mare there; I do not know who took her away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was the mare stole before we were in trouble; it has been found in the street since.</p>
               <p>Court. When was the mare found again? - It was found one night since, a little boy came and said she was in the street.</p>
               <p>- MINSHALL sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Bedford-street, Liquor-pond-street, I boil horses for the dogs; on Monday night the 8th of November, about twenty minutes or half an hour after eleven, the two prisoners brought this mare to my gate, they asked me a guinea for it, Smith was upon the back of it, and the other stood at the gate, and I asked them whose it was, and they said it was their own property, that they bought it and gave two guineas and a half for it, and they were partners in a dust cart, and had it three weeks; I looked at it, and saw it was blind, and I asked them what made them bring it at that that time of night to sell, they said it fell down under a load of dust, and they could not get it up again; I looked at it and found it was very clean, as if it had just come out of the stable; I asked them a good many more questions, and at last I asked them whether it was a horse or a mare, and they said it was a horse, I looked and found it was a mare, and I told them I suspected them, and then they used a many bad expressions, and Smith said I wanted to swindle them out of it; Smith went out under pretence to make water, and he ran up a passage and I stopped them, I sent our boy round St. Giles's, and I went round Paddington way, and our boy heard that it belonged to Mrs. Marshall.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith. This man is very apt to take people's lives away for the sake of the reward, he has been confined himself for the same affair three years, and has taken us up thinking to make the same of us.</p>
               <p>Court to Minshall. Have you been confined for any thing? - Once.</p>
               <p>For what? - For carrying some silk in a cart, two men hired me to carry it, and it was stolen, I was tried here for it, six or seven years ago, I was convicted and sentenced to Newgate for three years, and the horse and cart taken away.</p>
               <p>Have you ever given evidence against any horse stealers? - Yes, in the sessions before last, one that was stolen from Lewisham, and another a year and a half or two years ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080108"></xptr>What did you get in that last conviction? - Nothing at all, there is a ticket the prosecutor would not trouble himself about it.</p>
               <p>What do you expect to get by this? - Nothing at all as I know on, I have attended here ever since Tuesday week, and at Hicks's-hall, and lost my time.</p>
               <p>What are the horses that you boil up? - Dead horses, and poor ones, that are past their labour.</p>
               <p>You do not always wait till they die? - Sometimes we buy them alive in Smithfield, we deal with collar makers, and give them so much each for the meat and they have the hide back again for their own use.</p>

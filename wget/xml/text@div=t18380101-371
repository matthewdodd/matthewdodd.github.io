The prisoner used to work for me—I have missed, within nine months, between fifty and sixty pairs of boots and shoes—on the 9th of October I missed two pairs—I mentioned it to the prisoner—she said it was very strange who could rob me—I went to to the station and gave information—this is one pair of those I missed that day—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Fleming, a pawnbroker, in St. Martin's-lane. I took in these boots on the 19th of October, but could not swear from whom—this is a counterpart of the duplicate I gave—they were pledged in the name of Ann Tippen—both the prisoner and her daughter had pledged with me in that name—whether she pledged this pair or not I cannot tell.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES HAM</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant P</hi>). On the night of 19th April, at 11.30 p. m., I was on duty in plain clothes in Cook's Road, Kennington Park—I saw three men standing at a corner—I knew them all, the prisoner is one of them—when I first saw them he was twenty yards from the others—I kept them in sight some time—a constable came up, the prisoner then walked to the other two, and they walked in the same direction as the constable was coming from—after the constable disappeared they came back to where they first'stood, and at 12. 20 they turned into Doddington Grove—I had been in a doorway and they could not see me—I went to the corner of Doddington Grove, peeped round, and saw the prisoner on top of a wall, and the others standing at a gate which was shut and leads through the wall—I heard a whistle and the other two ran away—the prisoner jumped off the wall and tried to get away, but before he could recover himself I knocked him against the wall and broke his hat—I said "What are you doing here?"—he made no reply—I said "I shall take you in custody for loitering here for the purpose of committing a felony"—he was very violent and said "No bleeding Ham shall take me," he knew me—he struggled about twenty yards round the corner into Cook's Road—when I tried to peg him on the fence, to get better hold of him, but found it was a wooden fence, not iron—I got him against the fence, tight, and made him groan—he said "It is no use, I will go quietly with you"—I then let go his right-arm and took hold of his left sleeve to get better hold of him—I heard him grate his teeth, and at the same time he raised his right-arm up with something shining in his hand—I put up my hand to save my face, and the knife went into my knuckles—my hand bled a great deal, but I did not give way till his coat gave way, and he left it in my hand—I am sure he is the man—I had known him along time, my hand was badly cut—I went to the doctor and was off duty nearly a month.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was a fine night, it was 11.30 when I first saw them and five minutes to 12 o'clock when the wound was inflicted—I meant to stick the rails into his coat, and if they had gone into him I should have had no objection—I should like to have skewered him as you do a turkey.</p>

I have had instructions to take the prisoner since 20th April—on 15th October I was again instructed to apprehend him—I told him I was going to take him for stabbing Sergeant Ham, on 19th April—he said "I know nothing about it;" he afterwards said "I know who has done this for me, it is the party <hi rend="italic">as</hi> gave me three</p>

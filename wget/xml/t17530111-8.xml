            .</p>
               <p>Q. What is her age?</p>
               <p>S. Hailing. She is upwards of 14 years of age. On the 6th of Dec. I dropt a mettal stay hook, set with Bristol stones, on the floor, in my mother's bedchamber; I bid the prisoner take it up; the next day I asked her for it; she said she had put it by, and it was safe, but could not tell where; I desired her to look for it, but she did not produce it; she having behaved extremely ill, I accused her with secreting it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take it up?</p>
               <p>S. Hailing. No, I did not; but I heard it fall, and saw it lying on the ground. After my taxing her she owned she had converted it to her own use; at first she said she had sold it for two-pence to a woman; after that she said the woman was to give her a ring for it; and at last she said she had given it to her mother, and that her mother told her she was a very good girl, and bid her see if she could get some plate; then I asked her if she had taken any thing else; she then asked me if I missed any money out of my drawer, and owned she had taken fifteen guineas out of it; I desired her to take a great deal of care left she should accuse herself with more than she had taken; then she said she took six half guineas, and told it into her apron, and after that twelve guineas.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was this confession made?</p>
               <p>S. Hailing. This was in our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did your drawer stand?</p>
               <p>S. Hailing. It was in a buroe in my closet.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the buroe locked?</p>
               <p>S. Hailing. It was not; and the key being left by mistake in the closet door, she said she took the opportunity of going up and taking them when we were at breakfast; I desired her to go into the closet and shew me the drawer; she stamp'd, and said she should die at the sight of the drawer ; I shewed the footman the drawer beforehand ; he said to her, if you will not touch the drawer, touch it with a pen, which he gave her in her hand; she took it, and touched the right drawer directly, and said, she had seen me go to that drawer before. There was no stirring but she was always after me of my sister, for which I talked to her before.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money did you miss?</p>

               <p>S. Hailing. I only charge her with three or four guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the money last?</p>
               <p>S. Hailing. I had not seen it for about a fortnight or three weeks before, but can't say how much there was; there were fourteen guineas and a 27 s. piece, when she confessed what she had taken.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was there in the drawer before you missed any ?</p>
               <p>S. Hailing. I can't justly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there twenty pounds ?</p>
               <p>S. Hailing. There were about 30 l. but I chuse to say under rather than over what I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, how much can you say you missed?</p>
               <p>S. Hailing. I can say three or four pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the stay-hook or money since?</p>
               <p>S. Hailing. No, I have found neither.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 68.) On the 29th of March I ob<lb></lb>served the prisoner Colsell and a wagon in the Commercial-road—he had this bag, containing another bag with oats—he walked in a direction from the wagon—I said, "What have you got there?"—he said, "Ducks'food"—I asked where he got it from—he said, "That man driving the wagon gave it me to take home to Exmouth-street"—he called out to the prisoner Adams to stop—I went across the way with him—I said, "Do you know this man, have you given him this bag?"—he said, "Yes, I have"—I said, "You ought to know better, an old man like you robbing your employers"—he said he found the food in the loft, and was going to send it home—I asked if he had got any rabbits—he said he had not, he had ducks—I took them into</p>

               <p>custody, and took Adams to hit master's wharf—he then said he found the food with oats in the loft—the bag that Colsell was carrying contained 28lbs. weight of oats and one nose-bag—I took a sample of oats from a bin on the premises of Messrs. Gamman, and compared them—in my judgment they are exactly alike—Mr. Gamman's name was on the wagon—I searched a place in Exmouth-court, where Adams said he lived, and found some split-beans—there was a pig and some ducks there—it was the place Colsell said he was going to carry them to.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father, Robert Gamman, coal merchant, Wapping-wall. The prisoner Adams was carman to the firm—he was sent out early in the morning before I was there—Colsell was em<lb></lb>ployed by Adams to assist him—we allow him to employ who be likes to help him—the nose-bag produced is one of ours—we never allow our servants to take raw oats—I have compared these with the bulk, and believe them to be the same—I have been in the business eight years, and have been con<lb></lb>stantly in the habit of looking at these sort of things—I cannot say whether when our carman has his helper if he comes to the wharf, he might tell the other man to meet him—it generally requires two to go with the cart.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you mean to swear positively to these oats being your property? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I have compared them—I believe them to be the same quality—I do not say they are the best oats—he had no business with five nose-bags full) of oats—he had four horses.</p>

On the 17th of January, I went up stairs, for about ten minutes, and when I came down, I happened to go out at the door, and saw the glass of the window cut or broken; it was quite dark. The hole was large enough to admit a hand and reach the combs - I missed three or four dozen combs, they were in four packages, each containing six. I had seen them safe just before I went up stairs, the glass was not broken then. I named it to some persons, and the next morning, Daniels came and gave me information; the prisoner was taken to Bow-street - I have never recovered my combs.</p>

            . I lately worked for Mr. Osborne, horse-dealer, in King's-road. I know the prisoner, I was going through Clare-market, on the Friday morning after the robbery, saw him, and asked if he had been up towards Princes-street the night before, he said,</p>
               <p>"No, he had not." A little while after, I saw him with some papers in his hat, doubled up like combs; I immediately went up to Mr. Hamilton's and told his wife I had seen a boy with her combs, as I thought, in his hat - we went with an officer to Clare-market, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>JAMES M'CUE. I know the prisoner by name only. On Friday morning, I was with Daniels; I had heard of the robbery, and asked him about it, he said he knew nothing of it. I told him there had been some combs missing. I saw some parcels in his hat, in the shape of combs.</p>

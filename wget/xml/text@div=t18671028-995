                  </hi> On 8th August, about eleven at night, I was at the An<lb></lb>gel at Stratford, the prisoner and another young woman came up and asked me to treat them; we went inside, and I treated them to half a pint of gin and raspberry—I left the Angel with them at twelve o'clock, and got as far as Kean's newspaper shop—I remember nothing more till George Kean took me home—he is no relation to the man who keeps the newspaper shop—I missed a gold Albert chain—I met the young women a week afterwards and accused them of it—I said, "You had better give me that guard"—they said, "I never saw you or the guard either"—I left them, and two or three weeks afterwards I met the other woman and took her into the Albion Tavern—I afterwards found that Mr. Brown, the landlord of the Oliver Twist, was wearing my chain—I am sure it was mine.</p>

Last Saturday week the prisoner was given into my custody for stealing the chain—she said, "All right; I will go with you quietly; I am innocent, although I was in his company, with another girl of the name of Sheen; I saw Sheen the next morning, she showed me the chain and asked me if I knew where she could dispose of it, but I would not have anything to do with it."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was drinking with this man and another. They came out behind me arm in arm. Sheen said, "I know this young man; I will take him home; "and she did so. I saw no more of her till next morning, when she said, "Emma, I have got a chain."I said, "Where did you get it from? "She said, "Never mind, I had it last night."I said, "It is gold."She said, "I do not think it is, "I said, "I should not like to have it in my possession."I asked a friend to buy it, but he had no money.

               <p>Q. On the 1st of this month did you lose any part of your property? - Yes; a plow heel and a small wheel that we call a windlass wheel.</p>
               <p>Q. These are things of very inconsiderable value? - Very inconsiderable value.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner at the bar, previous to the time of losing this property? - I had employed his master, he is <rs id="t17941208-13-deflabel78" type="occupation">apprentice</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17941208-13-defend222 t17941208-13-deflabel78"></join> to a Mr. Pentering a carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. In that employment, I suppose the prisoner at the bar had access to your house? - To the shop where the robbery was done.</p>
               <p>Q. What ground or foundation have you to suspect the things were taken by the prisoner? - They were taken on him. Mr. Jostling, belonging to the Lord Mayor's court, sent for me, and there it was proved that he had these things in a basket.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not know any thing of your own knowledge? - No, I do not. At the same time, as he is not in the habit of doing these things, I beg leave to recommend him to mercy; I only wish to make him a little example.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. These are two pieces of iron that, I believe, you would not swear to them? - I can bring the patterns; I could swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not his master bail for him? He gave you notice for trial on Wednesday, to-morrow. - I was not at home when the notice came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say it would be more convenient for you to have it brought on to day than to-morrow? - I don't recollect; I don't know that I did or I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know in your own mind the man's surrendering to day, is a day before the notice? - I consented so far as this, as my brother or whoever it was that took the notice, told them it would be more agreeable, because I had so many men under me.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the constable of the city; I stopped the prisoner, on Wednesday, the 1st of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that by virtue of any warrant? - It was between the hours of five<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080060"></xptr>and six; I was coming across Smithfield, and the lad was coming towards Smithfield, I stopped him, and he seemed very flurried.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no warrant? - No, I stopped him on suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasioned that suspicion? - Seeing him have something heavy.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he tell you on an enquiry of him, of them things what he had in his possession? What did he tell you? - He told me it was iron; I told him the magistrate had given me orders to stop every person, at night, with iron.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine him? - I did, at the Compter I told him it would be better for him to tell the truth; I never thought it would come here, I thought he would be convicted under the act of parliament. When I got him and the iron to the Compter I sent to Mr. Bradley, the prosecutor, he came over, and then the nephew claimed the iron.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the iron? - I have had it in my possession ever since,(produces the iron) it is in the same state as when I took it on the prisoner. It is cast iron.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I believe he was in the road (the place where he walked) to his master's house?</p>
               <p>Q. To Bradley. What marks do you usually put on your property in iron? - We do not mark them; but the patterns that we mould them in is generally sufficient.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, a plow heel and windlass wheel, they are common to every person in that trade? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a very difficult matter for any person to swear to any loose piece of these articles, that they shall be his property? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you look at these articles, and tell me whether you can positively swear that these were your property? - These are the same that were found in the basket.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that these are your's? - No, I will not venture to swear.</p>

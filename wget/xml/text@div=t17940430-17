               <p>Q. Your master had the key had not he? - Yes; when we came down to the shop I looked through the crack of the door and I could see a man, I could not distinguish who it was.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you able to discern what this man was about? - I could see him with a bit of iron in his hand and I could hear the iron rattle; he had a light, his back was towards me stooping down; we went to unlock the door, and as soon as the door moved the light was put out, when I got into the door, I bid my master stand at the door, and I rushed in towards where I saw the light, and I laid hold of the man in the dark, and pulled him down on his back, and called for my matter to come.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he when you did this? - In the shop; I had seen him with a light.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the man? - We took him to the watch-house, to the cage.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that man? - The prisoner at the bar, I had known him for years before this. After I had got him in the cage went back to the watchman, got a light, and see who it was, and went afterwards with the light to the shed and we looked to see how the prisoner had got in, and we see half a dozen pantiles were off, over the lost where some old iron lay.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300029"></xptr>Q. How many pantiles do you think were taken off? - Six.</p>
               <p>Q. By means of the pantiles being off could any man come in through the laths? - Yes, there was room for them.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the tiles? - The tiles were laid on other tiles on the roof of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. None had dropped to break? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe in the building? - A bag of iron was under the hole where the tiles were taken off on a shelf, where we lay old iron.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it old iron that was in the bag? - Yes, old iron that was collected from different parts of the shop.</p>
               <p>Jury. How do you suppose the man got in? - I cannot tell, there were buildings adjoining, there was a double roof and a gutter between the buildings.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you been in this lost? - In the afternoon to look out for a bit of iron for the blacksmith.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you use in general to keep your iron in bags? - No, loose in different parts of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the day before seen any iron of your's on the shelf? - No, we had no such kind of bag, it was not our bag, we had no such bag belonging to us; there was a large string at the mouth of the bag about ten yards, one end tied about the middle of the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. How high was the roof from the ground? - The top of the roof was about sixteen or eighteen feet from the ground up.</p>
               <p>Q. How many feet do you think the floor of the lost is to the roof? - About five feet.</p>
               <p>Q. How many from the shelf to the floor of the lost? - About two feet. I looked into the bag directly, and saw the iron.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did the bag contain? - About fifty pounds weight, it was a little bag and nearly full.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, looking at that iron was you able to say whose iron it was? - Some of it; I could say to one piece I had in my hand in the day time before this happened that I could swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you seen that piece in the day time before? - One of the men brought it in out of the yard and put it in the lost, I tossed it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the only piece of iron that you could speak to? - I did not take particular notice of any other piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take this piece of iron out of the bag in order to look at it? - In the shop, and afterwards I put it into the bag along with the rest and tied the bag up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it again before the justice? - Yes, and I am certain it is the same piece.</p>

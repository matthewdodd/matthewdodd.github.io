            . I am ostler at the Four Swans, Bishopsgate-street. On Saturday, the 9th of February, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner brought in this gelding, chaise, and harness, dreadfully splashed, and told me to take them in; I asked if they were to shop all night - he said Yes; he claimed them as his own: Mr. Burrow came between five and six o'clock the next afternoon, and claimed them - the prisoner was taken away from the inn on Sunday morning, by Sheppard, before Mr. Burrow came, a Mr. Bennett having claimed the chaise as Mr. Burrow's: the prisoner had stopped at the house all night, and in the morning, till he was taken; I heard him say, he saw the chaise standing, and got in and drove it away.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for, and took charge of the prisoner - he did not deny taking the horse and chaise, but said he did not mean to sell it; he told me he was a shoemaker, and a native of Warwickshire - that he had been living with his brother, a farmer, but did not seem to know the town; he said he had no residence in London - I did not find a farthing on him.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother, and live at Chesnut-wood, near Warwick - I am a farmer. My brother had been with me about fourteen months, and left me about three weeks last Saturday, of his own accord; he did not say what he was going to do, or where he was going; when he came home to me he was insane, and I took care of him till the 23d of December, 1826, when I went out, and when I came back I was informed he had half murdered the man I had left in care of him; he has never been right in his head since.</p>

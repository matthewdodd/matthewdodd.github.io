            . I have been married to the prisoner twenty-eight years, but have not lived with him for the last four years; he is a <rs id="t18310908-57-deflabel333" type="occupation">pensioner</rs>

On Thursday, the 14th of July, he passed the end of the street, near my house - I went out, and sent my little girl to call him back; he came back part of the way - I went to meet him, and begged him to go home; he seemed quite wet and uncomfortable; he said he would not go home, and told me to go home, and he would not trouble me any more; he went away, and I followed him at a distance into Whitechapel - I was about one hundred yards behind him - I missed him in Whitechapel, and waited there some time, then looked into the Blind Beggar public-house, and saw him sitting there; I called him out - he came out; I asked him to go home - he said he would not - that he would not be yellowed any more - that he would be a pauper on the public - I again begged of him to go home, saying, I would go with him, and beg him off; yellowing is a punishment at the hospital; he said he would never go home any more - I told him I was afraid if he did not return he would go to prison, and he had better submit to any punishment at Greenwich, than go to prison; he then asked if I was going to give him any thing - I said No, I had enough to do to find his children; he then walked on with me, and seemed very much agitated - I felt afraid, and shifted from side to side; this was in Whitechapel-road; and when we came between <placeName id="t18310908-57-crimeloc334">Colt-street</placeName>

               <p>Q.What was the blow given with? A. I could not ascertain I was so frightened - it came from him, for no other person was near; as I stood looking at him, after I received the blow, he said he meant to die himself - but he would kill me first; I ran back in my fright to Colt-street, saying "Will no one stop him" - he was taken, and I was lead over to the London-hospital; he was in liquor; I have seen him on other occasions, when he has been intoxicated, and taken precautions - for when he is in liquor, he seems not quite right in his head; the smallest quantity of liquor seems to take effect on him, and when he had no liquor he used to ramble from his family, and has been two months from the college, without any body knowing where he was, and not always in his right mind when sober - he appeared to have had a little liquor when I first saw him, but he answered more reasonable - he said he had had half a pint of ale at the Blind Beggar, and seemed more angry then than when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long had he been in the navy? A. Twenty-one years - I do not know of his being wounded in the head, but he has been to St. Helena, and was very bad on the voyage, and seemed much reduced in his constitution; he always seemed uncomfortable and wrangling when not in liquor; if I had not sent after him that day he would not liave called.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you not some high words on the road before he cut you? A. It was my urging him so against his will to return to Greenwich made him quite angry - I was not going to take him to the Police-office - there was a warrant against him, and I said he had better go home than to prison - I did not pull or push him - I never put a hand on him; I should have been glad to get out of his way - the would has not injured my constitution at all; I soon recovered, I was discharged on the Saturday from the hospital - when taken before the Magistrate, he was fined 5l. for the assault, and afterward held to bail; I said it was not in his power to get bail, and then the Magistrate settled that he was to be sent to Greenwich; I said I wished nothing more - he in fifty-nine years old.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On former occasions have you put sharp instruments out of his way? Yes, I have done so six times; he formerly begged me to put every thing out of his way, in case he should do me mischief - I have put knives and a razor out of his way; he was in his right mind when he desired me to do so - it was while he was living with me; he returned from St. Helena seventeen years ago, and was paid off.</p>

            . I was at the London-hospital as housesurgeon when the proseuctrix was brought in; I found a simple incised would in the throat, extending merely through the integuments, such a would as a knife would have inflicted, about an inch and a half long; it bled very little indeed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Bleeding might take place if it merely passed through the skin? A. Yes, without passing entirely through the integuments - it was exceedingly slight - it was an incised wound; my impression is that the integuments were cut through - the outher integuments were cut, and it bled.</p>

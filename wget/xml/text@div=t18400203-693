On the 21st of January, between twelve and one o'clock at night, I was in the Almonry, Westminster—the prisoner Stirrup, came up to me, and wrested my stick from my hand—he then commenced beating me—the prisoner Smith assisted him—they beat me with their fists, one before me, and one behind—I was making away as fast as I was able—I never saw them before—by the violent blows I received from them I fell on the ground on my hands—Smith took my hat and stick, and ran off with them—I called the police—a policeman came up the street, and took Smith—I did not see him taken, but I found him in custody shortly after<lb></lb>wards—I also lost a handkerchief and glove.</p>

I know Abbot's shop, but never was in<lb></lb>side it, and do not know where the parlour is—I saw the two prisoners together, about twelve o'clock—I am quite sure it was after half-past eleven o'clock—it was at the Nag's Head, Tothill-street, that is five minutes' walk, good, from the Coopers' Arms—they were standing outside the gin-shop—I cannot be mistaken about them, I knew them too well—I did not see a shorter man about in a fustian jacket—I am certain I am not mistaken in the prisoners—I mentioned it to the inspector when I took Smith—I did not take Stirrup that night, as the inspector said I had better wait till the morning, and let the prosecutor identify him—Stirrup was standing talking to Smith at twelve o'clock—there were two gas-burners in the window, and a large plate-glass—I am positive of him.</p>

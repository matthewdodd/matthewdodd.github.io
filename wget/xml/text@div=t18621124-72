                  </hi>. I am a paper-hanger, carrying on business at 84, Fleet-street—on Thursday, November 20th, about a quarter-past 3, I was in the basement of the house, and my mother called me up—I came up, and in consequence of what she said to me, I went out and saw the prisoner in</p>

               <p>Wine-office-court carrying a bundle of marble papers—I got some distance up the court before he saw me; he then threw the bundle from his shoulder and ran away—I followed him—he turned round from the top of Wine-office court, and I followed him through several streets, to the bottom of New-wharf—part of the way down there is a building, and he went round the bottom of that—I turned through and came face to face with him—I stopped him, and before I had time to speak, he said, "I am not the man that took the paper from Mr. Nind's shop—I said to him, "You appear to know a very great deal about it, then"—I had lost sight of him at some of the corners—he had slackened his pace when I met him face to face—when I came up to the bundle of paper, a boy was standing there, and I said, "If you will take care of that while I catch the prisoner, I will reward you"—when I came back, I found it removed a very little higher up, in charge of the boy—after I caught the prisoner, I brought him up New-wharf into Bouverie-street, and there a mob of ruffianly fellows tried to rescue him, but with the help of a party I knew, I took him to Fleet-street, and gave him in charge of a con<lb></lb>stable—this is my paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was safe in our shop before—one of our men had only shortly before tied it up—I did not notice it after it was tied up.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the parlour adjoining the shop 84, Fleet-street, on the afternoon of 20th November, about a quarter-past 3, and saw the prisoner going out of the shop-door with the paper on his shoulder—I called my son up from the basement, gave him information, and he went after him—I pointed him out to him—I went to the door and watched him across from Salisbury-square, on the side of our house, and saw him take of his hat, and walk with it a little distance in his hand—I watched him about twenty doors further on the other side of the way, and then lost sight of him—he was crossing the road in the direction of Wine-office-court, carry<lb></lb>ing the paper all the time—the paper was standing nearly in the middle of the shop—I had seen it safe a very little time before.</p>

The prisoner was given into my custody by Mr. Nind—I searched him at the station, and found this knife tied up with a piece of string—he gave the address of a lodging-house in Westminster—he did not know the house or the name of the street, but he knew the landlord—I went to several lodging houses at Westminster—at one they thought they knew a man answering his description, but could say nothing about him.</p>

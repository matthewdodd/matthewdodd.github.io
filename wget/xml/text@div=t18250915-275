Harmer was in my employ, and Carter was there occasionally - in consequence of information, I went into my wash-house, and found some bottles which had recently had spirits in them - I left them there, and on the morning of the 29th, I saw Harmer and my son go down stairs - I followed them, and saw Harmer go back to the wash-house - I then heard Carter ask my son where Stephen was; he said, he was out backwards - I looked out at a window, and saw the two prisoners go out; I went down and looked about, and found a bottle of gin in the copper-hole - I went and asked my son, if Carter was gone - Carter heard me, and said, No, and asked me for a glass of gin, which I served him with - I then went and asked Harmer what was the cause of the bottle of gin being in the copper-hole - he said, he was very sorry for what he had done, but he had admitted Carter to sleep there, in consequence of his being locked out from home, and that Carter had gone into the bar, and drawn the spirits. I asked him if he knew of any more being concealed, he declared, he did not - but I looked about, and under some water-butts, and some saw-dust, I found six bottles more of gin, and three of rum - Harmer was present, and declared, in the most positive terms, that he knew not how they got there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. All you know of Carter is, that he went into the wash-house; and then called for a glass of gin? A. Yes, and all the rest I heard from the other prisoner in Carter's absence - I believe I had other lodgers in the house - Harmer and my son slept together, but my son is not here - I perhaps might have played at skittles with one of the prisoners for a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q. How many bottles did you put there to wash? A. I suppose about thirty - I suppose ten or twelve were left.</p>

I am manager to Henry William Bedford, of 67, Regent Street, dressing-case manufacturer—on 15th January, the prisoner came to the shop, and after looking at an album and criticising the price of it, he asked if we had a good assortment of dressing-cases—I said "(Yes," and he went with me into the show-room, I showed him what stock we had, one at 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that was not good enough—I suggested an appointment for the following day when I would get some more expensive ones for him to look at, he called on the 17th and apologised for not coming the day before having some other engagements—I showed him a dressing-case at 150l, he wanted a monogram put on and sundry additions which would bring it up to about 200l—he said he did not object to a few pounds as long as I did the thing right, he liked to pay a good price, that the labourer was worthy of his hire, in which' of course I agreed with him; I asked him for his name and address and handed him my pencil-case "with a piece of paper to write it, and he wrote this in my presence "Colonel Warings, Warings House, Warings Town, County Down"—we had a little conversation on the Eastern question, and he referred to a wound on his cheek, and on his leg which he said he had received in the Crimean war—he left instructions with me to prepare sketches of monograms for the dressing-case—he said when he was in town he stopped either at the Langham Hotel, or the British Hotel, in Cockspur Soreet, at the latter of which he was stopping at then—on 22nd he came again about the monograms; he then looked about the shop and admired the stock and purchased a pair of china figures at three guineas, which he took with him—I let him have them believing him to be Colonel Warings, of Warings House, County Down—on the 23rd he came and selected another pair of figures and a writing set, which he said he would take with him—I said I would send them to the British Hotel, as it was a large parcel to carry—he said "Do," and I sent them, still believing him to be Colonel Warings—on the following day he came again, looked through the stock and asked to be permitted to take on approbation a game box and a photographic album, worth fourteen and three guineas—I said certainly, but as it was a large parcel I suggested that our porter should carry them for him—he said he was going to the Bodega wine stores to have a glass of wine, and the porter took them there for him; I suggested that he should have a monogram put upon the game box, and a cover made for it if it suited, which he agreed to—he came next day and said he could not return the goods that day, because the lady for whom the articles were selected had gone to the theatre and he could not see her the previous night—I subsequently had a conversation with my employer and the prisoner was given into custody.</p>

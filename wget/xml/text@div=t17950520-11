               <p>Q. You are a shopman to Mr. Atkinson? - Yes, he is a linen draper, in Bishopsgate-street without,No. 17, in the City of London. On Tuesday the 28th of April, the prisoner, came into our shop, to buy a piece of muslin; I shewed her several; believe it was about four o'clock in the afternoon; she said she wanted about a yard and a half; - I shewed her several; she said she fixed none of them. I left the wrapper before her while I went to the other end of the shop, to get another piece I thought would suit her, and while I was gone; I see her move her arms, which I suspected she had put something underneath her arms; when I came to shew her this piece of muslin, she did not like it; I shewed her several others but she would not give the price for them; I though she had got something; as she was going, I had a mind to see; I reached over the counter, litted up her cloak, and found the muslin under her arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the muslin? - The constable has got it, I believe.</p>

               <p>Macclugh. That is the piece of muslin; I know it by several marks on it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you know how many pieces of muslin were laying on the counter? - No I do not.</p>
               <p>Q.Supposing, for instance, you sell any of these muslins, the private mark goes with them? - If it goes altogether.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200014"></xptr>Q. You don't take off the mark; therefore this may be purchased for what you know? - I am certain it was in the wrapper before this woman came in.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know what number of muslins you have? - No, we do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you cannot judge from the number of them, that you had lost any of them? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you say you had seen this muslin? - A little time before the prisoner came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. The same muslin you took from underneath her arm? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Atkinson. I was up stairs and the bell was rung, and I immediately ran down, and this man had hold of the prisoner, and the muslin under her cloak and I had her kept in that situation till Sapwell, the constable came.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known any thing of her before? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What partner have you? - None.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Duke of Gloucester public-house, New Road, Whitechapel—on 10th November, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the morning, the prisoner, who had been there a month before, came in for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. Worth of rum—he gave me a shilling, which I found was bad before he left—I did not tell him so, but I followed him some distance, but was forced to let him go, having no one there but myself—I had given him the change—on the former occasion he paid with a shilling, which I found to be bad after he left, and gave it to my mistress, who put it in a drawer—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on 10th December he came again, and was served with 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of rum—he gave me a bad shilling—I sent for a policeman, and then showed it to the prisoner, who took another shilling out of his pocket, and said that he could not see any difference in them; he gave it to me, and I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I threw the bad one on the counter, and he took it up and gave me the good one—as he was taken to the station, I saw him throw some money in the street—Button picked up three penny pieces, two halfpence and a sixpence—I gave the two shillings to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 75, Whitechapel, on 26th December, I was in the Duke of Gloucester public-house—Mr. Moss showed me a shilling, I would almost swear it was bad—I left before the prisoner, and pointed him out to the constable and he was taken—on the way to the station he said "If you want it, you can take the lot," and threw some money away—at the station the inspector asked him what he had done with the shilling given him by Mr. Moss—he said that he threw it away coming out of the house—he spoke to a stout female without bonnet or shawl, just after he left the public-house—I picked up the 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; it was three pence, two halfpence and a sixpence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I gave the prosecutor one shilling on 26th Decem<lb></lb>ber; it was the only one I had; he said it was bad; I said "I don't think it," and threw it back to him and he give me the change. I was in a temper when I threw the money away, because I was going to be locked up on Boxing-day, when I was going to have some beer with my friends. I have had money returned to me as bad, which has afterwards turned out to be good; matches will change it.</p>

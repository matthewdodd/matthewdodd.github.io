On the 4th of August, about six o'clock in the evening, I returned from the city, and was told he had gone out with a new hat on, and left his own behind. I found the till empty, which contained four sovereigns and 20 s. in the morning. He was the only person there except the errand boy. I went to his lodings - he was not there - I went there again about two o'clock in the morning, and found him; the hat was there; the constable charged him with stealing the hat and money; he said it was all very true. Four sovereigns and some silver were found in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. In the morning you left 5 l. in case change should be wanted - A. Yes; he managed the shop. I saw his wife when I first went to his lodgings. She fetched him, and next time I found him at home. I have every reason to suppose he was intoxicated, and in that state he might take the money, meaning to take care of it.</p>

            . I am errand-boy, and am thirteen years old. The prisoner went out about five in the afternoon with a new hat on, and left his own behind. I said,</p>
               <p>"Why, you have got one of master's new hats on." He said, Yes; he was going to shew a gentleman the shape of it. I saw him at the desk about a quarter of an hour before he left, and when my master came home he missed the money. I saw he appeared the worse for liquor. He told me to get the tea ready, and he should return in ten minutes, but never returned. We shut up at nine o'clock.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's lodgings, and found him in bed. The hat was on the drawer, which Bennet claimed. I said he must go to the watch-house. I said I took him for robbing his master. I did not mention money or any thing. He was very much intoxicated, and said he very well knew all about it. I found four sovereigns and six shillings in his pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Charles Skinner. On the 14th of Sept. I was at the corner of Bow-lane, Poplar—I had in my pocket one shilling, six halfpence, one penny, and sixpence farthing—I had seen this money safe when I had purchased a pennyworth of suet at a shop just by—there was a person at the comer selling "practical jokes," and while I stood there I heard some halfpence chink in my pocket—my hand was not in my pocket, but some one else's was—I turned immediately, and laid hold of the prisoner, who was the nearest to me—there was another person near me, but not near enough to have put his hand into my pocket—I held the prisoner till he got from me—I called, "Stop thief"—he began to walk—I took hold of him again, and kept him till the officer came and took him—he had not an opportunity to communicate with the other man—I do not know whether he had an opportunity of throwing money away—I had lost one shilling and six halfpence.</p>

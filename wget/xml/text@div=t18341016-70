            . I am in Mr. Eaton's employ. I have looked at the silver found on the prisoner - I had been working on some of it - I know this silver by certain marks on it - it was in my drawer in the workshop - here is about one ounce, worth 5s. - I marked it before it was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are your marks on this? A. Yes- file-marks - they are cuttings - I did it with the edge of the file - there is nothing peculiar in it - I can swear it is the silver I marked - I would swear to it if I saw it at any distance off - other workmen might produce the same mark- it was marked on purpose to detect the thief - here is more than I lost - I only identify part of this - I said I marked some of it - my brother William was present.</p>

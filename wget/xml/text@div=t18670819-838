I walked out, looking at the shilling. I said, "I can see this is a bad one now," and when I counted my change over I had only 91/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., instead of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 91/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I thought the shilling he had given me was my own, aud threw it away, that it should not get me into any further trouble. I never dreamed of his giving me a bad shilling in change.

            . On Tuesday, the 17th of April, about nine in the evening, going by the Fleet-market, the prisoner and a sailor pushed by me in a very odd manner; they went on before me: this gentleman and a young woman were walking together: I saw the prisoner go up to the side of him, and bring something from his side; what it was I cannot say: I saw him give it to the man in sailor's cloaths: the sailor made off with it. Mr. Perkins took hold of the prisoner, and said, you have picked my pocket: he said, me pick your pocket; no, by G -, I am as honest as yourself, and can bring persons to prove it. He desired to be searched.</p>

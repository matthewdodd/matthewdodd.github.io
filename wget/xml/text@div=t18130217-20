               <p>Q. Was your house broken into on the 13th of January last - A. Yes, about ten minutes past six in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What part - A. The shop window; the third pane from the door was broken; the lower pane of all.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in the shop at the time - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed that pane to be whole in the course of the day - A. Yes, I had, two or three hours before that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What articles do you expose in the window for sale - A. It is a corner window. One window watches and clocks, and the other window more particularly jewellery.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at home at the time - A. I was in the upper room, in the first floor. I was at tea at the time, and in returning from tea to the shop, on my entering the shop I went to that window to turn a lamp. I heard a rattling noise in the window. I perceived a man's hand in the window, and one of the silver spoons in action. I immediately opened the door, and in opening the door he drew his hand back and ran away. I immediately pursued him. I overtook him about an hundred yards from my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of him - A. No, never from the time that he had his hand in the window. I brought him back to my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find anything on him - A. Not of my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any of your property taken away - A. Yes. I never got it again. I do not know what became of that property.</p>
               <p>Q. What was taken away - A. Four silver caddy-spoons, value one pounds two shillings the selling price. I gave eighteen shillings for them; three tea-spoons, about three shillings and sixpence a piece; the selling price five shillings each; a pair of sugar-tongs, ten shillings and sixpence or eleven shillings; one desert spoon, twelve shillings; and one plated table-spoon, six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out of the shop was the prisoner running - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other person running - A. Not any. I do not know that anybody else was near the spot. When I took the prisoner he asked me what I wanted with him. I said, you rascal you are the person that robbed my shop. He said nothing to that. I collared him and brought him to my shop, but I did not find any of my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see when he was running whether he threw anything from him or not - A. I do not think that he had time. I did not perceive that he did.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear the window break did you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you came down was it before you saw his hand in the window - A. It was immediately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adams. The last time you observed this window whole, was two or three hours before - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For anything you know or perceived the window might be broken while you were up stairs - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard no breaking. If the window had been broken when you came down stairs you must heard it, must you not - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For anything that you know the window might be broken while you were up stairs - A. No doubt it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181302170013"></xptr>Q. You cannot say that the prisoner broke it - A. Yes, by his hand being in.</p>
               <p>Q. You also say you found no property upon him - A. No property of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. For anything you know the things might be taken away while you were taking of tea - A. No such thing. I do not imagine they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not possible that the window might then be broken - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And, of course, if the window had then been broken it is also probable that the person that broke it might take the things away - A. It is probably. I do not believe that the window was broken. I believe it was cut.</p>
               <p>Q. It might be cut while you were up stairs - A. Yes, no doubt it was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you find anything about the prisoner that would have cut a window - A. No.</p>

            . I am a parish constable. I know nothing more than taking the prisoner in custody. I searched his person, and as I was searching him I found the fore finger of his right hand bleeding. It appeared to have been cut with glass. I asked him how that was done. He said, that was an old wound. I am sure it was not an old wound. There were a few drops of blood on the floor where he stood. I found nothing on him but his own property.</p>
               <p>JURY. Was there any blood on the glass - A. I did not see that. The prisoner's finger was cut length-ways.</p>
               <p>COURT. What time was it when you got there - A. Between six and seven. Nearer seven than six.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adams. Are you a surgeon - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you distinguish a cut from glass from a cut of anything else. Can you distinguish a cut from glass from a cut from anything else - A. I cannot.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square office. On the 26th of January, I met the prisoner in custody at our gaol, I asked him what brought him there. He said, you need not say anything, my crime is heavy enough. I said, what have you been up to; why, said he, I have been breaking a window at Pimlico.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words - A. I asked him, what brought him there. He said, you need not say anything at all about me, my crime is heavy enough. I said, what have you been at. Why, said he, I have been breaking a window at Pimlico.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. to prosecutor. Which way did the prisoner run when you came out of your house - A. Towards the Queen's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, when you came out, look the other way to see whether anybody was running, or not - A. No, I did not. I did not lose sight of him after seeing his hand in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his person until you got out of the door - A. Yes, I saw his person, but not so as to distinguish the features of his face. I saw his body.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the crime that is alleged against me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

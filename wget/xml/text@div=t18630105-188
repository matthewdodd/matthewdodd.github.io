                  </hi>. I reside with my father, at 49, Westmoreland-place, City-road—on 6th November, I was servant to Mrs. Gedley, of 5, Artillery-court, Chiswell-street—on 6th November I was sent by her to Mr. Thorpe's, in Bunhill-row—it is about ten minutes walk—about ten minutes past 6, I was coming back with 4 mantles in a bundle which had been given to me at Mr. Thorpe's—when I got into Bunhill—row I saw the prisoner—he came up to me—I had seen him in the early part of the afternoon—I had been two or three times to Mr. Thorpe's—him walking up and down Bunhill<lb></lb>row once or twice, I can hardly recollect which—there was somebody with him; that was about 4 o'clock—as I was coming back with the mantles, about ten minutes past 6, he came behind me, and tried to snatch the bundle from me, but I held it so tight he could not get it away—I began to scream, and he caught me by the throat, and tried to throttle me, and dragged me across the road—I fell down at the corner of the court where he dragged me to, and then he got the bundle—before he got the bundle the other one who was with him came and gave me a kick at the side of the head—I did not see so much of that man as I did of the prisoner—he was like some one that I had seen before—I have seen a good many persons like him—I tried to follow that man, but he got away—on the 11th I was taken to the station-house by a policeman, and then saw several persons—I picked out the prisoner as the person who had assaulted me—I heard the charge read over to him, and he said he could prove that he was at his young woman's house from 2 o'clock till 10 in the evening—I had previously given a description of the man to the officer.</p>

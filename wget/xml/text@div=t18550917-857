               <p>On Saturday, 1st Sept., the prisoner came, towards dusk—she had a bottle of ginger beer; the price was a penny—she gave me a shilling; I gave her change and she left—before she left, I placed the shilling on the back counter; there were no other shillings there—within three minutes, when I had washed the glass, I took the shilling up to make up the difference of the penny, which I had taken from the till—I tried it with my teeth, and found it bad—I put it in my pocket, where I had no other shilling—when I went home at night, I placed it in a small jar, and kept it by itself—I afterwards gave it to the constable, when the prisoner was taken—on the Wednesday following, the prisoner came again about a quarter to 4 o'clock—I saw her in the shop, and knew her—she asked for a bottle of ginger beer, I served her—she gave me a bad shilling—I turned round and tried it with my teeth, and told her it was bad, and that she bad passed one with me before, and I should give her into custody—she replied that I should not <hi rend="italic">nail</hi> her, and ran away—she ran out of the shop, I followed her, and caught her about fifty yards off, at the corner of Homer-street—I did not see any officer—I detained her there—she looked round and said she would walk quietly with me to the station, which was on the right-hand side—she turned the corner with me, and she had no sooner done that than a man came up and said, "What is the matter, my dear?" she said, "This man is going to give me in charge for passing bad money"—the man took hold of her hand that had the purse in, from which she gave the shilling and said, "Come along"—he pulled her away, and I let go her hand—they walked very quickly till they got to the top of John-street—the station is in a line with that—I had previously sent a boy for a constable—they saw the constable coming, and the man ran down Should-ham-street as fast as he could go—the prisoner ran down Crawford-street—she was taken, and I gave her in charge—I marked the two shillings, and gave them to the constable—I am quite sure they were the two I had received from the prisoner.</p>

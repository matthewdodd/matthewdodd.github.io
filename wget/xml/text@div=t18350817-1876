                  </hi>. I live in St. Paul's Church-yard, and an a liven-draper, and have one partner. On the 15th of August, we market one crown, one half-crown, four shillings, and two sixpences; and about a quarter of an hour afterwards, I asked the prisoner, who was in our employ, what he had sold—he said he had sold a cape for seven shillings—I went to the cashier, whose duty it is to receive money, and found he had paid him se<lb></lb>ven shilling—I then went to my friend, who I had solicted to go to the shop, and found he had purchased two collars for fourteen shillings and sixpence—I then went to the prisoner, and told him to produce what money he had—he first produced some halfpence, and then reluctantly produced a crown-piece and a half-crown, which I had marked, and given to a gentleman to purchase goods at my shop—these are the monies I had marked.</p>

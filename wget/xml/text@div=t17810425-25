I came home on the 9th of April about twelve at night; I went to bed; about three in the morning I was called up by a nurse attending my wife, who was lying-in; she said there was somebody breaking into my house, or the next house; I had slept found; I rested a little; then I opened the window, and saw some persons were in the street; soon after, I heard a single tap at the street door, which I took to be a signal for persons in the house to come out of it. Upon this I got up, and went down stairs; I found the kitchen door wrenched off the hinges, and the kitchen windows had been forced; in the kitchen I found a dark-lanthorn; and, some time afterwards, there was a crow found in the area. In looking to see what loss I had sustained, I missed the buckles out of my shoes, which were standing in the kitchen, as I pulled them off over night; and there was likewise missing, a silver top of a castor; every place in the kitchen had been searched, but there was nothing in it but common kitchen furniture: the communication between the kitchen and the rest of the house was very secure; so that they could not get in, except by great force and noise, to make their way further. I was not disposed to enquire into these matters, not having sustained much loss, but I was acquainted by one of the neighbours of an advertisement. I went to the office; there I found the top of my castor, and there I saw the prisoner. I am very certain that at night every part of the house was fastened when I came in. I was let in by the boy,

I know this top of a castor; I cleaned it; there is a dent in it, which makes me certain it is the top of my master's castor; I have seen it very often; it fitted the mustard castor. The outside window shutters were wrenched open, the wood of the inside shutter had been cut away, and a hand had been put in, by which means the bolts were undone.</p>

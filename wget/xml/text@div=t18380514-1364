                  <hi rend="italic">Mr. Cockburn</hi> Q. Was that the nomination day? A. Yes. Q. Did the polling commence on Monday? A. Yes. Q. Did you go up stairs? A. Yes. * * * * * Q. Who spoke out of the window? A. Mr. De Horsey and Mr. Miller. Q. You went to hear them speak from the same window? A. Yes. Q. And they did speak? A. Yes. Q. After Mr. Miller had spoken, did you see him go any where? A. I saw him going into a room. Q. What descrip<lb></lb>tion of room? A. On the left-hand-aide on the first. flight of stairs. Q. He went out of the room in which he had been speaking, and went into ano<lb></lb>ther? A. Yes he did, Q. Was it a sitting-room or a bed-room? A. A bed-room. Q. Did anybody follow him into that room? A. Yes, Mr. William Mason. A. After they had gone in, was the door closed or not? A. It was nearly closed-not latched. Q. Do you mean that it was ajar? A. It was a panel door, with a catch to it. Q.

               <p>that the catch was not fastened? A. No, it was not fastened. Q. Did either you, or Wall, or Plant make any observation? A. Wall did. Q. In consequence of what Wall said to you did you go any where; did you place yourself any where? A. Yes, we went close to the door. Q. Wall said something to you, no matter what; but in consequence of what he said to you, you and Wall, and Plant went close <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the door? A. Yes, Q. Did you hear Mr. Mason say any thing to Mr. Miller? A. I did. Q. What did he say? A. He said that there had been expended, Q. Can you give the precise words of the conversation—was it that there had been 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. expended, or that there would be 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. expended? A. He said that 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been expended, as near as I can recollect. Q. Well, go on? A. And then he said he wanted 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more to buy seven score burgesses, or else Mr. Miller would lose his election, which was just, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-piece. Q. Did Mr. Mason, at the time that he said 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been ex<lb></lb>pended, say any thing else? A. I cannot recollect whether he did or not. Q. Perhaps you had better tell the Committee, from beginning to end, in your own way? A. He said he wanted 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to buy seven-score burgesses; and Mr. Miller made this reply, "I do not know how it is, Mr. Mason, when I go to a poor man to solicit him for his vote, I get bron<lb></lb>beated in a most shameful manner," which I know he has, for I have he and it myself—I have heard him <hi rend="italic">brow-beaten. Q.</hi> What do you mean by bron<lb></lb>beaten? A. When there has been a promise of any thing, it has not come forward, and Mr. Mason has pocketed the affront? Q. Can you tell me what Mr. Miller said? A. He answered, and said, he must not lose him election for the sake of that much money—he said, "I wish I had never coalesced with Mr. De Horsey." Q. After that, what did you do? A. After that, when we heard that—it was not me who rushed into the room first, but Wall; and he saw us, and Mr. Mason put his hand into his pocket and offered us a half-crown to drink his health, and we refused to take it. Q. Who was it that went into the room? A. I believe Wall—I saw them both in. Q. Did Plant go into the room? A. I do not know whether it was Well or Plant. Q. Who was it that offered you the half-crown? A. Mr. Mason. Q. Did he open the door? A. It was open. Q. But so as to admit of his going in? A. Yes. Q. When the door was open, did you see who was in the room? A. Yes, Mr. Miller and Mr. Mason. Q. did you see any one else in the room? A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Committee. Q.</hi> Who did you say offered you the half-crown? As Mr. Mason. Q. Did he offer each of you half-a-crown? A, No, half a crown among us—he put his hand into his pocket, and offered us all three the half-crown, and we refused to take it. Q. You said you did not go into the room? A. When Plant and Wall went into the room and rushed upon them, Mr. Mason and Mr. Miller came out, and in the lobby Mr. Mason offered us a half-crown. Q. Then you had gone into the room? A. I am not certain whether Wall or Plant had—we were all closed to the door. Q. Did the other parties who went into the room come out? A. Yes. Q. And half-a-crown was offered amongst you all three? A. Yes. * * * * * * * *</p>

I do not know that I had any curiosity for going. Q. How came you to go up stain? A. Because he spoke up stairs. Q. I thought you told us that you heard him speaking out of the window? A. I was up stairs in the room. Q. Then there can be no mistake about it, that you were in the room when he spoke, in the very same room, on the Saturday night? A. Yes. Q.

We saw them go in, and we went to the door to tee if we could not hear some conversa<lb></lb>tion—it was through what Wall said—he said, "Let us go and hear some<lb></lb>thing," Q. What did Wall say?

And when did you see them go into the bed-room on the left-hand of the lobby? A. It was soon after the speech was made; about half an hour, or thereabouts. * * * * * Q. Can you tell the Committee whether it was a dark or a light passage? A. It was in the evenings between nine and ten o'clock. * * * * * Q. Can you inform us whether you could see these two gentlemen as they were speaking? A.

                  </hi>. I am Member of Parliament for the Borough of Newcastle, in Staffordshire. I have represented that Borough in tour Parliaments—I was a candidate at the last General Election in July, 1837—Mr. De Horsey and Mr. Badnall were the other candidates.</p>
               <p>Mr. De Horsey and myself was of the same political interest, and Mr. Badnall, I believe, was on the opposite interest—the dissolution of Par<lb></lb>Diament was on the 17th of July, and I arrived at Newcastle on Tuesday night, the 18th—I proceeded to canvass the electors on Wednesday morn<lb></lb>ing, and continued doing so during that day—I first addressed the electors in a speech on the Wednesday evening alter the canvass, from she Castle hotel, where the friends of Mr. De Horsey sad myself used to assemble—I took up my quarters in the town, at the house of Mr. William Mason—I lived and slept there all the time I was at Newcastle—I have a residence in Scotland, and one in Buckinghamshire, where I generally reside—I slept at Mr. Mason's, on the Wednesday night after I had made my first speech to the electors, and every night while I was in the place—I can<lb></lb>vassed again during the Thursday, and again addressed the electors, very shortly I believe, in the evening, from the Castle—on the Friday, I again canvassed during the day, and in the evening went with Mr. De Horsey and several other gentlemen, to the Theatre—I did not address the electors on Friday evening—I went direct from the Theatre to Mr. Mason's house-no speech was made during that day by me—the nomination was on the Saturday, I think, at eight o'clock in the morning—Mr. De Horsey and myself went to the nomination, and when we had been proposed and se<lb></lb>conded, we addressed the electors in the Town-hall—I should think it was then a little after nine o'clock, or between nine and ten—the whole business was over early—after that business was over, I again pro<lb></lb>can remember, about five o'clock, which Mr. De Horsey, and a number of other gentlemen, I should think fifteen or more—we dined in a large back room on the first floor—I left the Castle, I should think, soon after six o'clock, from six to half-past six—it could not possibly because much as half-past six o'clock—I do not think it was so late—it certainly was not so late as seven o'clock—we then went and canvassed a few voters who Q. Now after leaving the Castle hotel between six and seven o'clock, on the Saturday evening of the nomination, did you again return to the Castle at all that night? A. Not at all that night—after leaving the dinner, I con<lb></lb>tinued canvassing the electors little more than an hour, I should think, per<lb></lb>haps an hour and a half—it might be an hour and a half-till about eight o'clock—I cannot distinetly remember what part of the town we canvassed—we passed through several streets, going over rather more ground that the Saturday evening of the nomination,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183805140172"></xptr>
               <p>as it was only to call on persons who were not at home before—on an canvassing ceasing for that evening, I went to Mr. William Mason's, at whose house I was residing-to the best of my knowledge it could not be so late as half-past eight o'clock when I got there—I think it was about eight, or, perhaps, ten minutes after eight o'clock—it was from eight to half-past eight o'clock, certainly not later—I found Mrs. Mason at home, and took tea with her in the drawing-room—I did not go out of Mr. Mason's house again all that night—I went to bed early, between ten and eleven o'clock—soon after ten I should think—I am quite sure, that after arriving there I did not go out at all—I am quite certain that the day of which I am speaking was the Saturday before the election, the day of the nomination, for on that Saturday I dined at the Castle, but on every other day I dined at Mr. Mason's—the polling was on the Monday—it was over much before four o'clock—I was at the head of the poll—the Nos. were for myself 669 or 667-635 for Mr. De Horsey-and 292 for Mrs. Badnall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have given this account of what took place during the Saturday, I must now ask you, in point of form, did you address the electors, or make any speech from any room in the Castle on these Saturday evening of the nomination? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not—I was not there at all between nine and ten o'clock—I did not on that evening go from any room in the Castle hotel into a bed-room on the left-hand side of some stairs, or any other bed-room—I was not followed into any bed-room, nor was I in any bed-room with Mr. Mason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Mr. Mason say to you that there had been 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. expended and that he wanted 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more to buy seven-score burgesses, or else you would lose your election? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he did not, or any thing of that kind, at any time or place, not that sum or any other sum—I did not say, in answer to that, "I don't know how it is, Mr. Mason, when I go to a poor man to solicit high vote, I get brow-beaten in a most shameful manner"—I never said that, or any thing of the kind—I did not say to him, on any sum of money being mentioned, that I must not lose my election for the sake of that money, nor any thing to that effect-nothing of the kind was ever said by me—I never said I wished I had never coalesced with Mr. De Horsey, nor any thing to that effect—on the contrary, I was perfectly satisfied with the coalition as advantageous to both parties. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now did such an occurrence as this ever take place, that you being with Mr. Mason in a bed-room, or any other room in tae Castle hotel, a person named Wall rushed in on you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No-certainly not-nor Galli<lb></lb>more or Plant—they neither of them ever found me and Mr. Mason toge<lb></lb>ther any where in the Castle hotel—Mr. Mason did not, in my presence come out of the room into the lobby, and, offer them half a crown, or any other sum of money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have heard the alleged statement upon which I put the seven last Questions to you—I ask you, is there one word of truth in any one part of that statement, as far as relates to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as relates to me, there is not one word of truth in it—it is wholly false—that, nor any thing of the kind ever took place between me and Mr. Mason, or between me and any other person—it is my firm belief, that at the last election no person was bribed, or illegally treated in any way on my behalf.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think you say you have been a representative of the borough of Newcastle for four Parliaments? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183805140173"></xptr>
               <p>is the fifth—my political principles are Conservative—they have always been Conservative or Tory—I never sat for the borough of Newcastle as a Reformer—I never sat on any other principles than I now do—I have been a Tory all my life—I have been a member of the Carlton Club ever since it was established.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you not now know, Mr. Miller, that bribes were given at former elections on your behalf for the borough of Newcastle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I do not know it—I have never taken the management of any election.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has not money of yours at the previous elections for the borough: of Newcastle been, to your now knowledge, applied to bribe voters; and have you not sanctioned that conduct by the payment of that money afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not believe that the payment of money after an election, even if I suspect some part of it has been improperly applied, implies a sanction of that application—I have not known that any money I have paid has been applied to purposes of that kind—I never had any thing to do with the settlement of any account as to what should or should not be paid—it has been entirely in the hands of my agent, who, without consulting me, has paid or not paid what be thought proper—Mr. Murray, in London-street, was my sole agent, I believe, at all the elections—I will swear he was at all except one, and I believe he was at that one also—that I believe was the second contest I stood, in 1831—I do not know whether he was down there, but he acted as my agent, and he is the only party with whom I have transacted business in settlement of the accounts at all the elections—I always considered him my sole agent—I communicated with him con<lb></lb>fidentially on all the circumstances—he was my only agent, to my know<lb></lb>ledge—he was the only person I considered as my agent—my reason for qualifying the answer is, I think I have heard one or two legal gentlemen were employed during the election, and it might have been supposed they were my agents, but I did not so consider them—I will certainly swear I had no agents but professional agents—I believe I have never paid a farthing to any other person than professional agents at any of the elections—I never paid money to, or settled accounts with, Mr. Mason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you authorised Mr. Mason to pay monies on your account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I may have authorised him to pay such things as subscriptions to cha<lb></lb>rities in the town, and things of that kind-at the last election, when I left his house, I requested bin to pay my private bill for post-horses at the Castle, which, I believe, was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as I was short of money—I had given my purse to some ladies who passed through, and I believe I bor<lb></lb>rowed two sovereigns of Mr. Mason, for I had not enough to take me on to Stockport—that was the only instructions I gave him to pay money at the last election-to the best of my recollection, I never authorised him to pay money on my account at any election; hut, of course, for small things, like the post-horses, it is impossible my recollection can go through the four elec<lb></lb>tions—they might be such sums as 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe I have never au<lb></lb>thorised him to make any payment for me whatever for what can be called election purposes-as I said before, in going over the four preceding elec<lb></lb>tions, there may be something which entirely escapes my recollection; but I certainly, on my oath, have no recollection of ever having Commissioned him to pay any sum of money whatever connected with any election, nor any money for me, except, I believe, subscriptions to charities, and the post-horses at the last election—I would wish to state, in addition, that I think, probably, when I have been at his house before, perhaps he has</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183805140174"></xptr>
               <p>saved me the trouble, and paid the post-horses for me when I have come in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Be so good as to give me the names of your last committee at New<lb></lb>castle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my word, I cannot give you that, for I do not know—these was a committee <hi rend="italic">pro forma</hi>—there were a few gentlemen that were called the committee on the occasion of the coalition between me and Mr. De Hot<lb></lb>sey—they were stated to be the committee for both, but I have been told that those gentlemen took no part whatever in the election—I cannot re<lb></lb>member their names—I believe Mr. Mason was one, but I am not sure—he sometimes accompanied me on my canvass—he was certainly an active supporter of mine—he is a man of considerable influence in Newcastle—I recollect one or two of my most active supporters objecting to their name being put on the list of the committee, and I do not recollect whether Mr. Mason's name was put on—I rather think it was—I think he was one of the committee—I have some doubt, or I would not express it—I am not Quite certain, but I think he was one of the number—I think Mr. Joseph Bailey was one, and Mr. Leicester—Mr. Hall was the chairman; but, in answering to their names, I do it not so much from my own recollection of any thing about them at the time, bat from having heard the evidence given before the Committee of the House of Commons, and having my memory refreshed by that—it is not from any recollection of my own that I answer the Question of Mr. Bailey and Mr. Leicester being on the committee, but from having heard the proceedings, which satisfies me they were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you attend the committee-room at Newcastle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. De Hor<lb></lb>sey and I were present in a large room at the Castle hotel, with thirty on forty other persons, when it was proposed that various gentlemen should be named as on the committee of the Red and Blue party,-and it Was pro<lb></lb>posed that Mr. Hall should be chairman—I was present, but I unhesitat<lb></lb>ingly answer, that there was no business done by that committee, further than a declaration that the coalition should be generally announced in the town, and I never was at any committee meeting at Newcastle from that hour—I never attended a committee afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the persons named on that occasion Mr. Mason, Mr. Bailey, Mr. Hall, Mr. Eardly, and Mr. Hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have mentioned with regard to Mr. Leicester and Mr. Bailey, I have no certain recollection myself though I have no doubt about it, having ascertained it since-with regard to Mr. Eardly and Mr. Hand I remember still less—the only one I can positively and unhesitatingly swear to, from my own knowledge at the time is, Mr. Hall, who certainly was on the committee—I remember him, as he was named our chairman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have given us the number of the voters who polled at the elec<lb></lb>tion, did the prisoner vote for you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember—I have been told he did—I believe he did—I have no doubt I canvassed him—I have no particular recollection of every one, among nearly a thousand elec<lb></lb>tors-unless I had seen him vote I could not tell—I believe he voted for me, as I have been told so since—I believe the number of the constituency of Newcastle is nearly a thousand-of that number there are freemen and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. householders—I do not know what proportion the freemen bear to the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. householders—I should suppose there are eight hundred, probably, on the roll as freemen, but a great number of them are also householders-about six-eighths or eight-tenths of the whole, I should say, at least, are</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183805140175"></xptr>
               <p>freeman—Mr. Badnall and Mr. De Horsey were the two who had the majority by the show of hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you have the kindness to tell me any one voter's house to whom you went after half-past six or seven o'clock on the Saturday night before the election? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Indeed I cannot tell you the name of one—I left the looking after them always to the gentlemen who were with me—I know the Lower-street—I do not exactly know where I went that night—I went some distance from the Castle, but what streets I went round I cannot tell—I will not undertake to say I was not in the Lower-street, or whether I was in Church-lane, I have canvassed the town so often—I have always had gentlemen with me, and remember very little of the relative situations of the Streets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear you were not in Church-lane after half-past eight o'clock, that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have told you before I am confident I was at Mr. Mason's before half-past eight—I certainly think I may swear I was not in Lower-street and Church-lane after half-past eight, for it is my full conviction I was at Mr. Mason's at a quarter half-past eight at the latest; but if it should be a minute or two later than I suppose, I do not like to swear to a thing of which I am not positive; but it my full belief that I was nowhere but at Mr. Mason's house after half-past eight o'clock—I should certainly say it is impossible that I should have been both in Lower-street and Church-lane, after half-past eight o'clock—I do not remember whether the road from one or the other is to Mr. Mason's, but I do not believe I was out so late—I will not swear to a minute or two, because I did not look at my watch, and had no thought of any subsequent examin<lb></lb>ation on the subject; and my recollection being first called to matters of time and place, for many months afterwards; at the same tinge, as this was the 22nd of july, a month after the longest day, and as we had not candles at first after my goings into Mr. Mason's, I conceive it was not after the time I mention—we sat by daylight, after I arrived at Mr. Mason's-whether that could be on the 22nd of July in that latitude, I cannot say—I think I have answered positivery whether I was in Lower-street or Church-lane after half-past eight o'clock-for take reasons I have stated, and those only, cer<lb></lb>tainly I can swear I was not-from the reasons I have stated to you, but not from any recollection of the circumstances through every hour previously.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You must give me an answer one way or other; will you swear po<lb></lb>sitively, without say qualification, that you were not in Lower-street and Church-lane after half-past eight o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have given tae qualifica<lb></lb>tion with regard to the state of the light, supporting the reasons for my recollection—I will swear positively I believe I was not—I shall give you no other answer—I firmly believe I was not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, I ask you on your oath whether you were not in the Royal Express public-house after half-past eight o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my oath I do not know that there is a public-house in Newcastle called the Royal Ex<lb></lb>press—I believe I was not in any public-house after half-past eight o'clock—I have no recollection that I was—I can answer toe question no more positively—I was in various houses that night—I have no knowledge of leaving any public-house after half-past eight o'clock with several other peo<lb></lb>ple, and going into Lower-street and Church-lane—I certainly did not leave any public-house after that time to go and canvass—I do not know the di<lb></lb>rection in which I went canvassing—I nave no recollection of being in any public-house, but I was in some eight or ten houses on that short canvass—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183805140176"></xptr>
               <p>may have been in a public-house, and I may have been in a public-house approaching that time; but I believe it is very unlikely that I was in any house, except Mr. Mason's, after ten minutes after eight o'clock—I do not know a man named Boot—I have not the least recollection of canvassing a man of that name at a public-house of which he was the tenant—I can give no other answer—I can swear to my full conviction that I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I ask you without Qualification. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> But I will only answer you with a qualification—it is my full conviction, on my oath, that I did not canvass the man you mention, nor any other man so late as half-past eight o'clock—it is my full conviction I am correct as to time, but I know the mistakes which are made as to a few minutes, and I will not on oath say—I did not afterwards accompany any person that night arm-in-arm into the Castle hotel—I do not recollect whether I passed by the Roebuck hotel that night—it is not at all unlikely I might, but I do not remember.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you pass by the Roebuck hotel that night after half-past eight o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will answer that with the tame Qualification as I have an<lb></lb>swered your former questions—I believe I had taken up my quarters of Mr. Mason's at a quarter or at the latest twenty minutes after eight o'clock, but for ten minutes or so I am unwilling to swear positively—I will swear positively I did not pass the Roebuck at nearly nine o'clock that night—I have told you before the means I had of knowing the time—I did not look at my watch, but the general appearance of the afternoon—I had no other means of knowing the time—I might look at my watch, but I have no recollection of doing so—I will swear most positively that, I did not address one word to the crowd that night from the Castle, nor on the day before—it was nearly dark at half-past eight o'clock—I do not dis<lb></lb>tinctly remember, but it was so light that we had not candles when I first went into Mr. Mason's; and as it is darker in-door than out, it was most likely we should have had if it was approaching dark—it was getting darker, of course, at eight o'clock-if this was the 22nd of July, and at the same hour of the afternoon, I could swear more accurately than I do now—I will swear I believe I was not out after the time I have named—I can give no other answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear you were not in company with Mr. Mason in the Castle hotel that night when it was nearly dark? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That I will most positively—I did not enter the Castle hotel with Mr. Mason and several others after seven o'clock—I quitted it after dinner, and did not enter again—I did not enter it after seven o'clock that night—I did not address the people on the outside from the Castle that night, and state that I was much fatigued, and hoped the burgesses would be at the poll the first thing on Monday morning-nor did I then wish them good night—I did not do so between nine and ten o'clock, and nearer ten than nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you canvassing in the High-street that night after eight o'clock, or after half-past eight o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I must give you the same answer to that as I gave with respect to the other places—I believe I did not canvass after about ten minutes after eight o'clock, and about that time, and with the same qualification as the similar questions I answer that—I will under<lb></lb>take to say, I was not seen by one, two, three, four, five, or six persons after nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After half-past eight o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With the qualification I have given before, I certainly answer that—I firmly believe not—I am not certain whether the expenses of the last election have been fully settled</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183805140177"></xptr>
               <p>or not—I pay the expenses ultimately myself—I have paid a sum of money for the last election—I believe I have paid the expenses of the last election—I have not had any account of them communicated to me—I expect to receive them from the same gentleman I mentioned before—we expect he will give some statement of what he has paid; but hearsay is not evidence, or I could give you hearsay—I rather think I have paid the full expenses of the last election.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now I ask you, what were the whole expenses, including every thing you paid, for the election before this one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my word I cannot recollect—I have paid for four elections, and the accounts have often been settled some little time afterwards, and some of them may have been, in some degree, mixed—it is impossible to say exactly—it would even put me to some trouble, if I went home and calculated the communications I have received on the subject—it is really a difficult question to answer, without I might qualify it, by stating, at least some portion of what I was informed those expenses were for-if I am expected to answer the question as nearly as I can, I wish to state, at former elections there was as I have been informed—(I never sanctioned any thing of the kind,) but I have been informed it was the practice at Newcastle, as it is in most boroughs, I believe, for the friends of the candidates to give liquor to voters in public-houses—that has been done, I apprehend, extensively, and to that way, considerable sums may possibly have been expended—that is, as I have been informed—I do not conceive that any species of treating is legitimate—I have not considered myself responsible for the mode in which the accounts, were settled—my agent has paid what accounts he considered it right to pay, and such, I suppose, as he considered it right to refuse, he has refused—I have only paid in that way—I never made any exact statement of what I paid for the election preceding the last—I think the whole expenses, including legal assistance, and all matters, were some<lb></lb>thing less than 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was for the election immediately preceding this—I believe it was not more than 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will not undertake to swear it—I will swear it was not 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I do not believe it was 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will swear it was not 3500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should say it was not 2500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I be<lb></lb>lieve I have not paid 3500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that election—I cannot remember what I paid—I believe it was nothing near it—I will swear I did, not pay 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor my thing near it—I have several accounts at different times of differ<lb></lb>ent sums that were wanted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KELLY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were they written accounts, or merely verbal statements? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think my agent may have written to me to desire me to remit a sum of money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We want to know whether you have had rendered to you any account, detailing to you the items of the expenses of the election? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my word, I am not sure whether I have or not; but I will give, one answer to the question, which you will perhaps be surprised to hear; if I have had any account rendered, which I do not remember, I have not read it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not that because you were perfectly well aware of the practice at Newcastle to pay the voters money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not—I am not aware, indeed, that it is the practice—I have never scruti<lb></lb>nised what the money was paid for—I have given my agent such sums as he said he ought to pay for the election; and at times it has not been paid by myself, for a friend has even done it unknown to me; but I must say</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183805140178"></xptr>
               <p>no person ever paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for any election of mine but myself, ultimately, to my knowledge—I have not had a person to act for me for the purpose of preventing any legal knowledge of the fact of paying voters—I have told you I had an agent-nobody else was authorised by me—I know Mr. Christie—he never paid any sums of money for me, except in the way I have said-when I have not had money at my banker's in London, he has several times advanced sums connected with the election, and other sums I wanted to advance money for-if I had said to him, "Be so good as to pay 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," or any sum, to this person or that, he would have done it—Mr. Christie does not live at Newcastle—he is not connected in business with Mr. Mason—he is a hatter—they deal together, but I understand there is no connexion-not like partnership.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, I will not fatigue you by going through the three previous elec<lb></lb>tions, but I ask you to tell me what the borough has cost you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have pretty much the same difficulty in answering—I do not know of any practice of paying voters 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a head—I never heard of it—I have heard of such a practice; but certainly I disavow, on the part of the borough I re<lb></lb>present, that any such corrupt practices existed—I believe it has been the practice, after the election for a member of Parliament, for each of the mem<lb></lb>bers, or some of their friends, to give a dinner to the principal voters; and it has been usual for all the candidates, winners or losers, to give, after the elec<lb></lb>tion, half a sovereign to every elector, who chooses to accept it, who does not attend the dinner—I do not know that I can tell what the borough has cost me—I can give you my belief with regard to the cost of the last election—I suppose, altogether, the borough has cost me something like 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it has not cost so much as 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will swear that positively—that sum has not been expended on my elections, to my knowledge—I have made no calculation; but when you take a round sum, which I know greatly to exceed the truth, I can swear positively to it; but if you go into detail, it is not possible to answer—I do not believe 14,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been expended-you must give me a quarter of an hour in another room, if I had the accounts, to bring the thing in some degree to my memory—it has not cost me any thing like 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe it has not cost me 14,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe it has not cost me 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I will not swear it has not cost me 14,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the last election.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does that include the half-guinea you have spoken of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is more than I know of—I have not been furnished with any account of the last election—Mr. Christie advanced money for me—I paid him 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. be<lb></lb>fore I went out of town, saying, "If you should be called on for any mo<lb></lb>nies on my account, I give you that in hand;" and I have been informed he paid that exact sum to my agent—I do not expect to have to pay move—I will swear I do not expect to have to pay much more—I do not know of any practice in the borough of paying the voters 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-piece—I have heard of such practices, but not of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now have you not paid your election expenses on the footing of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-piece, being given to certain electors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not paid it on any such footing—I have paid the account in the lump, on the credit and re<lb></lb>sponsibility of my agent, without ascertaining whether there was any money paid to voters for votes, or not—I have not examined into the ex<lb></lb>penses minutely or attentively, and do not know to what purposes they were applied, but I was told the chief sums spent at former elections were for publicans' bills—I was told upwards of £2000.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The question is, whether you have paid money, under<lb></lb>standing it to be applied to the payment of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you preferred this prosecution, and expected to be examined here, did you not consider it probable you would be asked whether you had participated in any bribing of voters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly I did-no money was applied for that purpose to my knowledge—I attended be<lb></lb>fore the Grand Jury to prefer this bill at the last Sessions, I believe—I cannot say that I directed my attorney to apply for a certiorari to remove the case from this Court to a superior Court—I believe he did make such an application, but it was without any instructions from me to that effect—it was made without my knowledge—I heard that it was refused—I was in the Committee-room of the House of Commons, when Mr. Austin ad<lb></lb>dressed the Committee in reply—I could not be examined myself as a witness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know any thing of the Mr. Baileys, who you are not quite sure were on your committee, taking a bag with above one hundred sovereigns in it to the Slipper public-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know nothing of it—I heard Mr. Joseph Bailey examined before the Committee of the House of Commons, on the subject-if any such sum has been expended on my account, which is more than I know, I take it, that is the way in which, probably, some part of the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was expended, but I have not the slightest knowledge of it, more than I have been given to understand, at former elec<lb></lb>tions it was the practice-if any such sum has been expended, some part of the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has gone to pay it—I have not ascertained that any money has been paid to the voters—I have assurances from all quarters, that nothing has been spent in bribery, but I have no knowledge of any transaction connected with it—it is all hearsay.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a hat manufacturer, living at Newcastle.

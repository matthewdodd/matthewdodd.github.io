               <p>Did they take your shoes and buckles away with them? - They were not found on the woman, one of the witnesses found them.</p>
               <p>Court. Where do you live? - I live servant with Mr. Wardell.</p>
               <p>What is he? - He is a carpenter by trade, and keeps a shop, I did not live with him, when this affair happened.</p>
               <p>In what employ was you then? - I had been in London about six weeks, or rather more, I came from seven miles on this side of Northampton-town, I lived with Mr. Merchant, the milkman, and his wife and me disagreed, and I came away, and I had no friends in London, and I happened to be walking along that field, and intended to go back to Northampton.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was you ever in that field before? - No.</p>
               <p>Was nobody passing by? - No.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was it? - It was between nine and ten at night, it was quite dusk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. What business had you upon Chelsea-common at that time? - No business at all, I was a young girl, and came away from my place.</p>
               <p>A great many other young girls at this time, on Chelsea-common? - I did not see them.</p>
               <p>There was some talk about paying your footing, was not there? - I heard no such thing.</p>
               <p>You had a bundle at this time? - Yes, I gave her the cap out of my bundle.</p>
               <p>They did not meddle with your bundle? No, there was nothing in it worth any body's taking.</p>
               <p>You do not keep company with men at all? - I never did in my life.</p>
               <p>Was not you turned away from Mr. Merchant's service, by a soldier coming after you? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court. You have no right to go into any transaction of that kind, you cannot affect her character by any thing that comes out of her own mouth, you must call witnesses to her character.</p>
               <p>Had you any character from Mr. Merchant? - He gave me a character for being honest and sober, I came there without a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230139"></xptr> character, I wish I had not, my shoes were never returned, the patrol came and I told them, and they searched the man and woman, and made the man get up, and the shoes were under him, and I owned my own shoes.</p>

No answer was made, but in a few minutes after I saw a man having a cutlass catch hold of a woman, and she had something in her apron, and they were a pair of shoes, and I saw one of these men take a pair of shoes from the woman, I cannot swear it was the woman prisoner, the girl came and looked at them, but they were not her shoes, then a man came and said I have got the man and the shoes, and the girl then said these were her shoes and buckles, I cannot swear to the man prisoner.</p>

               <p>Court. What reasons have you for saying so? - While we was gone one time to see my wife's mother, she got a man into the house and locked the door, and a customer of mine came for some milk, and knocked at the door several times.</p>
               <p>Do you know this of your own knowledge? - It was by her own acknowledgment in my own house, and coming down she was very much confused, she said she had been up stairs to shew the lodging to the gentleman, and she locked the door because she thought somebody might come in, but however we never saw any thing of it, and she offered her service to go home with a black to America, if he would take her.</p>
               <p>The prisoners each called two witnesses who gave them a good character.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutrix. Who advised you to carry on this prosecution? - Nobody advised me, those gentlemen said they would see I was righted, I did not understand the business, nor I do not.</p>
               <p>Before you went to the magistrate did you receive advice from any body to bring this indictment, and to lay it so as to affect those people's lives? - Sir, these gentlemen bid me say the truth, and I have said no more than the truth.</p>
               <p>Did they give you any particular advice in regard to bringing this indictment? - They did not give me any particular advice, before the magistrate I was asked the questions the same as you have asked me, and I resolved them.</p>
               <p>Who paid for the bill of indictment? - Mr. Day.</p>

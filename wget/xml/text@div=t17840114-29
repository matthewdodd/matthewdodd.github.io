               <p>Court. Do you keep gold in your waistcoat pocket? - Not common, but I had pulled out my purse in the public house to pay my reckoning, and I put it into my waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>How long had you pulled it out before you met the prisoner? - About a minute.</p>
               <p>How much money had you then? - Three guineas and a half in gold, and half a guinea and four shillings in silver.</p>
               <p>Were you sober? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What at that time in the morning? - That is the common time in the morning that we are at work.</p>

               <p>What time had you come out that morning? - We had been out all night, it was Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Had you been at work? - No.</p>
               <p>Then what did you mean by telling me, that was the common time of your being at work? - We had been having a supper that night.</p>
               <p>Why did not you say so? What time had you supped? - About ten, and we were drinking after.</p>
               <p>Were you sober? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Will you take upon yourself to swear that? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>How came you to put your money in your waistcoat pocket? - I put in my money there accidentally.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you did put it in your waistcoat pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you felt it there after you had come out of the public house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>What occasion had you to feel for it after you came out of the public house? - I put my hands in my waistcoat pockets, I most generally carry them there.</p>
               <p>You say you immediately missed your money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you do upon that? - I went to seek after her, but could not find her.</p>
               <p>How long was it after she had been with you before you missed your money? - About a minute, she went home, and I went back to the public house, I missed my money before I got half way there.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140037"></xptr>Where did you miss it? - I was not a yard from the spot before I missed it.</p>
               <p>How many yards was she gone from the spot? - I cannot tell, she did not go the same way.</p>
               <p>But if you had gone but one yard one way, I suppose she would have gone but one yard the other? - I went into the public house to tell some of my fellow-servants of it.</p>
               <p>The first thing would have been to take the woman? - She might run up any alley.</p>
               <p>But did she? - I had my back to her.</p>
               <p>While you was walking one yard she could not be far gone. - She turned up Dyot-street.</p>

               <p>How far was that from the street where she laid hold on you? - About twenty or thirty yards.</p>
               <p>And do you mean to say, that while you was going that one yard she had gone twenty or thirty yards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When she laid her arm round your waist she run away directly - Yes, as soon as she got loose.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by that, had you hold of her? - No.</p>
               <p>Then what had she to loose from? - Only to take her arms off my waist.</p>
               <p>Why did not you run after her? - I did not miss the money then.</p>
               <p>Did you stand still? - I stood still to make water before I went away from the place, after I missed the money I went to the public house, and told one of my fellow-servants, and we went and got a constable, we could not find her that day, we found her about a fortnight afterwards;</p>
               <p>Did you know her before? - I never saw her before; she was in the public house while we was there.</p>

               <p>How long? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Was she in your company? - She was in some of my fellow-servants company. We were all drinking together.</p>
               <p>What did she say when she was taken up? - I cannot say, I was not there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a saddler's ironmonger, and live in Mar<lb></lb>tin's-lane, Cannon-street. The prisoner was my clerk—he has been so about nine months—it was part of his duty to call for accounts due to me—On Saturday, 10th April, I sent him to the Lunatic Asylum✗ for an account owing to me from Mr. Phillips—he brought me back the check for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said it had been written for him against he should call—he said Mr. Phillips asked him for the discount, and he said, considering he had been a good customer he would allow him the discount, and therefore he gave him 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he gave me this check with another check, and I gave him the 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which he said he had paid to Mr. Phillips—I gave him a half-sovereign and four shillings, believing his statement—this receipt is in his writing.</p>

Q.</hi> Were any wages due to the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think there were—he was paid as he made application for money—he had just completed nine months with me—up to a day or two before that his wages were 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, and I meant to advance them to 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year—I cannot tell what I had paid him, whether his account was strictly balanced to a few shillings—I believe he was rather overpaid—I really cannot say whether there was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in arrears—he had applied to me a few days before this for the settlement of an account of a few shillings—I was very busy at the time settling a cash account, and told him I could not go into it—I could not give him the money then, to come again—he never applied to me after that—if I had settled this account with Mr. Phillips I should have allowed him five per cent.—he was entitled to five per cent.; but he was a retail customer, and the rule of settling accounts with wholesale and retail customers is very different—there is not a distinction made on the bills of wholesale and retail customers—I am obliged occasionally to accom<lb></lb>modate a few retail customers—to these small accounts the discount is not always allowed—the accounts are not always sent out on these printed forms—if</p>

               <p>Q. How long was she a lodger in your house?</p>
               <p>J. Sharp. She lay seven nights in my house, in the same bed with me; I took her in, thinking her an honest person; she took an opportunity to take my gown out of my trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss it?</p>
               <p>J. Sharp. The day after Christmas-day. I was drinking tea, and I took my key out of my pocket, and left it upon the table.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it last?</p>
               <p>J. Sharp. I had not opened my trunk for three weeks before, or better.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner when you missed the gown?</p>
               <p>J. Sharp. She went from me on the Saturday night, and I missed it on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with her again?</p>
               <p>J. Sharp. I found her in Moorfields, and asked her what she had done with the key of my trunk: she denied knowing any thing of it. Then I said, What have you done with my gown which you took out of my trunk? She denied that too; but at last she owned she had pawned it for ten shillings in Houndsditch. I went to the place where she directed me, and there I found it. [ Produced in court, and deposed to. ]</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She lent me this gown, and I was to pay her 18 d. per week.</p>
               <p>Q. to J. Sharp. Did you ever lend her that gown?</p>
               <p>J. Sharp. No, never, neither to her or any mortal in the world. I have had it about 35 years, I did not use to wear it much myself.</p>

               <p>Smith. It is a sort of damask, or sattin gown.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lend her upon it?</p>
               <p>Smith. I lent her 10 s. upon it. I asked her whose it was; she said it was her mother's, who lived in Swan-alley, near Goodman's-fields; and that she had had it near 40 years.</p>

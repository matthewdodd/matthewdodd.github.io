                  </hi>. I am a clerk in Leadenhall-street—about a quarter to 6, on 28th December, I was walking up Cheapside—just as I got to the Old Jewry the Guards passed, and immediately after that, I suddenly felt a tug at my chain—I turned round, and distinctly saw my watch in the prisoner's hands—it was never severed from my chain at all—the chain held to my waistcoat—at that instant another man jostled up against me—I made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at the prisoner, he avoided it, and ran across the road—my watch was then hanging down—I put it in my pocket—I managed to catch him just by the Mansion-house—when he saw it was quite impossible <hi rend="italic">to</hi> escape he slackened his pace, and turned round and said he was only coming out of that public-house—I said, "You attempted to steal my watch"—I took him by the collar and said, "Come along with me," and gave him in charge—I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

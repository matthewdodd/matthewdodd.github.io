            . I am a medical man, and a member of the college of surgeons, and an apothecary - I attended the coroner's inquisition - I had seen the body of the child a day previous - I did not see it before the inquest - I attended the child's mother Mrs. West, and saw the child frequently during her illness - I should say the immediate cause of its death, was from neglect of proper care and attention, and nourishment - I conceive it died from want of proper food, such as is usually given to children of that age - the body exhibited the appearance of extreme emaciation, without any visible sign of disease; and marks of erosion on the skin, and different parts of the body, which I should say was from the clothes being left dirty on it, and not being properly changed - I cannot positively say the child died of starvation - there had been a bowel complaint I understand, and there was that appearance - it had the appearance of having suffered from weakness of stomach - that is a common thing with children, independent of the want of food - I can offer no decided opinion of the cause of its death - it might have been a disease incident to children, from weakness of bowels.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not common, that where the most proper food is administered, a child which has been weaned, and the stomach being out of order, the child becomes weak, and dies? A. It is common - the child had been weaned in consequence of its mother's death.</p>

            . I am an apothecary - I am not a member of the college of surgeons - I first saw the child on the 9th of August - it died in a week or ten days - the immediate cause of its death was diarrhoea, a complaint that is common to all children that don't wean well - the child had been weaned - the most proper food would be that most like the food it had left, such as milk and water.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the prisoner, (a <rs id="t18330905-126-deflabel714" type="occupation">child</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18330905-126-defend1309 t18330905-126-deflabel714"></join> of fifteen years old) able to distinguish what should be done in such cases? A. The knowledge of young people at times is very great, as to the treatment of children, - otherwise I should be sorry to trust a child to so young a nurse; the selection of food may undoubtedly, be attributed to want of experience in persons so young as the prisoner; a child requires great care; I say the child died of diarrhoea - but we must draw our conclusions from what we hear; in this child there was no appearance of disease in the bowels, and where children don't thrive from natural food, there is generally an appearance of disease in the bowels; they certainly sometimes die of mere weakness of the bowels; it is entirely a matter of opinion; my idea is, that if the child had received proper attention, and food, it would not have died; I cannot swear that it would have lived, but in all human probability it would have gone on well with proper treatment; if a child of the prisoner's age were not informed of what was proper to give it, she would naturally give it the food she used herself; it had certainly not been nourished, the body was extremely emaciated, that always follows with the bowel complaint undoubtedly, especially in the epidemic which had recently visited us; the mother died not long after the child's birth; I understand then it had a nurse for a short time; then it was sent into the country, and afterwards came back to the prisoner.</p>

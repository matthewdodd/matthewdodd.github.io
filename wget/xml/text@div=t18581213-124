                  </hi>. I am clerk to the last witness. In August last, in consequence of directions, I went to 9, Albert-square, Commercial-road, and saw a person who represented himself to be Mr. Cooper—I told him we were referred to him by Mr. John Cartwright, of Holloway-road, who had stated to us that he was commencing business there with about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he had from his grandfather, and that he (Mr. Cooper) was the executor—I also mentioned some minor details as to rent and furniture—he said he knew nothing about that, but Mr. Cartwright would have more than 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that the leasehold property was worth from 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it would be divided between Cartwright and a sister, and that Cartwright would have two-thirds of the produce—the will was not mentioned at all to my recol<lb></lb>lection—he offered to become security, should we require it, to the extent of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said that the reference seemed satisfactory, and I thought probably it would not require his security, but I would take his name in case we did—he gave me his name, John Cooper—I saw Cooper again on 3d September, and I told him we had not hitherto troubled him with the guarantee, but as the account was increasing, we now wished to have it—he inquired how much Cartwright had had of us—I told him about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he appeared surprised, and said we ought not to have let him have so much without having some money on account—I told him the reasons we had done so was, that he had promised to pay 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account shortly, and I also understood that he had said, that he was buying all, or nearly all, his goods of us—I then presented a letter of guarantee, which I took with me and he signed it—I told him I understood that Mr. Cartwright had said that the property was now sold—he said it was, and had fetched more than was anticipated, and that Cartwright would have at least 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. clear—he said that the purchase would be completed on the 14th of that month, September—I told him that we should require reference as to his (Cooper's) responsibility—he said there were many persons to whom he could refer, but as he should be sure to be asked a thousand questions, he would rather not do so—I asked him if he had employed a professional agent—he said he had not, the purchaser would have to do so, and he thought it was not necessary for him to do so as he wished to avoid expense—on my pressing him still further, he said he would think the matter over and call on us in a few days—I went again to his place on 17th September—he had gone away—I could not find admittance.</p>

             sworn. - On the 7th of June, near the Shepherd and Shepherdess, I missed a pocket-book and a handkerchief, the prisoner stood behind me, we were looking at the East-India soldiers exercising, a friend was with me, trying to get in at the gate, the prisoner stood by my side two or three minutes; I missed my handkerchief and pocket-book about five minutes after; I had had my hand upon them both about half an hour before that; the pocket-book was found upon the ground on the same spot; my friend took the handkerchief out of the prisoner's pocket, but I cannot swear to it, there is not mark upon it, but I believe it to be mine.</p>
               <p>- TIPPETT sworn. - Mr. Henley and I were looking at the soldiers, and Mr. Henley missed his property; I took the prisoner about ten feet from where the people were standing, and I searched him, and found this handkerchief in his pocket, and some little trifling things besides, that nobody has owned; I found the pocket-book lying on the ground. At the time Mr. Henley was speaking to me, a lady said, in the hearing of the prisoner, I saw that young man take it out of your pocket; I asked her to go down to the office, but she refused.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any answer to that? - A. None.</p>
               <p>JOHN WRAY sworn. - The prisoner was brought to the office. I searched him, and found two more handkerchiefs in his breeches, and a duplicate of another.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Henley.) Q. There was a considerable crowd at this time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And other persons were as near to you as the prisoner was? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the handkerchief? - A. About ten-pence to me, but not for sale.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never saw the gentleman to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

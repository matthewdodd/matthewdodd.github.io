             and James Gunning Stevenson.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 5th of June last, did a lighter called Susan come to your wharf - A. Yes, about the 5th of June, I am not positive to the day, my wharf is at Mill Bank.</p>

               <p>Q. To whom did that lighter belong - A. To Mr. Bradshaw.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did the deals belong - A. To Messrs. Wood and Dorvill.</p>
               <p>Q. From that time till about the 11th of June, did that lighter continue unloading - A. It did. On the morning of the 12th I missed her myself, and to the best of my recollection she was tied to the wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. About how many deals had she had in her - A. About two or three hundred when she was lost, all the deals belonged to Wood and Dorvill.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe afterwards you sent a clerk of yours of the name of Berney - A. Yes, and from information I went to Scott's wharf at Chelsea, I there found the lighter, she had been sunk, the tide was leaving her, there was water in her; and I went to Mr. Sibley's premises at Chelsea, I there saw about two hundred of the deals.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know them to be a part of the deals you lost - A. By the general appearance they were of the same cargo, they had upon them the same marks as were upon the other deals, the rest of the cargo. I had no doubt they were the deals I had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found the lighter it was empty - A. Empty.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Wood and Dorvill to place these in your wharf - A. Wood and Dorvill treated with me for the purchase, they were offered to me, and being a cargo of various qualities it was thought advisable that we should see how they turned out before we purchased them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were in a course of delivery to you and afterwards you agreed upon the purchase - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At any rate, were you responsible for them - A. So far as being under my care. We have two or three deals, here, they are marked by my servant that sorted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. That servant has absconded - A. He has absconded.</p>
               <p>COURT. How long had this barge been lying at your wharf - A. She came up about the 5th of June and we began unloading her until the 11th or 12th, and then she was missing.</p>

            . Q. I believe you are clerk to Messrs. Stevenson - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this lighter while she was lying by your wharf for the purpose of unloading - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she lying on the river - A. On the bank, floating at high-water, and on the mud at low-water.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the part where she was lying in the river - A. Yes. On the morning of the 12th I missed her, I afterwards went in search of her, I found her at Scott's wharf at Chelsea on the morning of the 13th, I found the deals taken out of the barge, the plugs pulled out and the lighter nearly full of water.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use of the plugs - A. When the barge is overloaded and the water comes in they have no other way of letting it out.</p>
               <p>Q. From thence did you proceed in search of the deals - A. I did, I found them on the premises of Mr. Sibley, I should think it three quarters of a mile from Scott's wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. How many deals did you find there - A. Two hundred and forty nine single deals.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them again - A. Yes, I knew them by their general appearance, by the mark of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080034"></xptr> the cargo, and by the mark of our man, who had sorted them; this one has the mark of our sorter, a W.</p>
               <p>Q. How is it that they have not all the ship-mark - A. I do not know, it is sometimes the case. This one appears to have been cut, the ship-mark is generally upon the edge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Do you know whether any of the deals were on the wharf - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is impossible for you to tell whether these deals were taken from the wharf or the barge, they are the deals I admit that were originally in the barge - A. All those that were loaded had the sorter's mark upon them, except some few which laid in the barge when the men left off work; I missed no deals that were piled on the wharf, only those that were left in the barge.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had you known the prisoner before - A. I know the prisoner by being in my club, how long I cannot say; it might be six months or a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of that time had you seen him frequent - A. No, not seen him frequent, but I have often times seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you helped to work in that barge the night before - A. I never worked in any craft of Mr. Stevenson's.</p>

               <p>Q. From what place did you have these deals - A. From Scott's wharf, from on board a board a barge.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see that barge - A. The day before the deals were found at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. The deals were found at your house on the 12th - A. I saw them the day before at five o'clock in the morning at Scott's wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was there first, you or the barge - A. The barge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it coming up the river - A. No, I did not. I went there by appointment, a person came to me that brought up the deals.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of the barge coming there the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080035"></xptr> day before - A. I expected deals by a barge.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, and tell me whether he had been with you a day or two before - A. I cannot say it was him; it was a person very much like him.</p>
               <p>Q. Look again, you have seen him before - A. I have, at Queen-square; I have some doubts of his being the man.</p>
               <p>Q. You have some doubts, have you - A. Yes, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you seen the person that came about the deals - A. I saw him once before he brought the deals; he came and said he sold deals by commission; he offered me some for sale; he said the deals were at Dock-head; I asked him if I could see them; he said he was going down that day, and he would bring them the next morning, and if I did not approve of them I had no occasion to buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him the price - A. I did, he said as they were an inferior sort, thirty-five.</p>
               <p>COURT. This was before you had seen them - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Do you mean thirty-five or any other sum, recollect what you have sworn to - A. He asked thirty-five; I agreed for thirty-five if I approved of them after they came up.</p>
               <p>COURT. You said he asked thirty-five - A. He asked more, I believe it was forty; I said I would give thirty-five if I approved of them.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of the 12th did he bring them to Scott's wharf - A. Yes, on the day before they were found at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you fetched down to Scott's wharf - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Scott's wharf to where you live - A. Near a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did he come in the morning to your house - A. Near five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go down to Scott's wharf with him - A. I did. I found the deals in the barge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go on board with him - A. I did, and examined the deals, I agreed upon the price; to the best of my recollection it was thirty-five; I began to land them in about an hour and a half; it took us the whole day to get them into my premises; on the next morning Mr. Berney and the officer came and claimed them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were they - A. Upwards of two hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoner, do you or do you not believe him to be the man - A. I cannot say; I believe he is very much like him; I cannot say. To the best of my knowledge he is the man; I cannot say he is the man.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mr. Stevenson. Have you been out and examined the deals that are in the yard - A. I have, they have two strokes on the edge, that is the ship's mark in this instance in the deal that is here the mark is gone.</p>

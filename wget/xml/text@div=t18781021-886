I am a machinist, and live at 32, Norland road, Notting Hill—the prisoner is my wife—I partly recollect the 15th September; at half-past three that afternoon I went to bed intoxicated—I was awoke by my wife having hold of my upper lip with her teeth, biting me; I have no recollection of her striking me with anything; I have a <hi rend="italic">void</hi> recollection that she had something like a knife, but being three-parts drunk I did not know what it was—I received very slight injuries on the side of the head, nothing to speak of; there was just a little blood—I halloed out to her to let go; a man came into the room and said, "Is this your little game?"—I became faint and insensible, when I got drunk afterwards—I had quarrelled with her that day; I had left her without anything to eat all the week, and that day I beat her, and the day previous also—on the Saturday morning I gave her a shilling, and went out. <hi rend="italic">By the</hi>

               <p>and she got vexed about it—I have been a brute to her; I was the aggressor all along—I asked the Magistrate to look over it, but he would not—we have been married 13 years; we lived very happily for nine or ten years and then we separated for 18 months; she left me; she was addicted to other persons, and got drinking, and I beat her, and through grief at her drinking I took to drinking—I asked her to come back, and she did, and we lived together till this happened—she kept very well for a month or six weeks, and then she took to drink again; she got into other women's company, and they led her astray—when sober she is as good a wife as man ever had—I am unhappy without her; I wish to get her off, with your kindness—she was not in bed when this happened; she was leaning over me in the act of kissing me, and biting me; it was more in affection than anything else; she did not bite through my lip, it made no impression, there are no marks; the doctor strapped it up next day, and it has never been dressed since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master mason, and lodge at 32, Norland Road—about 4o'clock on the afternoon of 15th September I was in my room upstairs, and heard three distinct groans—the landlady was crying out for me to go into the prisoner's room; I did so, and saw her behind the door with a knife in her hand doing something to a towel, and her husband lying on the bed weltering in blood—I said to her, "What have you been doing?"—she said, "I have done it, and I wish that I had done it a little more, and for twopence I would serve you the same," and she threw the knife at me—she said, "Now I have done it; you can go with your b—wh—s," and she threw a lot of flour and carraway seeds over him as he was lying insensible in bed—I picked up this knife and gave it to the constable—I detained the prisoner till a constable came—she appeared sober, an 1 very cool and collected, not in any passion.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 13, Ladbroke Grove—on the afternoon of 15th September, at a few minutes past 5, I was called to the station and found the prosecutor suffering from three wounds on his head; they were clean cut wounds, two running into one another; they were not deep—they were stabs, he had a wound on the thumb also—this knife would inflict such wounds—they were not important, there was not much blood—he was quite sober then—I did not see any wound on his lip—I examined the prisoner; I found a bruise on her left shoulder and one on each knee, they looked like kicks.</p>

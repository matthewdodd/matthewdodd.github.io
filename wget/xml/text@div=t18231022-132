            , I went to the house of the prisoner, on the 10th of October, in company with Fidler - she went in first. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"How many there are, who get a living in this way;" I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes." The prisoner said she had gone to Croydon-fair, and passed fifteen; I understood her to mean half-crowns; she asked how many I should want - I said three. She went to a table drawer, and brought out a great many half-crowns in a bag. When she gave me the half-crowns, I was about to put them into my pocket, and she said,</p>
               <p>"No, they will rub;" she took them from me, and wrapped them in separate papers, to prevent their rubbing. She asked if I wanted any more; I said</p>
               <p>"To-morrow will be the best buying day, (Saturday)" - she said she always thought that was the best day herself. She asked if I should want larger or smaller. I had received 2 s. 6 d. to purchase them, from Avis; but the silver had not been marked - I had no more money of my own, and gave her the same money I had of Avis. He accompanied me to the spot, and I gave him the money when I came out. I did not see the man (Nash) in this transaction. I had three half-crowns for one good one.</p>

            . The statement of the last witness is correct. Fidler was the person who gave me the information. Bartram was hired to assist in the discovery. I did not see the man on that day.</p>
               <p>MR. POWELL. The three half-crowns produced are counterfeits, and from the same die, as in the former case.</p>

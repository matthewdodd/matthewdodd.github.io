                  </hi>. I am assistant to my father, Benjamin Woolf, he is a tailor in Regent-street. On 18th July, I saw the prisoner at our shop; he said he had just come from India, and landed at Brighton, and he had left his baggage on board; he required a clean shirt and collar, with which I supplied him—I asked him where they should be sent to—he gave the name of Sir John Hill, Bengal cavalry—he said he was staying at the Trafalgar Hotel, Spring-gardens—I asked him if he wanted anything else, thinking he was a good customer—he said he had left his dressing case and all his things on board the ship, and he should require a dressing case for the morning—he requested me to bring it—he gave orders for two coats, two or three waistcoats, a couple of pairs of trowsers, and various hosiery; I do not know exactly the amount of all of them—he then left, and said he wished the shirt and collar to be sent down to the hotel—he put on one waistcoat in the shop, and took it away with him—I took the shirt and the collar to the Trafalgar, and finding Sir John Hill lived there, I left them—the next morning I took down the dressing case to the Trafalgar, and the prisoner gave a further order for shirts and other things—I think it was eighteen shirts, two dozen pocket handkerchiefs, a dozen socks, and some minor things—he said we were not to have the cambric handkerchiefs marked, and as soon as the ship arrived, he would give me his crest, that we could have it embroidered on the handkerchiefs—I delivered some of those things.</p>

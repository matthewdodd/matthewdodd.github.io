I am a market-gardener, at Enfield-highway—my garden is about a mile from my house—Appleby lives in the way between my garden and my house—Thorogood was employed by me to take things from my garden to my house—he was so employed on 29th May—he left my garden with some brocoli about half-past nine o'clock—my son told me something, and I sent for a constable—I went down to Ponder's-end, and close against Appleby's house I saw my son and a policeman—I followed them into Appleby's house, and saw him go to the back premises, get the brocoli, and give it to the policeman—the value of this brocoli it about 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it would fetch more of a retail customer.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 11, , and am a labourer in the Arsenal—we are paid our wages on Saturday, and left work at 1 o'clock on that day—on the Saturday in question, I went home, had some dinner, and cleaned myself—I stopped indoors a good part of the afternoon, and then went to a public-house; I forget the name of it—it was after tea; between 6 and 8 o'clock—I drunk but a small quantity—about 12 o'clock, that night, I was in the Woolwich Arsenal-road, which leads from Woolwich Arsenal to the railway—station—some people were fighting—I had a friend with me named, McCarthy—he was fighting there—I in<lb></lb>terfered to separate them, and some men attacked me—I was afraid of them, and ran back again and laid hold of some rails—I thought I should get pro<lb></lb>tection from their knocking me on the road—as I went towards the rails I called out "Police!"—some of the men came up to me first, and began to strike me again, and about a minute or two after, I think, a policeman came up—I took his number the same night—the prisoner is the man; he was in uniform—I asked him, if he was a policeman, to save my life, and that if he wished to lock me up, I would go quietly with him—he had hold of me then—he struck me before that—I did not know he was a policeman when he first came—his hat went over the rails when he hit me first—he first struck me on the back of the neck, and then on the side of the head, and then knocked me with his knee very hard in the side—he laid hold of the collar of my coat—this is the coat I had on (<hi rend="italic">producing one</hi>)—he tore it, and I could not wear it afterwards—when I saw he was a policeman I let go of the railings—I saw his hat on him again after a time—he then took me to the station—a. negro assisted in taking me along, but he did not strike me to my knowledge—he told me several times to give the officer 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and he would let me go, and then the prisoner asked me—I did not give him two shillings, but said I would report him to the inspector when I went inside</p>

               <p>—Davidson said, when we got near the station, "Give me two shillings and I will let you go"—my face was then covered with blood, and I had been very much ill used—as we were going to the station, the prisoner struck me at different times with his fist, and shoved me with his knee in the left side—when we got to the station, some more of the men came in, and Davidson asked some of them, "Who charges the man?"—they were persuading one another, and the black man was persuading some of them—there was one man, I believe, who had his coat torn—he gave his name as Daley after<lb></lb>wards, and the black man said to him, "You have got your coat torn; you charge him"—I was listening to them; at the same time the policeman charged me—I did not take notice of what he was doing at the time, I was noticing the others—when I was going to make a statement to the inspector the policeman shoved me back, and told me to keep silent—I was then locked up until the next morning, which was Sunday, and then bailed out—I did not know any of the parties that were there; they were all strangers to me—I appeared before the Magistrate on the Monday, and was remanded till the Friday—Daley did not appear on the Monday—I was discharged on Friday—two policemen were shoving me out of the Court, and the Magis<lb></lb>trate called me back and asked me if I had any complaints against anybody, and I then charged Davidson with assaulting me—he was present at the time—I thought I was nearly dead after this knocking about, some of the people said they did not think I should live till morning—I walk with a stick, because my leg is hurt, and I got an injury afterwards on the shin at work—my hip is a little sore now from the knocking I had—I was sober enough to know all that was going on that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, of 24, Havelock—terrace, Plumstead—I am on the suspension list now from the Royal Arsenal—I formerly worked at the Royal Arsenal—on Saturday, 19th September, about 12 o'clock, I was in Station—row, and saw some men fighting there—I saw Brian trying to separate the combatants—he ultimately ran away and called out "Police! police! police!" in a very loud voice; about a minute and a half or two minutes afterwards a policeman came up—the prisoner is that man—Brian was then standing thirty-four yards from the corner, where the former fighting was, near some iron railings—he ran to the railings, and went down on his knees, with his face to the railings—he said to the prisoner, "Don't kill me," and after that he said, "If you wish to take me to the station I will walk quietly"—the prisoner then took him by the collar, with his right hand, and struck him with his left fist, and attempted to pull him up from where he was—he was holding fast by the railings with his hands—he ultimately succeeded in pulling Brian up—the prisoner had no hat on at that time—I did not see anybody knock it off—I did not see Brian touch the hat—a man named Joseph Webb brought the prisoner his hat—I had known him some three weeks, from seeing him about—after the prisoner had got his hat, he took the prosecutor into the road, took his hand off his collar, and then pushed it back, punched his face, and then he punched him with his knee—he did that both against the railings and in the road—his knee went against the prosecutor's hip—there was a black man there—the prisoner called him "Charlie," and he came and assisted him on the road to the station—the black man asked Brian if he had any money—he named the sum, five shillings, and if so, and if he would give it to the officer he would let him go—Brian did not say anything to that in my hearing—when they got into William-street, the black man asked him again and again if he had two shillings—he repeated that full seven times; the last time he said it, Brian made a sort of refusal—I could not distinctly hear or understand, in the excited state he was in; his face was dirty and bleeding at that time—after Brian made that answer, the prisoner said,</p>

               <p>"Oh, if you will not, I will press the charge, and lock you up"—that was within a few yards of the station—I went into the station with them—no one made a charge against Brian at first—Davidson asked several of them, "Who charges this man?"—he said to several, "is it you?"—they said, "No," and then he came to Daley, and said, "Oh, you have got your coat torn, what is your name?" and so then the charge was made out in Daley's name, and Daley did not know what he was doing—he was not sober—he was not very drunk, but he was drunk—he did not know the nature of the questions put to him, or why he signed the sheet—he confessed that on the following day, and said he was sorry for what he had done—Brian wished to explain his case, but he was not allowed, the prisoner pre<lb></lb>vented him—then another of the witnesses, Sullivan, wished to make an explanation, and he was not heard—the prisoner shoved him so that he went down on his hands, his hat fell off, and the prisoner kicked the crown of it in—Sullivan picked his hat up and the prisoner ordered him out—Sullivan said, "I will go out if the inspector orders me"—ultimately the inspector said, "You had better go out for a while," and he went out—the black man assisted to take Brian into the cell, and then I went away—Brian was quite sober—I do not think he was exactly clear—I believe he had had liquor, but he was sober—he was very much excited by the fighting and the ill—usage he had received; he was panting for breath—on the Monday after, I went before the Magistrate—I was not asked by anybody to go, neither did I know Brian at all—I had never seen him in my life before—the charge was made of assaulting Daley—Daley did not appear, and the prisoner knew that he did not intend to appear, he was told so—I was called in after the prisoner had made his statement—Brian was remanded till Friday, on his own recognisances, in 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went again on the Friday of my own accord—the prisoner and Daley were there then—the Magistrate inquired of Daley why he did not appear on the Monday, and he said one reason was that his father did not wish him to, another reason was that he did not want it known that he had been out so late, and another thing was, he said, that Brian had never assaulted him—he said that he did have a fall, but it was in the struggling to support one of the combatants—Mr. Trail asked him why he signed the charge—sheet, and he said because they asked him to sign it.</p>

               <p>coming from Woolwich—McCarthy looked to me as if he was drunk—words occurred between him and Bennett—Brian saw it was coming to a quarrel and he came between them and separated them—Dinam said, "Halloo Bennett, my friend, what is up?"—Bennett was drunk, and he took off his coat to fight McCarthy—I don't know Bennett at all—he had not a livery on—I don't know who held Bennett's coat—Dinam ran to an oyster stall to leave a bundle there—they began to fight, and Bennett fell down on to McCarthy—about nine or ten more came up who seemed to know Bennett—Dinam also came up after them and struck Brian—he staggered with the blow he got, and then a man named Daley came up and struck Brian too—I turned round to Dinam, and said, "What a shame it is, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, to take and beat that man for trying to make peace"—he said he did not care, for Bennett was his friend—Brian then made a retreat towards Green's-end, and got up against some iron railings—about five or six followed him, and began punching him against the rails—I said, "What a shame to treat a man in such a manner"—he began crying "Police," and "Murder," and I ran to the railway<lb></lb>station—he was the first to cry out "Police,"—the collector at the station asked me what was the matter, and I told him and went back—a policeman was there when I got back—he had hold of Brian by the right hand, and was punching him in the jaw with his left—the policeman was the prisoner he also struck Brian going down Thomas-street, and <hi rend="italic">jobbed</hi> him with his knee on the hip and leg—I said to the prisoner, "What a shame it is for you to ill-treat that man, he has got quite enough without your bitting him"—his face was covered with blood at that time—the prisoner said, "If you are not off, I will serve you the game in about two minutes"—going down Thomas-street I heard Brian tell him that he would make a complaint to the inspector about his ill-treatment to him and the prisoner up with his fist and struck him again—I went into the station-house and offered to make a complaint to the inspector about the policeman's treatment of Brian, and as I was going to do so, the prisoner caught hold of me, pushed me round and said, "You don't know anything about it"—my hat fell off—I stooped to pick it up, and he gave. it a kick and kicked the crown in—I turned round and said, "Don't ill-treat me; if the inspector tells me to go out, I will"—he told me to go out for a while—I afterwards came back to the station, and the prisoner pushed mo out into the street—I said I did not care about standing there in the wet, so I would reserve my evidence till before the Magistrate—on the Monday morning I went before the Magistrate and gave my evidence.</p>

Q.</hi> In what manner did Daley make the charge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said, "Do you charge this man?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "What do you charge him with?"—he said, "With assaulting me"—I said, "Are there any marks of violence"—he said, "Yes," and showed me some blood on his face—there were a great many people in the room at the time and a great noise—I did not see everything that passed—Brian appeared to me to be drunk by the way he spoke, and he leaned back in the dock—he might have been struck for what I know—I did not notice Sullivan so much—I could see that he had been drinking—I did not see him go out of the station—he was ordered to go out, and he said he would not go unless I told him to go—I said, "Your best plan is to go away quietly," and he did go—I did not notice his hat fall off.</p>

I live at 5, Armstrong-place, Plumstead, and am a fitter in an engine-room—about half-past 12 or a quarter to 1 on Sunday morning, 20th September, I was outside the Bull at Plumstead, going towards home—I was knocked down by a man named, Brian—that is the man. (<hi rend="italic">Pointing him out</hi>)—I had not done anything to him—he came behind me and knocked me down—I got up when I could, and saw him running away—my coat was all torn, trying to get up, and my nose cut—Brian and another man were on the top of me—I don't know the other man at all—when I got up they both ran away—I followed them, and saw Brian run into the policeman's arms—I was sober; Brian was drunk, and very much excited—I went up and gave him in charge for knocking me down—Brian got hold of a railing and the prisoner could not move him at all—Simper, the porter was there helping the prisoner—I saw the prisoner's hat knocked off—I think it was Brian knocked it off; it went down the area—there were a few persons round—they at last got Brian away from the railings—I did not see the prisoner strike him at all while I was there—I followed to the station—I saw the other constable come up—I saw a black man there—I was near enough to hear what took place between the parties while they were going to the station-house—I heard nothing said about giving money—I signed the charge-sheet at the station—there was no difficulty that I saw about Brian's making a statement—I did not wish to press the charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, living at Armstrong-place, Plumstead—on the morning of 20th, I stood up with Sullivan and Stevens at a tobacconist's shop for shelter—Brian and McCarthy came up and wanted to pull Sullivan from his standing-place, to get in, I suppose—McCarthy was intoxicated—a man named Bennett came up at the same instant, alone—he was also intoxi<lb></lb>cated—McCarthy turned round and struck Bennett and knocked his hat off Bennett was thrown down on the ground and McCarthy on the top, and while in that position McCarthy beat him severely—I tried to render assistance to take McCarthy, but I could not as I had a bundle under my arm—Brian asked me the reason why I was doing so, and struck me—I said, "If I was not encumbered with this bundle, I would certainly take my own defence," and then he struck me again—I then went and gave my bundle to an oyster man, near the Arsenal station—by that time Bennett had got on his feet, and we got him away by the Bull Tavern—McCarthy and Brian followed on and there, at the corner of Taylor's-buildings, the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> became general—a fight ensued, in which a young man named Daley came up, and was knocked down twice by Brian, and then Brian ran away, and I ran after him and called, "Stop him"—the prisoner ran out, stopped him, and caught him by the collar—Brian made a sort of rush, and the prisoner was lite<lb></lb>rally dragged along the wet ground by Brian, I should say, for a yard—they were both partly down—Brian got up, and clung to some railings—I tried to help them get him away; while the prisoner was trying to get him away he was struck by Brian, and his hat fell down the area—that was the first blow I saw given by Brian; I will positively swear before you all, that the prisoner never struck Brian once—I was near them when they left the railings—I saw a black man there—he was not near them—I was near enough to hear any con<lb></lb>versation that might have taken place—I did not hear a word about two shillings, or money; I heard no offer made by Brian to the prisoner—I went to the station, and heard the charge—I did not hear Brian charge the prisoner with striking him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

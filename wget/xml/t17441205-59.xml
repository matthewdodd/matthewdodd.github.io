Bourke said there was one Conelly concerned with them; and Ellis said, no, don't go to hurt any body, for you know there was no body there but you and I. I said to him, I don't want you to confess upon a promise of pardon, but only desire you to speak the truth. <rs id="t17441205-59-verdict380" type="verdictDescription">

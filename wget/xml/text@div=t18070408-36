            . I am a constable of Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it that called upon you, and desired you to call at North-green. - A. A person of the name of Burridge.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 28th of March did you find the prisoner there. - A. Yes. Mr. Burridge charged the prisoner with stealing three pieces of some mahogany belonging to Mr. Ayres. The prisoner denied it at first, but afterwards he owned to taking one piece; the prisoner said if I would go with him to a baker's just by, he would shew me that piece, which he did; it was under the baker's dough through. I took it back to his master's. I then asked him where the other two pieces were; he said he had taken them to No. 10, Caroline-court, Saffron-hill; I went there and found fourteen pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner acknowledge that he had taken them there. - A. Yes; and the man in whose place it was found said he had brought that wood there. The prisoner said he took it out of his master's yard.</p>

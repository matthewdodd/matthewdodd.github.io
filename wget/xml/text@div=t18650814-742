                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler at the Euston Head Tavern, Euston-road—on the night of 31st July, between ten and twenty minutes past 11, I saw the prisoner in front of my bar with another man and a female—I closed the house about twenty minutes to twelve—my man secured the doors—I saw them safe afterwards—the following morning, a little before 4, I was called up by a policeman, and found that the house had been entered—the bar window was nearly up; it was like that when I went to bed, it must have been palled down further for anyone to get in—I missed about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of coppers from the till, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver from the shelf—another drawer had been forced open—I found two cigar-boxes empty—I missed all this plate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this walking-stick, which were safe on the previous night, the plate is worth about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also missed some wine—I should think the prisoner was at my bar an hour and A half. I did not see him come in; I first saw him about 10—the street-door was undone when I came down and open, it was bolted inside the night before, there is no key to it—I saw the prisoner the same morning at the Guildhall—I am quite sure he is the person.</p>

On the morning of the 26th of September, about twelve o'clock, I counted all the bars of soap in my back-yard; there were thirty-seven of yellow, and forty-nine and three-quarters of mottled; I counted them again at six o'clock. I then went to the west end of the town, and returned at ten o'clock. I called Hill to take my horse to the stable, and then counted the bars of soap. I found four bars of yellow deficient, and three and three-quarters of mottled. Hill returned in about half an hour. I told him he had robbed me of some soap - he denied it at first, but afterwards said he would go and fetch it from his uncle's. I sent for an officer, who found on him 25 s. in a purse, and my wife's pen-knife. I then went with him and the officer to his uncle's house - he said, "Mr. Howard is come for his soap, uncle." Conner said he had nothing of the kind, and objected to our going into the room, as his wife was in bed. The officer said he must do his duty - he went into the room, and began to search. Conner lifted up the clothes, and took the soap from under the bed - he said, "I suppose this is the soap you came for." I have compared it with what was left on my premises, and it appears exactly the same.</p>

            . I am the officer. I went to the house, and said to Hill, "What have you been doing - you have been robbing Mr. Howard." I think he said Yes. I said, "Where is the soap you have taken?" He said, "At my uncle's." We went to Conner's, and Hill said, "Mr. Howard is come for the soap." The door was opened, and I showed my authority. Conner said, "You can't be admitted into this room, my wife is in bed." I made my way in - he had not then said any thing about soap, but that it was not there - I said "You have it, for it was put on the table to-night." I went in and got a light, and turned over several baskets and other things - he then turned up the counterpane, and said, "I suppose this is the soap you are looking for." It was wrapped up in a blue apron. I found the pen-knife and tooth-pick on Hill.</p>
               <p>HILL'S Defence. No one knew any thing of the soap but myself. I took it there while my uncle and aunt it were out, and put it in the blue apron - there was no one in the house.</p>
               <p>CONNER'S Defence. I knew nothing about it till the officer came - I made no refusal to let him in - I took the light to show them every part of my room, not knowing the soap was there.</p>

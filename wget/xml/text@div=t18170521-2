             a knife. I ran off, Cooper was with him, Davis pursued and threw me down, when Cooper came up and took the money out of my box, which hung round my neck - I went and told my master. At nine o'clock we found Davis at his lodgings, very drunk, Furzeman and Roberts secured him there; Davis and I were old friends. I had been collecting money. When he drew his knife it was to cut the box from me.</p>
               <p>JAMES COLTER. I was hired to go out with the sweeps as a drummer; we were returning home when the prisoners met us in George-street - Davis asked for some beer - We refused it, and he took the money out of the box; there was quite a mob of them-Davis was intoxicated. I saw nothing in his hand. We were not sober.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL FURZEMAN. I am a constable. On the 3d of May, I went with Mr. Smith to a house in Church-lane, and found Davis there; when he saw me he began to roll about as if he was drunk. I took Cooper the next day.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL ROBERTS. I am the watch-house keeper. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210004"></xptr>went to Davis's house with Furzeman, and took him. Morris and Colter appeared quite sober.</p>
               <p>DAVIS'S Defence. Morris said he would make it up for 2l., and he had 30s. of it; he came to me in prison, and said he was satisfied.</p>
               <p>MORRIS. They made me drunk one night, and sent me to Newgate; I said I would make it up for 2l. - I was in liquor. I received 10s. but it was taken from me again.</p>

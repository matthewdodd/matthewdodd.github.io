            . I am a pork butcher, and live opposite Mr. Ames's, in Paradise-row, Lower-street, Islington. On Monday, at noon, while I was standing in my shop, I saw a man looking at this carpet as if to purchase it; he looked round as if to see if any person was watching him, and then took it on his shoulder, and walked away; I went and told Mr. Ames; I did not follow him; I had a slight sight of his face as he turned round, but could not swear to his person.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Ames - I heard that the carpet had been taken about a quarter past one o'clock. I ran in the direction Mr. Cartwright told me, and caught sight of the prisoner; when two hundred yards from my master's shop, he was then alone, and had the carpet under his arm; I did not lose sight of him until I stopped him, when I called Stop thief! he dropped it. I am quite sure I saw him drop it; I held him untill my master came up, and told him to take up the carpet and carry it back to the shop, which he did. I had seen it about ten minutes before in the fore court; he said,</p>
               <p>"For God sake let me go."</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At the examination, the porter said he could not swear to my person, but he picked up the carpet; there were several persons running.</p>

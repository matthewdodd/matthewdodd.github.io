            . I am a surveyor. On the 29th of March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in my parlour, in John-street, Fitzroy-square, and saw the prisoner in a cart, nailing up a chest of tea. I followed the cart to Bardsley's; he was driving. I told Mr. Bardsley of my suspicions - a constable was fetched - the prisoner denied taking any tea; I said if the constable looked into the nosebag he would find the tea - he did so.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How many chests were in the cart - A. Three; he said he had taken no tea from it.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Lloyd, a carman, and the prisoner was a carman. I sent him to the East India Warehouse in Haydon-square, to fetch two chests of tea, and gave him another - he was to deliver one of green tea to Mr. Bardsly the other two were black.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know which was Bardsley's chest - A. By the number on the permit.</p>

            . A chest of green tea was brought to my house by the prisoner, it was nailed up very neatly. Mr. Finden gave me information, and a bag containing eighteen ounces was found in the nose-bag - I compared it with that in the chest, it is the same description of tea in every respect - the chest weighed about a pound short. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"I hope you will forgive me, I will never do so any more, it was a case of necessity."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not chests often break in coming over the stones - A. I have had them come loose - the tea was very clean, and did not appear to have fallen out, he did not say that the chest had broken. I live in Tottenham-court-road.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Finden. I saw the prisoner's hand in the corner of a chest, and saw him pull tea out, and put it into a white bag, and put that into the nose-bag. I was looking out of the garret window.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him take it from the chest or sweeping it up from the cart - A. I saw him take it out.</p>

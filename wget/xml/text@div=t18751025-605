                  </hi>. I live at 21, Myra Street, West Ham—on the night of 1st October, about 6.45 I was standing in the Broadway at Strat<lb></lb>ford—there was a crowd there near a man selling earthenware—I felt a hand at my waistcoat pocket—I looked down and saw the prisoner with my watch in his hand, and I immediately caught hold of him and held him till a constable came—when I caught hold of him he let go of the watch and I caught it in my hand—it was not detached from the chain—I held him and sent for a constable—the prisoner asked me to let him go and told me not to tear his coat—I charged him with attempting to steal my watch, and he said he had done nothing of the sort, he had not taken his hands out of his pocket.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The watch was still on the chain, which was round my neck—there were a lot of people in front of me, the prisoner was by my side; the watch was in his hand, but was still hanging to the chain.</p>

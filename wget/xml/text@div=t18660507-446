                  </hi>. I am the wife of Carl Langenscheid, who keeps dining-rooms at 1 and 2, Mincing-lane—one day in April, between 1 and 2 o'clock, the prisoner came in for a glass of ale, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a bad shilling—I kept it in my hand, and he gave me a good one, and I gave him the change—he drank the beer, and asked me for the bad one back—I refused to give it to him—my husband sent for a police<lb></lb>man, and the prisoner put something in his mouth, and tried to swallow it—he tried to escape, but my husband stopped him outside the door—I gave the bad shilling to my husband.</p>

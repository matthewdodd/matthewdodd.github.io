                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the transaction on the Monday at the Bank of England? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> yes; he gave me small notes and cheques to the amount of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I got partly money and partly notes for the cheques—I then proceeded to the Bank of England with the whole, and got large notes—the largest note I received was a £200 note—I had not put anything on the notes I brought from the bankrupt, and from the bankers in Lombard-street, till I got to the Bank, when I wrote "William Rotherham" on the top of the notes—(looking at some notes) here is the name on every one of these—I received a £200 note, and delivered it to the bankrupt—I do not remem<lb></lb>ber what amount of cash I had in gold and silver, but I received a ticket like this (looking at one)for the gold—that was given under the gallery—I never received a £200 note for the bankrupt except on those occasions, on the Saturday before, when I took some money to the London and West<lb></lb>minster Bank, and the £200 note which I got at the Bank of England.</p>

Scafe, and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Anderson, making altogether 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and if Mr. Scafe would give him the bill he would make him a present of the remainder of the money, which was about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said so—he said about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was due from Miss. Scafe, in addition to the bill; and that Scafe held a bill drawn on his sister.</p>

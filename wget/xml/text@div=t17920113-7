               <p>I remember being on the river the 2d of January last, about half after seven or eight; we went out, and in rowing up the river, one of my men said, master, here is a towing match; I turned, and saw a boat at a distance, and there were the two prisoners drawing a ship's boat; I am sure of the prisoners, I knew them before; I went close to them; we secured the boat, and pursued them, and never lost sight of them; Willis had the rope over his left arm, Bailey was pulling the sculls; when I saw him come so close, I saw him chuck the rope from his arm, and away they rowed; I pursued them as soon as I could wind the boat round; I never lost sight of them till they shot round the tier; then I saw Willis jump out of the boat, and I lost sight of him all at once; I then pursued Bailey, and there was a boat stopped; I am conscious he is the person; one of the other witnesses brought Willis all over wet; there were sixty odd heads of hemp, that is, six hundred and a half in all; the boat had the name of Eliza on the stern.</p>

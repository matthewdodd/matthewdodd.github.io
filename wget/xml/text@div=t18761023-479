On 1st October, a little after 4 a.m., I was on duty in Berkeley Square, and examined the. area of Dr. Hewitt's house, No. 36, and found this chisel and knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the bar was hanging down—I communicated with the people of the house—the area gate was locked, and there was a little dirt as if a person had climbed over.</p>

                  </hi>. I am footman to Dr. Hewitt, of 36, Berkeley Square; that is next door to Lord Londesborough's—on Saturday night, September 1st, about 10.45, I locked up the house—I locked the area door, put a bar across, and bolted it—the area gate was locked and the key taken upstairs—on Sunday morning I was rung up by a constable, went outside, and saw a bar projecting from the area door and one or two of the bars broken, and half the glass taken out—there were two broken panes lying on the steps.</p>

I am hall porter to Lord Londesborough—I was standing on the steps at 12.15 or 12.30, and heard the breaking of glass at No. 37—I went to the area and-saw a man rush up the steps and spring over the gate very quickly—I said "What is the matter?"—he said "Look at her," and went very quickly round the corner of Mount Street—I saw his face distinctly; there was a lamp at 37 and another at 38—on 6th October, I was taken to the station, and saw eight or nine men—I asked if there were any more, and was told no—I then picked out the prisoner as the man I had seen—I have not the least doubt that he is the man.</p>

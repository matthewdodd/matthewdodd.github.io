            . I live at No. 5, Tottenham-place.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners - A. Yes, perfectly well; I lived with Harding, I seperated from him a twelvemonth ago last April, On last Monday was three weeks, between twelve and one at night, I went into Mr. Wakefield's public-house to get change of a one pound note, I had something to drink there, the two prisoners were there. When I saw them I did not ask for change, I put the note in my bosom and paid for the liquor; I came out of the house and as I went up <placeName id="t18100718-39-crimeloc235">Greek-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18100718-39-crimeloc235" type="placeName" value="Greek-street"></interp>

I directly went home to my father No. 5, Tottenham-place. I am an unfortunate girl, I did not give any alarm there were nobody in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. This happened on the 25th of June, have not you seen Harding from that time till he was taken up - A. Yes, I saw him the week before last, I met him by Short's-gardens. We went into a house and drank together.</p>

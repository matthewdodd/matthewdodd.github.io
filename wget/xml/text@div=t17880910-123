               <p>"Mrs. Williams," by myself; and the officer brought in Johnson's wife, with nine pair of children's shoes, which were my property. In Merrell's apartment, we found a tambour needle, a pair of snuffers, and two pair of men's shoes, which were mine; the shoes had my mark; the snuffers we lost out of the shop, about eight days before; there were some lasts there, one of which I swore to; I never missed any men's shoes; we are always selling shoes; I missed children's shoes; I mitigated the value at fifteen shillings; Merrell had been with me near a twelvemonth; and Johnson is a boot closer, and worked for me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Both these persons had been employed by you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Both very good workmen I believe? - The prisoner, Johnson, is a very good workman.</p>

               <p>The other was your clicker? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He had worked for you at first, for twelve shillings a week? - Yes, and in a fortnight I gave him fourteen shillings a week, and four pair of shoes yearly; Johnson worked by the set price.</p>
               <p>You entertained a high opinion of both of them? - I did.</p>
               <p>You never suspected either of them, till you were told that they were going to set up in partnership? - No.</p>
               <p>Is it all uncommon for persons who work occasionally on little orders to borrow their master's lasts? - Not without asking leave.</p>
               <p>Are these snuffers conscientiously worth six-pence? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect ever selling any children's shoes to Johnson? - I do, four or five pair; but I never sold him a red shoe.</p>

               <p>Will you swear you never sold these nine pair of shoes, that were found in his apartment to any body? - It is impossible a person that keeps a public shop can be certain.</p>
               <p>Pray what sum of money did you offer to take to compound this felony? - I never consented to any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Was not you to shew lenity to them on condition that they did not go into partnership, and set up against you? - It was a matter of indifference to me.</p>
               <p>Court. I must have a direct answer to the gentleman's question? - I never had any concern at all about partnership, nor knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Did you promise them lenity upon any condition? - None at all; when they made application to me to compound felony, I told them, I should have nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Did not you authorize your attorney, that on receiving a sum of money, and on these men undertaking to enter into no partnership, this bill should not be found? - I did not.</p>
               <p>What may be the value of the tambour needle, a penny, or two-pence? - God knows, I do not.</p>
               <p>Are not you in Merrell's debt? - I owe him money.</p>

               <p>(The last deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court. This seems to be a very small trifle; might not such a thing as that, in the common course of business, be taken home by your servant, or by Johnson? - I put it up in a particular place; I have often enquired of Merrell, where it was, and never could find it; I had it made for Mrs. Williams, in St. Martin's-lane; these shoes are all mine; here is my writing; I missed them about three weeks before; I can swear I never sold them.</p>
               <p>Who sold in you shop besides? - Nobody but Merrell.</p>

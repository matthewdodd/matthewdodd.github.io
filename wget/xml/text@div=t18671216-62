                  </hi>. I live at 1, Gardner Row Cottage, Knightsbridge, with my aunt, who keeps a greengrocer's shop—on Thursday, the 14th November, the prisoner and another man came in together—the prisoner asked for a halfpennyworth of onions—I served him, and he gave me a halfpenny—they then left together—the prisoner came in again soon after and asked for another halfpennyworth of onions and paid me with a shilling—I gave him the change—I kept that shilling in my hand—soon after he left the other man came in and asked for another halfpennyworth of onions, and also paid me with a shilling—I found that to be a bad one—I then had one shilling in one hand and one in the other—I gave them both to my aunt—I did not give the man the change—he left the onions on the table and went away.</p>

            ? - Yes; my husband is an auctioneer and appraiser.</p>
               <p>Relate what passed upon the 15th of July last: where do you live? - Red Lion-alley, Cow-cross.</p>
               <p>Relate to the Court where you first saw Cutler on the 15th of July? - At Merlin's Cave.</p>
               <p>Who were in company? - Mrs. Bates and her brother and Mrs. Boutflower; we were together by ourselves and supped in the garden on some cold lamb; I saw Cutler in the ground playing at skittles, he was not of our company; he came to fetch us into the house to hear some women sing.</p>
               <p>What did he say when he came to you? - About ten o'clock he came down to the bottom of the ground where we were, and invited me and the two ladies to go into the house to hear some women sing.</p>
               <p>Did you go into the house? - Yes; Mrs. Boutflower, Mr. Bates, and I went in.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay in the house? - About two hours and a half; we did not stay all the time in one room.</p>
               <p>Then you went home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who were the company that went home together? - Mrs. Boutflower, Mr. and Mrs. Bates, and I, the prisoner, and a gentleman and gentlewoman I don't know.</p>
               <p>Where did you part with the company? - At the Cold Bath, Cold-bath-fields; Mr. and Mrs. Bates live facing the Cold Bath; the other gentleman and lady left us at Cold-bath-fields likewise.</p>
               <p>When did you part with Mrs. Boutflower? - We went as far as the Three Tuns, Brook-street, Holborn; there we parted with Mrs. Boutflower.</p>
               <p>Then there remained only you and the prisoner? - No; I turned out of Brook's-street into Holborn, and I desired Mr. Cutler there to go home; we made a sort of a shop, he asked me to go in to drink a glass of wine or something; I said I would do no such thing; he said it was not prudent for a woman to walk along the streets at that time of night; then I went home to my own house, and he went with me.</p>
               <p>Was there any body in the house when you came home? - Yes, a woman that I had left in care of the house.</p>
               <p>How far is it from where you live to the Three Tuns in Brook-street? - I cannot tell exactly the distance; a great way.</p>

               <p>What time do you suppose that might be in the morning? - I fancy near half an hour after one, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>When you came to your house you say there was a woman in the house? - Yes, she opened the door.</p>
               <p>Did she remain in the house or did she go? - She had her bonnet and cloak on; I desired her to stay; she went out of the house immediately; she said if she did not go home she should be turned out of her lodgings and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100028"></xptr> never be admitted more, that if it were ever so late she must go home; she went out and shut the door immediately.</p>
               <p>What became of Mr. Cutler? - He went into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Who shut the door? - That Mrs. Bradley.</p>
               <p>JURY. Did the prisoner offer to take his. leave of you when you came to the door? - No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was you got into the house before the woman went out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was Cutler? - He walked into the kitchen before me; the kitchen is near the door.</p>
               <p>When the woman was gone had you any conversation with Mr. Cutler? - After the woman was gone I desired him to go home, that it was not a proper time for him to stay; he went to the far end of the kitchen next the fire place, and there he pulled me on his knees.</p>
               <p>How long might that be after the woman was gone? - Ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, ten minutes I fancy; I struggled and altercated with him a good deal.</p>
               <p>Did you endeavour to get away from him? - Yes, I did get away from him from there; he overtook me at the kitchen door as I was going to the street door to call for assistance; he caught me in his arms and threw me down on the floor; after that with a good deal of struggling, I got loose from him once more.</p>
               <p>You got away from him again? - Not away, I only got up upon my feet; he took me up in his arms again and carried me to the kitchen fire place to the far end of the kitchen; he threw me down there; then he effected his purpose there; he threw me down upon my back and fell a top of me.</p>
               <p>What did he do to you there? - He effected his purpose, and did what he intended to do to me.</p>
               <p>You must describe what he did to you? - In what manner.</p>
               <p>You must tell what he did, whether he lay with you or what? - He lay with me.</p>
               <p>Did he lie with you as your husband does? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he or not enter your body? - He did by force and violence, not by my consent.</p>
               <p>When he had entered your body, did you feel any thing particular? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>What did you feel? - It is a very disagreeable circumstance to mention; I found something come from him.</p>
               <p>You are a married woman; had he complete carnal knowledge of your body? - He had.</p>
               <p>What passed after he had done this? - He lifted me up again; I told him that he had used me extremely ill; that he had the wrong person to deal with; that I would certainly acquaint Mr. Bradley of it, and I insisted upon his going out of the house immediately; during this scuffle two little children of mine were crying in bed, I in a flurry went up stairs.</p>
               <p>COURT. You have two small children? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How old is the eldest? - Three years old.</p>
               <p>How old is the youngest? - Fifteen months; I just looked into the room and went down stairs again immediately.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. So you went down again immediately to the object of your affection?</p>
               <p>Where was the prisoner during the time you went up stairs? - In the kitchen; when I came down I desired him a second time to go out of the house; I was exceedingly flurried and frightened; I told him he had terrified and frightened me so I did not know what to do, and begged he would out of the house; he said if I would take the children up some drink which they wanted, he would go out of the house the moment I came down again; I carried the drink up, a cup I believe it was of liquor, to the children; he followed me close up stairs; I went into the room first; he came in, locked the door upon me, and locked me and himself into the room; he took me up in his arms then, and threw me upon the foot of the bed; there he committed the same fact as he had done in the kitchen before.</p>
               <p>Had he complete knowledge of you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>JURY. Were the two children in the bed? - Yes, in the same bed.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him when he took you in his arms? - I struggled with him all I could, and repeated the same words as in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100029"></xptr> the kitchen, that he certainly would suffer for using me in the manner that he did.</p>
               <p>JURY. Was it not possible for you to have locked yourself in the room from him when you first went up? - I did not go into the room.</p>
               <p>JURY. It was possible for you to have got into the room, and locked the door? - To be sure it was, but I had not a thought to do it when I went up the first time, I was so exceedingly frightened.</p>
               <p>COURT. You know you left Cutler below stairs in the kitchen when you went up to the door? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>COURT. So then you had complete time to have gone into the room and locked the door? - I was so frightened that I had not the thought to do it; I only peep'd in to see what was the matter with the children.</p>
               <p>What passed after that? - He then insisted upon my going into my bed; he swore d - n his body he would do for me if I did not undress and go to bed immediately.</p>
               <p>Did he oblige you to go into bed or not? - He did.</p>
               <p>What became of him? - He undressed himself and came in after me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you undress yourself? - He helped to undress me, and frightened me exceedingly.</p>
               <p>With the two children? - Yes, the two little children were in bed.</p>
               <p>How long did he remain there? - About an hour, or an hour and half.</p>
               <p>Nothing passed in bed, I believe? - No, only my altercation with him; he went down stairs, I thought he was going out of the house, but I did not hear the house door shut.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you came down? - Two hours after that, I dare say.</p>
               <p>When you came down, where did you find Cutler? - In the kitchen, sitting upon a chair; I asked him the reason he was not gone out of the house all that while, for that I should certainly acquaint Mr. Bradley of my ill treatment; he said, he hoped I would not acquaint my husband of it; he opened the street door and went out, and I saw no more of him till I saw him before Sir

            : the first person I saw that morning was Mr. Hamley, a relation of my husband's; I appeared much frightened and flurried; I did not look in my countenance as usual; he asked me what was the matter with me; I told him I had been to Merlin's Cave the night before, and a gentleman had seen me home, and had grossly affronted me and used me ill.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Did you tell him the same story that you have done now? - Not all; he said he was going to Mr. Fowler's in Dean-street, and he would call again in his return home; he called again about 12; he asked me then about it, and I related him some part of the story again; but was very cautious what I said to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. What did you tell him? - I told him of the prisoner's using me ill in the kitchen, and throwing me down twice in the same manner that I have related to you: he said, he could wish to have some further conversation with me, and he invited me to take, a walk with him that afternoon.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him that he lay with you? - No, I did not repeat the same as I have done to you now; he wished to take a walk with me in the afternoon, to have some more discourse with me upon the matter; we took a walk as far as John o'Grote's in St. George's Fields; I then related the whole of the matter that had happened to me; I imagined that was his reason for inviting me to take a walk.</p>
               <p>When did you inform your husband of it? - The next morning, the Thursday morning; Mr. Hamley advised me to acquaint my husband as soon as possible, which I did the next morning.</p>
               <p>Is the house you live in adjoining to any dwelling-house? - No, there is never a house adjoining, nor dwelling-room.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>I think this acquaintance of yours with Mr. Cutler began at Merlin's Cave, did it not? - I never had no particular acquaintance with Mr. Cutler; I only knew him by sight.</p>
               <p>Had you never been in his company before? - Never by myself.</p>
               <p>Have you been in company with him with other people? - I have seen him playing at skittles there.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100030"></xptr>You said no acquaintance with him? - No farther than his saying, how do you do Mrs. Bradley.</p>
               <p>Did you say how do you do Mr. Cutler, in answer to it? - No farther than very well, thank you.</p>
               <p>You knew each other by sight, and to speak to each other? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time in the evening was it that you went to this Merlin's Cave? - Between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>What diversion was going on there; what amusement; what a sort of a place is it? - A public-house.</p>
               <p>Did you play at skittles? - The gentlemen were playing at skittles.</p>
               <p>Did you play at skittles? - No.</p>
               <p>You have never played at skittles? - Yes, I have before now.</p>
               <p>How many times a week in general do you think you go to play at skittles at Merlin's Cave? - I don't know; I have been once or twice with a lady or so.</p>
               <p>But you have been there three times a week, have not you? - I have been often, sometimes with my husband.</p>
               <p>Never without your husband? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>You was invited into a room by Cutler at half after ten, to hear some ladies sing? - There was a great deal of company there.</p>
               <p>You had supped there? - Some cold lamb and cucumbers and some ale.</p>
               <p>I suppose when Mr. Cutler got you in he got better liquor for you? - He did not ask me to drink.</p>
               <p>So you drank nothing but that mug of ale that evening? - There were other people as well as me to drink it.</p>
               <p>You drank nothing else but ale? - I saw nothing else but ale.</p>
               <p>At about what time did you set off from Merlin's Cave to go home? - Between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>You told us you parted with your company in Cold Bath Fields? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts did Mr. Cutler propose to give you a glass of wine? - About Holborn.</p>
               <p>You refused that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You thought it I suppose a very impudent application of Mr. Cutler to you? - Yes, I thought it rude.</p>
               <p>How did it happen afterwards that you suffered Mr. Cutler to walk home with you after this? - He politely asked me to let him see me home.</p>
               <p>Then his politeness had cured this insult in asking you before to go in and drink a pint of wine: when he came to your house there was a woman in the house? - There was.</p>
               <p>How many children? - Four.</p>
               <p>I suppose you took your leave of Mr. Cutler at the door? - No, I did not, he followed me in.</p>
               <p>I should have thought now that it would have been full as prudent, considering the insult he had offered you in the street, not to suffer him to come into the house; a man that had asked a married woman about one in the morning to go into a house and drink pint of wine with him, how came you to firsser him to come-in? - I had no apprehension that he meant to do me any mischief.</p>
               <p>Well, you did suffer him to come into the house; then how came you to let this woman go out of the house, before he was gone out of the house? - I had several times desired had to stay.</p>
               <p>You did not walk out of the house with her, and call the watch for fear of accidents? - No, I expected Mr. Cutler would have gone out.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Cutler continued ten or fifteen minutes before he began to be what you call rude; then he began to be very rude, threw you twice on the floor, and then got his will of you; you forgot to tell us that you cried out murder, and help, and so on? - I was never asked the question.</p>
               <p>You did cry out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As loud as ever you could? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After he had lain with you the first time, then you went up stairs? - Yes, and looked into the room.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury asked you a very sensible question just now; it never entered your head to lock yourself into the room, and cry out for help? - I was so frightened and intimidated I did not know what to do.</p>
               <p>So frightened, that instead of locking yourself into the room, to prevent further danger, you ran down into the kitchen again to the person that had frightened you: how many yards is the watchman and his box from your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100031"></xptr> house; is he within 20 or 30 yards from you? - He is within sight.</p>
               <p>If you had but put your head out of the window and called the watchman, you would have prevented the second mischief? - I wish I had, and prevented it all.</p>
               <p>How long was it from the first time that you say he lay with you in the kitchen, before you went up stairs with the drink for the children? - Immediately as soon as he lifted me up.</p>
               <p>Within five or ten minutes then? - Yes, the children screaming all the time.</p>
               <p>Then within five or ten minutes he had thrown you down, and repeated this thing? - No, it was some time; it might be ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Ten minutes or a quarter of an hour between the two acts: how many beds are there in this room in which you looked in? - Only one.</p>
               <p>How many children were in the bed? - Two.</p>
               <p>Where were the other two? - In another room, up another pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>How old is the eldest child that was up above stairs? - About seven or eight.</p>
               <p>He did what you have told us; and you undressed yourself at his threats and went to bed; and he to you; he got up in an hour; nothing happened but altercation there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go to sleep? - No, I lay awake all the time.</p>
               <p>Did it never enter your head to get up, and cry out at the window, to apprehend this villain that had done you so much mischief? - I did not chuse to make any nordtion there; I thought I could take him afterwards.</p>
               <p>You let him stay till between six and seven in the morning? - Five or six.</p>
               <p>Was not you afraid that people would all be up; people are all up at six or seven in the morning; was not you apprehensive of having a strange man seen coming out of your house? - I gave you my reason, I intended to acquaint my husband.</p>
               <p>On the morning after this happened, the first person you saw was Mr. Hamley, who is a relation of your husband's? - By marriage.</p>
               <p>And a particular friend of your's? - He has known me and my family a great many years.</p>
               <p>Are you very intimate with him, or nothing more than a common acquaintance with him? - Nothing more than a common acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Had you no woman of your acquaintance; do you know no good motherly woman that you could have gone and told this to? - You see he came into the house while I was at breakfast.</p>
               <p>But there you did not tell him what had happened? - I related to him part of the story.</p>
               <p>You had not told him that he had lain with you? - I told him that he threw me down in the kitchen and used me ill.</p>

               <p>Not that he had lain with you? - Yes, I told him that he had thrown me down in the kitchen, and lay with me.</p>
               <p>Then for God's sake what was the walk to John o'Grote's house in the evening for? for you had told him all you knew, that the man had lain with you; what was this scheme that was to be cooked up in the evening? - Mr. Hamley did not tell me his reasons for inviting me out.</p>
               <p>Then neither he nor you thought of going then before a justice, and taking out a warrant? - I did not know that I should do that.</p>
               <p>Had you never heard that to commit such an outrage upon a woman was an offence punishable? Had you never heard that people usually applied to justices upon such an occasion? - I never had any conversation about the matter.</p>
               <p>When was it for the first time that you went before a justice of peace? - On the Thursday afterwards.</p>
               <p>Was it the Thursday or Friday? - I think it was the Thursday.</p>
               <p>You did not go till the Thursday? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you been at this Merlin's Cave on the Wednesday? - No.</p>
               <p>That you swear, positively? - Wednesday was the day I was at John o'Grote's house; it happened on the Wednesday morning</p>
               <p>Was you at Merlin's Cave of the evening of Wednesday? - No, I was at John o'Grote's with Mr. Hamley then.</p>
               <p>Was you or not at Merlin's Cave on Wednesday? - No.</p>
               <p>Were you there on the Thursday? - I was there one day in the week afterwards, but cannot tell.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100032"></xptr>But had you been there before you had been at the justices, the evening before you had been at the justices? - I don't know, I believe I had.</p>
               <p>Did you play at skittles then? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing about Mr. Cutler? - I never mentioned his name at all.</p>
               <p>Was any body with you in your walk to John o'Grote's house; did any company go with you? - Nobody but Mr. Hamley and I.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Hyde out with you that evening? - I never walked out with that gentleman in my life.</p>
               <p>You know such a person? - I know he was in possession in the same house that my husband was.</p>
               <p>Where was your husband on the Tuesday or Wednesday? - He was in possession as a man under the messenger in Lamb's Conduit-street.</p>
               <p>That is close by; it may be half a mile, it is not more? - More than that.</p>
               <p>Well, no matter, three quarters of a mile; when did you see your husband first? - Thursday morning.</p>
               <p>Did not you see your husband on the Wednesday at all? - I did not.</p>
               <p>On Thursday you saw him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see Hyde in his company? - I saw Hyde at the house.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with your husband before Hyde? - Not on this matter.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with Hyde? - No; the man was quite a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to Hyde about your husband's having a fine opportunity of making 70 or 80 l.? - I mentioned to my husband, that there was an advertisement for a rider's place, and thought he had better accept of that, it would be 70 or 80 l. a year; that it would be better than being a servant to a messenger to bankruptcies.</p>
               <p>You were blaming your husband for being a fool about not accepting this profitable place; do you know a Mrs.

            ? - I know a Mrs. Bates.</p>
               <p>She was one of the persons in your company? - Yes; and she supped with me.</p>
               <p>She is a married woman, and one of your acquaintance? - I believe so.</p>
               <p>When did you see her? Did you see her on the Thursday? - Not till the Saturday.</p>
               <p>You did not call upon her on Thursday to go to Merlin's Cave? - No.</p>
               <p>That you swear? - That I swear.</p>
               <p>You did not see her till the Saturday? - No; I did not see her till the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Did you mention to her this transaction? - I told her Mr. Cutler was taken up for using me ill.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prosecution. You say when you got into Holborn with Mr. Cutler, that he asked you to drink a glass of wine with him? - He did.</p>
               <p>You considered that as an insult? - I told him, I did not chuse to do any such thing; it was not prudent for me to go into taverns and places.</p>
               <p>COURT. What did you understand was his drift by that invitation? - I did not think he meant me any ill.</p>
               <p>Then it did not strike you that he meant to have any intimacy with you, if you had gone to a tavern with him? - If it had been in the middle of noon-day I should not have gone into any tavern with a man.</p>
               <p>Did not you understand, by that invitation, that he meant to take you into a tavern and be familiar with you? - I did not know that he meant to take me into a tavern.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you understand that he meant by that question of his to get you into some place and to lie with you? - I had no ill opinion of him till he began to use me ill.</p>
               <p>Did not you at that time imagine that that was his drift? - I would not have gone if it had been in the day, much more by night.</p>
               <p>Why do you think it improper to go by night more than by day? - I would not have gone in the day with any man.</p>
               <p>Did not you understand that Cutler, when he asked you that question, wanted to have you into some house to be familiar with you? - I had no suspicion that he intended any such thing, I had not indeed.</p>
               <p>OBERTUS HAMLEY sworn.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A watchmaker.</p>
               <p>Are you any relation to Mr. and Mrs. Bradley? - Some distant relation.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mrs. Bradley on Wednesday the 16th of July? - Yes; being out about business on Wednesday the 16th I came into St. John's-street, Clerkenwell, from thence coming into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100033"></xptr> Cow-cross, before Mrs. Bradley's door, I called in to ask how the family did; it was about 9 o'clock; seeing some alteration in her countenance to what I usually before did, I asked her, what ailed her? she said, she was not well; I immediately bid her a good morning; she said, Mr. Hamley, if you will be so obliging as to wait a few minutes I have something particular to acquaint you with; about ten minutes after I withdrew into another room; she then said, that the evening before, the 15th, she spent the evening at Merlin's Cave, together with Mr. and Mrs. Bates, and Mrs. Boutflower, the wife of an attorney's clerk; in her way from her own house she called at Mrs. Bates's in Cold Bath Fields; Mrs. Bates's brother being there, went with Mrs. Bradley, as Mrs. Bates, it did not suit her immediately to go, she would follow them in a few minutes after; when they came to Merlin's Cave they went into a skittle-ground; seeing some gentlemen at skittles they sat at the farther end of the garden, this Mr. Bates the brother, and Mrs. Bradley; soon after which Mrs. Bates came to them and joined their company, and there they remained till about nine or between nine and ten o'clock; after which they adjourned into the house, by the intreaties of some of the gentlemen that came to them, I don't know whether it was Mr. Bates or not, or the prisoner; as soon as they came into the house they joined in one of the rooms, and sat altogether; after which there were two women that came into their company that had formerly sung at Sadler's Wells; Mr. Cutler knowing them desired them to sing a song, and I believe it was repeated by some others in the company; they sang till about twelve or between twelve and one; she then went home with Mr. Cutler, Mrs. Boutflower, and Mr. and Mrs. Bates into Cold Bath Fields, to their lodging, where they parted from Mr. and Mrs. Bates; from thence they went to Brook-street, Holborn, to a public house, where Mr. Boutflower was spending the evening; the wife of Mr. Boutflower, when she came to the door, seeing the waiter, enquired whether her husband was gone home or not; she there took leave of Mrs. Bradley, and, Mr. Cutler going down Holborn, Mrs. Bradley desired Mr. Cutler not to trouble himself in going home with her, as she was very capable of taking care of herself; he then entreated her to go with her to see her home; as soon as they came to her door they saw a woman that was occasionally hired by this Mrs. Bradley to look after the children in her absence; she, in opening the door, had her cloak and hat ready to go home to her lodgings; Mrs. Bradley then entreated her to stay there for the might, or the remaining part of the morning; she answered, that the people would wait up all the morning, in expectation of her coming home; the woman then going, Mrs. Bradley shutting the door after her, went into the kitchen, where the prisoner was; he then began with some familiarities, and Mrs. Bradley then had some altercation with him; she desired him to quit the house, or otherwise she would acquaint her husband of it; saying, Mr. Cutler, you have the wrong person to deal with. you may depend upon it, and if you proceed to any ill treatment you may be assured that you will suffer for it; he then threw her down on the floor, and in struggling she got from him, ran to the street-door to make her escape; but Mr. Cutler immediately ran to her, took her in his arms, carried her to the farther part of the kitchen, near the chimney, there threw her down, and then carnally knew her: she did not mention immediately the word carnally, but it implied the same; then he lifted her up from the floor; she desired him to go out of the house, which he refused, repeating the same words as before, that she would acquaint her husband of it; he said, he hoped she would not be guilty of informing her husband; with that the children were crying up stairs, she ran up as far as the door; the children calling for liquor, tea, or something, she went back into the kitchen, where the prisoner was, and then taking up the liquor to give the children, desiring of him then to quit the house; the prisoner said, if she would carry up the liquor he would go; upon which she went up stairs, and the prisoner followed her; that as soon as she entered the room they both entered the room; he locked the door on the inside; she then turned round and asked the prisoner, how he dared presume to come into her bed-chamber? that then the prisoner laid hold of her, threw her on the bed, and carnally knew her a second time; after which the prisoner bid her to take off her cloaths to go to bed, for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100034"></xptr> he would sleep with her the remainder of the morning; she then undressing herself, or he partly undressed her, she could not recollect which, she went then to bed, and the prisoner undressed himself and went to bed also; in the morning about five or six I believe the prisoner got up, and she supposed he was gone out of the house; but on her coming down some time after, an hour or the like, she found the prisoner sleeping on a chair; she desiring him to go about his business, he soon after withdrew, entreating her not to inform Mr. Bradley, her husband of it; to which she said, he might certainly depend upon it that she would acquaint her husband of the whole transaction: after she had told me this, I went out of the house, and told her, that if she would defer going to her husband till the afternoon I should be glad to meet her on Black-friars Bridge, and take a walk into St. George's Fields: my motive was to see, if possible, whether there had been any intimacy before: I asked her if they had ever been together before? whether there had been any intimacy, any liberties granted whatever? and she declared, that she was innocent from first to last: I did it on purpose to evade it, before the information should come to the husband's ear; she met me about four or a little after in the afternoon; she declared her innocence from first to last: In coming home I went into Hatton-garden, and told her I should call on my return home at her house, as she expected that the prisoner would call that night; he had told her so the foregoing day.</p>
               <p>When did he tell her so? - The Wednesday evening I was told of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. When did he say, that he would call? - On the Tuesday, I believe, the former evening; I went in the evening, but Mr. Cutler was not there.</p>
               <p>COURT. When was it did she say, that Cutler said he would call again? - I suppose it might be in the evening, before they parted; said he, Mrs. Bradley, I will call and see you to-morrow; Mrs. Bradley replied, she should have some company to-morrow evening; therefore whether she desired him or not I cannot particularly tell; she said, she did not desire to see him, did not desire his company not the ensuing evening.</p>
               <p>COURT. That is what she told you; but what did she say to him, that she excused herself from seeing him because she should have some company? Can you recollect when it was that Mrs. Bradley said, Mr. Cutler made this proposal of calling to see her in the evening? - On the foregoing night, Tuesday the 15th to the morning of the 16th.</p>
               <p>COURT. At her house? - I cannot immediately say it was in the evening.</p>
               <p>COURT. Whether it was when Mr. Cutler parted from her in the morning, or when? - I did not remark that, I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You are a watchmaker you tell us? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you ever act as an attorney? - No.</p>
               <p>I thought you had; because the precision with which this lady told the story to you was more like giving instruction for drawing a brief than telling a tale to a friend; she desired you to stay a few minutes, and then you retired into a back room with her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she tell you the story in the same words afterwards? - There might be some part of it repeated then.</p>
               <p>Not since then? - Yes; in the presence of her husband I heard it.</p>
               <p>Only those times? - No.</p>
               <p>You have a fine memory indeed! so you, as a friend to the family, called in to pay a morning visit, and enquire how the family did; when had you seen the family before? - Very likely the Sunday before.</p>
               <p>Do you visit often at Mrs. Bradley's? - Very often.</p>
               <p>How many times in a week? - Sometimes two or three times in a week.</p>
               <p>You are intimate there? - Very intimate with Mrs. Bradley, and her husband, and family and all.</p>
               <p>So intimate that in a wet stormy night perhaps you take a bed there? - No; far from it.</p>
               <p>I ask you upon your oath, did you never sleep in that house?  - No, never</p>
               <p>Never a night in your life? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Do you ever happen to stay late in an afternoon? - Till twelve or one o'clock in a morning I might be there.</p>
               <p>You deny that you did ever sleep there all night? - I never slept with her.</p>
               <p>Never slept with her, and always in the kitchen; never in the bed-chamber, upon your oath? - I have been in the bed-chamber many<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100035"></xptr> a time; not any criminal connection we never had together in our lives; I have been when the children have been ill.</p>
               <p>Then you have been a kind tender nurse when the children have been ill, and, anxious for their health, you have been perhaps in the bed chamber; sometimes when Mr. Bradley, who is pretty much from home, is absent, you are so kind as to keep the wife company till one or two in the morning; sit up and tell her some very pleasant stories? - I have been there very often.</p>
               <p>Now by this walk that you took you suspected her a little I find, because this walk to John o'Grote's house was to sift her, to know whether she had been guilty of any imprudencies? - Certainly my motive was to evade a prosecution if there had been any intimacy, but she declared there had not.</p>
               <p>Then from the knowledge that you have of your relation's character, you suspected there might have been something of that f ort? - No, I wanted an altercation to discover if there had been any thing of intimacy.</p>
               <p>Then you were a little jealous of her? - No, not jealous.</p>
               <p>Neither jealous nor suspicious, but for the purpose of preventing this getting to the ears of her husband, the only ear it should have got to, you took a walk to John o'Grote's house for the purpose of sifting her to evade a prosecution; did you see her any more that night? - Yes, I called at the house, and the woman that was there the night before was there.</p>
               <p>You was in hopes that you should catch Mr. Cutler in a trap then, you thought that he would be there? - I did not know but he might.</p>
               <p>You was in hopes of meeting him there? - I had no engagement with him.</p>
               <p>But you thought you might meet with him there? - Probably that might be the reason.</p>
               <p>You found Mrs. Bradley at home, and she told you that Mr. Cutler had not been there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she tell you she had been to look for him at Merlin's Cave? - She did not say that; she had never been to Merlin's Cave till the Thursday.</p>
               <p>She could not tell you that then? - No.</p>
               <p>She might be there on the Wednesday? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. We shall prove that she walked there after she had been at John o'Grote's house.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prosecutrix. Was there any mention made of Cutler's being to be at your house on Wednesday evening? - I believe he did say he would come on the Wednesday evening, and I told him that I did not desire to see him any more.</p>
               <p>When did he tell you he intended to come on Wednesday evening? - When he was going out of the house, I believe, in the morning; I said I did not desire to see him any more; I should certainly acquaint my husband with the affair.</p>
               <p>That is all the answer you made him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You said nothing to him about having company? - I don't believe I did, I did not desire his company.</p>
               <p>The question is, whether you told him not to come on Wednesday evening, for you should have company? - I told him I did not desire to see him any more.</p>
               <p>Did you give that reason for it, that you should have company? - I cannot say upon my word whether I did or no.</p>
               <p>Did you tell Mr. Hamley that you told the prisoner when he proposed calling upon you that evening, that you should have company? - I don't remember saying so.</p>
               <p>Court to HAMLEY. You hear this woman says she cannot recollect telling you that she made that excuse with the prisoner that she should have company that evening? - The words were mentioned to me, that some acquaintance or company would be there, and therefore she desired he might not come.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prosecutrix. Did you or did you not expect he would come that evening? - I did not expect that he would.</p>
               <p>Did not you appoint Mr. Hamley to come to your house, after you had parted with him in Hatton-garden, in expectation that he would meet Cutler there? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. What say you to that Hamley?</p>
               <p>HAMLEY. I recollect the circumstance well that she did recollect something of his saying he would call in the evening, and she desired him not; I told her I would be near her house about nine, and would drop in.</p>
               <p>Why? - Because I expected Mr. Cutler would come again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my counsel.</p>

               <p>Do you know the prosecutrix, Mrs. Bradley? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have formerly been employed to take care of her children? - I was her nurse when her child was ill, much about last Christmas.</p>
               <p>I believe now at this time, in summer, you get your bread by selling fruit? - I go up to Merlin's Cave of an evening.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the week in which Mr. Cutler was taken up for this matter? - I remember the time that I was up there, the 15th and the 16th, that was the Tuesday and the Wednesday.</p>

               <p>Did you see Mrs. Bradley there on the Tuesday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see her there on the Wednesday? - Yes, I did, and spoke to her.</p>
               <p>About what o'clock in the evening on the Wednesday was it that you spoke to her? - I believe between six and seven.</p>
               <p>What conversation passed between you and her on Wednesday? - I had an acquaintance laid in, who had caught a violent cold; I knew one time when Mrs. Bradley was bad with her face, that she had an old woman with her; I asked her if she could tell me whether that old woman was at leisure, I wanted to get her a nurse's place; she said she was afraid she was not at leisure; she asked me after that if I had seen Mr. Cutler.</p>
               <p>Did you know Mr. Cutler? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she know that you knew him? - Yes, very well she knew it.</p>
               <p>Did you see them playing together at skittles there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have they often been in company together there? - Yes, frequently, both him and others.</p>
               <p>She was a very good skittle player? - Yes, she would challenge any body to play at skittles.</p>
               <p>Counsel. What, Bradley against all England - you said you had not seen Mr. Cutler? - Yes; she said she had expected to see him that day at her house; I replied, very possible he might come; she said she had provided a shoulder of lamb and green pease for his dinner; I said very likely he might come up there that evening, but I had not seen him; possibly his business might have prevented him; that was all that passed that night.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Cutler come up to the Cave that evening? - I did not see him that night at all.</p>
               <p>Do you know this Mr. Hamley, this kind relation? - Mr. Hamley, yes, he is a watchmaker.</p>
               <p>And a relation of hers? - He is no relation I believe.</p>
               <p>You nursed her, did not you? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>He used to come and visit sometimes? - He was there on Sunday night as the child was bled with leeches, and they both went as they told me to go to meeting; they came home about eleven at night; I made an observation that I thought the parson had made a long sermon; it was a methodist meeting-house in Jewin-street, they told me they were going there.</p>
               <p>They do preach long sometimes I believe? - Never longer than about eight I believe; I have been there myself.</p>
               <p>Do you ever remember Mr. Hamley's sleeping in the house all night? - No, I cannot say I do; I can tell a person that I remember sleeping there one night, a Mr. Robinson.</p>
               <p>You knew her sometime, and was in her house and have reason to know her character; is she, from the knowledge you have of her character, a modest or a lewd, immodest woman? - I told you my opinion; she cannot be very modest, when at all times she would go out and come home at all hours when I was there, and sometimes very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Have you seen her with other men besides her husband? - Yes, that I have divers of times when the husband was not at home at all, and men have laid in the house when he was not at home.</p>
               <p>Then with you she bears the character of being an immodest woman? - I don't know what you can call a modest woman, if you call that one.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You attend this garden? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cutler you are well aquainted with? - I never saw any misbehaviour in him.</p>
               <p>How came you to recollect to positively the day of the month? - I had, as I told you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100037"></xptr> before, an acquaintance that lay-in who had a cold; the child was put out to nurse about that time; I was obliged to get a nurse that night, and we paid a month's money upon that day of the month again.</p>
               <p>As to Cutler, you cannot say whether he was there or not? - I did not see him on the Wednesday; on the Tuesday I saw him there.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prosecutrix. Have you heard the evidence that this woman has given? - I have.</p>
               <p>She says that between six and seven in the evening of the Wednesday, that you came to Merlin's Cave and had a discourse with her; that you asked after this Mr. Cutler, and said that you had provided a shoulder of lamb and some pease for his dinner? - That could not be, I don't dine at that time of the day, I generally dine about one; I did not see her, nor I never was near Merlin's Cave on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Did you tell this woman that you expected Cutler to dine with you, and had got a shoulder of lamb and pease for his dinner? - No such thing; I never saw this woman.</p>

               <p>Do you remember any time in the evening, when you was in the room, Mrs. Bradley laying a wager about any thing? - No, but I remember another circumstance which is rather more singular, that was, Cutler was asked to sing a song, which he frequently did, so he begins and sings a bit, By G - d, says he, I can neither sing nor do any thing else; she took notice of it, she goes out and takes him with her into the passage between the two rooms, and she comes in again, this was on that Tuesday evening; she comes in again, and said that Mr. Cutler was fineable for what he had said.</p>
               <p>She went out to form her judgment, and came in and said that Mr. Cutler was fineable for what he had said? - Yes; upon which we desired that the ladies would withdraw to bring in their verdict upon it; they went out into the other room.</p>
               <p>How many of them? - Four, and when they came in again we fixed a foreman; we asked them what was their verdict, the verdict was given by Mrs. Bradley; they resolved<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100038"></xptr> that he was fineable a bottle of ale; the bottle of ale was had in, and he paid the six-pence because he was not incapable.</p>

I said, "No"—I then tried it, and it broke—I said to the prisoner, "I will give you one chance; if you like to pay me for the bad half crown you gave me last Friday, I will let you go"—she said, "It is a likely thing I am going to pay you for what I never had"—she would not pay, and I sent for the police—a water<lb></lb>man came, and when he came, the prisoner said, "I would rather pay you than be locked up"—he said it could not be done, he must take her in charge, and I gave him the two half crowns.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hammerman, of Southwark Bridge Road—on 17th January, between 6 and 7 p.m., I was in Lant Street, with a young woman—the prisoner came up to us; he was interfering with everybody who came about, knocking up against them and then furning round and speaking to them—he knocked up against me—I said "Mind who you are knocking against"—he used foul language and challenged me to fight—I said "I will," but before I had time to take my coat off he struck me, and when I got my coat off I struck him—he fell, and while he was on the ground I saw his hand in his pocket—when he got up I saw a knife in his hand—he rushed at me three times with the knife, and then I found I was stabbed under the right ear—it bled, and I was taken to a doctor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He might have had a drop, but he did not seem drunk—he was staggering about—I cannot tell where I hit him, I was quite sober—my blow did not knock him down, but he seemed to slip off the kerb—I said before the Magistrate "he reeled from my blow"—two friends of mine came up as it happened, but neither of them pushed him or touched him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bedstead maker—I saw Cook talking with a girl at the corner of Lant Street—the prisoner knocked up against them and Cook asked him what he was doing—the prisoner said "If you want to fight have a fight"—I am not sure whether Cook knocked him down or whether he fell, but when he was down he put his hand in his pocket, pulled it out, and I saw a knife in his hand—he got up and opened it, and</p>

               <p>said "Now come on"—I saw him strike at Cook twice with the knife, and the third time it hit him, and he said "I am stabbed"—I went for a constable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He did not rush at him, but Cook's head was down like this—I believe I said before the Magistrate that they rushed at one another, but I can't recollect—the prisoner held out the knife and I said "Come on"—the whole thing was very quick—I did not say anything before the Magistrate about its being accidental.</p>

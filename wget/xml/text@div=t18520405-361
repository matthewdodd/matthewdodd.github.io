                  </hi>. I assist Mr. Taprin in his business, in Hungerford-arcade. On 4th March the prisoner came and asked for a penny cake—he it broke off—I gave the prisoner one of the pieces back, and told him it was bad—he said he took it at the top of the street—he went away—I saw him go into a baker's shop in Bedford-court—after he came out I went into the shop, and in consequence of what I was told there I gave him into custody with the piece of the shilling—this is it.</p>

I was on duty about 7 o'clock in the evening—Taplin gave me an alarm—I took the prisoner in Bedford-street, Covent-garden—I took him to Bedford-court, and Mrs. Elizabeth Johnson said, "That is the man that passed a bad shilling to me"—I told the prisoner I should search him before be went any further—he said he would not be searched by any b—y policeman—I searched him, and took part of a shilling from his hand, and in his right hand coat pocket I found three shillings wrapped in paper—he said he was not aware that he bad any<lb></lb>thing of the sort about him—these are them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Cherry Tree, in Kingsland-road.

She made a communication to me about the prisoner—I went out, and saw her about sixty yards from our house, going from it—I said, "You must come back with me, for passing bad money"—she said, "Do I owe you anything?"—I said, "You must come back with me"—she said I was mistaken in the party; she would not go back—I took her hand—she resisted for some time—at last I took her back, and found my sister, who gave me this shilling—she said, in the prisoner's presence, that it was bad—the prisoner said we were mistaken altogether—I asked her for the 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—she said she had not a farthing in the world—her right hand was closed—I said, "What have you got in that hand?"—she said, "Nothing," and put her hand behind her—with my sister's assistance. I opened it, and found in it this other bad shilling—she was given in charge.</p>

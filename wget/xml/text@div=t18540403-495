                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Hutton and Co., of No. 5 and 6, Newgate-street—the prisoners were in our employment—Coombes was our principal packer, and Wells was second packer—in Jan. last we received a bale of Italian tram silk from Messrs. Cortie, of Milan—I have the invoice here—I did not tell Wells the weight of the bale of silk—Wells did not see the invoice.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">a prisoner</hi>). I was in Messrs. Hutton's employment; and have pleaded guilty to robbing them (<hi rend="italic">see last Case</hi>)—I have been in their employment turned eight years, as a silk skeiner—it was my duty to work on it, but not on the premises at Newgate-street—I had not access to the bulk of silk on the premises; the prisoners had, they were packers—in Jan. I received from Coombes 7 lbs. of silk, such as this produced—I had occasion to go to the warehouse two or three times a week to ask for employment—it was packed in brown paper—Coombes said, "Here is 7 lbs. of silk; we want 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound for it"—that was him and Wells—Wells handed the silk from the cellar to Coombes, who was within hearing, and he handed it to me—I was to pay them at dinner time in the warehouse, if it was sold—I sold it that night to a man named Beale, who keeps the Black Swan public house, Church-street, Bethnal-green, for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this was on Saturday; I did not settle for it till the Monday—I think I settled for it to Wells in the warehouse, but am not quite sure—I gave him at the rate of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound—I did not pocket 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. myself—there was an allowance made to the person who sold it for me—he did not actually buy it of me; he obtained me a purchaser, and gave me the money, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I gave a young man there 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and kept the rest myself—about a month after that I received 18 1/2 lbs. of the same silk, wrapped in paper, which weighed 15 ozs.—Coombes told me to meet Wells at dinner time at Westmoreland-buildings, Aldersgate-street—I met him there in the open street, and we went into a coal shed, and weighed the silk with the paper, after which it was delivered to me, and they told me to meet them at 8 o'clock at night at a public house opposite, where it was weighed; I do not know the sign—I took it to a man named Buggies, who received it of me, and sold it in two lots—he brought me 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the first lot; the weight was short, and they kept back 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or it would have been 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he sold the rest the same afternoon, and paid me for it at the rate of 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound—he gave me two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and some odd shillings—I took the money home, turned the notes into cash, and went to the public house appointed at 10 minutes past 8 o'clock—I found the prisoners waiting there, and paid them at the rate of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound, according to agreement.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say anything about offending God Almighty until you were apprehended? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I dare say I have often in private—no dishonest man ever does anything wrong without feeling it—I never did wrong until I yielded to the proposals of these two men, never, and my employers know that—I never pursued anything but an honest, upright course—Mr. Ruggles is a <hi rend="italic">turner on</hi> and a weaver in Slater-street—the promise to me was made by</p>

               <p>Mr. Hutton, if I would let them know; he said, "I am convinced you never could have done this yourself, and I will be your friend if you will disclose the truth"—he meant that he would recommend me to the merciful consideration of the Court—I have been at Messrs. Hutton's just upon nine years; I was in their service before the prisoners—I used to skein different silk to this, dyed silk—I am charged with stealing gimp—I only saw Mr. Hutton once while I was disburdening my mind—I saw somebody else from Mr. Hutton's, and disburdened my mind to him as well—it was Mr. Sleigh, a partner in the house—he also said it would be better for me to disburden my mind—the name of the publican where I sold the silk is Beale—he took it away out of the house, and sold it—I did not give him anything for selling it—I gave the young man half a crown; no, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—his name is Arnett—I mean to represent that Mr. Beale sold it for me without any remuneration—I have not known him twelve months personally—I did not tell him I had stolen it, or that I had come honestly by it—I told him I had got a lot to sell, and he laid, "I will take it, and see if I can sell it for you"—he did not know where it came from—he did not know where I lived—he is not a dealer in silk that I know of—he kept it the best part of an hour—I think he went out of the house to sell it—this was on a Saturday night, just after Christmas—the house was open—we were in the parlour—it was past 9 o'clock at night—there were, I think, other persons present.</p>

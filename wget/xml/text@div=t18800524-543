The drawer was accessible to any one in the shop. I had not the key. Six or seven hours elapsed before Mr. Ullman came to look after the money. In intro<lb></lb>ducing a system of bookkeeping to Mr. Ullman's business my life was made a perfect misery to me by his brothers. My system was too strict for those who had to contend with it, and Mr. Ullman abused me in my bedroom between 3 and 4 in the morning. I am innocent; if guilty I should not have stayed in the neighbourhood where my duties took me, and I was taken into custody within 100 yards of one of Mr. Ullman's shops. I left because I was thoroughly worn out with annoyance and anxiety. He claims 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me, and that nearly tallies with the amount I am charged with stealing. I have borne an honest character, and the testimony brought against me is not sufficient to chastise a child upon.</p>

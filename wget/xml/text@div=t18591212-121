                  </hi>. I am a Custom-house officer—William Thomas Edmunds was also a Custom-house officer, and I was with him on board the <hi rend="italic">Castor</hi> on 24th November—she is a steamer trading between London and Hamburg—she was lying at Horseleydown—I was putting on board export goods, teas—the vessel had been discharged two hours and a half previous to that, at 4 o'clock, or a little after—the last time that I saw Edmunds moving about on the deck, was from 5 o'clock to ten minutes to 6—he came from the after part of the vessel with some official books in his hand—he was perfectly sober—the next thing I heard was a moaning noise proceeding from the fore hold—some persons went down into the hold and brought Edmunds up the fore hatch in a cattle sling, by the steam crane, and he was laid on the deck—he said he was in great pain, and was taken to the hospital—it is eighteen feet two inches from the deck to where he fell—a light had been taken to the fore hold when I looked down, but there was no light there before that—there was a light twenty-two feet six inches from the spot; not in the rigging, but on the cattle house—it did not even throw a light on the main hatch—there was a light in the main hold which threw its rays upwards against the bulk head, and that made the fore hold more dusk—the light was between decks—the bulk head came flush to the top—there was only the bulk head to separate the main hold from the fore hold—there was no hatch across the fore hold—I have had nearly eighteen years experience in going on board vessels when they have been discharged—when a vessel is discharging cargo at night it is quite usual to put on hatches over the hold; it is, I should say, the invariable practice, if not taking in or discharging cargoes—the exceptions are these; if the combings of the hatch are high, so as to be a guard against danger; some of these steam vessels have combings from eighteen inches to two feet high, but in this case the combings were only three or four inches above the deck—there was a steam crane at work on board the vessel at the time I heard the moaning—the man was taken up with it into the main hold—no cargo had been taken into the vessel when I left at twenty minutes past 12 at night.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you not in a little error about the time the unloading was completed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think not; the finish of the discharge was between four and live—the reloading sometimes commences before the cargo is out—I do not think the vessel had to leave next day—I do not think she had any regularly appointed time—Edmunds was on the deck when he was on duty—he was on duty at this time—it was his duty to be by the fore hold and the main hold to see the cargo—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is, as far as it goes, a pretty correct plan of the ship's deck, but there are a great many things left out—it is a correct representation of the main hold and the fore hold and the windlass, but here is a distance marked of three feet one and a half inches from the crane to the hatchway—I think that is not correct—I have measured some parts of the deck, and from the break-handle to the combings of the hatchway; it is not three feet one and a half inches as described here—I make it two feet one; and if you put the man's elbow and arms when pressing on it, you will find there will be hardly any space at all—I did not measure the distance from the side of the vessel to the combings—the steam crane occupies a very large space—I should say it is five feet in circumference—I cannot say the length of the vessel from stem to stern—with the exception of the place where the steam crane is there is nothing between the combings and the side of the vessel at that</p>

               <p>particular place—there is a passage on the other side of the vessel, from the companion to the aft—there were a great many people about on this evening taking in rice—there is a hand crane on this side of the deck, a permanent structure—it is opposite the steam crane—with the exception of the steam crane on one side, and the hand crane on the other, there is, I believe, no permanent structure on the deck—there was a gangway from one end to the other—I have not measured the height of the combings, but it does not exceed four and half inches—I will swear it does not exceed eight inches—I will not swear whether or not there were ring-bolts along the deck by the side of the combings—I believe the vessel arrived on Sunday, and this was Thursday—there were lighters at the side of the vessel with cargo for the ship; I cannot say the number.</p>

I am a custom-house officer—I was on board this Teasel on 24th November—the captain went on shore about half-past-three or four o'clock and came back at very nearly seven—I can swear there was nothing in the fore hold after four o'clock; I looked in—they began to load cargo in at half-past 2 the following morning, and I took an account of the goods that were put in—I recollect the deceased going to the water closet forwards, about six o'clock—he spoke to me as he went—the steam crane was not in motion then though the steam was up—they were just going to commence loading some goods—we commenced working almost immediately he passed me—I afterwards saw him in the hold and assisted in getting him out—I did not see him fall—after he had been removed in a boat to the hospital I called to the prisoner and said "Will you have those hatches put on?" he said "No I will not"—I said "Why?" he said "Because we are going to work there"—I said "When you begin you will have sufficient time to do that"—I have no control over them, but I said that for the sake of humanity—when he said "No, "I said "Will you put a light there?"—he did not put a light for an hour afterwards, when there was a dim light hung in the foremast.</p>

               <p>that I could not even see the steam-crane—he could not take the port side, because the steam-crane was at work—he came the other side to avoid it—there was not ample room for three or four men to walk abreast between the hand-crane and the combings; not for one—whether there was room to go between the combing and the crane would depend upon which way the crane was swung—I cannot say whether there is room for two or three men abreast when the crane is not at work—during the progress of loading and unloading I have never seen the hatches stowed away—to get them away they are laid on the deck close to the hatchway—I do not know whether they would be in the way of people who are walking up and down—I never saw any hatches moved to another part of the deck—there is no rule not to go across the hatches when they are on; I never heard of it—it was so dark this night that you could not see whether the hatches were on or not—I have walked across the hatches ordinarily—the deceased could not have gone any other way—the cargo was not loaded until half-past 2 next morning, I do not know whether it was on board the lighters next to the vessel at the time the accident occurred—it was not my duty to go and see what lightens were alongside—Mr. Wilkins is the tide surveyor, having the supervision of myself and my brother officers—he did not say that he would go and inspect the hold, and request that no cargo should be put in until he had inspected it—I heard nothing of the kind.</p>

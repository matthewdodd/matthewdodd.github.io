On 27th Nov., about three o'clock in the afternoon, I went to the Hampstead-road with some officers, to attend a soldier's funeral at St. James's Chapel—I found a great many persons there—it was my duty to keep a thoroughfare for the soldiers to pass and repass to the chapel—a disturbance took place—there was hallooing, shouting, and throwing stones at me and my brother officers, and threatening to do us some injury—I heard a man say he would do for one of the constables—I felt a rap on the head with something, I could not tell what—I fell down—it made me insensible—when I came to myself, I found myself in a chemist's shop, and the blood running from my eye—I thought I had lost the sight of my eye—I was taken by two officers to Mr. Collins', and after that I was under the police-surgeon—I was ten davs before I could do duty.</p>

About three o'clock, on Monday, 27th Nov., Sergeant Wilkes was brought to my surgery—he was rather cold, and almost insensible—he was not aware where he was—his pulse was very low—he was almost in a state of collapse—I found a small wound between the eyelid and the external angle of the right eye—the skin was broken—the wound might be dangerous—it appeared mare to have affected the brain—it might have been caused by a stone—the ball of the eye was not injured—I suppose it produced the effect from the violence with which it was thrown.</p>

            . It appeared that the Company's Servants were moving their Pipes, and that 4 of them were lost; that the Prisoner was seen to draw away two of them, one of which was found in a Wheeler's Yard in Elm-Street, who deposed he bought it of the Prisoner for a Shilling. The Prisoner in his Defence pleaded that he was Servant to a Scavenger; and as he was going along with his Cart where the Company's Servants were at work, they told him that they would give him 2 or 3 old Pipes if he would lay them down a Load of Ashes to raise their Work, which he did. The Prisoner could not prove his Bargain, but called several to his Reputation, two of them Masters he had served, who gave him a very good Character.

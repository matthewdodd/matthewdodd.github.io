             sworn. Examined by Mr. Pooley. Q. In what situation are you belonging to the London Dock. - A. I am principal warehousekeeper to No. 3.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the property of that warehouse under your care. - A. It is, I am answerable to the company for it.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 9th of April was the prisoner employed in that warehouse. - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a great quantity of raw coffee loose and in bags also in that warehouse, it was in such a situation as he could get at it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And in the course of his employment he went in and out of that warehouse any time he pleased. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the evening of the 7th of April, when he was coming out of the Dock premises, was he searched in your presence. - A. He was searched by Mr. Mac Donald in my presence, I saw a little bag of coffee taken out of his breeches, and one taken out of his hat, which contained more raw coffee; we had nothing else in that warehouse but raw coffee; I went along with the officer to the house where he lodged, the officer searched it, I saw a quantity of coffee found in a little back room under the bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to be the warehousekeeper; the quantity of coffee that is contained in that warehouse I should think that it is impossible for you to state that you lost this. - A. We have too large a quantity to swear that we lost that.</p>
               <p>Q. I think there are a vast number of warehouses that have articles of this description. - A. Not in the Dock, out of the Dock there is raw coffee in a great many warehouses.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were employed in this warehouse as well as him. - A. I suppose fifty.</p>
               <p>Q. How much does this quantity amount to altogether that was found upon him. - A. Between three and four pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it found upon his going out of the warehouse. - A. Yes, he was within a hundred yards of it, but he was not gone out of the great gate.</p>
               <p>- MAC DONALD sworn. Examined by Mr. Bosanquet. I was on duty at the west gate of the Dock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner there. - A. I saw him when he was coming out, I searched him, I found two bags of coffee, one concealed in his breeches, the other concealed in his hat, it is raw coffee; I said to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160059"></xptr>him, Tuck, you ought to be ashamed of yourself to do such things; upon my word, says he, I was led into it by others, he said he was very sorry for it.</p>
               <p>Court. How long has the man been employed by the London Dock company. - A. Between five and six months.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called no witnesses to his character.</p>

            . I live in the house of Mrs. Clarke, in Great Marlow-street, Mary-le-bone. The prisoner was employed as a nurse. Mr. Edward Witt hired the house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130063"></xptr>and I had the care of his property, his wearing apparel was in a chest of drawers in the front parlour - the prisoner attended me for a fortnight; and on Monday, the 10th of January, I was much worse. On Tuesday, she came about eight o'clock, but she did not usually come till about ten. I went to sleep, and did not awake till half-past ten - I then found the chairs in a litter, and the drawers loose - the property stated in the indictment was safe the night before. She did not come again after I saw the house in confusion. I had paid her what was due to her on the night before. She was taken up on the Thursday following.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. You have answered upon your oath that your name is Witt - is that your name? A. It is the name I have gone by - I have lived with Mr. Witt as his wife, he is a groom. I did not swear before the Magistrate that I was his wife. I have sent the prisoner to the pawnbroker's several times with clothes of Mr. Witt's - I sent her the night before, with a great coat to pawn, because Mr. Witt was out - I might have sent her three or four times to the pawnbroker's, and I expected her the next morning - she did not give me the duplicate of the articles, but left it on the drawers - I saw it, and went to the pawnbroker's. Upon my oath I did not send her to pawn these articles.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. I have a coat, two pairs of breeches, and two waistcoats, pawned by the prisoner on the 11th of January, for 4 l. She had pawned articles of Mr. Witt's before - the greater part of them were redeemed the night before from my shop, and nearly 4 l. paid for them. They were pawned in name of Mr. Witt.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner on Wednesday, the 12th of January. Mr. Witt brought the ticket to the office, and I went and traced the prisoner to an empty room - she had absconded from her former lodgings.</p>

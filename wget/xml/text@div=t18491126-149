                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Louis Amie De Bergue—I live with my brother Frederick William Billings—the prisoner was our servant—on the 18th Nov., in consequence of missing some articles, I went into her bed-room, and found two silk dresses of mine between the mattress and the bed—I told my brother; and in the evening I charged the prisoner with stealing them—she produced a comb of mine out of her pocket—she was taken into custody; and next day I went with the sergeant to the Servants'-Home in Millman-street—some boxes were opened there, in there prisoner's presence—she had given us the keys the night before, hoping that we should not give her into custody, and said we should have the things back—I found two handkerchiefs, two neck-ties, and a pair of scissors of mine—I missed a coat of my husband's, and five tea-spoons, which I found in a drawer, into which a box of my mother's had been emptied—the clothes have not been found—she was only with me a few days.</p>

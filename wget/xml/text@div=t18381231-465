                  </hi>. I live in George-street, Minories. The prisoner was in my service for about two years, and left about three months back—on the 14th of December, after leaving my house, I returned about half-past nine o'clock—I found the servants in great anxiety and excite<lb></lb>ment—they thought there were thieves in the house, and I found two officers in the house searching—I found a pair of half-boots in the cellar, which did not belong to any body in the house—I remained up all night, and all the servants as well—we searched the house three times that night—the next night we also searched the house, and took the plate and jewel<lb></lb>lery up stairs, when I went to bed, at half-past twelve o'clock—next morn<lb></lb>ing I was called down by my servant a little after seven o'clock, and found a table-lamp burning, which had been extinguished the night before, some matches and a hammer on the ground, and a poker broken—I lost a hat and some boots—on going to bed I thought I had taken all the plate up stairs, but the silver sugar-basin and a soup-ladle were forgotten, and they were gone—some of them are marked with my initials—when I came down I found the patent blind down, and the parlour window open, but the street door was safe.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to the prosecutor. On the 14th of December I came down between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, and went into the store-room—I found the door and window left open, which I had fastened overnight myself—I had gone to bed about half-past twelve o'clock—I missed a great quantity of fried fish, some smoked beef, and three parts of an apple-pie—I found a hammer laid on the mat in the parlour that was usually kept in the warehouse—the parlour-shutters were open, and put back as they are in the day-time—I had left them closed and fastened—I found a table-lamp burning, which I had put out the night before—I found that lid of a lucifer-box near the lender, and matches scattered about the parlour—on the Thursday night I had found a pair of strange boots in the cellar.—I knew the prisoner when he was in my master's employ, and thought they looked like his boots, but I could not swear to them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City police-inspector. From information I obtained, I apprehended the prisoner at his mother's house, in Norman-court, Cable-street, between two and three o'clock, on Saturday after<lb></lb>noon, the 15th of December—he was sitting by the fire, in a room on the ground-floor, without any shoes on—I asked him where his shoes were<lb></lb>he said, "Up stairs," he would go and get them—I prevented him, and told his sister to go—she went, and returned, saying she could not find them—I said I thought I knew where his shoes were—he then said his mother had got them on—I found in his pocket some pieces of pie-crust, and a latch-key—I took him up stairs, and in a cupboard there, found a hat, with this silver sugar-basin, tongs and ladle in it, which Mr. Calisber, who went with me to the house, identified—I took the prisoner to the station-house, and requested him to try on one of the old boots found it the prosecutor's—he did, and it appeared to fit him.—he denied all know<lb></lb>ledge of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> He said they were not his boots? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he had two or three old pairs up stairs, in his own house, similar to these—the boot fitted him, as an old boot would fit-a person, rather loose—I do not know whether it would have fitted me, I did not try it—there was nothing very remarkable about them—he went with me into the room, where I found the hat, and turned some things out of a little round basket for me to search—there was nothing in that relating to this robbery—the hat was in a closet, which was not locked—I asked him how he came by the things, and he said a boy had given them to him—he might have said the boy was to call for them, but I did not pay much attention to his story, not believing it—I do not recollect that he told me I might find the boy at the theatre—I think he said the boy was a weaver.</p>

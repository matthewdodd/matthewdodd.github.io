            . At the time this happened I was a porter at the White Horse Inn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner at the bar there and when - A. Yes, on the 8th and 9th of October last, he came there I believe on the 8th; I am not positive to the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his giving you any directions on the 9th of October - A. On the 9th of October, between three and four in the afternoon, he gave me directions to take the check in question to the bankers for payment, he said to Sikes's and company in Mansion-house-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the amount of the check - A. One hundred and three pounds twelve shillings, and if I received large notes, I was then to go to the Bank and endorse them in my own name, or the name of Leech, and to get small notes, one's or two's. I accordingly went to the <rs id="t18101031-21-viclabel126" type="occupation">banker</rs>

               <p>Q. Did you get payment of it - A. No, I did not. I was then desired to wait till one of the gentlemen came out. On the gentleman's return he desired me to tell the person that gave me the check to come for the money himself. I then went home, leaving the check there. Before I had gone home Mr. Nalder the city marshal came up to me and asked are some questions about the prisoner; I went back to the White Horse, Mr. Nalder promised to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310030"></xptr>meet me there; I happened to be there first; I then went up stairs to the prisoner and informed him of the message I had received from Messrs. Sikes's, which was, that he was to come to receive the money himself, upon which he answered, then I know what to do: I then came down stairs, leaving the prisoner up stairs; I found Mr. Nalder waiting down stairs, I conducted Mr. Nalder to the prisoner, and he immediately apprehended him. Then I accompanied Mr. Nalder and the prisoner to the Compter. In our way to the Compter the prisoner appeared to be quite ignorant of his situation, he seemed to be quite stupefied, he appeared to be insensible of the situation he was in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. He said that he knew what to do, did not be add that he received the check with some others of a traveller in the country - A. No, I did not hear him say that.</p>

I was; I found the prisoner there, I met him coming out of the room he slept in, No. 28, up two pair of stairs; I immediately took hold of him, and told him he must go with me; he asked me who I was, I immediately told him my name and the situation I held in the city; he then asked me what I wanted with him, I told him he must go to Mansion-house street with me; he almost immediately shammed to be extremely drunk.</p>

I desired Colton to take hold of his arm; we took him down stairs, and from thence put him into a coach, and conveyed him to the banking house. Colton went with me in the coach. Upon getting into the banking-house, I took him into a back room of Mr. Snaith's banking house and searched him; I found upon him three drafts, purporting to be drafts drawn upon Snaith and Co. all of them signed, Stokes and Hodgson, payable to different people, one for the sum of eighty-three pound twelve shillings, another seventy-eight pound twelve shillings and sixpence, another twenty-sixpound twelve shillings, and another draft not quite complete, in as much as the figures are not complete in the body of the draft. It is directed to Sikes and Co. purporting to be signed by Stokes and Hodgson.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they checks or plain paper - A. They are plain paper, and on the same paper is part of another draft not finished by the figures neither by Mr. Hodgson's name.</p>

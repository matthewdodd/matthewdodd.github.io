             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman, in Fleet-market: On the 25th of December, about twenty minutes after ten, I saw the prisoner at the bar, and another woman, in company with her, come across the market, on to my beat; I perceived the prisoner to have something rather bulky in her apron; I went up to her, and asked her, what she had got in her apron; she made no answer, but threw the contents down on the ground; I perceived that they were blankets and sheets; she ran away almost to the top of the market, and I ran after her; I never lost sight of her; till I took her; she had got four or five hundred yards, or more, when I laid hold of her; she said, "you have got me, damn it, never mind, it will only take me over the fish-pond;" I took her back to where she dropped the property, and found a brother watchman in possession of it; I desired him to take it to the watch-house with us; the constable of the night asked her where she got it; she said, a butcher's boy, in the market, gave it her; he said, she must be detained till we found an owner; in about a quarter of an hour after, I was sent for, to the watch-house; Mary Crutch was there; she said, it was her property; she told her, if she confessed to the parties that gave it her, or were concerned with her, she would forgive her.</p>
               <p>Court. You must not tell us what she said.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gardner. Q. Have you al<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130105"></xptr>ways given the same account of this transaction? - A. Yes; I was examined at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said nothing about any alarm being given? - A. There was no alarm given.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say there was? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never, on any occasion, impute this felony to any other person? - A. No; I said thus far, as soon as I got on my beat, I heard a whistle from a man, and another whistle below Harp-alley, that gave me a suspicion something was going to be done.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Mrs. Crutch? - A. Never; I said to her, I heard two men whistle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say you saw two men? - A. I saw a man whistle, and another man below Harp-alley answered the whistle.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from this place where she dropped the things? - A. Nine or ten yards.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had any conversation with Mrs. Crutch? - A. None but what I have said here; when she came into the watch-house, she said this property was her's; I told her I heard a whistle by Black-horse-alley, and another whistle at Harp-alley, and I suspected a house was going to be broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with her, whether there was any reward in this instance, or any other? - A. Never.</p>

Christmas-day, that shop was robbed of the things mentioned in the indictment, (enumerating them); my sister, a Mrs. Gaylay in my shop; she went down to the shop to go to bed, at a quarter after ten; she came back, and said, the place was robbed of the things off the bed; I went immediately to the watch-house to get a light, and they shewed me the things, and asked if they were mine; I knew them to be my property.(They were produced in Court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gardner. Q. By what mark do you know the bit of blanket? - A. There is no particular mark; I know it to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you suppose, about this town, there may be many bits of blanket like one another? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bits of blanket now do you think there may be like this? - A. I suppose many hundreds.</p>
               <p>Q. The circumstances being so that there may be many hundred bits of blanket like that, and that having no mark, how can you swear to that? - A. There was no other bit of blanket in the watch-house, and a bit was lost off the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what ground did you swear so positively to it? - A. A piece of blanket was lost off the bed at the same time as the blanket and the coat, and they were all in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Instead of swearing that that is the blanket you lost, the utmost you now swear is, that you lost a bit of blanket like that? - A. That is all I mean to swear.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the coat? - A. Yes; it is burnt with putting over walnuts.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You lost a blanket, a sheet, a piece of blanket, and a coat? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a doubt upon any one of them? - A. I have not the least doubt in the would that they belong to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gardner. Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes, by sight.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no reason to have a bad opinion of her? - A. No; I have no bad opinion of her now.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether to your knowledge she has not before now been at your shop? - A. No; not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know something of two men having committed this robbery? - A. I said I suspected two men, and said, if she would tell me, I would not hurt her; I have a very great suspicion of two men, especially one; I don't think she broke the shop open; there was a woman with her had a muslin apron, else, I suppose, she was to take the things; but the prisoner had a blue apron.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You know nothing about the matter, I suppose? - A. No; only what the watchman told me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any woman with her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>- GAY sworn.</p>
               <p>I can swear to the coat, it is my husband's, it was on the bed that night; I think I can swear to the sheet, but positively I can to the coat; I think I can safely swear to every thing here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the 25th of December, I was coming down Fleet-market, at ten o'clock, a young man, like a butcher, asked me to hold the things, till he fastened his shoe and tied his stocking up; I was then going to give them to him, he said, no, he would treat me; we were going to drink; crossing the way, the watchman stopped me, and the man ran away; I threw the things down and said, you don't see after him; he said, no, the person with the property I want.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Challice.) You described two women in company, was there any man with them? - A. No.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130106"></xptr>(The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character).</p>

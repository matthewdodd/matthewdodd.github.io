I am certain the prisoners are the men, Pinkston had a cutlash and Free and Brown had each a pistol, I gave them six shillings. I went directly to Clerkenwell Bridewell and gave an account there of the robbery, and I described the persons and dress of the men that robbed me, that one had a cutlass, another a large flapt hat, and another had a light coloured handkerchief tied loosely about his neck.</p>

We met the prisoners in another part of the field, in which the prosecutor had said he was robbed, we immediately attacked them, I saw Brown throw away a pistol, Kipping seized Pinkston and he threw away a pistol likewise, Free had a remarkable large slapped hat, Brown had a handkerchief tied about his neck, exactly in the way the prosecutor had described one of the men, we took them to prison, I believe they were in hold in less than three quarters of an hour after the robbery was committed.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Queen's-row, Pentonville; my husband is a carpenter. On the 13th of Sept., the prisoner Ann came and repre<lb></lb>sented herself as Mrs. Thompson, and asked if we made kitchen tables—I said, "Yes"—she said she wished for a good one—I said I would call Mr. Davey to take her order—she represented to him what she required—he was to go to her house to receive the order—she gave her address in writing, "14, Hermes-street"—she said she had some things to be done—Mr. Davey went with her, and brought a written order back—on Wed<lb></lb>nesday, the 18th of Sept., the prisoner Emma, who is the daughter, called and asked if the box which had been ordered for the children to take to school was done—I said, "Not quite"—she said they wanted it very particularly—I said I understood it was for the children to go to school—she said, "Yes," and left the shop—our boy took the box and clothes horse next day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the witness's husband. On the 13th or 14th Sept. I was called into my front shop, and the prisoner Ann said she wished a very strong kitchen table, one of the best—I said I could make it—she said, "Call on me to-morrow morning, I will give you the order"—I called at 14, Hermes-street, and the prisoner Ann gave me an order for a kitchen table, a clothes horse, and box, in writing—the table was never made—I made the horse, box, and a paste board, which I sent by the apprentice—I think, on the 19th—nothing was said about the price.</p>

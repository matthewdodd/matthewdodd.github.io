On Saturday, the 6th, between six and seven o'clock, I counted up 24 l. in the bar; it consisted of crowns, half-crowns, shillings, sixpences, and three sovereigns; I can swear there were forty half crowns and eighty shillings; I placed it in the corner of one of the drawers; the prisoner was in the kitchen, which faces the bar at the time, and must have seen me count the money and put it there - my husband sent down stairs to say he was much worse; she heard the boy bring that message - and I had scarcely got up stairs a moment, and poured on this medicine, before I heard the bar door open, which I had left on the spring lock. I gave my husband his medicine, hurried down, and the prisoner was then gone; I had left her in the kitchen, and no one else there. I called her four or five times, but could get no answer. I had left her busy washing the tea things; she had left them unfinished, and had brought part of them into the bar, as an excuse. I found the whole of the money gone - it was all we had. We are young beginners, and had collected it to pay away; she had given us no warning. I did not see her again till the 10th of December; and have only recovered 5 s. 8 d.</p>

            . I live opposite to the Britannia - the prisoner was servant there. On the 6th of November, between<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130036"></xptr>six and seven o'clock, I saw her coming out of the house; she met me on Keen's steps as I was going in with a bundle, to a lodger there; she had a black bonnet with light ribbons on; her apron was folded on her arm; it hit against me as I met her, and sounded like money in it. I went up to the lodger, came down, and Mrs. Keen had lost her money.</p>
               <p>JOHN KEEN. The prisoner came into our service on the 1st of November; I took to my bed on Wednesday, and on Saturday was informed of this robbery. I heard she was gone towards Leeds, and sent an officer after her - on the 6th of December I found her at Wiggan, in Lancashire - I got a constable; she was brought to me; I said,</p>
               <p>"What could you be about to behave as you have to me; what do you deserve?" she said,</p>
               <p>"I don't know what - I deserve hanging;" she pulled off her rings, and said she had bought them with my money, and had spent the rest in clothes, and riding about - she had but 5 s. 8 d. left.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Hill-house, Foreat-hill, Lewiabara—on Tuseday morning, 2d September, about half-past 7, I was at my second-floor window, my bedroom, and saw the prisoner in the road loitering about, looking at my windows—he moved out of my sight for a few minutes—about ten minutes afterwards I went down stairs, and found the dining-room door open, which leads from the dining-room into the hall, and the prisoner in the room, very near the window-cill—when he saw me he jumped out of the window into my garden, and from there into a neighbour's garden—I ran after his—by the time I got out he had got into the road—I called out, "Stop thief"—he ran nearly a mile, I should think, altogether—he was stopped—when I came up, I said, "You are the man that has been in my house"—I recognised him at once—he said that I was very ungrateful; that he was running after the fellow that I was running after—he was brought back—he came very reluctantly, and bolted off once, but we caught him again—I met a constable, and gave him in charge—when I got back I missed from my dining-room a plated tea-spoon, two forks, a pair of silver sugar tongs, and a salt-spoon—they had been on the breakfast table—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them—I can swear positively to them—I next saw them in the police-court, about a week afterwards—they were produced there by the constable.</p>

I live at Forest-hill, and am a gardener—on this Tuesday morning, I was at work in a kitchen garden in Weatwood-park, and saw the prisoner running—he ran into a place where there was no thorough<lb></lb>fare—I called to him to stop, but he took no notice—I told him there was no thoroughfare, but he kept on running—about two or three minutes, per<lb></lb>haps, after that, I saw the prosecutor running after him—the prosecutor asked me to run after him, and I and two other men did so, and caught him three fields off—no one was running but the prisoner and us when we stopped him—he said that he heard a gentleman call out "Thief" as he came by the house, and was running after the thief, and we were mistaken—I said, "You come back to the prosecutor, and he will very likely let you off if you are not the man"—I have seen the place where the property was found—the prisoner passed that spot—we brought him back, and gave him in custody.</p>

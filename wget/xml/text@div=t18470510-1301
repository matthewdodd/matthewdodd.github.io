On the 8th of Feb., at eight o'clock at night, I fastened up the shop—I was called by Harris about eight o'clock at next morning, and found the place broken open, and a quantity of leather fronts stolen—I had seen them there the night before—they were worth 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—none of them have been found.</p>

I live at Bermondsey—I know the prisoner very well—two or three months ago, I do not know the date, he came to my house and brought a bag containing a quantity of fronts, grafts, and Clarences—I said, "I see you have got work"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Where did you get it?"—he said, "From Mr. Batty, of Shoreditch"—I said, "I am glad of it, I hope you will keep it"—he went down stairs for five minutes, leaving the</p>

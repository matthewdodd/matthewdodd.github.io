On the morning of the 4th Oct., I was at the Jolly Sailor, in St. George's-in-the-East—I saw the prisoner striving to force his way in—I spoke to him, and requested him to go home—he did not, and I took hold of him to remove him from the door—he grasped me by the body—I turned him away, his foot slipped, and he fell in the road—he had a fiddle with him, which was broken, and he came up and stabbed me under the nipple of the left breast—he was making a second attempt, when 1 caught him by the wrist, and stopped him—this knife was taken from his hand—I was taken to the hospital, and remained there four days—I sup<lb></lb>pressed the blood by putting my hand against the wound—the surgeon probed it half an inch.</p>

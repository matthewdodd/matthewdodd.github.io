               <p>The last day of January, I saw the woman prisoner, by Wardour-street, with a handle of a quart pot hanging out, and I thought she had some more on the other side; she went into a house that was uninhabited, and sat down, and hid it, and then I saw her go to this cellar.</p>

               <p>I was informed there were some pot stealers in Wardour-street, and I went up, and I found the man prisoner concealed in the gutter, on the roof, he said he was going to the vault, and he heard a noise; he came down with me, the constable was waiting on the landing place going down; I said here is a place, and we went into the vault which is under the street, and I kicked over this pail; none of the pots were on the woman, nor near her; she was coming up when I went down; several people came and fetched their pots away.</p>

               <p>I was going by, and I saw some pattens at this man's cellar, to sell, I asked him the price, and they stopped me, and beat me, and ill used me, I have never been well since. I never stole any of the pots, and how they came there I cannot tell, I have three children, the gentlewoman that I work for was here all day yesterday, and the day before, I have washed and ironed there this four years: she lives in Castle-street.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, as to the prisoner Dubois, there does not seem to me any evidence under the circumstances of this case to affect him with the fact of stealing; the pots are found in his cellar, and though in general where things are stolen; and they are found in a man's possession, if he gives no account of them, it is presumed that he stole them, yet where there appears to be another hand, as in this case, it takes off that presumption; his offence is that of receiving.</p>
               <p>N. B. He was afterwards tried for receiving goods, knowing them to be stolen, and found guilty. (See the last trial of this sessions.)</p>

               <p>Q. Where was this? - A. In my room, she came to me, I cannot say the day of the month; I pawned it the same day she brought it to me at Mr. Marriot's; she told me it was her own property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give you any reason why she would not pawn it herself? - A.No, she said she was rather fatigued, and if I would take it she would pay me for taking it; I pawned it for three shillings; I gave the money to the prisoner immediately I came back, and the duplicate.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you pawn any thing else for her? - A. Yes, soon after that I pawned a gown.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after? - A. I cannot justly say the time, but it was in the course of the month she came and asked me if I would go and pawn a gown for four shillings; it was a stripe coootn gown; I asked Mr. Chandler four shillings for it; I took nothing else at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose name was that article pledged? - A.

               <p>Q. How came you not to pawn them in her name? - A. I have taken several things for people to pawn, such as house-keepers.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you pawn only for house-keepers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a Mrs. Jackson? - A. Yes; I lodged in the same house where Mrs. Jackson lives; and when I removed, the prisoner wished to live in my room; the prisoner made me a present of these tickets at that time.</p>

Yes; I laid them upon my mantle-piece, and she asked me and my husband to give her a few nights lodging, and she was for that few nights lodging with me near three months, and one day she and I had a few words, and I bid he to quit my apartment, and when I came home I found she was gone, and I looked upon the mantle-piece for the tickets, but could not find them, and three of mine were gone with them.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL HAMILTON sworn. - I am an officer: On the 1st of the present month I went to the prisoner's apartments, in John-street, New-road, near Lisson-green; I saw the prisoner lodging in a garret at No. 3; I told her my errand, and I searched her, the prosecutrix was with me, and I found a duplicate of a pair of gold ear-rings that referred me to Henshaw's, High-street, Mary-le-bonne, I think she said they were her own; I searched the room, and found two gowns, half a shawl, and some other small articles, which were claimed by the prosecutrix, and a cloak and a cap, that was all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Henshaw's shop for the earrings? - A. I did not go myself; I caused him to appear at the office.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Henshaw). Do you know the person who pawned the ear-rings with you upon the 26th of January? - A. No; but this is the duplicate; it is in the name of Frances Robins.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutrix). Look at that sheet - do you know that sheet to be your's? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any letters upon it? - A. None at all, but it is my own, work, I bought it and made it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that part of the things left in your drawers? - A. Yes, it was one of the articles.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the tea-spoon, gown, and curtains? - A. I can swear those are mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Now with respect to the cradle-quilt and piece of cotton, are these articles your's? - A. That is a piece of cotton belonging to the gown I have on, and the cradle-quilt is also mine.(Hamilton, the officer, produced a gown and several other articles).</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix, These are all mine.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Look at the ear-rings - how do you know them to be the same? - A. By the make of them; I have had them these twelve months.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200026"></xptr>Q. What is become of your brother, whom you left in charge of your apartments? - A. He lives in Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not bring him? - A. I had no orders.</p>
               <p>Prisoners defence. I was at the house of the prosecutrix three or four days with Mr. Clark, her brother, and he shewed me a paper, and said his sister had made every thing over to him, and in case he should be called on for rent, that he had toleration to sell every thing, and he asked me if I would go and pawn some things for him; I went and pawned a petticoat, and Mr. Clark, and his wife, pawned several things, to my knowledge; and the things I took to Mrs. Prince, I told her where they came from; and she said, she knew Mrs. Thomas very well indeed; I told her the circumstance that Mr. Clark had related to me concerning Mrs. Thomas making the goods over to him; and Mrs. Prince said, it was no matter if Mr. Clark did sell all the things, because his sister was such an infamous woman, and she deserved it. I never saw the drawers open; the ear-rings which that woman has sworn to are mine; I was with the Marchioness of Abercorn, as nurse to her ladyship, and I gave half-a-crown for them to Mary Stevens, one of the house-maids; I never could pawn them but for a shilling; I never was in the house one night, and I never took any thing out but when they were present; I have no more to say.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Prosecutrix.) Q. Now tell us about this paper that the prisoner has talked of? - A.That never was any thing of consequence at all; I had offered them my rent four times over; I told my brother if any body trouble you I will make the goods over to you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make over to your brother all those articles? - A. No, only a few things in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make over any of those things you have lost? - A. No.</p>

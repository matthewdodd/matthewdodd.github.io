                  </hi>. I am a butcher of Lillington. On Saturday afternoon, 30th Sept., I had in my shop four ribs of beef—I do not know the exact weight—I missed them about 6 o'clock in the evening—they had been lying on a marble stone inside the shop—any one could get them from the street by reaching over—I have a beer shop at the back, and the prisoner was drinking there, with others, from 2 till 4 o'clock that afternoon in the yard—there is no communication between the back of the premises and the butcher's shop; you have to walk through two private rooms—the prisoner had a small reticule basket with him in his baker's basket—I saw no beef in his basket—on missing my beef, I gave information to Road-knight, and on the same night, about half-past 10 o'clock, he brought the beef and the prisoner to my shop—I identified the beef.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Illingdon, near the prisoner, and am a postman. On the afternoon of 30th Sept, about 4 o'clock, I saw him at the back of Mr. Silver's house, and in the tap room—as I went home, the prisoner overtook me just through the little turnstile, with a basket on his shoulder, with something heavy in it—going across the field, I dropped some dog's meat which I was carrying, and as I stooped to pick it up, Jones turned and faced me, and I saw a large lump of beef between his arm and the basket.</p>

On 20th Sept., Mr. Silver gave me information, and I went to the prisoner's house, and found both doors locked—I waited till his wife came home, about 9 o'clock; she opened the door, and I searched the house, and in a cupboard up stairs found four ribs of beef—the cupboard was shut, but not locked—there was nothing else in it—that room had been previously let to a party who had left—I continued my search, and found the prisoner in a little place, eighteen inches square</p>

                  </hi>. I am a millwright, of Lillington.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 248.) On the evening of the 20th of December, about six o'clock, I saw the prisoners together at Battle-Bridge, going towards Pentonville—there was a cart by the side of the road, but no horse to it—they went and stood by the wheel of the cart, and then walked away to the Bell public-house, about thirty yards—then returned, and passed the cart on the opposite side of the road, about thirty or forty yards—they then returned to the cart, took something from it, and ran across the road together—they were together all the time—I saw Jordan put something under his coat—Davis passed me first—I caught hold of Jordan, close behind him, and asked what he had under his coat—he said he had nothing—I found the reins under his coat—I took him to the sta<lb></lb>tion-house—Davis ran away, and was taken afterwards—I am quite posi<lb></lb>tive of him—I have known him for three or four years.</p>

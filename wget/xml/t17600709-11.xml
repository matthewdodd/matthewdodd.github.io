               <p>Price Swancott. The prisoner was imployed to do bussiness for my wife. On the 14th of June I miss'd a blew waistcoat and shirt; I had intelligence she was in the round house for a quarrel; I went there, and asked her if she knew any thing of my waistcoat and shirt; she said she had pawn'd them, the waistcoat to Mr. Pell, the shirt in Russel street Covent Garden. I went and found them accordingly; I had known her a great many years, and never knew her to do the like before; she always bore a good character before.</p>

I would have trusted her with a thousand pounds; she has had an opportunity in my house to have taken things of value had she been so minded; I remember she was a little in liquor the last time she was at our house. Whether she took the things, or any body else, I know not.</p>

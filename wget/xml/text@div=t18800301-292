I am a builder, of 2, Addington Terrace, Brockley Road, Forest Hill—on the evening of 14th February I left my horse and trap outside the Bricklayers' Arms, Sydenham—I came out five minutes afterwards and they were gone—I did not leave them in the prisoner's charge—I do not know him and never saw him till he was in custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman P</hi> 265). On 14th February, about 8 p.m., I was on duty in Lordship Lane, Dulwich, and saw the prisoner driving a horse and cart—a man named Adams was in the cart with him—he was driving very rapidly, as if he was drunk, so I followed him to the Cherry Tree, where he was putting a nose bag on the horse—I said, "You are in charge of this horse and cart?"—he said, "No, the other man is; he has gone in to get some beer"—Adams came out, and I said to him in the prisoner's presence, "Are you in charge of this horse and cart?"—he said, "No, this man is," pointing to the prisoner—I said to Jones, "I shall take you in custody for being drunk, as I consider you have charge of the hone and cart as you were driving"—the other man went away, and I took the prisoner and the horse and cart to the station—on the way the prisoner threw away some papers, which a boy picked up and gave to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Forest Hill—I was outside the Bricklayers' Arms, and saw Pettit go in, leaving his horse and cart outside—I went in and had some drink, and when I came out I saw the prisoner by the house's side—he said "The horse is cold; I am going to give him a run up the road to warm him; Charley won't be able to go for some time," that is Pettit, "do you mind having a ride with us?"—I said "I don't mind"—he said "Jump up"—I said "Wait a minute, I will ask my wife and come back in a few minutes"—I did so, and then jumped up and drove with him from Forest Hill Station to the Grove Tavern, and then said "Turn round, Pettit will wonder where you are"—we were then three-quarters of a mile from where we started from—he did not go back—he said "Now I will go as far as the Grove Tavern—we passed the Grove, and I asked him to turn back, as he would get into trouble—we did not stop at the Grove—he said "We will drive as far as the Plough now"—we did so, and had a pint of ale there—that was two miles from where we started—he said "We will turn to Forest Hill again now," but instead of</p>

               <p>doing so he went straight ahead—I said "We are not going to Forest Hill, we are going away from it"—he said "I shall drive as far as the Cherry Tree now I am here"—that is quite half a mile from the Plough—we went to the Cherry Tree and fetched a pint of ale out, and two constables walked up and asked me if I was in charge of the horse and cart; I said "No"—the prisoner had the reins all the time—he appeared to have had some beer, but I do not think he was drunk—I did not feel unsafe through his driving.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was a stranger to me—I had no idea that anything was wrong—I did not think he was drunk—he did not drive fast—he might have been a little the worse for beer—he sat in the cart all right—I did not know whether he belonged to Pettit—I left my wife in the public-house.</p>

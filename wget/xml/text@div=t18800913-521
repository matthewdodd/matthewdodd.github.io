                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman A R</hi> 664). I was at the station on this day—I went with Inspector Pryke to the Victoria Road in consequence of a complaint having been made—I saw a van going in the direction of Sidcup—I saw Steventon and Smith sitting on the back part of the van, their legs hanging out; Steventon was tearing up some paper—the others were sitting in the front part of the van—I took Steventon and Smith into cus<lb></lb>tody directly; I told them they would be charged on suspicion with stealing a purse and ticket to the stores—they made no reply—the van was not searched till we got to the station, when other constables arrived and took the prisoners into custody—Goodson led the horse—Johnson became very violent when the Inspector took him, and I released Smith to assist the Inspector—I took Steventon into the station first, and then returned to the Victoria Road and apprehended Smith—all were eventually taken into cus<lb></lb>tody—two constables stayed with the van—they are here—the bottles were for vitriol, and the carboys are framework to put them in.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PURCELL</hi>. I searched Steventon; I found on him a small quantity of tobacco and a pipe and some cigarette papers—I gave it all up to the Inspector—Smith and Steventon walked to the station, but in custody, and not by themselves.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Some portion of the papers were found on the tailboard of the van, and some in front—if I have said "I saw Smith and Steventon getting into the tail of the van," it is a mistake; they were on the tail part—they could easily reach the bottles where the papers were from there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R</hi> 36). I was off duty when I saw the Inspector and the other constables coming up the Victoria Road with a horse and van—the prisoners appeared to be in custody—the van was drawn up at the station side door—the prisoners were taken inside—I remained with the van till Pryke came out—I saw him search the van—the van was under ay observation while the Inspector went in—no one went near it to touch it or put anything in it—I should have seen them if they had.</p>

Only the prisoners and the police were about—I did not say at the police-court several persons were coming along—that is a mistake—there might have been people about—I meant to say nine or 10 people were about when the van stopped at the door—they gathered round when the van stopped.</p>

It is not my habit to do more duty than is required of me—I did not go to the police-court on the two first occasions the case was heard—I made no report to the Inspector of what I had done—I knew the prisoners were charged—the Inspector did not say he wanted a man to swear he had watched the cart—he said I was wanted as a witness—he saw what I had done—I did not see any one sitting on bottles—I would not swear it—the prisoners all went in the station together in a heap—I would not swear no one was in the van when I watched it.</p>

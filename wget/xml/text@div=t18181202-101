            . The prisoner lives at Rumford. I got acquainted with him as I was coming to town. He said he could put me into a good thing, where I could pass money, and get a good bit of bread. He was to supply me with counterfeit money, to pass in the way of trade. I told Mr. Wood and Mr. Story. On the 22d of November I walked to town with him. We went to two public-houses, and then into Petticoat-lane. Martin then asked Hanchett<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020046"></xptr>if he had sold all his blackberries? He had told me when he introduced me to the man, he should tell him I was his brother, and had just come out of Maidstone jail, and was coming the queer. Martin made a sign to him. I asked the prisoner the meaning of it? He said it was to know if I was a nose, and his answer meant that I was a good fellow. After this, he and Martin walked together in conversation. When I got to the Gaff, which is a court where the Jews meet, Martin asked how many I wanted. I said 2 l. He served me. I asked the prisoner what I was to pay. He said 5 s. a score, and afterwards served Clarke and the prisoner with a score. Martin went across, and beckoned to us. After that we went to Rumford, to the Sun public-house. I paid four bad shillings for two pots of egg-hot. They attempted to get away. I stopped them, and the constable took them.</p>

               <p>WASEY STORY, ESQ. I am Under-Sheriff of Essex. Nicholls gave me information. I advised him to take those steps, as a great deal of bad money had been circulated at Rumford. I found twenty bad shillings on different parts of the prisoner's person.</p>
               <p>MR. C. E. POWELL (examining the money) - It is all counterfeit, of the same die, and has never been in circulation.</p>

I searched the apartments, and found a pair of silk stockings hanging wet on the line; I found nothing more there, but, after I had taken him, I searched his pockets, and found seven duplicates, two of them of some of the same property, and two others of Mr. Matthews's pledging. I went round to the pawnbrokers, to bring them forward to the examination, and then he was committed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Wilson—he Keeps the Cock public-house, at Walthamstow. On the 7th of February, in the morning, I was in my bar; and as I had for some time suspected that my till was robbed, I marked sixteen halfpence and six penny-pieces—I left, and went up stairs for two or three minutes, and heard the till rattle—I came down, and saw the prisoner, who was my servant, coming out of the bar in a great hurry to go up stairs—I told her she had no business up stairs, she had the pots to clean, and I asked her what she was going for—she said she did not know—I told her to come back, as I had suspected her a long time of robbing me; and I sent my son for an officer—during that time the prisoner went to the water-closet—I afterwards saw six penny-pieces found there, and one of them was one I had marked—this rum and bottle, and this pin, which is mine, were found in her box by the officer in my presence—I know this rum is mine, because that morning our rum was rather thick, as this is.</p>

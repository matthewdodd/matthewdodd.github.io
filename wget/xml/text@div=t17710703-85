               <p>William Biggs. I am a farmer and victualler, at Stanstead, in Hertfordshire. On the sixteenth of January, I sent two teams to London, with flour. My man brought me word that two horses were seized by two men and a constable, one from each waggon. Sweetman, Smith, and Howard, sent me a notice to meet them next day at the Swan, in Fetter-lane: this is the notice (producing it, it is read.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Biggs, Sir,</p>
               <p>Take notice, that unless you meet me at the Swan, in Foster-lane, No. 108. porsley at twelve o'clock, your horses will be condemed according to law.</p>

               <p>Jney 16, 1773.</p>
               <p>I went there, and found Sweetman, Smith, and Howard. I took two of my friends with me; I asked them who they were; they gave me their names; they shewed me the act of parliament, and told me my horses were forfeited. I asked them what they valued them at; at first they said, thirteen guineas; however, they came lower, till at last they asked four guineas; I throwed the four guineas down upon the table; Sweetman insisted upon two guineas more, and he refused one guinea being too light; my friend changed it; they took the four guineas: then a sort of an attorney they had there, drew up a kind of a preamble; that was a promise that I should not proceed against them afte rwards: my friend and I insisted upon going before a justice, which they refused; they wrote an order to the constable, and signed it with their three names, for him to deliver the horses; they called it a warrant. I went to Mr. Goulding, the constable, in the evening; he refused to part with the horses: we went before justice Wilmot; he said the constable had an authority to deliver the horses by that writing: I paid five shillings, and got my horses out, and sent them home.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. One was a mare, I think; of what value was that?</p>
               <p>Biggs. Seventeen pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what value was the horse?</p>
               <p>Biggs. Eleven pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you earnestly intreat them to do it; and tell them that the horses was not your own?</p>
               <p>Biggs. Yes; I did; but I desired to go before the justice, which they refused.</p>

            . I was with Mr. Biggs on the 17th of January, at Fetter-lane: I was a neighbour of his; I came up with intention to buy these horses, thinking they were forfeited, as I deal in horses: the prisoners, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030102"></xptr> another, not here, were for compounding it; were for going before a magistrate, and they were not willing to go any where. Mr. Biggs had no objection to go before the magistrate; he wished to go there, and would have met them at any hour in the day; they would not fix upon any time: we could have them go before Mr. Wilmot; they would not: Mr. Biggs threw down four guineas; they refused it: Sweetman would have two guineas more; I said, We will not give it, the horses shall be forfeited first; then they agreed to take four guineas, which I paid them.</p>
               <p>Q. from Sweetman. He said Biggs threw down the money; I understood Biggs before that his friend threw down the money.</p>
               <p>Court. No; he threw down the other guinea in the room of the light one he objected to.</p>

               <p>Bateman. No; I cannot read; it was a dirty looking fellow that wrote it, while we were absent.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Bigg was not present when this note was wrote?</p>
               <p>Bateman. No.</p>

               <p>Bateman. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they take the horses off?</p>

               <p>Bateman. Near the Bull inn, in the road; they stopped us as we were coming back empty; they said they had seen us with our waggon loaded: I don't know what they did: I saw Howard sign this paper for the delivery of the horses; they all three signed it: here are three witnesses saw it besides myself.

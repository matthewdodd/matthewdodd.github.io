                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 7, Tottenham-court-road—on the evening of 26th September, at half-past 10 or 11 I was at the Moss public-house close to the Euston-square station—I saw the prisoner there in his shirt sleeves; he was holding the door as I entered—I stood at the door and had a glass of gin, and waited for the ram to leave off—I went to the door, and he said that it was a very wet night—said yes; I am afraid it will not leave off; he said, "I think not; I live a long way from here, over the water, in the London-road, and I have never been on this side before"—I asked if he should ride or walk; he said that he should walk it—there were a great many people there; one of them was a stout fres<lb></lb>coloured man, a Scotchman, he was stooping overcome person who sat down—we remained speaking together 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour—the rain left off—there was another pot had and the stout man shared it—he and the prisoner went to my house; they remained there about a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes, and had a pot of porter—I told the prisoner that it was time for us to disperse as it was getting late; he left, the stout man re<lb></lb>mained in my room—I left the house by myself about 5 minutes after-wards, leaving the stout man in my room—when I got to the street door I saw the prisoner and said, "I thought you were gone home," he said "Not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185910240100"></xptr>
               <p>yet"—I saw a man and women at the foot of the stairs, and the prisoner spoke to them—I then saw the prosecutor standing on our door-step, with his hand on the rails; he asked me where I was going, I said, to the Ship public-house; he went with me, and the prisoner followed—I believe they had ale or stout there; the prisoner said that they might call for what they wished and he would pay for it; the prosecutor had a glass of stout to him-self, and I had a glass of brandy, and the prisoner had some ale, for which the prosecutor paid—we remained a few minutes, and the prosecutor and I left together, and went to the door; the prisoner and his mate followed—the prosecutor asked us if there was another house where anything could be got to drink; I said "Yes," and we went to the Beans; the prisoner and the stout man followed us—that is the man who I had left in my room—the prisoner had asked me if his mate was still in my room; I said, "Yes"—he said, "Tell him I want him," and I went in and brought him in his shirtsleeves—that was at the first public-house—when we got to the second public-house, he said he would not pay for anything there, because of the number of people that got round him, and I said, "Do not"—we left that public-house and went towards Tottenham-place; the prisoner and the stout man followed us a certain space behind, about as far as I am from the Judge; to the corner of Grafton-street, where the stout man seized the prosecutor by the throat—he threw him on the pavement, on his back, the prisoner fell on him, and I saw a watch and chain in the prisoner's hand; they then flew back immediately in the direction that we had come—the prosecutor laid insensible for a few seconds—I stood still for a few minutes; I could not speak, as I could hardly believe what had taken place—I called "Police" twice, and the prosecutor called out likewise—I left him there and went to look for a policeman—I did not see him again till I was brought to recognise the prisoner.</p>

               <p>subsequently returned, and about half-past 11, or a quarter to 12, I was at the end of Tottenham Court-road alone, looking for an omnibus—I saw Caroline Wells at the door of a public-house kept by Thompson; she asked me to treat her to something to drink—I gave some of the other persons drink as well—I saw the prisoner there; he was one of those whom I treated—there were two or three others with him—he and a stout man were together—I left that public-house; the young woman walked by my side—I then went to the Southampton Arms, and afterwards to the corner of Grafton street—I turned quickly round and the prisoner and another man were close to me—the other man seized me violently by the neck and garotted me, and the prisoner took my watch-chain and appendages—I was thrown down and became perfectly insensible—upon recovering myself I found my waistcoat buttons torn as they are now (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also lost a gold pin, but I think that was broken in the struggle, because the man's arm passed round me.</p>

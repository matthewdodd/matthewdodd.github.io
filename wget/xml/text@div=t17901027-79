I had a bay gelding wounded; I saw it the 19th of September; it was at grass; I kept it in a field near the house; I saw it between six and seven in the morning; I seldom missed a day seeing him; but I cannot positively say to a day; I observed part of the gelding's tongue hanging out of his mouth; a part he appeared to have gnawed entirely off; and the remainder hung in rags, occasioned by his having gnawed it: I sent for the farrier; the tongue was very much inflamed, and appeared to have been cut; but it was so swelled, I could not see whether it was cut or not.</p>
               <p>Did it bleed much? - It did not bleed then; the tongue was dead; there was no blood; I attended at different dressings of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270110"></xptr>the horse's tongue; the horse is alive now; the tongue was injured to a certainty; but I cannot tell how; the prisoner was my weekly servant.</p>

               <p>I am a farrier. I saw this horse the 19th of September, when Mr. Bond sent to me; part of his tongue hung out of his mouth, between two and three inches; and he could not get it into his mouth; and it was swelled, and mortified; it had been done, I suppose a week before; it appeared to have been cut with scissars, and had been dressed with vitriol water, or something; the other piece is getting found.</p>

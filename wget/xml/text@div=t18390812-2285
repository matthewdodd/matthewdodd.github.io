                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Morgan, of the Strand. On the 3rd of August, the prisoner came to receive some gloves for his father—he was standing in the shop—I was in the parlour—I saw a movement of his hand which led me to suppose something was taken from the counter where he stood—I went forward into the shop—he stood there with his hat in his hand, and a bag on the top of the hat, covering the open part of the hat—I desired him to wait a little while and he should be attended to, and desired him to put down his hat—he put it down on the ground on a stool sideways, so that it leant against the stool—the bag fell forwards, and I saw something there—I put my hand down, and took the piece of hand<lb></lb>kerchief out of his hat—I locked the door, detained him, and sent my son for my husband, who came as soon as possible, and he called in Lock, the policeman, who took him.</p>

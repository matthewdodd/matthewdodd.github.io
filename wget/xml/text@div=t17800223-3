               <p>When did you see the trunk in Piccadilly? - I think opposite James-street; I am certain I saw it after I passed Hyde-Park-corner.</p>
               <p>Did you find any of your things again? - Most of them.</p>
               <p>What had you in the trunk? - I cannot recollect particularly, there were stockings, breeches, and a number of things.</p>
               <p>How many pair of silk stockings? - I believe six or seven pair.</p>

               <p>Any shirts or stocks? - Six or seven,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230005"></xptr>hey were in the trunk at the time; it was fastened with two leather straps.</p>
               <p>Did you stop at all? - No, unless a little at the turnpike. I missed the trunk between St. James's-street and the Hay-market. Upon missing it I immediately stopped the chaise. The straps which fastened the trunk were cut.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner near the chaise? - No.</p>

               <p>Did you find any thing else? - Yes, an uniform coat, waistcoat, and breechees, which the justice gave up to Mr. Howorth. When we went in Barnett was not at home; in about ten minutes Barnett knocked at the door; I laid hold of him and brought him in; his shoes and stockings were very dirty; I asked him if he had any thing in his house; he said no, nothing but his own; I opened the drawers and found a stock with Mr. Howorth's name on it, and I found the coat, waistcoat, and breeches in an handkerchief. He then said somebody had left them there, for he knew nothing of them, and asked his mother and sister who left them; after that he said the persons who cut the trunk off were at a house at Temple-bar, if I would go and see for them. I thought there was no truth in that. I took the prisoner to Sir

               <p>Did you see what they had brought? - No, they had something under their arms; I did not see what it was.</p>

               <p>Was it a bundle, or box, or what? - I did not take any particular notice what it was; as I thought it was no business of mine I did not enquire. I went away that instant as they went in. I heard them ask if Barnett was at home.</p>

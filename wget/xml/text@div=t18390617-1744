               <p>Hill, London. The prisoner was in my employ for some time—I let his have money when he wanted it—he had a commission, and I made it up to 1002. a year—if his commission exceeded that he had it—it might have produced him 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; but if it did not produce him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I made it up to that—he travelled for me in this country and abroad—he ought not to have travelled for other houses—I had forbidden him to receive money for me for the last eighteen months—Mr. May is a customer of mine—on the 18th of March the prisoner told me he wanted a piece of black satin for Mr. May—I had not such an article—I got it for the purpose of the order—I gave it to him, to take it to Mr. May, to tell it to him—from half-past ten to eleven o'clock in the morning—no price was named—he knew it cost me 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard, and he was to get as much more as he could—Mr. May always paid cash on delivery to the person who carried the article—it was not the prisoner's duty to receive the money for this piece—he had received money on former occasions from Mr. May for goods—he was aware of May's practice, but I told him not to receive the money—he said, "I shall be over as soon as I can, and state at what pride I sold it"—he returned between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—I was not in the counting-house when he returned—I saw him about five o'clock—he laid Mr. May had agreed upon 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—I said, "That it less than you expected"—he said, "But I shall see him again to night, and get 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more, and let you know to-morrow, that you can make out the invoice" that was all that passed—he did not return—I did not see him till, I think, about the 7th or 8th of May, when he called at my counting-house for a letter, and was taken—before that I met one of his acquaintance in the street, in quite a different part of the town, and I communicated to that party that there was a letter for the prisoner—I gave him no reason to believe that this had been discovered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William May, a tailor, in Holies-street, Cavendish-square—he is ill. On a former occasion we had purchased some velvet of the prisoner, and we stated we wanted some satin—a few days before the 18th of March he brought a sample of satin with him, and asked Mr. May if he was willing to purchase a piece of satin—he said yes, provided he could bring it according to the sample, but he should prefer seeing it in the piece—the prisoner said he would bring it, and he came, I believe, on the 18th of March, and brought a piece of satin—he asked 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard, and my husband bid him 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he</p>

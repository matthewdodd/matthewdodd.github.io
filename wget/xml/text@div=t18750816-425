                  </hi>. I am a clergyman of the Church of England, residing at Marina, St. Leonard's—on 3rd of April this year I received this circular, marked A. (<hi rend="italic">This was headed</hi> "<hi rend="italic">Consolidated Exchange and Banking Agency, 8 and</hi> 9, <hi rend="italic">Gracechurch Street, London" offering to give advice with regard to the purchase of securities, and protect purchasers from fraud, and also to give them facilities for purchasing, by paying the amount by instalments</hi>). On the receipt of that letter I wrote the letter marked B, acknowledging it, and on the 8th April I wrote this letter marked C. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>):" 104, Marina, St. Leonards-on-Sea, April 8, 1875. Sir,—Thank you for your letter of yesterday. I shall be further obliged if you could let me know when the dividend is payable on the Egyptian 7 per cent. Khedive Loan, 1870 <hi rend="italic"></hi>; also how often drawings take place, and when the next is. I think it is a good plan to buy in when a dividend is near, is it so or not? The Egyptian, 1873, dividend is nearly due, I believe, which would be most profitable, 1872 or 1873? I shall be glad of further particulars about City and County Bank; is it under the Limited Liability Act? What were the shares orginally; how much paid on them; how long established, and all particulars; also the same about Wedgewood Coal and Iron. I don't see either in the <hi rend="italic">Money Market Review</hi> quoted. What do you think of Lima</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187508160030"></xptr>
               <p>Railway; to a holder of 5 per cent. Peruvian Stock, what would be your advice, to hold on or sell? I see Native Manure Company's shares rise: please quote your scale of brokerage on purchase and sale of Foreign Bonds and Stocks. What is your opinion of London, Chatham and Dover Ordinarys?<hi rend="italic"></hi>") I received this letter marked D, replying to my inquiries. I received this telegram F, dated 12th April, stating that he had bought five Egyptian Bonds, 1873, at 80 3/4, and requesting draft by next post to cover same. I wrote this letter on the same day. (<hi rend="italic">This enclosed a cheque on Sir Samuel Scott &amp; Co., for</hi> 403<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to meet the purchase of the five Egyptian Bonds.</hi>) The letter G enclosed a receipt for the amount remitted. (A <hi rend="italic">number of letters were put in and read, containing questions from the witness as to certain Companies and investments, and also pressing for the delivery of the bonds, with replies from the defendant</hi>) I expected the bonds by the next post, because I had paid for them and inquired whether they were purchaseable cum dividend, and upon the strength of that I sent my cheque—I looked for nothing more or less than the five Egyptian Bonds—I was no party to any interest for non-delivery—after receiving this letter of the 12th May, from the defendant, stating that he was compelled to carry over until the next settlement, the 31st May, I telegraphed to my solicitor, and then came up to town and saw. the defendant in the presence of Mr. Govett, my solicitor—I understand he is very ill to-day, he was on Sunday—we went to the prisoner's office to demand my bonds—I asked him why my bonds had not been sent—I pressed for the bonds, and my solicitor asked to see the note, which would have satisfied us that they had been purchased, but we could not satisfy our minds, except on one point, that they had not been purchased—the prisoner produced a piece of paper, but I did not look very much at it myself; I left it to my solicitor, and he informed me it was utterly valueless—I saw the amount 403<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the paper, which answered to the amount of the cheque I had sent—I believe this is the piece of paper. (<hi rend="italic">Head</hi>: "13th April, 1875, Sold to the Con<lb></lb>solidated Exchange and Banking Agency, five 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Egyptians-1873, at 80 3/4, 403<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. (signed) H. H. Wraxall &amp; Co.") I asked for the bonds, and the prisoner went away and said he would go and get them or see some gentleman—we waited for a long time, until we were tired, and went away—they 'told us that if we returned in two hours Mr. Hawkes would be sure to be there—we returned in two hours and he had not come back, we were told by Mr. Hawkes' employes—we asked for the money or the bonds, and a gentleman, Mr. Hanrott, who was his legal adviser at that time, recom<lb></lb>mended them to produce the money if they could not produce the bonds, and he wrote a letter to Mr. Hawkes and left it for him with that advice in it—Mr. Hanrott appeared to be advising the prisoner while we were there, and before the prisoner left—he was asked a great many questions by the prisoner—the prisoner did not come back, and we got neither the bonds or the money, and I returned home—on the 18th May I applied for a warrant against the prisoner, at the Mansion House, and advertised a reward for his apprehension—every means were taken to find him at his own house, and at his office—at the time I applied for the warrant, Mr. Hanrott, the prisoner's solicitor, and a gentleman as Counsel, were there—I afterwards received this telegram from the defendant. "Sir H. Wraxall writes, that bonds await our order; satisfactory apologies must be made, also inden<lb></lb>tification for expenses improperly necessitated"—I telegraphed to him that Mr. Govett had my full authority to receive the bonds—I had given him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187508160031"></xptr>
               <p>authority to receive them weeks before, and Mr. Govett did receive them; but I still thought it my duty to the public and to myself to continue this prosecution, and the prisoner was committed for trial by the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I considered it my duty to continue this prosecution, that was my own unbiassed opinion, I did not ask my solicitor even—I felt very much grieved about the whole case—it is a long time ago since I first began investing—I have not speculated, buying shares is not specu<lb></lb>lating—I have not been an investor in the public funds as long as I could wish, it extends over a period of thirty years—I generally ask the opinion of others, but I have found if I have gone upon my own it has been better than other people's, sometimes even better than respectable stockbrokers—on the interview of 13th May when Mr. Govett went with me I was asked who a certain person who was with me was—I said "Never mind who he is, he is a friend of mine," as I consider a policeman to be to a man who is in difficulty, as I felt myself to be—I did not even know his name—I wished to keep up his character as a detective—I don't think I said he was a personal friend of mine, I was in need and I considered him a friend in need—I don't believe I did say a personal friend: I was under excitement, going there—I considered I had lost a large sum of money—I did not say at the Mansion House that I introduced the detective as my personal friend, I contradicted it—I said he was a friend, I could,—not call him by his name because I did not know it—when the prisoner left on 13th May he did not give us to understand where he was going for the bonds—I don't think at that time I had heard Sir Henry Wraxall's name—he was going some<lb></lb>where, I won't swear that he said he was going to Sir Henry Wraxall—I am placed at disadvantage in answering these questions because Mr. Govett is not here, and upon that occasion he listened with professional ears, and I really 'don't remember—I think if I had known the detective's name I should have told him to keep it back—he was a detective, and it was better his name should not be known—the prisoner went away to get the bonds from someone or somewhere—I gave Mr. Govett authority to accept my bonds from the prisoner from the first, if he could get them—in my first telegram I said "Get my bonds"—before I saw the prisoner at all I telegraphed to my solicitor—I think it was on 12th May, the day before we called at the prisoner's office—I am not aware that Mr. Govett when the bonds were offered to him refused to accept them saying he had no authority from me, he certainly has never told me that because he knew that he had authority to accept them—I expected the bonds the day after I had sent my cheque—I went up to London because I was afraid that the bonds would not be delivered until the 31st of May—I expected them a month before—I had paid for them and they were due to me—I was under the impression that he could not deliver me the bonds at all—I was afraid before the 12th May that the bonds would not be delivered until the next dividend day—I received a letter stating that I should have to wait for the bonds until next divi<lb></lb>dend day—I went up to London because I wanted to get them the earliest day that I could—this prosecution was not continued because I and Mr. George Lewis were threatened with proceedings for the course we had taken with regard to Mr. Hawkes—I should have gone on with it under any cir cumstances and I told them so in the office—I was not threatened with any action—I had heard that Mr. Hawkes through Mr. Hanrott, his then attorney, threatened an action against me and Mr. Lewis, but it did not.</p>

               <p>influence my going on; there was my own case and many others—I should have been less than a man, if I had not gone on, after the letters I had received—I don't recollect that I telegraphed to Mr. Govett that I had heard that the bonds were ready to be delivered over on 1st June—I believe I received a telegram from the defendant and communicated with Mr. Govett to tell him to accept the bonds—I won't swear that it was on the 1st June because I really don't recollect—I had given-him authority over and over again before, that—I dare say I did communicate with Mr. Govett on 1st June to accept the bonds—I have got a memorandum "Received notice of receipt of bonds from Mr. Govett on June 3rd"—I paid for them on 12th April—I have no memorandum that I Telegraphed to Mr. Govett on 1st June—I last saw Mr. Govett on Sunday week, he spent Sunday with me at St. Leonard's—he was very unwell then—we had no conversation about this business at all—he was an old friend of thirty years, and spent Saturday and Sunday with me—I have not commu<lb></lb>nicated with him since he left me on Monday week—he has not been at these Sessions to my knowledge—I had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Hawkes, but it was not for holding over or continuing—I did not hold over or continue at all—I did not return what money I had from Mr. Hawkes, I wrote for an explanation—I don't recollect that at the interview at Mr. Hawkes's office Mr. Hawkes explained that he was put to a great deal of trouble by Sir Henry Wraxall holding over—I don't recollect anything of the kind passing—I saw a contract note similar to what has been shown me this morning Mr. Govett asked the prisoner if he had a contract note from Sir Henry Wraxall—he said "Yes" and he produced a piece of paper—I can't swear that he said that Sir Henry Wraxell had given him a great deal of trouble, but he would go to him and try and obtain the bonds—I won't deny it either, but I don't think Sir Henry Wraxall's name was mentioned at that time—I don't think the prisoner said at that interview that 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. had been paid for the non-delivery of the bonds—I had received a communication to that effect, but I don't remember that he said it at that interview—I won't deny it, but the impression on my mind was that all we could get was a general refusal of money and bonds—I am sure he did not say that as we had accepted the 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for non-delivery, he could not force the people to deliver over the bonds—he said he would go and try and get them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had not given him notice of my intention to come to London—I don't know how Mr. Hanrott, his solicitor, came to be there—I knew Mr. Govett had called there the day before—it was an arranged interview, that was it—Mr. Govett told him that he would meet them at a certain hour the next day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am conducting this prosecution on behalf of Mr. Hatchard and Mr. Cannon—Mr. Govett was examined before the Mag<lb></lb>istrate—I have received two telegrams addressed to his firm in King's Bench Walk with reference to his illness—on 18th May I applied for a warrant to apprehend the prisoner for fraud in connection with these bonds—his attorney Mr. Hanrott, and his counsel Mr. Cooper, were present to oppose the warrant being granted—Sir Robert Carden declined to hear either of them and granted the warrant—I then used every effort to appre<lb></lb>hend him, and finally being unsuccessful, I offered a reward for his appre<lb></lb>hension—I think that was about 31st May or 1st June—after the bonds had been delivered up, Mr. Sherwood, his present solicitor called on me to know whether we should persevere in the prosecution—I told him "Yes,"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187508160033"></xptr>
               <p>that I was perfectly willing if he pledged his word that the defendant should surrender, not to have him arrested if I could discover him meanwhile—I never was threatened by him or by anybody with any proceedings of any kind, neither was Mr. Hatchard to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I informed Mr. Sherwood that I had receive 1 a telegram <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Mr. Hanrott saying "Take your own course, my client will take his;" and I also informed him that I had communicated with Mr. Hanrott by letter, and told him to tell me where the prisoner was, that he might be apprehended, and whether he would surrender him; but I declined to allow the case to be settled in any way by the delivery of the bonds—I cer<lb></lb>tainly did not understand that Mr. Hanrott was threatening an action in respect of the advertisement of the warrant after the acceptance of the bonds by Mr. Govett—I think the advertisment appeared the day before the acceptance of the bonds—it only appeared once, and I think it was the day before the bonds were delivered up—I think it was on the 1st June the defendant telegraphed to Mr. Hatchard the bonds were ready to be delivered over; the advertisement was sent to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper on 1st June with<lb></lb>out any knowledge of the telegram; Mr. Hatchard residing in the country the telegram was sent up to me—on 2nd June the advertisement appeared, and on the 3rd the bonds were delivered up—T did not certainly understand that Mr. Hanrott was intending an action—I understood the phrase "my client will take his course "as a sort of threat that it was better to leave him alone; however Mr. Hatchard would not let him alone—I appeared at the police-court for Mr. Hatchard first, and I think it was on the third occasion Mr. Cannon appeared—you opposed that charge being taken before a summons had been taken out—Mr. Cannon said he had come from Brighton, and the Lord Mayor ordered an information to be filed, and it was filed and proceedings granted—it was not the act of the Lord Mayor, it was your act—I think he would have heard it at once, but you opposed it.</p>

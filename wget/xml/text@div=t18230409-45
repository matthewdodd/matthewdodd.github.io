On Monday, the 24th of February, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I went into the front room on the ground floor, and found the window open - I had been there about half-past three o'clock; it was then shut. My father was at home from three to five o'clock. There is no fore court; the window opens to the road - I missed a cloak, a silk handkerchief, and a shawl, which were lying on the table at half-past three o'clock; it is a sash window, and could be thrown up from outside. I saw the property again on the Wednesday in possession of the officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was you last person in the road - A. Yes. The window was shut quite close. My mother and I were sitting together, and my father up stairs.</p>

            . I live at Hackney. On the 24th of February, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner jump over a hedge into a field, where I was, with a bundle of things; he ran towards Margaret-street, towards town. I followed and saw his face. When he got up to the canal, I saw him throw the things in - I took them out, and delivered them to Algar afterwards, and gave an alarm. He was brought back in a moment - I secured him. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How far was I from you - A. He passed close by me - I was cleaning the ditch out. I saw his face plainly, and called to him to stop; but he would not. When he was brought back, he said the handkerchief that contained the things belonged to him. I pulled them all out of the canal directly, and saw him knocked down.</p>

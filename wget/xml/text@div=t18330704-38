             is the landlord, and lives in the house - I rent my room of him - on Whit Sunday I left my room to go into the country - I left my room door locked, and took the key with me - the prisoners at that time lived there; I returned on Friday, the 30th - I found my room locked; I discovered a band of my gown lying on the floor before I had been in the room ten minutes, and I missed various articles. I have recovered nothing but a piece of silk; I missed six silver tea-spoons, some brooches, a pair of sugar-tongs, two sovereigns, three half-sovereigns, twelve shillings in silver, one South-sea shilling, a fourpenny piece, a penny silver piece, and other articles - the prisoners were not living in the house when I returned; I lost a piece of silk which I have got back, it was in my drawer when I left the room (looking at it) this is mine, and this part of a necklace is mine, and this pin; they have been in Prendergrass' possession - I saw them in my drawer on the Saturday night - I had bought the silk for a bonnet, there was a yard and a half of it. The beads and pin were made a present of to me by a lady some years ago - I bought the silk of Harriett Jessup.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. And where did she get it from? A. She had it from the female prisoner, I heard her say so; the street door is left open at times; I don't know the name of this silk, it is a common colour - I know it is mine by the length, which is a yard and a half, and here is a piece of a pattern of it - this piece was cut off to make it even, on the Friday before I went out - I dont know it by anything else; I never saw Mrs. Jessup with any more of this silk - I don't know anything about any other part of the silk - I never saw any of the silk in the prisoners possession I am certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you and Mrs. Jessup and the female prisoner, have not all been together, when she has been in possession of a great deal more of the same silk? A. No;

            . I belong to the Lambeth-street Police Office. I know the prisoners - I went to Newcastle-court, Strand, on Wednesday the 5th of June, in consequence of information of Willis, and another being there,(a female) I found them there - the prisoner is the female; it is a common brothel - I knocked at the room door - I did not see the man then, for he refused admittance; I descended down the next flight of stairs, and saw him at the window; I asked his name, he said Hutton; I went up stairs again, and threatened to use violence at the door, and then he let me in - the female prisoner was in bed; I found this yard and a half of silk, some pearl beads, and part of a gold pin in a chest of drawers among their other wearing apparel - I brought them away with all the other things; I produce the beads and gold pin, as well as the silk, they have never been out of my possession.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the part of the pin in a state capable of being identified? A. I should think not - nothing is more common than these beads.</p>

            . I am the wife of Joseph Jessup. Allen lived at our house, and so did the two prisoners; they are not man and wife, but lived together; Mrs. Willis owned he was not her husband; they left the house on the 29th of May; I did not see them when they left; they had paid their rent on the Sunday, and I did not know they were going till after they were gone - nor where they were going to - I know this silk - I first saw it about the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040051"></xptr>24th of April; I saw it in possession of the female prisoner, she brought it down to me; I had made her a dress of the same colour, and had that instead of money; and I sold it to Allen on the 25th of May - I have a piece of the same sort here, which I cut off before I sold it to Allen; I cut it off to make it even, a yard and a half - this is it, and here is the piece I cut off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you in the habit of acquaintance and friendship with Mrs. Willis or Jones? A. No otherwise than as a lodger - I first saw the silk about the 24th of April, she brought it down to me - Allen was not with me - the silk was in a whole piece then; Allen did not see it in the whole piece; she knew the prisoner had a dress like it, and she heard me mention that the prisoner had a whole piece; she never saw it, not to my recollection, but I am not sure - my husband is a carpenter, I am a dress maker, but don't follow the business; I made the dress for Mrs. Willis; I did not ask where she got the silk; she told me her husband had taken it out of pawn - I did not think it an odd way of paying me - she left quite on a sudden, without my knowledge - nothing was lost in the house before they came there, I am sure - I was never charged with taking other people's wearing apparel.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH JESSUP. I am landlord of the house. Allen went out on Sunday the 26th of May, and returned on the Friday about six o'clock in the evening; and about five minutes after she called my wife up, and we found she was robbed - the prisoners had gone on the Wednesday - I tried all the keys belonging to the locks in the house, and found the key of the prisoners' room-door would open Allen's door, but no other key would do it - I had seen about a yard and a half of silk the week before Whit-Sunday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Have you ever said you would try to get the prisoners transported for fourteen years? A. Not to the best of my knowledge, I will not swear positively.</p>

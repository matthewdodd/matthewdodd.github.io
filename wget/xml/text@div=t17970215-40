               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say to this? - A. He said he bought it of a man with a blue coat; the haunch hung there in my shop about half an hour before I met him; I saw it before I went down to the farm; I am certain it is my haunch, there is no mark upon it, I know it by my cutting; I should know it if there were an hundred; I am positive it is mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You say you know it to be your haunch of mutton by the cut? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I have no doubt of your being a skilful butcher, but may not any man cut it like you? - A. I cut it to my satisfaction, I know it is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. That you say; but are you sure you are not mistaken? - A. I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. May not another man cut it like that? - A. I am sure it is mine.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150066"></xptr>Q. Answer my question? - A. I shall if I think it necessary.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you do or not, you shall answer it, - I ask you whether another man may not cut it like that? - A. I know it is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. If you think that sort of answering will gain you credit you are mistaken. - Do you think another man may not cut it like that? - A. He may do it better.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you think another man may cut it like that? - A. He may.</p>
               <p>Q. As far as that is cut another may be cut like it? - A. It may.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no other marks to swear to it, for knowing it to be your haunch of mutton, than the manner in which you cut it? - A. Yes; it is the manner.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no mark upon it? - A. It is my haunch of mutton.</p>
               <p>Q. Answer my question? - A. I shall if it is reasonable.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't swear that nobody cuts mutton like you? - A. I will not swear for any body else, I will swear for myself.</p>
               <p>Q. I should like to know what you do swear to? - A. I will swear it is my mutton.</p>
               <p>Q. But, Mr. Wright, all these are matters in which people may be mistaken with the best intention, but the Jury who are trying that man's guilt must judge of your knowledge; don't you think a man may cut mutton like that? - A. I don't believe there was another haunch of mutton within five miles of the place.</p>
               <p>Q. I will not ask you another question after that answer? - A. If you do, I will swear it is my mutton.</p>

             sworn. - I keep a public-house, and am a constable at Edmonton: I know nothing more about this than that the prisoner had a black pudding and two pints of beer at my house, one while I was out, and another after I came home; he came to my house about half after one o'clock, and staid two hours; he left my house about half after three, or near four.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any mutton with him then? - A. No; I don't know what became of him when he left my house, I never saw him afterwards till he was in custody the next morning, when I took him before the Justice; I don't know what o'clock he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. How far do you live from Wright's? - A. About a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have a wife and four small children; I bought this mutton about a stone's throw from the public-house where this constable lives, by a wheeler's-shop, by one Mr. Coleman's nursery; I bought it of a man who had a long blue coat on.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who said, that while he worked for them they believed him to be an honest man.</p>

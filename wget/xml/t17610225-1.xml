            . On Tuesday the 17th of this instant, I was coming from St. Paul's Church-yard; and just after I past where <placeName id="t17610225-1-crimeloc3">Ludgate</placeName>

I put my hand in my pocket, and missed it; and said, I had. He said he saw a person take it out of my pocket, and we might apprehend him, if I thought it proper. Accordingly he went and brought the prisoner's companion to me. I kept him, while he brought the prisoner; and said, he picked my pocket; and as they were both standing together, near the wall, I saw the handkerchief lying between them.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell from which of them it fell?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, I cannot. I took it up. [Produced in court, and deposed to.] We secured the prisoner, and carried him before my lord-mayor, and he was committed. We inadvertently let the other go. The prisoner, before my lord, denied the fact.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you your handkerchief last.</p>
               <p>Harris. I had it, I know, not two minutes before.</p>

            . Last Tuesday was se'ennight as I was going down Ludgate-hill, I observed the prisoner at the bar, and another man, walking along; the other man was a little behind him; I had followed them a good while before. Just as they got beyond the place where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176102250003"></xptr> Ludgate stood, the people were pretty thick; the last man was close to the prisoner; I was very near them; I saw the prisoner at the bar put his hand to the prosecutor's pocket, and in an instant turned about, and gave something to the other man. I cannot say I knew what it was. They immediately retreated to the wall, and went up a little alley. There I saw them consulting and laughing together. Then I went and overtook the prosecutor, and told him what I had seen; and said, if he would step back with me, I would shew him the fellows. He went with me to the alley. I laid hold of the other person, and delivered him to the prosecutor; and after that I got hold of the prisoner, as he was walking off towards the end of the Old Bailey. Just as we brought them close together, the handkerchief was down on the ground between them. I cannot say that I saw it fall, but I am very certain it was not there before; it must have been trampled about by the many people that were there, if it had. Mr. Harris took it up, and said it was his own. Then we took the prisoner before my lord-mayor, and through inattention let the other go off. Before my lord he denied knowing any thing of the matter, and said he was a bricklayer by trade.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was coming from my work, my master had given me a little bit of a holyday, to go to a club in Monkwell-street. I came through Cripplegate, and up Wood-street; and walking down Ludgate-street, I stopped to make water just by the end of the Old Bailey. They laid hold of me, and said I had got a handkerchief. I said I would go any where with them. There was another man that they stopped; they let him go, and stopped me. They took up a handkerchief that lay against the wall. I did not know what it was.</p>

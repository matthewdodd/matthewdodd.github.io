               <p>Laay Mayo. On the 18th of July, about nine o'clock, I left a box at Mr. Cartier's containing the things mentioned in the indictment; the box was locked and wrapped up in flannel, I have the key now in my pocket; I desired Mr. Cartier to bring me some pack thread to tie it, he did; I asked him for some wax; he helped me to seal the box; I gave it him, and begged he would take care of it; he asked me what it contained; I told him papers of consequence; he said, I suppose papers relative to your law suit; I replied, they are papers of consequence, and take care of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where the box was deposited?</p>
               <p>L. Mayo. I cannot say; I think near the closet.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the contents?</p>
               <p>L. Mayo. There were twelve bank notes of 100 l. each, two bank notes of 50 l. each, and 200 l. in small notes, but of what sums I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any of 10 l.?</p>
               <p>L. Mayo. I believe there was, but how many I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your Ladyship lose besides?</p>
               <p>L. Mayo. A gold chased case to a watch; there was near twenty pounds in crowns, half crowns, shillings and sixpences of particular coins; there was near 300 guineas in guineas, about 20 l. in quarters and half guineas, and six thirty-six shilling pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your Ladyship remember where you received any of the notes?</p>
               <p>L. Mayo. I received of Walpole and Co. four bank notes, value 100 l. each, on 21st of April, 1769, and six bank notes, 100 l. each, from Mr. Batson, on 15 March, 1769; there were two notes of 100 l. each, that I have forgot where I received; and there were two notes, 50 l. each, which I had from the bank, but they could not give me the numbers.</p>

            . On Wednesday, the 18th of July, Lady Mayo brought a box to me; I put it in a closet between my bed-chamber and a parlour on the ground floor, in the presence of her Ladyship.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see it last, before you missed it?</p>
               <p>Cartier. I put it in the closet about nine o'clock; I saw it when I went to bed, about eleven; it was wrapped up seemingly in an old blanket; in the morning about six o'clock, or thereabouts, perhaps before, I heard my maid cry out; I started up and asked what was the matter? she said, You are ruined and undone!<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177010240024"></xptr> You are robbed! I jumped up in my shirt and went to the parlour, there I found the cup board was broke open; at the bottom of the stair-case I found this quilt, which had been cut open; and there was a flannel petticoat (producing them) they were the quilt and piece of flannel the box was wrapped up in; and there was the sheath of a carving-knife with a fork in it, upon he quilt; the knife was not in it: I went down into the kitchen, and there I found the box broke open, and some papers, which I suppose the things had been wrapped in, were scattered about the kitchen; the contents, whatever they were, were gone; I suppose the box was forced open by running a knife, or some such thing into it; my house was broke open; the rails before the house were broke open, and the pin of the kitchen window was either broke or taken away; the shutter was forced open, and the help of my kitchen door was taken off.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you put the box in a closet between your bed-chamber and the parlour?</p>
               <p>Cartier. Yes; I lay in that bed-chamber; there is a little passage or closet between the parlour and the bed-chamber.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the box was locked?</p>

               <p>Lyon Alexander. I live in Wormwood street, by Bishopsgate-church, near London-wall.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg the favour of your Lordship to order Jones out of court, whilst this witness gives his evidence.</p>
               <p>Court. Certainly, if you request it.</p>
               <p>(Jones is ordered out of Court.)</p>
               <p>Council. Give an account to the court upon what occasion you first saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Alexander. About twelve or thirteen weeks ago, Jones came to my house on a Sunday; he said, how do you do, Mr. Alexander? I said, how do you do? he was dressed in mourning; he said he had an aunt lately died in Oxfordshire, that had left between three and four thousand pounds between him and his brother; he said he had took a public-house by Red-Lion-Square; I asked him to lend me five guineas to buy some things with; he said here is a guinea for you, and gave me a guinea; will you come down? my brother is standing at the corner, but don't take any notice of him, and he will take no notice of you; but walk up and down, said he, and take no notice, I will speak to my brother, and then I will give you a glass of wine; I saw his brother, the prisoner, waiting in the street; he went and spoke to him; then he came to me, and asked me to drink a glass of wine; I went with him to the White Hart Tavern; that was about eleven o'clock; it was near sermon-time, the door was just going to be shut; the waiter said we must make haste; we called for a bottle of red wine, and drank it up between us as fast as we could; he made me drink most of it; then we took a walk; he said, let us go and see the two men hanging in chains upon Bow Common; we went there; there was nothing more passed then. On the Sunday following he came to my house again; he said he had spoke to his brother about lending me five guineas, but he would not do it, but he would give me a moidore; he said, I keep a public house; don't make yourself strange; call now and then, and have a pint of beer, and eat a bit of bread and cheese: I called once or twice, and drank with him; some time after that, Jones came to me, and asked me if I would buy a parcel of bank notes; I said I would go and enquire for a purchaser; I went down to one Hart, one of our people, at Wapping, who kept a shop, half a silver-smith's, and half a shop shop; I asked him; he said he would buy all there was; I went and told Jones of it; I asked him how many there were; he said six hundred pounds, and a ten pound; he said, do you think the man has got money enough? I told him yes; he said he had not got them now, they were out of town; he asked me to go with him for them; when we had walked about two miles, we got a lift for seven or eight miles in a post-chaise; when we had walked about a mile and a half, we came to a field-gate about half a mile from Welling; Jones said, we will stop here; in about ten minutes a country dressed man came up and asked him how long he had been there; he told him ten minutes; he bid him come into the field under the hedge, and he would give him the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177010240025"></xptr> things; they went and sat upon the grass; he took them out of different pockets; there were five or six small parcels done up in rags or paper nes gave me three parcels to put into my waistcoat pockets; the man did not stay three minutes; Jones and I came home together, and I gave him the parcels; he bid me call at his house in the morning; I did; and from there we went to Wapping; I asked Jones what I should have for my trouble, if he sold the bank notes; he said, let him tell them for what he would. I should have sixpence in the pound of what he sold. One Charles, a dyer, went in the coach with us; he did not know our business; we left him at a public house. When we came to the house, they desired us to go up stairs, which we did; Hart asked to see the bank notes; I can't be positive what Jones asked for them, but he said, I will give you three hundred pounds for the six hundred and ten; Jones refused that; then he offered 300 guineas, and Jones agreed to it: he went into a little room and brought the money to him out in bags, 100 l. at a time; then Jones offered him the diamond ear-rings, and asked twenty-four or twenty-five guineas for them; the man bid him ten; he said he would not take that, and he put them in his pocket again. I forgot to tell your Lordship, that when I went to ask the man if he would buy the notes, he bid me not tell him that he belonged to the shop, but that he was a Dutch captain. The next day I called upon Jones; he gave me 15 l. that is six hundred sixpences; the Jew that bought them gave me a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Jones give you that money openly before the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Alexander. No; he told me his brother said he gave me five pounds too much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing of that sort to you?</p>
               <p>Alexander. No; he bid me call again; I did, and there the prisoner and Jones were together; Jones gave me the ear-rings; he said, take them, and let the Jew have them; I carried him ten guineas for them; then he gave me a large piece of gold, foreign coin, he said he would have five guineas for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what piece it was?</p>
               <p>Alexander. No; it was foreign money; I got six pounds for it; the Jew told me it was a six pound fifteen shilling piece, so we were to have fifteen shillings a piece. There was also a pinchbeck watch, and a gold case; the outside watch-case was gold, chased. I went to Jones's house, and whilst Jones was called away, the prisoner said, I have three or four hundred pounds worth of bank notes; I will give you the same for disposing of them as my brother has done; I said, very well; he bid me not mention it to his brother; he said, I know where you live, I saw you come by that day my brother was with you, I will call upon you; he called the next day, or the day after that, and brought three notes of 100 l. each; I asked him to go with me as his brother did; he said I don't care to be seen by the man; he went to the White Bear near the house, and waited for me; the man gave me 150 guineas for them; the prisoner bid me give him the money under the table, which I did; and then as we came over Tower Hill he gave me seven guineas; he said the money comes to seven pounds ten shillings, but we shall not stand for three shillings; he bid me meet him in a day or two at the Two Blue Posts in the Hay-market, about four o'clock; I went there in a coach from home; I was not five minutes in the house before the prisoner came in; he said he would take a coach, and give me the note in the coach; he bid me bring him the money in two or three days; we went into the coach, and he gave me the note; when we had rode about two hundred yards, he got out; I thought I could get more for the note; I went and asked another Jew if he knew any body that would buy a bank note; this was on Tuesday; he and another Jew brought a gentleman to buy the note; it was Mr. Maddox; he asked to see the note; I told him I had not got it then, I should have it on Friday; he said, don't he afraid, I have got money, and pulled out a purse of money; the two Jews came again; the name of one was Harry, the other Marks; I gave the gentleman the note, and he put down seventy pounds; he said he had no more money about him; I gave the two Jews three guineas each; the prisoner came to my house on Sunday, and said, I thought you would have brought me the money; I told him it had been ready ever since Friday; I gave him forty-seven guineas and a half, and half a crown, which made fifty pounds, the price the rest sold for; I had nothing then; he threw down half a guinea for the children; a relation of mine,

               <p>Jones. I will. On Thursday morning, about twelve weeks ago, when I was a-bed, the prisoner came and knocked at my window; I live in Hackney road; I lie upon the ground floor. I got up, and let him in; then he told me he had got a prize; he opened them in my room, to the amount of 1000 l. but not all in hundreds, and there was about 150 l. in guineas, 16 or 20 l. in 5 s. 3 d. piece, I can't positively say the number of them; there were also crowns, half crowns, and shillings; there was a chased gold case to a watch; a pinchbeek metal watch, some plate, and a pair of diamond ear-rings; he told me he got them somewhere by Leicester-fields, I think he said at a prisoner's. I went to Monmonth-street, and bought a suit of black, the prisoner bought nothing there; after that, at the bottom of the street we bought some shirts and silk stockings; then we went to Holborn; there we bought a hat and hatband a piece. I parted with him in Holborn, and went home; there were two or three, men at the door that I was rather dubious of. I went to the butcher's in Bishopsgate-street; I went to buy something for dinner; while I was in the butcher's shop I saw the men pass by; they turned back again; I was afraid of them; I went to my sister's, and sent home to know if any body had been there; I found there had not. On Thursday my brother and I dressed ourselves in mourning; we look a coach in Cheapside, and went to the General

Bank note; we had 10 l. in cash, and a draught of about 32 l. 14 s. it was 12 l. odd money. From there we took a post-chaise to the George at Aylesbury; there we changed a 100 l. note. We took a post-chaise and four there to Thame; there we changed a 100 l. note. We took a chaise with four horses to the Crosses in the corn market Oxford, there we changed a 100 l. note; from there we went to Abingdon, I can't remember the inn; there we changed a 100 l. note; from there we went to Benson; they could not change a 100 l. note there; I asked them to give the post-chaise boy an order to change the note at the next inn, which he did, and we received the money.

From thence we came to London; that was on Friday night; we bid the post-chaise boy drive us to the first coach in Piccadilly: we took a coach to Shoreditch church. When we came through the bar at Shoreditch, we heard the mail was robbed; we had agreed to go out the next day to change the rest of the notes, but upon hearing this we thought it not safe; we lay that night at my house in Hackney-road.

             came to town; he said he was uneasy, and should be glad if we would fetch the things away. On Monday Alexander and I went to fetch them; he brought us the things about half a mile this side Welling. I had agreed on the Sunday before to sell the notes to Alexander; I went with Alexander next Sunday to sell the notes; we had then to the value of 610 l. I sold them at Iron Gate to a silversmith, I believe the man was, for 300 guineas.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177010240027"></xptr>Q. Was the silversmith a Jew or a Christian?</p>
               <p>Jones. Alexander told me he was a Holland merchant. Alexander was to have 15 l. I carried the notes and the pair of diamond ear-rings in my waistcoat pocket; the house was shut up so dark that I could hardly see my way up stairs. A woman at the bottom of the stairs spoke to the Jew, I suppose in Dutch; I went up stairs; the man was in a sailor's dress, with trowsers and a jacket on, and his hat flapped over his face; he spoke to Alexander in some foreign language. Alexander told me afterwards, he asked who I was; I gave him two 100 l. notes, and he fetched 100 guineas in a bag out of the next room. He fetched another 100 guineas, and I gave him two 100 l. notes. I gave him 210 l. for the last 100 guineas. I left Alexander with him, as he wanted to see if he could not get something more for his trouble. I told Alexander to come to me next morning for his 15 l. which he did; I gave him 15 l. and 6 s. over. The man offered me ten guineas for the ear-rings; but I would not take it. I asked him, I think, 30 l. I had 80 l. in draught notes; I asked him if he would buy them. He advised me to born them for fear of the consequence. I received one of the draughts at Lewisham, and all the rest, I believe, at Oxford, and on the road, in change out of the bank notes. Alexander asked me afterwards if I would sell the ear-rings. I told them to him for eleven guineas, but he paid me but ten for them. because he said he had but ten. I sold the gold and the metal watch to Alexander.</p>
               <p>Q. There were some guineas, moidores, half crowns, and some bank notes seized at your house; whose were they?</p>
               <p>Jones. Part of them were my own money, about 20 l. the rest was part of what my brother gave me for my trouble, about a fortnight before I was taken up. There was a 30 l. bank note I gave cash for to a neighbour; there were six or seven moidores and eighty guineas; there were some crowns and half crowns.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the numbers of any of the notes you changed upon the road?</p>
               <p>Jones. There was No. 117, 118, 119, and 120, or 200, that I am sure of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what letters?</p>
               <p>Jones. I do not; I intended to set down every number, but I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the note you changed at Maidenhead Bridge a 20 l. or 100 l.</p>
               <p>Jones. A 20 l. I am positive.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Jones. He was an apprentice to a barber; he used to follow smuggling with Mr. Mattison.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the things seized at your brother's house?</p>
               <p>Jones. Only some handkerchiefs, which he said he had bought.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whose service he has lived in?</p>
               <p>Jones. He lived with Mr. Keene, the architect; he came there when I went away; it may be three years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he live afterwards?</p>
               <p>Jones. I did not see him for a year: I believe I have seen him at Mr. Mattison's.</p>

            . I live at Maidenhead; I am Father to the last witness. Two young men in mourning came to my house; I believe my wife changed a Bank note for them. I don't recollect their persons. They had a chaise with four horses to the Rose and Crown at Hounslow.</p>

               <p>Mr. Maddox. I am a broker. Alexander came and asked me on the 5th of September if I would buy a 100 l. Bank note; that he could get it for 70 l. I suspected it was stole out of the mail. I told him if he would call upon me in the afternoon. I would give him an answer. I went to Sir

            's, my banker, for advice; I learnt that Lady Mayo had been robbed of some Bank notes. Her ladyship gave me the number of her notes, and requested me if the more appeared to be one of her's to buy it. Alexander came to my house; I put him off till next day whilst I obtained the numbers of the notes of Lady Mayo. I went to Duke's Place; he and another Jew came and said they had not got the note then, but I might have it in the afternoon or next day. I found they were afraid of me; they seemed to dispute whether I had the money; I shewed them the money. I went with them to a back room in the King's Arms alehouse; I laid down 70 l. Alexander bid the other man tell it; then Alexander took the note out of the knees of his breeches, and gave it me; this is the note. (producing it) it is K 292, Jan. 2, 1769, value 100 l.</p>

            . I sealed the box in two or three places; my seal remains very plain. We found in a bag at Jones's house 80 guineas and six moidores in an old cannister, ten crown pieces, and seventeen half crowns, at the prisoner's lodgings in the Hay Market. We found in one box ten guineas, which belonged to

               <p>Q. Can you recollect the very words?</p>
               <p>Clay. He said he did break the house open himself, and did commit the robbery himself. I then asked him if Jones was concerned with him; he said, No; not any other person.</p>

               <p>What the last gentleman said is very false; they said to me as I was coming in the coach to Newgate, that if I would confess I broke open the house, they would admit me an evidence. I said, I could not say what I did not know, for I knew nothing of the robbery. They asked me if Jones knew any thing of it; I said, No; no more than I do.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Clay. Was any thing said to him about being admitted an evidence?</p>
               <p>Clay. It is not true, my Lord.</p>

               <p>- Quin. I have known the prisoner six months; he is a quiet sober young man. I went to Mattison's to buy goods; I believe the prisoner was in partnership with him.</p>

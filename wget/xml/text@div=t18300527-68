On the 28th of April I received 13l. 9s. at the pay-office - I went that afternoon to the White Swan, Ratchiff-highway, and saw the prisoner there; John Wiggan was in the house; the prisoner wanted me to buy some black-lead pencils of him - I told him I did not want such things; I went home between four and five o'clock, and slept till half-past nine, then got my supper, and went to the White Swan again - I got there about ten; I found the prisoner there, and another in his company - the prisoner came to me again, and asked if I was not going to have some pen-knives and pencils; I said I wanted no such things - I staid there about a quarter of an hour, and, between ten and eleven o'clock, came out to go home with my shipmate (Wiggan) who is not here, he is gone away; I walked as far as <placeName id="t18300527-68-crimeloc362">Princes-street</placeName>

I said, "No, I don't want any thing," and before I could speak almost, the other knocked me down - I do not know what he struck me with; it was a stick, or something very heavy, acroos my breast - it was a star-light night; the blow knocked me down - my hat fell off with the fall; I recovered myself, and then the prisoner came up, struck me across my forehead with his fist, and knocked me down again - my jacket came off my right shoulder a little, and they caught hold of my jacket and pulled it right off my back - I went, and caught hold of it in the prisoner's hand, and said, "I see you want to rob me;" I laid hold of him, and he passed my jacket behind to the other one, who came behind, caught hold of me, and knocked me down again by a blow on the back of my head - I got up, and they were gone; I had nobody with me then but my shipmate - it happened right in the highway; I called out as well as I could, but they knocked the breath from me - I lost my jacket and hat; there were 17s. in my jacket pocket, also a pair of silk stockings and a silk handkerchief - I have a mark of the blow on my forehead now, and my arm is not well; I went home, told my landlord, and, between ten and eleven o'clock next night, I saw the prisoner at the White Swan - I was having a glass of ale at the bar; he was sitting in the room with about thirty of them, and when he saw me he held his hat over his eyes - I went to him and said, "Don't you know me?" he said Yes - I said, "Where did you see me?" he said, "Yesterday, here between ten and eleven o'clock;" I said, "Did you not see me in the highway?" he said Yes - I said."You had better give me my clothes, which you got from me last night, and I shan't say any thing at all about it;" he said if I said he had my clothes he would give me a dig in the eye - he did not strike me - I went outside; Sergeant Wheeler was coming by; I took him in, and had him secured - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270034"></xptr>am sure he is the man; I have never found my things - his wife came and threw down some duplicates, but I would have nothing to do with them - I saw him two or three days after he was examined; he told me if I would make it up he would give me 25s. to buy another jacket - I did not accept his offer.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. He forgot to state at the first examination that he was struck at all. Witness. I swore at the first and second examination that I was struck - my jacket was got off my shoulder by their knocking me about; they caught hold of it by the neck, and pulled it over my shoulder.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. If I was assaulting you in a thoroughfare, where twenty or thirty people would come up in two minutes, why did not your shipmate give an alarm to rescue you, you are stronger than me? A. You took care of me with a large stick or something - my shipmate threw his jacket off to fight for me, and he lost his jacket and hat; I did not see you the next day till night; I was not intoxicated next morning - I took the duplicates his wife gave me and heaved them down; she offered them to me to make it up- I would not carry them in my pocket: she said she would leave them there - I left them in my lodging, and never returned them to her; I never said I should get 3s. 6d. a day for this, which would be better than going a voyage - I had got a ship, and was going away; they came and took me out of the ship, and would not let me go - I went to a doctor the next day, and paid 6d. for some stuff; my nose and arm were hurt - my shipmate is gone to sea: I have never seen him since he was at the Justices: I never saw you before - I do not recollect your advising me not to fight with a black man.</p>

            . I am a sergeant of the Police. I was standing nearly opposite the Swan on the 29th of April, about eleven o'clock at night; Welford and Wiggan came to me and made a complaint - Welford said he could swear to the man from a hundred, and pointed the prisoner out; he was sitting against the bar - two or three girls of the town stood before him to conceal him from view at first; I then told him he must go with me -I knew him from the prosecutor's description, without his being pointed out; I have known him for years - when I went to him he pulled his hat over his face, and dropped himself in the seat; I took him to the station-house - he was at first in a great rage, and said he would serve the prosecutor out for giving him into custody, when he got lose - he afterwards became more calm, and said he hoped he should be able to arrange it with him; at the second examination I was much surprised to find neither the prosecutor nor Wiggan there - they had both identified the prisoner at the first examination; I inquired, and was told he had compromised the case - I immediately went to his lodgings, and the landlady gave me from the table this pension-ticket and eight duplicates, which she said the prisoner's wife had brought there - the duplicates are for apparel; the landlady said she would not suffer a compromise to take place - I could not find the prosecutor; I saw him at eleven o'clock at night, and asked why he left the office to compromise things with the prisoner's wife - he said."Oh! d - n the jacket - the poor woman has got a child; let him go;" Wiggan is gone to the Mediterranean, and they nearly succeeded in getting the prosecutor out of the way again; I went on board a vessel in the West India-dock, which he was going off in, the next day, and the landlord of the house appeared to connive with the party. On the way to the station-house the prisoner told me he had a finger in the pie, but he knew nothing of him or the jacket; the prosecutor did not appear drunk when I saw him; when I searched the prisoner he said, "How was it possible for me to commit such an offence when I hold this relic?" (Producing a bottle of holy water) and here is an oath I found on him, in his own writing, on which he swears not to commit drunkenness or any unlawful desires - he was drunk that night when I took him, but not incapable of walking.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You have known me some years? A. Since I have been on duty in Ratcliff-highway, about three months - I know you sell articles about; I never knew you accused of any thing, but have seen you with low characters; he hawks knives and things about for sale.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in a long address, stated that he had been in the King's service, and in several battles, and declared his innocence.</p>

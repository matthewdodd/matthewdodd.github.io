                  </hi>. I am Mrs. Strickland's solicitor—I saw the prisoner on Friday, 22nd March—he had left me a letter a day or two previously and called in pursuance of it—he told me he was the landlord of 90, Curtain Road, which he had let to Mr. Strickland for a term which had not expired, and that he was desirous of having possession at quarter day, but there were three quarters' rent due—I told him it would be paid in due course—the amount was about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said that the stock would be removed, and there would be an arrangement for him to come into early possession—the prisoner said he had been asked to give up the keys to the widow, and he had done so almost immediately after Mr. Strickland's death—he did not say he had another key and was in the habit of going on the premises, nor did he make any demand for moneys paid for taxes—I gave him no authority to go on the premises—no reference was made to it—he only referred to rent.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman G</hi> 3). I took the prisoner for stealing a quantity of veneer from 90, Curtain Road—he said he did not know any<lb></lb>thing about it—I saw some veneer in the shop at No. 88, and asked him to account for the possession of it—he said he got it from Mr. Norman,</p>

               <p>who was present, and said he did not deal in veneers—I pointed to some birch veneer, and asked him where he got that from—he said, "From Mr. Salomon's"—I went in the cellars on the Monday, and found 20 parcels of walnut burrs and a quantity of black wood, satin, and mahogany veneers—on the Tuesday I again searched the house, and in the coal<lb></lb>cellar found 53 packets of walnut veneers, 10 of maple, and 2 of chestnut—and from inquiries I made I went to Mr. Norman's, and found five bundles—altogether there were 192 parcels, of from 40 to 50 leaves, found and removed to the police-station—at the station the prisoner said, "I have taken the veneer; it was only to pay myself for rates which I had paid, amounting to 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he produced receipts dated 4th January and 8th March, 1878, for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—this key fits both Nos. 88 and 90—I found this account-book, which shows the sales for the amounts given in evidence; also this pass-book, which shows the amounts paid to his account during March, 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—from 1876 to April, 1878, there is nothing paid to his account—I took the book to the bank to be made up.</p>

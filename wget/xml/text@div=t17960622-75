               <p>On the 1st of June, I was going from the Custom-House, to my lodgings, and when I got home, I missed my pocket-book; I went back immediately, and I heard it was stolen from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had the pocket-book about you, when you came from the Custom-House? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel it taken from you? - A. No; it was about twelve o'clock at noon when I got home, I did not see the prisoner at all.</p>
               <p>- BACON sworn.</p>
               <p>I was looking out at a window, and saw the prisoner pick the gentleman's pocket, and I called a person to stop him, and when he came back, he had dropped the book; I cannot say it is the same book that he took out of the gentleman's pocket, a boy brought it up to me, and said, that was the book he had seen him drop.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my book, there are three bills of lading in it that I got at the Custom-House.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabout do you carry that book? - A. In the outside pocket, it is worth 2s.</p>

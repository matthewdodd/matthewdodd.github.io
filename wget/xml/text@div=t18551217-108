                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 168). On 7th Dec., about a quarter to 8 o'clock in the morning, I was in Wells-street, Cripple gate, and saw the prisoner and another—when they saw me, they turned round, and went back again, and the prisoner took this parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the other one, went back into another street, and ran a little way—I went round, and met them both together in Red cross-square—as soon as the prisoner saw me, he threw the bundle at my feet, and ran away—I overtook him in Noble-street, took him to the station, searched him, and found on him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a penknife—he gave his address, No. 7, Little Saffron-hill, but I could not find that he lived there—the other got away—I have opened the parcel—it contains nine pieces of woolen cloth.</p>

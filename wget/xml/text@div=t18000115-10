               <p>JOHN WHITMARSH sworn. - I live in Craven-street, in the Strand, and lodge with Mr. Snowden: On the 23d of November, I was robbed about a quarter past five, or I do not think it was so much.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the day shut in? - A. No, it was not; it was a clear evening; a man came up the <placeName id="t18000115-10-crimeloc51">road, which leads from Battersea-bridge</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner, whom you saw at that time, the person you had seen on the 23d of November? - A. It struck me very forcibly the moment I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that he was the person that robbed you? - A. I really have no doubt at all of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found your watch since? - A. No. He put his pistol into his coat-pocket, on the left side; it was a bath coat with a black velvet collar; his under coat was a dark drab, with a strait cut; it was a frock coat, and no lappels; it was a silver watch, gilt.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the colour of the horse? - A. It was a bay blood horse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. All that you formed your opinion upon was from a view of two or three minutes at the utmost? - A. True.</p>
               <p>Q. He had a round hat on? - A. Yes, and a great coat, open.</p>
               <p>Q. And that was all the opportunity you had of observing him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And this man you did not see till nearly a month after? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How was he dressed at Bow-street? - A. With the same great coat on, but a different close-bodied coat, and his waistcoat was the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at all agitated? - A. Not the least; at the time that he was at the side of the carriage there was a man not forty yards off, a gardener:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150010"></xptr>I pursued him afterwards; the road was lined with people.</p>
               <p>GEORGE SNOWDEN sworn. - I live at Fulham: I was going there in my carriage on the 23d of November, about five o'clock in the evening, we were stopped by a single highwayman, who desired the coachman to stop, or he would blow his brains out; the man stopped, and the highwayman immediately put his head into the window on the left side, with a pistol in his left hand; he immediately said, gentlemen, your watches and your money instantly; quick, I have no time to lose; my brother, who was on the other side, said, take your pistol away, I have left my money at home; he is now in Derbyshire; then he took a watch from Mr. Whitmarsh, and put it into his coat-pocket, and still kept the pistol in the chariot; now, says he, gentlemen, your money; Mr. Whitmarsh pulled out a red morocco purse, and gave it him; says he, very well, go off, take your pistol away, we have behaved very handsomely; but before that he said, what, have not you a guinea or two, cannot you give me a guinea or two; then he took the purse, and put it in his inside pocket; well, says he, gentlemen, have not I behaved very much like a gentleman, and away he went.</p>
               <p>Q. When you did see the prisoner at the bar at Bow-street? - A. I was sent for several times to look at men; but I did not see the man. On the 21st of December I was sent for again, and I saw the prisoner and four or five more, in a row; I immediately fixed upon the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that the prisoner at the bar was the person you had seen on the 23d of November? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at all alarmed? - A. To be sure I was; I sat in the carriage in the corner; the sun was setting, it was king of twilight; I had a particular opportunity of observing his features; I have no doubt but the man that I saw at Bow-street was the same man; he had a large hat on, and when I saw him at Bow-street, I immediately remarked that that was not the hat; they fetched another, but I said, that was not the same hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. On the 21st of December, I wish you to recollect, do you mean to swear it was on that day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not the 1st of January? - A. I think not; to the best of my recollection and belief it was the 21st of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Then as far as your memory goes, you are as correct in that, as in any other part of your evidence? - A. Yes; I cannot be very certain.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a month after the robbery happened? - A. Yes, thereabout.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You never saw the prisoner but once at Bow-street? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.And then Mr. Whitmarsh was with you? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I keep a coffee-house in Clifford's-inn-passage: I have known the prisoner Franklin three years; he kept a grocer's shop at Ealing when I kept a public house at Brentford; that did not succeed, and then he went into the fish line; I then got him to assist, now and then, the officers; my house is used by Marshalsea-court officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Hindes and Baylis being discharged? - A. Yes; I was at the office at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Franklin that day? - A. Yes, I saw him in the morning; between twelve and one o'clock at noon I asked him if he would go with me; and he said, no, he would not, for fear he should be wanted; when I returned at half past four in the evening, I found him at my house; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180001150011"></xptr>looked at the clock as I passed St. Dunstan's-church; I found him endeavouring to quell a disturbance that Baylis, who had been discharged, was making in my house, because my wife would not serve him; Franklin stopped to drink tea with me and my wife and my sister, and staid till between seven and eight; my wife knew him from a child.</p>
               <p>Q. What character has he deserved? - A. He always bore a very good character.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The prisoner lived first in Ealing? - A. Yes, in both situations.</p>
               <p>Q. And then he turned Marshalsea-court officer? - A. No, Marshalsea-court assistant.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing to do with the Marshal-sea-court yourself? - A. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you always look at the clock when you go home? - A. I generally cast my eye at the clock, because it is so conspicuous.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you quite sure that you looked at it that particular day, if you look at it every day? - A. No, nothing more particular; I go particularly by the discharge that day; if it had not have been for the discharge, I would not have given my evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has the prisoner used this coffee-house? - A. As long as I have kept it; about eight months.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live before that? - A. The George, in Brook-street; I kept it near a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you come from when you went to live there? - A. From Brentford; I kept the One Tun.</p>
               <p>Q. The house kept by Shock White? - A. The same.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you keep that house? - A. Three years.</p>
               <p>Q. It never occurred to you to have this sort of accident happen, to have people taken out of your house? - A. No, only Hindes; he was a Marshalsea court officer.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he charged with? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any other persons taken out of your house, at any time, for any crime? - A. No, only some people of a search-night, to take them before the Lord Mayor; there were three or four Marshalsea-court officers.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were taken out, and how long ago was it? - A. Five; and they were discharged the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other time at which any other persons have been taken out of the house? - A. Not since I have kept it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How did he employ himself all the while he was there? - A. In smoaking and drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed? - A. In a pepper and salt coat; I lent him five guineas the Friday week before he was apprehended, to buy him some clothes; a striped swansdown waistcoat I believe it was, with mother-of-pearl buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. He drank tea with you and your wife and sister? - A. Yes, and then went to smoke his pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from your house is it to Whitechapel? - A. It is a good distance.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your errand? - A. Nothing particular; curiosity led me to see the discharge. I never had any thing of the kind before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the charge when Baylis was taken? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else were there during all this time? - I cannot tell their names particularly; there was one person,

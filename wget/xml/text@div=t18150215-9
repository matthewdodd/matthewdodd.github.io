On Wednesday, the 11th of January, I was putting on my child's frock, all of a sudden, I heard a rattling at the window, I said God bless me, what is that. Afterwards I found the rattle was in the window, but I did not know it at the time; I ran to the door, I looked at the window, the glass was all safe then; it was a damp night; I did not miss the ribbon; the window was not hurt in the least; I missed nothing then. My little girl came home from school, she went to the window to double up the ribbons, she said mother, have you sold all the green ribbon; I said, not. She said the ribbon is all gone. I looked in the window; I could not see which way it could he gone; then I thought it might be taken at the time that I heard the ratling. I saw my empty rolls, but no ribbon. I missed a piece of green figured sattin ribbon, not a whole piece; I have them in in half pieces; a green figured sattin, and a piece of brown ribbon.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them - A. I cannot say. All my ribbons had been cut, nor can I say how many yards I lost; I cannot form any judgment to set any value at all upon them. When I missed them, I concluded they could go no way out but through the bolt holes that holds my shutters.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them afterwards - A. No, never.</p>

            . Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. I have seen him before. Three boys came to me, I do not know what month it was in, the prisoner was one of the three boys, between eight and nine o'clock at night, they asked me to let them leave a bit of ribbon; I asked them why they did not leave it at their mother's, I knew their mothers, I did not know much of them; I believe Church was the boy that laid it down on the table; the mother of the prisoner took it away. I never saw any more of them. The mother of the prisoner and Mrs. Church took it away in about a quarter of an hour afterwards. I believe it was a bit of dark green ribbon. The boy Abbing came in half an hour afterwards, and asked me for the ribbon; I told him I had given it to Shaw's and Church's mother.</p>

             took the ribbon, and put it through the bolt hole at Mrs. Martin's shop window; he drawed the narrow green ribbon through the bolt hole; then he brought the green ribbon to the other side of the way, and rolled it up; he gave me the ribbon to put into my pocket; then he took the wire, and went, and drawed the watch ribbon; he ran away with that as far as the Rising Sun, he thought he heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181502150009"></xptr>somebody coming, he dropped that ribbon; then John Church shired the wire away; we could not find the wire again.

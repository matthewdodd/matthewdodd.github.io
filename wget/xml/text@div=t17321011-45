I felt the Prisoner soroudge me where my Pocket was, which made me suspect him; upon which I pull'd my Pocket almost forward, and felt my Money was then in it. There were a Half-crowns, a Shilling, and a Silver Three-pence. He kept close to me for a little while longer, and then rose up and made towards the Door. It not being usual to rise before Church was done, I presently concluded that he got my Money, and putting my Hand to my Pocket I found that it was cut, and all my Money taken away. I call'd out, Stop Thief! and he was taken before he got out.</p>

He fell on his Knees, begg'd Forgiveness, and said it was the first time he had ever been there, and should be the last.

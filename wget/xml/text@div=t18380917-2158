                  </hi>. On the 7th of September, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was in Chiswell-street, passing towards Finsbury-square—I suddenly missed my handkerchief—I stopped for a moment—a young man came and told me I had had my pocket picked, and pointed out two men going in an opposite direction—I followed them ten or twelve yards, when they crossed the road, and returned, following a gen<lb></lb>tleman—I saw the two persons, of whom the prisoner was one, pick the pocket of that gentleman—I had him taken, and my handkerchief was found on him, and the handkerchief of the other person which I saw him take was taken from his trowsers—he said at first that he had no handker<lb></lb>chief, and then he said it was given him by a young man.</p>

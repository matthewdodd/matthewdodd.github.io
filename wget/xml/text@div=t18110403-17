            . My husband is a baker in Round-court, opposite of Mr. Cooke's; I was standing in the shop, I saw two women pass two different times, about six o'clock in the afternoon. I saw one of them take up her apron and pick up something, I did not know what; they then both went into a public-house next door; I went to the door immediately and asked Mrs. Cooke if she had lost any thing; she came out of the door, and said, yes, all my china plates; I went to the public-house bar door, they were both coming out; I asked them what they had got there; the first woman had nothing, the second woman had the china in her apron; I took them from her, and delivered them to Mrs. Cooke; I had a child in my arms. They both went away. In the evening we went to a public-house in Vine-street, and found the two women about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Vine-street near you - A. Yes. We went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030010"></xptr>to the Carpenter's Arms public-house in Vine-street, it is house that such people use. I am sure the prisoner is the person that took the plates up, I had seen her often that afternoon. These are the plates that I took away from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of the plates, they would be of no use to me. I could buy a plate for a penny that would serve me as well.</p>

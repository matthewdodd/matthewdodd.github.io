Great Luxembourg shares in March last? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did, to give to Mr. Massop, a sworn broker of Pinner's hall, Old Broad-street—they were delivered to me by Mr. Carr—I paid him by cheques for them—I speak of the certificate as the shares—there is no registration; they pass by delivery as bank notes—the prisoner remained in my service three months after that, till the middle of June last year—about 10th June, in consequence of information I received, I made inquiries with regard to his not delivering the shares to Mr. Massop, and he stated that they were with other shares and papers of his with a man at Southampton, whose name he mentioned, but I forget it—I went to South<lb></lb>ampton to the address he gave, and there was no such person to be found—it was a small parish just through Southampton—I inquired at the Post<lb></lb>office, but found no such person—on my return home, the prisoner never came back to my office, and I did not see him again till about a week ago at Guildhall—I paid 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the 100 shares, and have supplied 100 other shares to Mr. Massop in lieu of them.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185508200083"></xptr>
               <p>these certificates were not lodged, and I spoke to the prisoner about it at the same time—Mr. Massop spoke to me about it on 10th June, and I spoke to the prisoner directly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not he tell you that as Mr. Massop owed you money on other transactions, it had better stand as security? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think he did say some<lb></lb>thing of that sort—I made no agreement to that; I said nothing—the whole of the conversations took place in June, and my visit to Southampton was in June—I went there a few days afterwards—there are no shares issued in the Company—this (<hi rend="italic">produce</hi>) is scrip, and entitles you to receive the dividends—if you want to sell, on transferring this to the vendee, that is the completion of the sale—there is no transfer at all made by the Company; they are not aware in the least who their shareholders are.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stockbroker, of Pinner's-hall. On 8th March last year, I gave directions to Mr. Jessopp, to purchase shares for me in the Great Luxembourg Railway, but did not receive any shares from him, or on his account—I have very frequently spoken to the prisoner about these shares—he made a variety of excuses week after week, and he said that he had not received them, and that they had not been delivered—I made frequent applications to him, and he made frequent excuses—I did not authorise him to keep them for me, or to deposit them with anybody for me on my account, nor with any one at Southampton—I have received another 100 shares since from Mr. Jessopp.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You never authorised him to deposit them in any manner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I received the dividend from him—I do not remember the amount (<hi rend="italic">looking at a book</hi>)—I received 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Smith on 6th April, I sup<lb></lb>pose that must be it—I undoubtedly received the dividend—one day, when I wanted the shares particularly, he said that he had left them at the office, that the dividend would be received altogether, and he would pay it to me—I received the money without inquiring at the office whether the shares were there—I had not had many transactions with him independently—our acquaintance commenced about the end of 1853, and he introduced me to Mr. Jessopp about the same time—I discounted a bill for him once—that was the only transaction I had with him as a principal—I have my cash book with me—I have no subpoena to produce my books—I have not been to the office this morning—I have been told that there is a subpoena lying there—I do not remember having any transaction with the prisoner about shares, independent of Mr. Jessopp—I will not swear that I have not—I in all probability gave him the order in this very case—he has not on many occasions bought and sold shares for me on his own account, but only as the clerk—I do not think on any occasion I have had a transaction with him as a principal, only in discounting a bill—I have had some South Devon stock—the prisoner did not buy them for me on his own account, he was not on the Stock Exchange at the time—I think I had joint speculations with the</p>

               <p>prisoner, but only through Mr. Jessopp—yes, I have with the prisoner on his own account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you to divide the commission? when you received an order from clients to buy shares, was not the prisoner to buy them cheaper if he could, and you and he to share the difference? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, we on a few occasions bought what we call a consol or two, and divided the profits—if we thought consols were going cheaper, we bought a consol together—that is 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. consolidated stock, and divided the profits—that was done through Mr. Jessopp—it was while the prisoner was with Mr. Jessopp—Mr. Jessopp knew nothing about my sharing the profits with his clerk—we did that per<lb></lb>haps four or five times—that was 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not recollect buying anything else in connection with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the meaning of carrying over? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If you have bought, and are unable to pay, you can sometimes get the people of whom you have bought to deliver them in another fortnight, or another month—I will not swear that I had not as many as a dozen transactions of that description with him—I do not remember carrying anything over with him, and do not think I did at all—I do not know whether my books would show, very likely they would.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were told this morning that your books were subpœnaed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Was it safe to go?—my books would not show a regular debtor and creditor account between me and the prisoner—I believe there is not such an account standing on my books with the prisoner—there is not money due to the prisoner from me at this very moment, I owe him nothing—I will not swear that there is no account between me and him, but I believe not—I swear that there is no money due from me to him, or appearing to be due—I should think he would not have left it all this time if there had been—I frequently made applications to him for the shares, almost daily, both before and after he paid me the dividend—I do not know on what day the divi<lb></lb>dend was paid—I did not speak to Mr. Jessopp for a long time; I do not know whether it was before June—I do not believe I asked the prisoner to exchange these shares for me for some new shares which the company were issuing, telling him that shares were falling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he not produce the Company's receipt to you for ten of the new shares, and leave it with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say whether it was ten new shares, or ten old shares—I do not know whether it was in June—the shares were very much lower in June—I do not think I asked him for new shares at that time, he had other shares of this sort—I remember his show<lb></lb>ing me one—I do not know how long these speculations went on—there may have been one as late as May, I do not remember—I do not know that I was entering into speculations with him at the time that I knew that he was holding these shares—I had no particular reason for not telling Mr. Jessopp that I was speculating, I should not have cared two straws about his knowing—I have been in business since June, 1853,1 think it was.</p>

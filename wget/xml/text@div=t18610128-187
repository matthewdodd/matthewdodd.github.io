                  </hi>. I am a telegraphic clerk in London—all the messages that are sent from the country are sent up to London, and we have all the originals here—here is one from Walsall (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it bears date 1st October.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a partner with Poole in the two businesses in London and Northampton—I was in Northampton during the whole of the early part of July—I am one of the bankrupts—I was not acquainted with Mr. Cooke, of Walsall—my partner had no dealings with him that I am aware of—I do not know of any large quantity of goods being sent away</p>

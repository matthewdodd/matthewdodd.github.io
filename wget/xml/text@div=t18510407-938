                  </hi>. I am master of Dunning's Alley Work-house, which belongs to the East London Union, and is appropriated for the reception of female paupers in that Union—the paupers dine together in the hall, at twelve o'clock—the prisoners were inmates—on 1st April Collins, Fuller, Donovan, and Dunlevy were sitting at one table, and Burchell was employed in handing the others the meat after it had been weighed—in the course of the dinner, Fuller said she would be master of the house—I do not recollect now what the others said—Burchell took a potato off the plate of a girl named Sparkes, and I think she touched her nose in so doing—I requested her to sit down, and as she was proceeding to the end of the hall, she turned, and I saw her throw the potato—it passed near my head—I suppose it was thrown at me—I called on the porter, who was present, to do his duty—a girl named Margaret Conner attempted to put Burchell out of the hall—she resisted, and the porter put her out—as soon as the door was shut, Fuller threw the contents of a pannakin of beer in my face, and Collins the contents of the salt-box—Donovan and Dunlevy each threw a plate, one of which hit me in the face, and the other one my head, of which I have the mark now—after that plates came rapidly, and pannakins from the prisoners, and I saw knives and forks falling about me—there was a great disturbance, tumult, and riot—I tried to clear the room, and several kicked me behind, but I can<lb></lb>not say who it was—my face was streaming with blood at the time—I got into the yard—Fuller, Donovan, Dunlevy, and I believe Collins, followed me—Fuller got hold of me by the neck-handkerchief, and tried to strangle me—the others also had hold of me—I was afterwards rescued by some of the other inmates—blood was then running off my nose and chin—I am suffering from the blows now; these plaisters are from the effects of them—I am still under medical treatment—after I was rescued, they rushed up-stairs, and destroyed 250 panes of glass—there were also five door-plates broken, and the sashes of the kitchen-window were broken by Donovan.</p>

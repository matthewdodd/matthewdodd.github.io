            . I am a constable. On the 5th of May I apprehended the prisoner at the Guardian Society's house, Cannon-street-road. I searched, and found nothing on her; I told her I took her for robbing Mr. Webb, with whom she formerly lived; the matron told me, in her presence, where to find the things produced, she said nothing to it.</p>

               <p>MRS. WEBB. She left us on the 27th. When I got up in the morning, the drawers were in their proper state.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you find them turned round, or were they put back - A. I found them turned round, and the kitchen poker lying on the carpet. The house is two stories high; our door is kept shut; we have no lodgers; there was nobody in the house but her. A little girl was to go to the house while I went out, but she could not get in, for the prisoner had left the house, with the children in it. I left it at ten o'clock, and returned between one and two o'clock. She might have gone out and returned if she pleased.</p>

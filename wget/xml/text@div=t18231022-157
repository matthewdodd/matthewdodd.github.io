I saw two drays turn up Worship-street - they were quite close to each other - there was a driver with the first, but not with the other - it was not the prisoner. They belonged to Hanbury and Company. I saw the deceased leaning up against the wall; there was no footpath on that side of the way; the deceased was on the near side of the dray, as it went along - there is room for two carriages to pass abreast. I do not know that two drays could so pass - there is plenty of room for one - the first dray passed the man - the second threw him down, and the wheel went over his skull, and killed him on the spot. The prisoner was a few yards behind the dray - he was laid hold of at the time. I saw the deceased on the ground, and his brains among the dirt. I ran up to the office, and told the officers what had happened - they took him as he came by. He said he could not help it - the first dray was not wider than the other. I cannot say whether the deceased was drunk or sober. He stood upright to try to save himself - the wheel was near enough to crush him.</p>

            . I am a journeyman dyer. I was with the last witness. I saw the two drays - there was a driver with the first. The first dray passed the man without doing him any injury. I saw the second dray - there was no person with it to prevent mischief. The prisoner was behind it - the deceased stood upright, to try to keep clear of it - part of the dray caught hold of him, and threw him down, and the wheel ran over his skull. The drays were going at a moderate pace. I cannot say how far the driver was behind.</p>

            . I am a silk-warper. The deceased was on the opposite side of the way to where I stood. I saw him walk round the corner of the street, before the wheel went over his head. He went on that side the way where there is no pavement. I saw the first dray pass - there was a driver with it. The second driver<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182310220060"></xptr>might be about twenty yards behind - two or three houses off. If he had been up with the dray, the accident would not have happened. The prisoner was stopping near a sadler's shop - it was within three doors of the corner of Worship-street.</p>

            . I took the prisoner into custody; he had then got thirty yards from where the man lay - he was behind the dray when I laid hold of him. Both the drays had stopped; he said the second dray was his. I went and measured the ground - it was thirteen feet wide - the width of the dray was about seven feet. If the driver had been there the accident would not have happened.</p>

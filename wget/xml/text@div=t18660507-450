                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-Policeman</hi>, 424.) On Monday, 30th April, about two minutes past twelve at noon, I was near Mr. Houghton's shop, and saw the three prisoners together—I saw a gentleman looking in at the shop on the left-hand corner of the window, and next to him was the prisoner Robin<lb></lb>son; nearest the window on the other side was Green, and outside of her was Smith—just as I came round to the front of them, I saw Robinson's right arm go, and I saw the gentleman's chain of his watch drop from him—I could not see the hand—I could only see the elbow, between the gentleman and the window—the hand was in front of the gentleman, against his waistcoat—I saw Smith touch Robinson directly she caught sight of me—he stepped back on to his short leg (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner was lame</hi>)—and he got between the two females—he had his hand down—I put my arms round the three of them, and called to the gentleman, "You have lost your watch"—they were all standing in a knot, no one else was near them—he felt in his pocket, and said, "I have"—two gentlemen assisted me—they kept the crowd away—there was a boy there, and he said, "He has got the watch in his left hand; there is the watch"—a gentleman seized Robinson's hand, and I took this watch from it—the bow was broken—I believe the prosecu<lb></lb>tor did not see the watch till we got to the station—he there identified it as his property—Robinson said that some one put it into his hand—he said he had come from Glasgow that morning—the women said nothing—I have got the bow of the watch—at the time we were at the station a gentleman came there, and said the bow had been picked up outside the shop, and taken in to Mr. Houghton, and I went to Mr. Houghton for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Robinson</hi>. He asked the gentleman if he had lost his watch, and he said, "Yes"—he said, "Did you see this man by the side of you?" He said, "No. On my oath I never saw the man by the side of me at all. I saw the females." <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. The gentleman did not say that he had not seen Robinson—I asked him to come to the station, and he said, "I can't come now."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Robinson</hi>. You ought to have taken the man in custody who gave it into my hand—you saw the man get away. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. There was no one near to you, only you three and the gentleman at the corner of the window.</p>

I am an unfortunate man to be there that morning; I came from Scotland; I had been to Houndsditch to buy goods; my brother and I have been in the <hi rend="italic">cheap-jack</hi> line, travelling about fairs, and getting an honest living. This morning I happened to be standing here and the females by me; a young man said to me, "Hold that a moment." I own I had the watch in my hand. The moment I was asked about it I gave it up. I did not attempt to rescue, or anything like that, because I was not the person that took it. <hi rend="largeCaps">GREEN</hi>

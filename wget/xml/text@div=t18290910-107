            . I am a baker, and live in High-Holborn. Southampton-street is in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn; the prisoner frequently came to the shop - I do not remember giving her change for the note at all; I do not remember taking a 10l. note from her at all; I wrote my name on a note which I received in my shop; I was examined before a Magistrate and signed my deposition - it was read over to me - this (looking at it) is signed by me, it is the same as I say now; I say to the best of my belief, I took the note of the girl.</p>


               <p>Q. You have not said that now? A. I did not tell the Magistrate I was positive of the prisoner; I know her, and know she lived with the prosecutrix; I do not remember the circumstance, though I know I did take the note, because I have written the prosecutrix's name on it, and said at the office I believed I did take it of the prisoner, and I do believe I received it from her - I wrote on it, "Mrs. Rochester, 12, Southampton-buildings," this is the note(looking at it) I have put that name on it.</p>

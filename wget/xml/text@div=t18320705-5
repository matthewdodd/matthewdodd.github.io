             lived with him -On Friday morning, the 15th of June, about twenty minutes or half-past five o'clock, I heard the deceased give a dreadful groan, and heard like a rumbling noise at the same time; it was in her room no doubt - I did not see her, but the noise came out of the back parlour, where she slept; I heard nothing more till the prisoner came along the passage, up to my bed-room door, crying "Oh, Mrs. Bayley, Mrs. Bayley, get up, get up - she is dead, she is dead;" this was not exceeding twenty minutes or half an hour after I heard the groan - I got out of bed, opened the door, and he was there naked, in his shirt; I ran down stairs as I was, and he came down after me - when I saw the deceased I said, "Oh, Reilly, you have murdered your wife;" he said, "I have not;" and said had I any money - I told him I had not; he said he wanted something to drink, for he must cut, he must cut- I then went up stairs, and put on my clothes, leaving him in the room - the deceased was laying on her back on the bed, with her clothes on; I left nobody in the room with the prisoner; I gave an alarm to the people in the house - I went down stairs again, for he still kept in a loud cry, "I must cut, I must cut" - when I came down I found him dressing himself; he said he must cut, he must cut, for off he must be - I said, "For God's sake, Mr. Reilly, don't cut and leave us all in the house, for we shall all he taken up, so cruelly murdered as this poor creature is;" he put a bag on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. On your saying "Don't go, Rielly," &amp;c. what did he say? A. He said, "Hold your tongue, you bl-y fool, I am only going to get something to drink;" he ran outside the door, with the bag on his shoulder, and ran off when I first went down he kissed the body, and said, "Oh, Kitty, Kitty, what shall I do? What shall I do? my God, what shall I do?" in that dreadful tone; and I said, "Oh, you ought to have thought of that before;" when he went to the door I looked after him, and he ran away; I saw a Policeman standing, and said, "For God's sake, Policeman, do you see that man running with a bag?" I sent the Policeman after him, and he brought him back; I had seen the deceased alive at half-past two o'clock the afternoon before - she came up to my room; I saw the prisoner after she had been to me, and delivered to him the message she had left, which was, that she had shut her shop door, had locked her parlour door, left the key outside, and was gone out to seek some remedy, for he had got some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050023"></xptr>money, and was swearing at her; I told him this - he seemed agitated and vexed at her going out, and said,"Good God, where is she gone? so comfortable as we have been;" they were always quarrelling ever since I have been in the house; this was as near three o'clock in the afternoon as possible; I saw him again at ten, in the street - I had not seen his wife; I went to bed between ten and eleven, and heard no more of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Where were you from three o'clock in the afternoon till between nine and ten? A. In my own room, about my business; I have seen the prisoner drunk - I have certainly at times seen the deceased have a drop with her husband: I have seen her drunk - I have lived there nearly two years.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time you had seen her drunk? A. I cannot tell - she had been bad a fortnight, laid up in bed, through his brutish usage.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Monday fortnight before this occurrence, did she not come home so drunk as to fall over the things and hurt herself? A. No, I never saw her quite drunk; I cannot say I do not drink occasionally myself - I had some gin with my husband about half-past nine o'clock, on the Thursday night; the prisoner was one of the party and paid for it - there was a quartern among a woman named Fleetwood, him and me; we had it in Aylesbury-street - my husband had some gin in Reilly's room that night, but I had not; that must have been after ten o'clock; when I met the prisoner in Aylesbury-street, I did not want to drink with him, but he would make me; he was perfectly sober, and had been at work that afternoon - he had some work, and said he was taking it home; the deceased has slept out many a time for safety - I do not know of her pledging his things; they kept their secrets to themselves - I do not think I have drank with her half a dozen times in my life; I never went to a pawnbroker's shop with her, nor drank with her after she had been pawning things - a Mr. and Mrs. Darnford lived in the street; there was a great quarrel between them about eleven o'clock that night - they live right opposite our place; I was in bed at the time, but could hear them quarrelling - our street door was not left ajar, but with a bolt and a string to pull it; any body outside could open it: I never saw Mrs. Reilly intoxicated - I have seen her fly out of the house, and be glad to sleep any where, even in a shed, to hide herself from him; I think I told the Coroner that I told the prisoner not to cut, or we should all be taken up, but you must make a little allowance for the fright and trouble I have had; I cannot recollect every word that happened - I do not know that the Coroner asked me about that; I cannot say whether I told him of the prisoner's saying, "Hold your tongue you b - y fool," &amp;c.: I only answered the questions I was asked - I mentioned about hearing a rumbling noise before I saw Reilly; I did not, to my knowledge, mention to the Coroner that, I told Reilly he should have thought of that before, when he kissed her; I was not asked it - you must excuse me, for the fright I have had in seeing the state of the deceased and the way I have been put about; I have been the only one who has been at the head of it - I took her part all the time I was in the house; the last time I rescued her from the prisoner, he swore he would murder me.</p>

               <p>MR. DONNE. Q. Where does Darnford live? A. Exactly opposite; it is rather a wide street - they were quarrelling outside their house; I got out of bed to see what it was - Daruford's wife was in the street, and he was calling to the Policeman to take her; I suppose she was taken to the station.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you saw the deceased dead in the morning, had she bonnet or shawl on? A. She had no bonnet, as to her shawl I cannot say - she had her other clothes on; she had a bonnet and shawl on when I saw her at half-past two o'clock - I do not know whether any bonnet was found in her room; I never said to a Mrs. Briant, or in her presence, that if the prisoner had twenty-five necks, I would hang him - I do not know her.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure you never said that? A. Not to my knowledge; I have said it to many people, but I do not know her, and he ought to have been hung years ago.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How had they lived together for the last fortnight? A. She was very ill, being laid up through his brutishness; after he had beat her he was more kind to her - there were no words between them after that, to my knowledge; when the prisoner returned on the Thursday, and I gave him the message, he asked which way she went, and I said, "The last time I saw her, she was at Mr. Chickles door;" and he said he would go after her.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw her dead in the morning, and he kissed her, did he say any thing to you about the way it had happened? A. No, he did not; he said he knew nothing of it - he was naked in his shirt, when he came up to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about what happened when he awoke? A. He said that he had never seen her - that he had just awoke, and found her on the bed; that was when I charged him with killing her - when she went out in the afternoon, she told me to tell him she had left the key for him, and I took it out of the back parlour door myself.</p>

            . I am the husband of the last witness. On Friday morning, the 15th of June, I was awoke by the prisoner; as near as I can ascertain, it was about six o'clock; before that (it might be an hour or two) I heard a rumbling noise, as if a chair or table was being moved, but what it was I cannot say - whether I went to sleep afterwards I cannot say; I was not asleep when the prisoner came up; the noise proceeded from the bottom part, which they occupied - I cannot say whether it was in the front or back room I did not hear any sound besides the rumbling noise; when the prisoner came up in his shirt, my wife went down first -I immediately put on my trousers, and went down as quick as possible - before I went into the room the deceased was in, I saw the street door open, also an inner door, which was in the centre of the passage - I went into the back parlour, and found the deceased laying on the bed; she had her clothes on, but whether she had a shawl or bonnet I cannot say, but I do not think she had - she was on her back, and to the best of my knowledge some of her clothes were covered over her; I cannot be certain - I felt her - her hands were warm, but she was quite dead - I looked at the prisoner, and said, "Reilly, I am afraid you have committed, or done murder, "I do not know which; he said, "I have done nothing, and I know nothing till I awoke this morning, and she was laying here by the side;" I understood him to mean the side of the bed: the body laid on the bed, on one side - I understood him to mean the floor, for he pointed to the floor, and I saw a great deal of blood on the floor, at the foot of the bed, by the fireplace.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050024"></xptr>Q. Was the blood in the place where he pointed to? A. Yes; there was a great deal of blood all over the floor by the bed-side.</p>
               <p>Q. Then was there blood at the side of the bed as well as the foot? A. I did not see it; I say it was on the floor; the prisoner came into my room, and said, "What shall I do? what shall I do? I must cut, I must cut" - he had then dressed himself; that was before he was brought back by the Policeman - I had gone up stairs after going down and seeing his wife, and he dressed and came up; he went down after saying this, and my wife, who was then up stairs, went down after him - I did not see him again till the Policeman brought him back; the Policeman went into the inner room, where the deceased lay, leaving him in possession of me and Gibson, another lodger - he attempted to get away from me - I took him by the collar, and said, "Reilly, you shall not go."</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did he attempt to go? A. I will not be sure whether he said, "You d-d fool," or "You b-y fool, I only want to go and get something to drink;" he was going towards the door - I took him by the collar, and said, "You shall not go," and we detained him; I had seen him the night before, going in and out - it might be about half-past ten or eleven o'clock; I drank with him about eleven o'clock, and went to bed directly after, leaving him in the shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say you heard a rumbling noise about an hour before you were alarmed - are you quite sure you heard no noise in the prisoner's room between that time and when the prisoner came up? A. No, I heard no voices nor groans.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you seized him by the collar, and he said he was going to get something to drink, was he not very much agitated and distressed? A. Very likely he might be; he had told my wife before, that he must have something to drink, and he wanted her to get him something, but she would not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he come into your room about five o'clock on the Thursday afternoon? A. Yes, to ask for some water for his tea; he was sober then, and said he had been to several places looking for his wife, and could not find her - there was a noise before Darnford's house about half-past ten o'clock, but I did not see Reilly there; I lifted my window up to see what the noise was, and Reilly called out to me, "Bayley come down" - he was at his own door; I went down, and partook of the gin in the shop - he was certainly tipsy then, but I have seen him more so; his wife certainly had been in the habit of drinking.</p>

            . I lodge in the second floor, at No. 5, Compton-street; I was the prisoner's lodger - it is his house. On Thursday, the 14th of June, I went to bed about nine o'clock, and was disturbed a little before half-past one, by a great noise, as if something heavy had fallen; it came from the ground-floor, and I supposed it to be from the back parlour, for it shook the partition of my room, which is a back room - I heard a continual noise, which appeared to me as if the goods were being removed, and after that, I heard the prisoner's voice; he said, "You b-y, b-y whore, what have you done with that gold?" and there was another word, which I could not distinctly hear - I knew the deceased's voice very well, and heard her say, "O Lord, O Lord;" I heard the rumbling both before and after that, and till past three o'clock- I got up, and opened my room door when I heard the deceased say, "O Lord," and remained there about a minute; I heard nothing else - I heard the front door bolt and unbolt three or four times, and heard footsteps from the back parlour to the street door; I kept awake till after three o'clock, and then went to sleep - I am certain about the time, for after I awoke, the chimes went half-past one, and I heard the clock strike two and three, and after that went to sleep; I was awoke again about six, and the house was alarmed - I went down, and saw the prisoner brought in; he was left in charge of me and Bayley - he tried to escape between me and Bayley, but did not succeed, and he said, "You b-y fool, I only wanted to get something to drink."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you and the prisoner disagreed about rent at any time? A. Yes, I am in his debt for rent now - the disagreement was three or four weeks ago from this time; it was because I did not pay him - I owed him 7s. or 8s., or it might be 9s.; I cannot tell on what day we had the quarrel - I have not been with Mrs. Bayley when she said if he had twenty-five necks she would hang him, nor have I joined her in saying so; I and my wife both awoke together - it was not on the Wednesday or Thursday previous to this that I quarrelled with him about rent - it was a long time before that; I paid part of it a week before - I believe the deceased was in the habit of drinking; I never saw her and Bayley drunk together - I had none of the gin on Thursday night.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What business are you? A. A tailor; I have lodged there six months, and paid 2s. 3d. a week - I owed him for about four weeks; the room was not furnished - I told him I would pay him as soon as I could; I had paid him for five months before - I had no quarrel with him.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness - we went to bed about nine o'clock, and were awoke when the chimes struck half an hour, and the clock afterwards struck two - it must have been half-past one: the noise appeared as if the partition of our room was shaken, and we started up together in a fright; I do not know what it was, but I considered that Reilly was moving his goods - it appeared to proceed from his back parlour; our partition is wainscot, and the same sort of partition continues down to his back parlour; I heard a continual noise going in and out at the street door - it kept being bolted and unbolted, and footsteps going along the assage to the back parlour; I heard Mr. Reilly's voice (if ever I heard it before), saying "What have you done with that gold ring, you bl-y whore?" that was repeated three times, and on one occasion the word bl - y was used twice; I heard Mrs. Reilly say "Oh Lord, oh Lord," in a very mournful tone; I went to sleep about four o'clock - I heard a continual noise going in and out of the street door, and what appeared to me like kicking against some hard substance, and then soft - my husband got out of bed, and opened the door; I flew to him, to prevent his going down stairs; we got into bed again - I do not recollect which went to sleep first: the noise ceased at different intervals before I went to sleep - I do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050025"></xptr>not think it ceased more than half an hour before I went to sleep; I continually heard going in and out at the street door; I was not disturbed again till the house was alarmed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. Is it usual to leave the door on the latch? A. There is a string with a hole through the door, which will remove the bolt, for any of the lodgers to get in any time they think proper; the bolting and unbolting made a great noise on this occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had been unbolted before half-past one o'clock, would you not probably have heard it? A. I suppose so- I was awoke by the partition being shook; we live at the back of the house, and do not hear waggons pass.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Is the string at the top or the middle of the door? A. Nearest to the middle; the lodgers in the house knew how to pull the string - it was a thickish piece of twine, with the knot outside; it had no handle.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the 15th of June I saw Mrs. Bayley, and from what she said I looked and saw the prisoner crossing St. John-street, at a very quick pace; I overtook him, and asked where he lived; he said in Compton-street - I asked where his wife was; he said at home - I said he must go with me, and took him into custody, to No. 5, Compton-street, and left him in the front room ground floor; he had a bag, containing new leather; I went into the back room; the deceased was on the bed, laying on her back, and the head rather inclining to the inner part of the bed - the face was very much swollen, and the eyes black; she had a severe cut on the head; her clothes were on - I observed a great quantity of blood on the floor, at the foot of the bed, and one spot of blood on the second drawer of a small chest, near the foot of the bed; on the fire-place was a shovel, with some human hair on it, and blood on the hair - that is in the constable's possession; I saw an iron stew-pan standing close to the fire-place, at the foot of the bed, and spots of blood on that - I did not examine the deceased's clothes; I took the prisoner to the station-house, searched him there, and in his coat pocket I found this silk pocket-handkerchief, with wet blood on it - it appeared much wetter than it is now; his left shoe was much stained with blood, and had hair on it on the same part as the blood, there is one or two hairs on it now, but having been taken out so many times some of it has got off; it was then damp, and had apparently been wiped - I was confident it was blood, from the smell; his trousers were spotted with blood - both his hands had a great deal of blood on them, and particularly the back part of his right hand; the blood on his trousers was wet</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You smelt the blood on his shoe? A. Yes, the moment I took it from Mr. Whitmore's hand; I could see it was blood, as well as smell it - Hall, the constable, has his trousers; the Magistrate ordered him to be stripped in prison - the blood on the floor appeared fresh; it appeared to be wiped, but I did not feel it to see if it was wet - I took the shoes from the prisoner's feet, and the trousers were on his person; the bed-side comes close to the fire-place - I suppose there is not above two feet distance; a stew-pan stood on the floor, with its bottom downwards, as if it had laid there some time- the blood on the floor was between the drawers and the bedstead, against the foot-post; the drawers were on the right-hand side, against the wall; the blood was mostly between the drawers and the foot of the bed - the prisoner, before the Magistrate, accounted for the blood on the handkerchief as being from a cut in his finger; there was a small cut on his finger - he told the Magistrate the blood on his hands arose from his lifting the deceased from the floor to the bed; I took him about two hundred yards from his house - I was not two minutes talking to Mrs. Bayley; he was walking, but certainly at a quick pace.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. About seven o'clock in the morning of the 15th of June I was sent to the prisoner's house, and searched the ground floor back room -I found an apron stained with blood in one corner of the room - it appeared like a woman's apron; one end of it was in the bottom drawer of a chest, which stood at the foot of the bed; the drawer was partly open - this is the apron (looking at it); this corner of it was in the drawer, and this, which is now mouldy, rested on the floor, and was stained with blood - there was no blood on the part which was in the drawer; the apron joined together with the blood which was on the floor - there was a curtain on the drawers stained with blood and dirt together - there was a small portion of flesh, about as large as a pen, on the cdge of the drawer, which was not closed; it might be half an inch from the extreme corner of the drawer; it appeared to me to be caused by the head or some part of the body knocking against the door, and being grazed, so that the edge cut part off - I found this shift (looking at it); there were marks of blood on it, but that appeared to have been standing about two days - it was in the corner behind the drawer, near to where the blood laid on the floor - it was folded up; there was a small quantity of human hair in the shift; the blood on it was not fresh - here is a paper containing the hair found on the apron, and that in the shift; I compared it with the hair of the deceased, and it corresponded; also that found on the shovel - the shift was about eighteen inches from the shovel - the drawers are eighteen inches from the fire-place, and the foot of the bedstead is fifteen inches from the fire-place - the shovel was on the top of the stove, where the fire is made; it is a sifting shovel, with holes in it, and without a handle; I found some duplicates in a case in the drawers, and here is one among them for a wedding-ring, pawned on the 2nd of April, 1832; I examined the shop and the passage, but found not the least appearance of blood whatever there, either in the shop or passage.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. On the 15th of June I examined the prisoner's clothes, as he stood at the bar of the office; I have them here - I observed blood on the trousers, and on his shirt; on the shoulder of his shirt, and a little on the waistcoat - I asked how the blood came on the shoulder of his shirt; he said by picking her up, and that on his trousers and on another part of the shirt, he said, was occasioned by cutting his finger - there was some blood on the flap of his shirt; there was very little blood on the waistcoat - he said nothing about that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. The blood is on the right leg of his trousers? A. Yes, it was nearly dry - this was about twelve o'clock.</p>

            . I live in Compton-street, next door to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050026"></xptr>prisoner; I sleep in the back parlour, and have the front shop - a party-wall separates my bed-room from the prisoner's. On the 14th of June I went to bed about eleven o'clock; I rose again, and went to the door about twelve; I went to bed again, and about two was awoke by a noise, like stamping on the floor, and something as though it was against the wainscot; I heard no talking, nor voices - it was dark; I was awoke two or three times, but the noise did not continue; I heard it three or four times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it after twelve that you heard it the first time? A. Yes - it was a disturbance in the street that led me to my door; I found it was a tipsy woman at her own door, opposite - she was taken to the station; I had heard none of this noise before that - I do not know when I heard it first, for I was asleep, and it awoke me, but the last noise was about two o'clock, I think - I knew the deceased very well; I had seen her the morning before, and last, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, she came for halfpenny worth of snuff; she was sober then, but was very poorly, and had been so for two or three days - I asked how she was - she said a little better.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was it soon after you went to bed that you heard the noise? A. I had fallen asleep, but it was certainly a very short time, because I was awoke three or four times, and the last time was before day-light - I have a clock, but did not notice the time; I spoke to the prisoner about five minutes before twelve o'clock that night; he was in the street, looking at the noise - he was in the habit of dealing in toys.</p>

            . I am an unfortunate woman. On Thursday, the 14th of June, about one o'clock in the night, I was with Sarah Ryan at the corner of Aylesbury and St. John-street, and met the prisoner; I did not know him before - we asked him to go and have a drop of something to drink; we spoke to him first - he said he had a drop of gin at home, if we liked to go home for it, we went home with him to his house in Compton-street - we went into the passage, just inside the street door, and he took the bottle off a shelf in the shop - the shop door is close to the street door; he said if we liked to stop a little while he would go and fetch some more - he just went to the corner of Compton-street, but could get none, and came back without any; we were not there five minutes altogether - he then asked one of us to stop with him all night; I asked where his wife was - he said she was gone into the country, and he knew she would not be at home that night; we rather doubted that, and neither of us would stop - he gave us two or three toys, and knowing the landlord of the White Hart, we went, and wanted to leave the toys there for a quartern of gin - that was a little after one o'clock; we went there directly from the prisoner's house; I saw nothing more of the prisoner; but just before we had the White Hart to treat her, and we were there - it is four or five doors down Aylesbury street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I suppose you were sober? A. Yes; we went with him, and sent him in doors first, as I thought his wife might be at home; he opened the door, but I do not know how - I know it was shut when we came away; we left him at the house - he did not seem the least out of temper; we did not go further than the passage, but we could not stand there without seeing into the shop door - we stood outside in the street while he went to the corner for more gin; we left the door open - he came back, went in, and shut the door; I did not take notice whether the bolt fastened - I supped at home, but was at the public-house on and off all the evening; the landlord happened to be up, doing something to his cellar - we heard him knocking, and got him to let us in; I do not know what became of the woman, who came into the White Hart with the prisoner - I think that was about one o'clock; it was getting on for two when we left him - I told the Magistrate it was between one and two, that we saw him at the White Hart; that was the time, as near as I can tell.</p>

            . I keep the White Hart, in Aylesbury-street. Cottrel and Ryan brought some toys to my house on the night of the 14th of June; to the best of my recollection, it was nearer one o'clock than twelve - they asked me to let them have some gin for them: and said they had been home with old Reilly (who was at my house a quarter of an hour before, with another woman, whom I knew by the name of Betsy) - I believe Reilly to be the man - I refused to give the gin for the toys.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long was Reilly there before the woman came with the toys? A. I should think half an hour; my shutters were up, but the door merely closed; I cannot speak to the time for ten minutes; the woman I believe called him old Reilly - she knew him, because she told me she had asked him if his wife was at home - they did not talk to him at my house; I took but little notice of him.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Cottrell called him by name? A. I think so; she told me after she had been to his house, that she asked him about his wife - that is my only reason for thinking she knew him before; I think this was about one o'clock.</p>

            . I am a private watchman. I was on duty in the neighbourhood of Compton-street, on Thursday night the 14th of June, between one and two o'clock - I cannot fix the time nearer than that; as I passed the prisoner's house I heard a rumbling in the house, which caused me to stop there and listen for a minute or two - I knew the prisoner and heard him call Mrs. Reilly a b-y whore; he said he would break her b-y neck- I heard her answer, "O dear me!" and heard what appeared to me to be her head hitting against a board, but whether it was so, I cannot say; I knew his wife; she said,"O dear me!" after I heard the knocking against the board; it was said in a mournful tone, as if he had been ill-using her - as soon as that was over the prisoner opened<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050027"></xptr>the door, came out and, asked what I wanted there; I said, "What is that to you?" he was dressed at that time: he sat on the cill of the door while I went about one hundred yards up the street; I then returned, and he was still sitting at the door - nothing passed between us; I went on leaving him sitting there, and I saw him in about a quarter of an hour, which was about a quarter before two o'clock, sitting down at the door, but did not speak to him; I did not see him again till a quarter after four - he was then between his own door and the next house; I did not notice whether his own door was open; I did not speak to him - he was dressed then, the same as he was at other times, as near as I can judge; I did not see him again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. At what time did you first come into Compton-street? A. About ten o'clock; I cannot tell whether I was there at half-past twelve, as my beat is in St. John-street - I cried half-past twelve in Compton-street; I do not know whether the clock had struck the half-hour - I was in Compton-street between one and two o'clock, and left it between one and two; I did not see Reilly with two women - when I saw him at the door, I said nothing to him about the noise, for I had heard noises so frequently between him and his wife, that I took no notice of it; they were continually quarrelling - I never quarrelled with the prisoner about a Christmas-box, or any thing else; I never applied for one at any house on his side of the way - I never had a dispute with him; but in discharge of my duty I have been obliged to go into his place, but I have been ordered out; he told me to trouble my head with my own business, but I had no dispute with him - I do not apply to people in his situation for Christmas-boxes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you hear a man and his wife quarrelling at half-past one o'clock in the morning, why not go in and ask what it was about? A. I had no business in his house; I am only a private watchman - the Police are in the neighbourhood.</p>

            . I am a surgeon and apothecary, and live in Coldbath-square, Clerkenwell. I was called in, on the 15th of June, by the parish officers, and saw the deceased about eight o'clock in the morning; she was laying on the bed, in a natural position, on her back, with some clothes on - with the assistance of my apprentice, I moved the clothes, and observed many integumental marks of bruises and contusious, more particularly about the face, head, and upper parts of the body - she had no cap on; her hair was matted with blood - there was a wound on the superior part of the head, extending through the scalp and pericranium, and exposing the crauium; it was of a triangular form, about an inch each way - there was another wound on the posterior part of the scalp, of a rounded form, and not extending through the pericranium; on making the usual incision to examine the head, which extends across it, from ear to ear, over the top, I found that the scalp, to a greater size than the palm of my hand, was already separated from the pericranium, and on my separating the integuments, black blood escaped, so that it was not perfectly coagulated; on removing the super or part of the cranium, I found a red blush on the dura mater, corresponding with the triangular wound on the intogument, which had denuded the cranium; the mark corresponds with the wound in situation and size, one being under the bone, and the other over it; I should think the wound must have been as recent as a few hours, the blood not having coagulated - there was a mark on the right hemisphere of the brain, corresponding with the triangular wound; there was some disease - the membranes covering the brain were thickened; the brain itself was very healthy and firm, and the cranium not fractured any where - on proceeding to examine the thorax, I could feel through the integuments, that many ribs were broken on each side, and ascertained that five superior ribs on the right side were fractured, about two inches from their termination, towards the front; these short broken ends of the bone were pressing on the lungs below - a quantity of coagulated blood was in the thorax on that side; it had effused from the lungs - there were about ten or twelve ounces, and about four ounces of it were in a coagulated state; on the left side nine ribs were broken, much more posterially than on the right, numbering from the second to the tenth, both inclusive; the broken part of the spinal ends of one or two of them had perforated the lung, and wounded it; blood had effused to something like the same extent as on the other side. I have no doubt, that although the fluid was then coloured with blood, that there was a deposition of water there before the injury; that is an evidence of some by-gone disease; I think it was on both sides, but certainly on the left; the quantity was not material, not to interfere with life - there was some adhesions on both sides passing from the lining of the ribs to the covering of the lungs; it is right to mention that, as they are evidence of discuse having existed some time or other, though, perhaps, not at the time of death; although this evidence of disease might interfere with enjoyment of the higher order of life, it could not cause death - on examining the left arm, the bone above the wrist was fractured - the end of the outer bone was considerably pressed from its situation; the outer bone of the leg was fractured three or four inches above the ancle - the scapulse on the right side was broken into many pieces; one other bone of the left hand was fractured about the centre; it appeared to me that the fracture of the ribs must have been inflicted by some large body; a poker, or any thing small would have left a corresponding mark; it must have been some larger body; as I could find nothing in the room to do it, I looked at the prisoner's shoes, which the Policeman showed me; I saw some blood on them, and fancy I can see some now, but it was more crimson then - there were a few hairs, which corresponded with the hair of the deceased's head, which I took with me for the purpose of comparing; they were very few in number; the prisoner had a slight cut on his fore finger; it was recent, and might have been inflicted with a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Would kicking. or trampling on the body of the deceased, have produced the effects you have described in the trunk of the body? A. I consider so; the broken fragments of the ribs had perforated the lungs, and on the eft side that was particularly manifest - I attribute the death<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050028"></xptr>to the pressure on the lungs, causing them to ooze out the blood which I found in the thorax; the ribs being broken, the least pressure would cause death - there was no protection for the lungs; the same act of violence which fractured the ribs would instantly cause them to perforate the lungs, which would cause instantaneous death - I saw a shovel with holes in it; I have no reason to think that had inflicted the wounds on the head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. The hair on the shoe and on the shovel had nothing to do with the mortal injury? A. I think not; the injury to the wrist and to the head had nothing to do with the death.</p>
               <p>Q. In short, your evidence is, that the injuries received by the deceased, on the ribs, were remotely the cause of death? A. They were the cause of death; the fracture of the ribs, and the perforation of the lungs, would be simultaneous; the great displacement of the parts convinces me that the lungs must have been perforated the instant the ribs were fractured.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be certain the ribs had not been broken some days before? A. Certainly; life could not have endured many minutes after such displacement had taken place, it must have been instantaneous, the broken ribs had overlaped, and the lung itself was so displaced as to be carried over the spinal rib, which pressed into it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in your judgment, she died from no fracture of the ribs, but in consequence of their perforating the lungs? A. One was the consequence of the other, the fourteen ribs being broken would certainly have caused death; she died from the fracture of the ribs, which caused the rupture of the lungs; if fractured ribs ever caused death, it certainly did in this case.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Could a person, having received the injury you have described, have come into the house alone? A. It is impossible; she never could have respired.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What do you suppose caused the wound on the head? A. I see no reason why kicks might not do it or trampling, that would also break the bone of the leg - there was no mark of any shoe nails; there are some nails in one shoe, but not in the bloody one - both have an iron tip at the heel - the deceased hadher clothes on.</p>
               <p>MR. MALLETT. I am clerk to the Justices at Hatton-garden. I was present at the examination of the prisoner on this charge; this examination is my hand-writing, and has the Magistrate's signature to it - it was taken down from the prisoner's mouth; I read it over to him - he did not sign it, but stated it to be correct, he first made the statement on the 15th - at the last examination the original statement was read over to him, and he said he had nothing to add to it; that was on the 22nd of June - he was called on by the Magistrate, to know what he had to say; I read over slowly to him what he had said, and he approved of it - no inducement was held out to him; he was not asked to sign it - (reads.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner says, "When I awoke she was laying in that state; the front door leading into the shop was wide open: I took her up in my arms, and that is the way I got that blood on my shoulder; I went up to my lodgers; I do not know at what time she came home; when I awoke at six o'clock she was laying there. I have nothing more to say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I consider myself entirely innocent of the charge - I have nothing more to say, but leave it to the Jury.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 212.) On the evening of 31st Dec. I saw the prisoner and another person, in Board-street, Ratcliff, coming in a direction from harrison's-court—the prisoner had something weighty in a handkerchief under his arm—he went into a marine-store shop in Board-street—the other waited outside—I went into the shop, and saw the prisoner put this lead into the scale—I asked where he got it from—he said he picked it up on Mr. Ray's wharf—I said I did not believe him—he then said, "I will tell you the truth; I did not steal it, the the other stole it off Mr. Ashcroft's cooperage; now let me go"—directly afterwards he said, "the other sent mo to sell it"—I took him to the station—he said the handkerchief was his.</p>

               <p>of the cooperage a few days before Christmas—a great quantity of lead was gone, and since then a considerable quantity more is gone—I have compared this lead with that on the top—about half of it corresponded with that lying in the gutter—about two hundred feet of lead has been lost.</p>

I am waiting for you;" I said, "I am very glad you are;" I took hold of his arm, thinking he was going home with me - we got about half way up Moorfields, and he said what was I going to do; I said I wanted to know how I was to get my rent and my things - he said he had not a halfpenny in the world; I said,"You will have no objection to go and see my husband;" he said, "I suppose you are going to put me into the Compter" - he gave me a shove, and ran off; I cried Stop thief! and a gentleman stopped him - I came up to him; he gave me another shove, and ran off again; he was not taken till last Friday.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Was the prisoner, during the whole time he was in your house, in the greatest possible distress? A. I never had any reason to think he was in distress - I sent for an officer on the 9th of September; that was to see for my property. and I took the duplicates - I should think there were fifty; I did not bargain that if he would give me the duplicates, and give security for the rent, that the officer should be sent away - I received the duplicates, and the officer went away; I said if they would give me a note of hand for 3l. I would forgive them the 1l. 15s. - some of the duplicates were not run out at that time, but it was not in my power to get the things out; I received a note of hand, and they remained between a week and a fortnight afterwards - my husband did not turn the prisoner out of his house without any covering for him or his wife, and say he would break his neck if he did not go out; I never received any money on the note of hand - his mother would not stand any more than 3l. for him; I did not agree to discharge him of all he owed me on receiving the security for the 3l. - I have not been to the prisoner since he has been in prison; I do not know whether my husband has - I do not know that my husband has offered to take 3l.; my husband has told the prisoner, when he was out of work, that he would employ him as a labourer, and he said he was not brought up to hard work - the prisoner was in work, holding up his finger at the back of an omnibus; I got a pair of sheets out for fear I should get no more, but I do not know that they belong to me.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner in Chiswell-street, and when I got him to the station-house, he said he was very much put about, and was obliged to pawn these things - he gave Mr. Wrecks a promissory note for the rent, and the property he had pawned.</p>
               <p>Witness for the Defence.</p>
               <p>JAMES BONNER. I am the officer who was sent for in September. The prisoner's mother and sister came there, Mrs. Wrecks said that he owed 3l. back rent, and if the mother would give a note to pay 1l. a month she would discharge them, and she said if they would give up the duplicate she would forgive them.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

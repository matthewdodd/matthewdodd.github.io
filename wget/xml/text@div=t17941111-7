               <p>Q. In what room? - My left hand room, which is my bed room.</p>
               <p>Q. On the ground floor or up stairs? - On the ground floor, level with the yard, it goes up three steps, when I saw Mrs. Hill lying across the bed I could not think what was the reason of it.</p>

            Was it the prisoner? - I believe it was. When that I had satisfied myself on looking on him I then run off to call for assistance I run out to Half Moon alley, and before I was out of the alley I saw a man, I heard him follow me, the moment I retreated I heard somebody run after me.</p>
               <p>Q. Your first account was that you saw a man stand by the side of the woman; where was the other? - His face was in the cupboard, a pilsering the cupboard, I saw his clothes. When I got from the house I run into Half Moon-alley, and called for assistance, somebody came to my assistance in a short time, I run up Mr. Morris's yard, when I got assistance we searched every where and did not find any body, I then came back to search the premises again, I was at the polishing shop, and somebody says, halloo! we have got him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you at that time? - I was in the polishing shop, on the same spot of ground, backwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business? - A looking glass manufacturer.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was at the back of your premises? - Yes, at the back of the ground, the front of the house faces the work-shop, I heard a voice say, halloo! I then came down into the yard, and see somebody have hold of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that person here that had hold of him? - I cannot say whose custody he was in, there was a number of people with lights, I cannot recollect whose custody he was in, and when that I see him I said, that was the man, and sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was it that this man was brought back? - About a quarter of an hour, I cannot say, it might be half an hour for what I know, I sent for Mr. Sapwell, I said, I had been robbed,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110020"></xptr>search that man, which he accordingly did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing found on him? - Yes, there was a watch and other things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. When did you see him searched? - Directly, a few minutes after.</p>
               <p>Q. You took the things from him? - Mr. Sapwell, the constable, did.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Croade. What did you find on him? - A watch, a pair of spectacles, seven gold rings, one knife, steel watch chain.</p>

            Is there any thing that leads you at all to suppose the manner in which these people got into the house? - No, but what Mrs. Hill said.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you made any observation of your own, how they got in? - No, I suppose they must get in at the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the watch? - I know what I gave for it, it may be worth two or three guineas, I gave five guineas for it, I have had it about a dozen years.</p>
               <p>Q. As you have had it so long as that, do you think it would sell for that? - I think it is worth three guineas to any one.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the chain, what is that worth? - The chain is of very little value, it is a common steel chain, worth two-pence or three-pence; the seal is worth about a penny; as to the spectacles I gave five<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110021"></xptr>shillings for them to Mr. Long, they would very likely sell for two shillings; the clasp knife one shilling is the worth of that, the three silk handkerchiefs they are worth about three shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a capital offence according to the amount of the value, therefore you must put a value on them; do you think these handkerchiefs worth no more than a shilling a piece? - No.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a veterinary surgeon, and live at Deptford. I have been in business since May last, and have lived in this house about three weeks—I succeeded my brother-in-law, Frederick Inglis, in the business, and Home wood was in his service—I went to the shop of Norris, who is a smith, in Church-street, Greenwich, and saw him, and saw my shoes hanging up—I went out of his shop, and wished him good morning—he locked his door and walked out with me—I saw a person, and told him the circumstances—I left Norris in the street, and about ten minutes after I returned, and told Norris that he had got some of my property—he said, "I have none"—I took them down, looked at about five pairs, and said, "These are all mine; but here is one small pair that I have made within a day or two; you will go with me to Homewood, and I will hear what he says about this"—he went with me to Homewood, who lived on my premises—when I got on my premises I called Homewood out, and showed him the shoes—I said, "You have been robbing me"—he said, "I have not"—I said, "You have robbed me, or made away with my property"—he said, "I have neither robbed you, nor made away with your property"—I said, "I shall give you into custody"—he said, "Don't be spiteful, I will tell you the whole truth; I have lent the horse-shoes to Norris, and that is all"—Norris said nothing, but I had heard Homewood say to</p>

               <p>Norris, "Say you borrowed them"—I marked the horse-show, and de<lb></lb>tained them—the prisoners went away—I said, "I shall find, perhaps, some more"—I had discharged Homewood on the 6th of July—this was on the 11th—he was not in my service then, but was living on the premises still—he had had a week's notice to quit—I had him apprehended in the course of the same afternoon—I never authorized Homewood to lend or give away my shoes—these are them—this is a pair of my own making, which I took from Norris's shop—they are pony shoes—I had not sold them—no one sells in the shop but me.</p>

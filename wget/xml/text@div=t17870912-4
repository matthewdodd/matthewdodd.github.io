               <p>(The Prosecutrix ordered out of Court.)</p>
               <p>I am a Surveyor; on the 20th of June last, I was with Mrs. Dealow; we were met by three men in Stepney Fields; who robbed both her and myself; one of them went up to her, and asked for her money; she made some trifling answer; either, that she had not much, or had none, or something of that kind; then says he, I must have your cloak; he took the cloak off.</p>
               <p>Had he any thing in his hand? - He had something of a hanger, or something of that kind, in one hand, while he took the cloak off with the other hand; he threw the cloak upon the ground, and one of the others took it up, and went away with it, and they all three went off.</p>
               <p>Did he roll the cloak up? - It seemed to be rolled up, and the other clapped it under his arm.</p>
               <p>What was his name? - Romaine.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner, was he one of the three? - I believe the prisoner was the person that took the cloak off; but I will not be thoroughly positive.</p>
               <p>When did you see him afterwards? - At the Justices Office; I don't recollect immediately when, but it was since the last Sessions.</p>
               <p>Did you know him again? - I did; I recollected his countenance, but not his dress.</p>
               <p>What was your opinion about him at that time? - Much the same as it is now; I told the Justice I could not positively swear to him.</p>
               <p>Look at him again, and tell me what you think at this moment? - He is very much like the person, but I do not chuse to swear positively he is the person.</p>
               <p>Was you positive as to Romaine? - Yes, I was rather positive, but not thoroughly as to him.</p>
               <p>You said you met the three men? - They first of all followed us, and then passed by us.</p>
               <p>How long might they be in the act of following and passing by you before you were robbed? - I suppose upwards of ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity then of observing them? - Yes, it was light enough, the moon was full out.</p>

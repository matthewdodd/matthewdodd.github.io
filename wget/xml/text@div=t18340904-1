               <p>SUSAN WILMOTT. On the 27th of July, I was going home to Turnham-green, at three o'clock in the morning - I was coming from my father's house at Hammersmith - the prisoner was with me - I had been walking about with him for about half an hour - it was not three quarters of an hour - I did not say so before the magistrate - as we went down the terrace, he put his arm round my middle, and felt down my side - I felt his hand in my pocket, he threw me down, tore my gown down, and broke the pocket from my side - I never saw him before that morning - I had met him at Hammersmith, and he said, if I would go with him to the Chaise and Horses, he would give me a glass of gin, as it was wet, which I did - I went along with him, and bid him good morning there; but, instead of his leaving me, he followed me across the road leading to the terrace, and there he threw me down, and took my money.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to walk with him? A. I had such a distance to go home, which took the time - I do not usually walk with people who offer me gin; but he said he was going to walk that way, and he was talking to me as he went along- I bid him good morning at the top of Turnham-green-terrace - he threw me down, tore my gown down, and took the pocket off my side - I am quite certain he took my pocket off, which contained five shillings, a sixpence, and 1 1/2d.; a snuff-box with Scotch snuff in it; a pocket-handkerchief, and a pocket-knife - I got up, and got my pocket from him again - he threw me down a second time - I got it from him, and he threw me down again, and got it from me, and said, if I called policeman again, which I had done before, he would cut my b-y throat - I called "Policeman," and Mynott, the policeman, came up to me - I am certain it was the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I heard a cry of alarm, on the 27th of July, as I was going towards Turnham-green-terrace - I heard shrieks of "Murder" - I went down the terrace, and saw the prosecutrix without bonnet or cap, with her hair all over her eyes - she ran up to me, and gave me information - while she stood talking to me, I saw the prisoner running up the road - I said, "Is that the man?" - she said, "I think it is" - I followed, and overtook him at the back of the Crown and Anchor - he had this pocket inside his bosom, with a handkerchief, penknife, three shillings, and five farthings, and a snuff-box in it - I took it from him - I have had them ever since, and produce them.</p>
               <p>SUSAN WILMOTT re-examined. This is my pocket which I had on - I have the fellow one on now - this is my knife - the strings are off the pocket now - he broke them off round my middle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning home, and it rained: going down Hammersmith, I saw the young woman standing under shelter - I stood under a few minutes myself - we got into conversation - she said she was very cold and wet - I said if she came over to the Chaise and Horses, I would give her a glass of gin - I walked down Hammersmith with her- when I got to Turnham-green-terrace, I missed 3s. out of my pocket - I accused her of taking it - she said she had not got it, and I took this money forcibly, having every reason to expect that it was my own - she screamed "Murder" - and I was taken.</p>
               <p>SUSAN WILMOTT re-examined. I tore his shirt in the struggle, and some of the money might have dropped from him, and he ran away above half a mile.</p>

He said he had taken her pocket from her side, but did not say what money he had taken - I found the pocket in his breast with the money, and in his pocket I found 4s. 4d. - he did not say he had lost 3s., nor complain that she had taken any money from him.</p>

I was at her room, in Half Moon-street, Bishopsgate, on the 2nd of May, with my brother and sister—I was cutting a bit of bread for my sister, and my mother took a knife and dug it into my head three times—she took my shawl off my neck, and said, "Is there any blood on it?"—I said, "No, mother"—she took her bonnet and shawl, and went out.</p>

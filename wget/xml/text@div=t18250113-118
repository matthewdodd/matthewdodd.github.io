On Sunday, the 19th of December, I had been to chapel in the evening and returned to the poor house - the prisoner let me in, and we went together to the kitchen, and sat down a few minutes by the fire, and he went out of the kitchen. I went up to bed and perceived that he was not in his own bed - we had usually slept in the same room - I thought he might be gone some other way, and I went to bed, but did not go to sleep - I then got up and dressed myself, and I found he had quitted the house, and left the gates unlocked and the keys in them. I alarmed the mistress - he had taken his own clothes away.</p>

            . I am a watchman at the lower end of Tottenham. On Sunday night, the 19th of December, I saw the prisoner about a quarter past eleven, with three bundles and this stick; two bundles were on the stick and one in his hand. I said</p>

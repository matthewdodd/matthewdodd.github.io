            ? - I do not know till I look, I have not looked at the papers; I produce two wills from the Prerogative-office, I received them from the records of the office.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. So all that you know, is that these are two papers that you have produced from the Prerogative-office? - Yes.</p>

               <p>- JONES sworn.</p>

               <p>I am a Proctor in the Commons, I know Mr. Bevan, he does business in the office I am in.</p>

               <p>Look at that will? - I have.</p>

               <p>What do you know of it? - I see nothing upon the face of it, to induce me to know it to be the will, I believe it to be so, and I have no doubt about it; in general wills have a jurata, this has not, it has been out of my custody several months, and therefore it is impossible I can speak of it with certainty, I have seen the will in the registry, but I do not know that is the very will that was put originally there, in the course of the prosecution in Doctor's Commons, the will was put into the registry; but whether that is the will, is impossible for me to say.</p>

               <p>When was it carried in, and by whom? - I judge by the indorsement, by one

            , clerk in the office, and I have no doubt, but that at the time it appears to be brought in, it was; but there is not any thing on the face of the will, that can induce me to say that this is the will that was tendered to the office by Mr. Bevan.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester to Mr. Hawkins. Are there any other wills of that name? - Not that I know of.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Jones. What time was the will that was delivered to you by Mr. Bevan so delivered? - I will swear that the will left by Mr. Bevan was in my custody previous to the 7th of May, 1784, which constituted the prosecution, for it appears to me that the citation citing Mrs. Stuport to bring in her probate, is dated the 14th of May 1784.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I need not go on with some more enquiries that I have, till it can be proved.</p>

               <p>Court. How comes it there is no jurata? - It was known there had been a probate granted to Mrs. Stupert, as the executor of her will, therefore the application was for a citation to bring in the probate.</p>

             sworn.</p>

               <p>Look at the will? - I have.</p>

               <p>What do you know of it? - I know that on or about the 7th of May 1784, this will, or I believe a will, was left at my office, and upon searching the registry, probate had been granted for a former will, in consequence of that, I see by my memorandum, because I took general instructions for a citation, to shew cause why it should not be declared null and void, and the probate revoked.</p>

               <p>Was this the identical will that was produced? - It is impossible for me to say, there is another gentleman in Court of the same profession, and he cannot say; I believe it to be the same will, I propounded in the cause on the part of Mr. Bevan.</p>

               <p>Who produced it to you? - To the best of my recollection, Mr. Jones brought it from hackney where he has a house, and Mr. Bevan is I believe his neighbour, Mr. Jones left it with me as I best recollect.</p>

               <p>Did you receive any will from the prisoner? - Upon my word I cannot say, Mr. Bevan came several times to me on this business, and consulted me, I told him what was necessary, and I know his application was in May 1784, whether he delievered it to me, and I delivered it to Mr. Jones, or whether he delivered it to Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110167"></xptr> Jones, and he took it to the office for instructions for the citation, I cannot positively say how I came by the will, I see I have as a matter of course taken instructions.</p>

               <p>From whose mouth? - That I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. Who did you receive the instructions from? - I cannot positively say, I do not recollect, but very possibly from Mr. Bevan himself, I could not take the instructions from Mr. Jones, though the will might be left to me for that purpose, I see I have taken these instructions with my own hand writing, which are generally taken by a clerk.</p>

               <p>Did you at any time see Mr. Bevan upon this subject? - I have seen him frequently upon the business.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. What past upon that occasion?</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. No, no, he does not know that that is the paper upon which the conversation passed?</p>

               <p>Court. You may ask whether he had any conversation about a will, but then the question supposes it to be that paper, which you are not entitled to do.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did you ever shew that paper to Mr. Bevan? - I do not recollect that I ever did shew it to Mr. Bevan, while it was in my office, it was brought into the public office for the inspection of Mr. Bevan or any other gentleman, but I do not recollect that I went with Mr. Bevan to shew it him; looking further into the memorandum, I see I have taken the date of the will, which I took the 6th of March, 1779, which is the date of this paper.</p>

               <p>Mr. Jones. The will that I took the instruction for the citation from was dated the 6th of March, 1779.</p>

               <p>Does it appear by your minute from whom you took the instructions? - No, it does not.</p>

               <p>Court. Is there any means by which you can indentify that particular paper now produced?</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. No, my Lord, I do not know that there are any particular means.</p>

               <p>Court to Jones. What means do you take in the Prorogative-office to authenticate papers, to prevent a substitution of one paper for another; for instance, now suppose one person should substitute another paper for the original will? - When wills are brought to the proctor's for the purpose of being proved, they lay there to be taken into the registry, the registry is searched to see that no former grant has passed, if it has, it is usual to take the original will back, then you take out a citation against the party who is in possession of that probate to bring it in, and some months after it is before you to bring it in, which is generally by affidavit of scripts, and the will is annexed; this will I find was brought into the registry, and there it remained in the custody of the register, the usual practice has been pursued in this cause.</p>

               <p>Court. No, it has not. - This is a seaman's business, and every expence is saved; the procto r also takes in the affidavit of scripts with the original will, it is of very little consequence whether he takes it in annexed to the affidavit or not.</p>

               <p>In this case it has not that? - The paper is identified to the register, he marks them in what they call an assignation book, takes down the date only.</p>

               <p>Court. The will you state does not identify that piece of paper, the date is no mark of the piece of paper? - The minute would be Bevan against Stupart, on such a day, Stupart brought into the registry the will, that is not marked at all.</p>

               <p>Court. The evidence is, that this is not the hand-writing of the party, now for ought it appears this may be a copy of that which Mr. Bevan brought, if there were circumstances which shewed this will produced could not be a genuine one, I certainly should not let the trial proceed.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. I am sure if your Lordship was to hear Mr. Bevan's witnesses, neither you nor any other person would have a moment's doubt of the innocence of the gentleman at the bar; and the parties on the side of the prosecution have been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178601110168"></xptr> putting him to all this pain and trouble without the least shadow of foundation.</p>

               <p>Court. All that we can say at present is, that there is no evidence laid before us to doubt of this gentleman's innocence.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, I have such a volume of witnesses in my brief, that if they were gone through would raise the astonishment and indignation of every person that heard of this prosecution.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, Mr. Woollstoncroft attends here to tell your Lordship that Mr. Bevan first applied to him, who was attorney to Mrs. Stupart, to desire his directions, that he was told Mrs. Stupart claimed a debt of ninety or a hundred pounds, and he asked Mr. Bevan what was willed, and Mr. Bevan telling him a few hundreds, he advised Mr. Bevan to pay her; said he, you had better make her an offer to pay her her debt, and get a discharge, rather than call in the will made to her, as the expences in law would be as much or more; this is what the prosecutrix now calls a compromise.</p>

               <p>Mr. Jones. It is becoming every man in this Court to say what he can; I mentioned two circumstances, the one is that the citation is dated the 14th of May, 1784, publication passed the 28th of July, and this indictment was not set on foot till the 14th of September last, after publication passed.</p>

               <p>Court. Then you cannot carry this any further.</p>

               NOT GUILTY
            </rs>.</p>

               <p>Tried by the London Jury before Mr. RECORDER.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bevan. My Lord, may I crave the favour of this Court to grant me a copy of the indictment, I have been exceedingly injured, my life as well as my property has been injured, and we can sufficiently prove that there has been a combination to extort money from me; a warrant was obtained, I suppose, more for that purpose than bringing me to this bar, but happily I escaped the villains that came to take me, and I came and voluntarily surrendered myself; my Lord, every thing that malice, that devilish malice could have done, has been done; therefore I hope I shall have a copy of my indictment, that I may be able to bring the prosecutors to justice, and I hope your Lordship will do it for the sake of public justice.</p>

               <p>Court. Mr. Bevan, the matter has certainly not proceeded in this case far enough to entitle me to comply with your request, for this reason, though it appears to the Court there is no ground for the charge, yet it does not appear to the Court, nor can it, whether the will produced in the Commons was a genuine will or not; the supposition of it's not being a genuine will may be perfectly consistent with your compleat innocence, for if this will was delivered to you by the brother, who claims the interest, it by no means follows, if it was not genuine, that you had any knowledge of it; but I cannot call this a malicious prosecution, until I have proof before me that it is a malicious prosecution.</p>



               <p>Mr. Bevan. My Lord, the not going into the evidence hinders this proof.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. It is my duty to stop a prosecution in its first stage, where a defect is found, but it does not seem to me to be of any importance to have a copy of the indictment; if you can trace out the offenders you may obtain satisfaction.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bevan. But when the sentence is passed in the Commons may not that be obtained.</p>

               <p>Court. The power of the Court will pass away with the Sessions, but I conceive it to be a mistaken idea that there must be a copy of the indictment, for, an action of conspiracy or for a malicious prosecution may be maintained without a copy of the indictment, granted by order of the Court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor and draper, and live in Westminster-bridge-road. A boy named Phillips came into my employ on Monday, the 23rd of January, and he remained till the Saturday following—I then gave him into custody—I missed the waistcoat in question at that time—this is it—the prisoner had been in my employ for two days about six weeks before, and knew what articles I dealt in—I discharged him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Causton, pawnbroker, Mount-street, Lambeth. I produce a waistcoat which was pawned on the 26th of January, by the prisoner for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in the name of Brown—the duplicate was destroyed in the other Court—I have not found it since the trial—the officer of the Court went and looked for it but could not find it.</p>

            . I am headborough of St. Luke's; when I apprehended the prisoner, I searched her and a box; I found nothing relating to the watch. Mrs. Straker missed some lace from a habit shirt of hers: I found the lace on the prisoners cap in the box; the prisoner said she took the lace and sewed it on her cap, to make Mrs. Straker a present of it.</p>
               <p>MRS. STRAKER. Q. You are the wife of William Straker. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the officer was giving his evidence about searching the box. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know it to be the prisoners box. - A. Yes, it was locked; I saw a cap found with lace on it, the lace is mine, it was upon my habit shirt; I do not recollect seeing it since. The Sunday before it was dirty I believe it was in the foul clothes bag, but I am not certain; the habit shirt was found in the prisoners box with the lace taken off; I knew the lace again, but there were no particular marks on it; I should not like to swear to it, I am sure it is the same pattern.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make her any promise of favour about the watch the night before. - A. I told her nobody should know of it.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What is the value of your watch. A. It cost me three pounds ten shillings, second hand, five or six years ago.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord - with most perfect consciousness of my innocence, I throw myself upon the mercy of the court and the jury. The watch which I am accused of taking, was perpetually left about the house, and in rooms through which many persons were passing. It is true I and many persons might have purloined it; but the rectitude of my conscience would not suffer me to do it. I ever protest my innocence with regard to the lace; - could it have been possible for me to commit a theft of the kind, I had frequent opportunities of so doing to a much larger value. The most perfect confidence was placed in me by the prosecutor and his wife. I have hitherto passed through life without a stain on my character. I trust in this instance I have not deviated from the principles of virtue and honesty, by which I have been brought up to from my infancy by my parents.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

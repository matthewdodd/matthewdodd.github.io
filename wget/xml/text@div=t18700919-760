I am a registered surgeon—I hare known this child twelve months—I attended it in September and October, for the whooping cough, and then again not till July—in July it was suffering from wasting away, from diarrhoea—that was the 10th, up to August the 4tb—the diarrhoea then stopped—at the latter part of my attendance I came to the conclusion it did not have sufficient food—I told the prisoner to give it up to the mother, or take it to the union—I said I should insist on her doing so—I spoke to the constable, and he said he could do nothing—I spoke to the curate of the parish, and I called on the 10th August, and found it had not been given up to the mother—she always said the mother was coming for it at the end of the month—I called on the 10th, got the mother's address, and gave it to a clergyman of the parish—I heard nothing of it till its death—I thought it had been starved to death; but I was told it died from diarrhoea—I am the pariah doctor—they might have had my assistance by sending for me at any time—I have attended the members of the family for a long time, and no complaint of the ill health of the child hid been made to me—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the child weighed 11 lbs.—it was terribly emaciated, and nothing in the body—I have heard that it was fond of feeding, and had a ravenous appetite—I attribute death to want of food, and I think if it had had it it would have prevented it—there was nothing particular in the bowels—the child was very weak and thin—there was nothing in the lower bowel—it was healthy—the stomach was full of gruel; it must have had food a few hours before.</p>

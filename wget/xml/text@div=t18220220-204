            . I am clerk at the Justice-room, Guildhall. I produce a pamphlet put into my hands, on the 27th of December, by Purton. The defendant was brought to the Hall, as the person which sold it to Purton; he was described in the warrant as a person, whose name was unknown, but whose person was well known.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. When he was brought to the office, did Purton say, that was the man he originally applied for the warrant about - A. He said that was the man who sold him the pamphlet - it was left in my hands to justify the warrant being issued; it was left in my possession before the warrant was granted.</p>

            . I am a constable, on the Bow-street establishment. On the 26th of December, I bought this pamphlet at Carlisle's shop, in Fleet-street, of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to learn his name - A. I tried to watch him from the shop; I went in and identified him when the warrant was issued - he is the person it was issued against. When I bought the pamphlet he was behind the counter, apparently serving, and behind the counter selling the same work when he was taken; there was a great many people about the shop then, and on the 27th, when I went with Harrison to take him, I did not learn his name till I got to the Justice-room. The book has my name on it, which I wrote on it a few minutes after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you messenger to the Constitutional Association. - A. I was employed by a gentleman named Sharp, who I have heard is connected with the association - I am not regularly employed by him; I have been employed to go no where but to Carlile's.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been concerned on any other business for Sharp, besides at Carlisle's shop - I have employed persons myself, on account of their determination to sell those books, and myself being known.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose determination - A. Why the people of the shop. I have seen placards in the shop to that effect</p>
               <p>Q. What was the nature of the placard. - A. That the address to the Reformers of the 24th of June was still to be had.</p>
               <p>The libel was here read; it was the same as that produced on Vamplue's trial. Page 213.</p>

               <p>PURTON re-examined. Q. At the time you came into the shop with the officers to arrest this man, did you say to any person, that the defendant was not the man who sold you the pamphlet - A. I deny it.</p>
               <p>Defendant. Q. Did you not buy the pamphlet when you came with the warrant - A. I told the officer I would buy a pamphlet of the person I meant, but that was not the book produced.</p>

            . I was housekeeper at Mr. Carlile's. When this man was arrested, on the 27th of December, I lived there; I had just come down to prepare dinner for the two men.</p>
               <p>Q. What two men - A. The man unknown, and the prisoner - I saw some one open the counter, and assume an authority, which I thought he had no business to do. I opened the door directly, and asked what he wanted; it was near one o'clock - he looked very contemptuously and made no reply. I asked him again what he came for, and he was talking to Purton, the spy.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by a spy - A. An informer; persons who go and buy these pamphlets to entrap them; they buy them and pretend that they understand them to be sedititious, and I heard Purton say to the officer,</p>
               <p>"That is not the man."</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he speak of - A. I suspect by the conversation that passed between them, that the man they wanted was gone away, and that the prisoner was not the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him whether he wanted that man or not - A. I did say something, but what it was, I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say to him,</p>
               <p>"This is not the man who you are going to take away" - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to say so - A. I did afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Be cautious what you say, you did not say</p>
               <p>"Do you mean the prisoner is not the man" - A. No, I did not. I heard the officer say to (Rhodes) the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"I have got a warrant for you." Purton was in the shop, I directly said,</p>
               <p>"If there is a warrant against you, hear it read, and see that it is in your own name" - his name is

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. That we may not differ about persons, is that the man, (pointing to him) who you call Purton the spy - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And is that man the officer with whom you had the conversation - A. I cannot say whether that is the person who arrested Rhodes, or the man unknown, he arrested one of them; there were two men arrested that day, within an hour, and I asked both officers to let them stay and dine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask the men, or Purton only - A. Oh! of course, I should not ask Purton to dinner, I only asked the officer to let the prisoner dine, the man unknown was arrested afterwards by another officer. I am married, I have lived at Carlile's since

               <p>Q. Have you the misfortune to be indicted for selling these pamphlets - A. If you call it a misfortune, Sir, I have, I would rather enjoy my own opinion, of course, and be indicted for it - there are two indictments against me.</p>
               <p>Q. Either of them for publishing Pain's works - No answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it for selling pamphlets, at Carlile's shop - A. Yes; I was shopwoman there for three months, that was in the spring - I left just before November. When the indictment was found against me, I was removed from the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You went away, and returned as housekeeper - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You talk of enjoying your own opinion, have you any belief in the Holy Scriptures - A. I shall not answer that, I do not think it a question I have a right to answer.</p>
               <p>COURT. The question is whether you believe the Holy Gospels, on which you have been sworn - A. When I am brought to trial, perhaps I may give my opinion.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who hired the prisoner and other man to serve in the shop - A. I did not; the prisoner had served there a very few days, I think not a week; the other man had only been there during the time the prisoner went, and the officer came back.</p>
               <p>Q. Well but how many days had he been backward and forward - A. That I cannot tell; I have seen placards in the shop - when there is any thing to sell people generally put up placards. I never saw one saying</p>
               <p>"This is the mart for blasphemy and sedition;" for I very rarely pressed myself in among the crowd, to see them - I swear I never saw it in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see it then - A. I saw it in my own hands, though whoever copied that placard out of the window did not copy the inverted comma's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say the words blasphemy and sedition were not there - A. I mean to say, I cannot say any thing about it; it was given me with many others that were given me for waste paper. The placard I speak of was copied in the newspapers, and I said</p>
               <p>"That placard had better be taken down."</p>
               <p>Q. I wish you to state again, what took place at the time Purton and the officer came into the shop, telling you I mean to contradict you if you speak untrue, and that you will hear of it in a different shape - now I ask you again, were you in the shop when Purton came in - A. I tell you I was in the little room, and saw the officer open the counter; Purton was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the officer say or do to Holmes - A. I have told you.</p>
               <p>Q. You must tell me again - A. No I will not.</p>
               <p>Q. I say you must - A. I will not.</p>
               <p>COURT. If you do not answer questions that are material, the Court will commit you for contempt. If you come forward as a witness, you must answer all fair questions.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What did the officer say or do to the prisoner when he came behind the counter - A. I told you that when he came behind the counter, I opened the door of the little room, and asked what he wanted, he turned round and made no answer, but said something to Purton, and, by their motions, I thought that they had got the wrong man, and that they wanted another man, who was gone away; then I asked him a second time, and he said to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182202200082"></xptr>the man</p>
               <p>"I have got a warrant for you." I told him to hear it read, and see that it was in his own name; then I asked him to let him stay and dine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Purton say or do any thing all this time - A. Something passed which I did not understand, for I retired into the little room.</p>
               <p>Q. I think I heard you say, Purton said that was not the man - A. Yes; that I did, and they also asked if there was any other woman there besides me; the man unknown was also in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he behind the counter at the time - A. Not at the moment, but he was coming down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that man before or after Purton said,</p>
               <p>"That is not the man" - A. I think it was before; I cannot say whether he was present. or not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On your oath, was not that man, whom you call</p>
               <p>"unknown," called by some Christian or Sirname - A. I do not answer that.</p>
               <p>Q. You can answer Yes, or No. - A. Then I must answer Yes; I called him by the name he went by, and the prisoner called him by that name also.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you advise that person not to give a name. - A. I never advise any thing.</p>

            . I am a Marshalsman of the City. I went with Purton, on the 27th, to apprehend the prisoner, at Carlile's shop; there was no name in the warrant. Purton was to go into the shop, and if he stopped I was to go in directly; I did - he was buying a book of the prisoner, and pointed to him. I took him; he gave a nod, and I lifted up a flap to stop him going into the room; I told him I had a warrant against him. Purton did not say</p>
               <p>"That is not the man." I had two warrants; the lady asked me to let him stop and dine. I said the Magistrate was sitting, and if he was gone he would be locked up till next day - she asked me a good many times to let him stop to dinner, and called the man down whose name is unknown, and then he put his hat on, and came away with me. When that man came down, Purton said</p>
               <p>"That is not the man."</p>
               <p>Defendant. Q. Did not Purton swear he bought the pamphlet of me the day before, that is the 26th - A. I do not know; I signed my name on the book he bought on the 27th - my name is not on the one produced.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In consequence of there being no name in your warrant, Purton went to shew you who the man was - A. Yes; he would not give his name at the first examination.</p>
               <p>JURY to PURTON. When did you buy the pamphlet produced in Court - A. On the 26th, here is my memorandum on it</p>
               <p>"Bought on 26th of December, of a short stout man, at the shop of R. Carlile." I wrote this within a quarter of an hour; before it was out of my possession; I have not written on the one bought on the 27th - there was no man in the shop like him, and I have seen him in the shop before.</p>

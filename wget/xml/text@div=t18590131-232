I am the wife of Richard Walsh—we keep a shop in Little Windmill-street—we sell sweets and cigars—on 8th January the prisoner purchased a cigar, he paid me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—on the following Monday he came again, and he paid for what he bought with copper money—on Thursday, 13th, he came again, asked for a cigar and offered me a half-crown—I told him I had got no change and I would trust him—I trusted him—he paid me next day—on the following Saturday he came again and bought three cigars—they came to 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a shilling—I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in change—I put the shilling in my pocket by itself—I had no other shilling—on Monday evening, the 17th, he came again and bought some sweet-stuff which came to a penny—he gave me the penny for that, and asked me to give him a half crown for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did so—I thought it rather singular, and I put the shilling I had in my pocket with the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and took them to a neighbour—I found they were all bad, and I put them by themselves—on Tuesday, the 18th, the prisoner came again, he asked for a cigar, and offered me a bad half-crown—I detected it immediately—I went round the counter and said to him, "You have passed a good deal of bad money on me; you must have thought me a natural fool"—I knocked at the door for my landlady and shut the prisoner in my shop—he got out, and I caught hold of him and pushed him into the shop again, and kept him until he was given into custody—I gave the half-crown and the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a school master. I have known the prisoner more than twelve months—he is a stationer and coal-merchant, and lived at 84, connaught-terrace, Edgware-road—his son was apupil of mine—his name was William Henry Duncan Stanynought—he was nine years old, and would have been ten in a few days—I saw him at nine o'clock the evening before his death—he was perfectly well—on the morning of the 4th of September I was sent for—a boy came to me who was in the prisoner's employ, about half-post eleven o'clock—I went over to his house imme<lb></lb>diately—I live very near him—In consequence of what I heard below I went up stairs immediately—I spoke to the prisoner from the outside of his champer door, and he answered me from within—he said, "Don't come in; pray don't come in, Mr. Finch, I shall shock you"—he said that in a very agitated tone—the room door was a little open—he said those words several times—I said, "Pray let me come in; are you ill? what is the matter?"—I then went in, and found the prisoner in bed, withy his son by his side, apparently asleep—I begged of the father to tell me what was the matter—he said, "I cannot tell you; I dare not tell you"—I entreated him earnestly to tell me—when he told me had killed his poor boy, that he had wounded himself, and that he was dying—I immediately said I would fetch a medical man, and asked who I should fetch—he wished me to fetch Mr. Barker, the medical attendant of the family—before I did so he pointed to some letters lying on a chair by the bed-side, and wished me to give one to Mr. Barker, and two other letters to his wife—I took up those letters and a knife which was lying on the chair, and a razor on the drawers, and put them in my pocket—I then fetched Mr. Barker—he had pointed to the knife, and told me it was the knife he had stabbed him<lb></lb>self witchy—there were marks of blood on it—It was partly covered with blood—I returned with Mr. Barker—we then examined the poor boy, and found he was quite dead—Mr. Barker examined the prisoner's wound—there was a slight wound on the boy's forehead—It appeared to me to be cut with a knife—It was a very slight wound—the face was partially black, and the features distorted—we removed the body into the next room, and the prisoner then told us how he had committed the murder—before that he said he had tried to destroy himself several ways, and had burnt charcoal three or four nights with that intent, but had been unsuc<lb></lb>cessful, and had tried to stab himself to the heart, and that was unsuccessful—he then said the boy awoke up in the night with the smell of the charcoal, and after that he had suffocated him with the pillow—the body of the child was quite warm—Mr. Barker then left me with the prisoner, and I had some</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183509210094"></xptr>
               <p>conversation with him—he was very much agitated during the time of the conversation I had with him, and appeared in very great agony—I told him the boy had been a very affectionate child to him—he said "Yes, he was an affectionate child—there was not his equal—there was not a fault in him"—"that boy(said he) has been the greatest consolation to me, when I have been in tears—he has come and consoled me"—he was a very affectionate child, and I never saw a Kinder father than the prisoner—the prisoner then la<lb></lb>mented what he had done—saying, "How could I do it?—how could I kill my poor boy?"—then again be would justify what he had done by saying the Almighty was not angry with him—that he had done a worthy deed—that it was a charity to kill the poor boy, for he would have been an idiot, and miserable for life, and afficted as his father, his grandfather, his great grandfather, and all his family had been—he said his father was blind at thirty—that his grandfather died in a madhouse that himself was grey, and his brothers hair was grey; and he dwelt very much on his family being afficted with this terrible malady—his great desire seemed to be for some body to destroy him—he wished for prussic acid, and was in very great agony—I had frequent opportunities of witnessing his conduct to his son, and I never observed a more kind and affectionate father.</p>

               <p>health, or the most distant prospect of it, life could alone be painful to me.—Yours very truly,—H. <hi rend="smallCaps">STANYANUGHT</hi>."—Wednesday evening.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARKER</hi>. I went immediately with Mr. Finch, and found Mr. Stanynought in bed, with his shirt smeared with blood, which had issued from a wound on the left side of him body, which he told me he had in<lb></lb>flicted on himself; and the dead body of the child lay by his side—having ascertained that the wound had ceased to bleed, and was not of an immedi<lb></lb>ate dangerous nature, I inquired into the cause of it—he told me he had plunged a knife into his side, and that he had destroyed his own child—that he had meditated doing so for a length of time, and had been most miscrable for many years—that he had brought the child from Gravesend on purpose to accomplish it—that he had burnt charcoal for several suc<lb></lb>cessive nights for that purpose, and that on the night in question, failing to accomplish it by that means, he struck the boy with a boot—jack on the forehead, placed a pillow on his head, and amothered him by that means—I examined the body of the child which was lying on its right side, with the face towards the bed—It was livid, and the face somewhat swollen—the mouth open, the tongue protruded, and there was a cut in the centre of the forehead—I ascertained that the wound had divided the integuments only down to the bone, and had done no injury—I have no doubt, from the ap<lb></lb>pearances, that the child had been suffocated—the prisoner's own wound was an incised wound on the left side of his body, in the chest, and had penetrated several inches—It was a very narrow escape of life—It was doubtful at the time, what would be the result—I left him in the care of Mr. Finch, and called some of his friends, who applied to a Magistrate—a police officer was sent to take care of him—I had another conversation with him, in the presence of another medical man, who I sent for—he had stated at the previous conversation, that he had alluded to some peculiar weaknesses—he said he had no objection to mention them to a medical man, they were of a private nature he said he had had them for many years—they had been sources of peculiar distress to him; particularly a weakness of the genital or<lb></lb>gan, as he expressed it, and his son inherited weaknesses of the same nature, and they had been sources of deep misery to him—he rather recapitulated what has been stated by Mr. Finch—I remember his saying he was now most happy, and was more quiet and tranquil, at that period than he had been for some months—from all that I observed, I have not the slightest doubt, but he was in an unsound state of mind at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FINCH</hi>. This is the letter he gave me for his wife—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"My dearest Lucy,—In my last moments I have to beg of you not to give way to despondency; this is the happiest moment I have long known. My poor little boy was doomed to suffer all his poor father, grandfather, great grandfather, and great—great—grandfather suffered before him; this has been the chief cause of my misery. I could not endure the thought; I never knew what it was to be happy, but have been acquainted always with desponding misery; my nerves unfit me for this world; to see my son nervous beyond any other child I have ever known, distracted me beyond redemption, and I inwardly feel that I am accomplishing the only action of my life for which I entertain any regard. Adieu, adieu, my blessed wife, may you never know the hundredth part of my sufferings. Kiss my two dear children.—H. <hi rend="smallCaps">STANYNOUGHT</hi>."</p>

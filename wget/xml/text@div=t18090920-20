He took me to the compter, there I saw him. We found the remaining part of the carpet in the city road.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, I live at No. 30, Barbican. On the 7th of August, about a quarter before two, the prisoner came and offered to pledge a remnant of carpet for half a guinea, he stated that it was worth seven or eight shillings a yard; I asked him what he gave for it, and not seeing it cut like a workman, I then asked him again how he came by it; he said Lord, Lord, what do you ask me that question for. I sent my young man to shut the side door, an officer passing at the same time I called him in; in the mean time I went to the door, he jumped over the counter, from the box, of my side. When the officer came into the shop he told him he worked with a Mr. Cross in Aldersgate-street, an upholsterer; I sent for Mr. Cross; he came; he said it was none of his, nor did he know the man. The carpet I gave into the hands of Leadbetter.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday the 7th of August, a little before two o'clock, I was passing along Barbican, the pawnbroker came to the door and called me in, he said there was a man there had a piece of carpet, he believed he had not come honestly by it. I asked him how he came by it he said he bought it of a man in the street, he gave either five or nine shillings for it, I am not sure which I took him to the compter in company with Mr. Richardson, we enquired at the different brokers in broker-row we came to Mr. Mullett; he said he had sent his porter out with different patterns of carpet, he had not returned; I told him we had put him in the Compter; he went with me to the Compter, and said he was his porter; we found the other carpets with a barrowwoman in Featherstone-street.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought that piece of carpet of a man with a one horse cart, going along the street. I do not know him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a musical composer. At a quarter to one on Friday morning, the 17th of May, I was coming from the Italian Opera House—I got half-way down Bond-street, and was accosted by the prisoner—I desired her to go about her business—I was exceedingly unwell—at the corner of Burlington-street the prisoner put her arms round my neck—two men were standing on the steps—they inquired the way to Holborn—I told one man—I put my hand up to my neck, and discovered I had been robbed of my two diamond pins—the prisoner ran away—I went on—I saw a police<lb></lb>man—I told him, and described the prisoner—we went down Bond-street in quest of the prisoner, and met her in the middle of the carriage-road, oppo<lb></lb>site Bond-street—I gave her in charge—I went back to Piccadilly, and the pins were found exactly on the spot where she was charged—I am sure of that—these are them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable C</hi> 172.) I met the prisoner in Bond-street, just opposite Stafford-street—she was charged with the robbery just at the bottom of Old Bond-street, in Piccadilly—I took her to the station, and went back to the spot where I took her, and saw the prosecutor take up these two pins near a plug-hole at the bottom of Bond-street, where the prisoner had been standing—she could have dropped them there.</p>

            </rs>, on the 8th Instant. Mrs. May swore, That her Husband had been arrested by one Exton a Bar , and kept in his Spunging-house till he had made up his Business; which having done, as they were going along the Street together a few Days after, while she stood talking with a Friend, her Husband was gone; and she having been inform'd by Exton there was another Action against him, went to his House, and ask'd if he was brought in there; which they denying, she desir'd to see their Prison-Rooms; and accordingly that Blandford, whose Husband is Exton's Follower, went up along with her; and Leeson, who lodges in the House, would go with them. Having seen a Room or Two, she desir'd to known if there was not another; which Blandford shew'd her, and as soon as Leeson and she were in together, fasten'd the Door, and went a way laughing. As soon as she was gone, Leeson flung her upon the Bed, and clapping one Hand upon her Mouth, endeavour'd to force himself between her Legs; which not being able to do, he took his Hand from thence, and putting both his Hands to her Privy-parts behind, did by force enter, and had carnal Knowledge of her Body, she crying out all while, but no Body coming to her Assistance till it was over, when Blandford open'd the Door laughing, and said, Captain, you are a Man Midwife, I hope you have grop'd her well; Come, come, Mrs. May, the Captain's a handsom Man, and you are a pretty Woman, and I hope you have got a pretty Child. That then she came down, and complain'd of the Injury done her, and so went home, where she told how she had been us'd. She produc'd a Witness, who declar'd that when she came home she told her she was undone for ever, and had receiv'd Damage in her private Parts; and that she making Inspection, found a Scratch, and the Parts somewhat red, as if Violence had been us'd. Her Mother depos'd to the same purpose; and a Surgeon swore, That there was a Scratch, and a sort of Inflamation in those Parts. Leeson in his Defence said, That he had never seen Mrs. May is his Life before; and that when he went up stairs with her, it was at her own Request. And to prove this, he brought serveral Witness, who swore she thrust her self into his Company, and would not be quiet till he went up Stairs with her; and when be had been up once, she told him she beliv'd he was no Man, for if he had he would have given her something and therefore she long'd to go with him again, and in a manner forc'd him to go; And one swore she heard her say, Come, Captain, they say you are a Man Midwife, pray feel my Body; after which, when they came down Stars, she sat in his Lap, kiss'd him, and was so very fond, that he grew uneasie, and would be gone; and that she seeing him going, would go along with him, and he could not be rid of her. There were two Midwives swore she had no Damage that they could perceive, and a Surgeon depos'd that she did not seen to have any Damage by a Force, but upon search he found she was clapt; and upon searching Leeson, which he had done twice since, he found him very sound. There were other Witnesses who said she was a Woman of a scandalous Life, and one swore he heard her Husband tax her with clapping of him. He then brought several Gentlemen who gave him a very good Character as to his Behaviour in Dublin College, in the Army, and elsewhere. Blandford also had some who gave her a good Character. After all which were heard, May call'd Witnesses to her Reputation, who gave her the Character of a very industrious, honest Woman; amongst whom was a Minister, who marry'd her to her Husband about 8 Years ago, had administer'd the Sacrament to her, and heard among her Neighbours that she liv'd a very honest, regular Life.

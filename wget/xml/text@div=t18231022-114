The prisoner lodged in my house for five weeks, in the top room; these sheets were in a basket in a lower room - I missed basket and all, about eight o'clock in the evening of Saturday, the 4th of October - they were safe ten minutes before. I did not see her again till Tuesday, when I found her at a public-house, and gave her in charge - she had given no warning; her husband went to look for her, and he never returned.</p>

            . I was in the street, near Bond-street. about eleven o'clock at night, and saw the prisoner with a sheet round her, and another round her knee - she asked me to buy them. I told her they were Morris's, as I knew she lodged there; she said a gentleman gave her a guinea, and she had taken them out of pawn. I said Morris would transport me, if I bought them. I told him of it next morning - we both lived with him once.</p>

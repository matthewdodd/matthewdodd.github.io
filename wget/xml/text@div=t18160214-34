On the 9th of February last, at about half past five in the evening, I had left my shop about three minutes, and my wife said she saw a man run away with the handkerchiefs. These handkerchiefs hung on a line with the door. I ran immediately, and saw the prisoner running about eight or ten doors off. I ran up to him, and heard a boy cry, stop thief, and the prisoner then quickened his pace. I still pursued him, and cried stop thief several times. At length he was stopped by Mr. Coney, and I insisted upon taking him back to my own house. I saw the handkerchiefs afterwards.</p>

            . I am a stay and corset maker. On the 9th of February last, at about half past five in the evening, I was standing at my door, and heard a cry of stop thief! which drew my attention, and shortly after I observed a man running. I live about twenty doors from the prosecutor. He who was running was running in a direction from Mr. Hardy's house; in the middle of the road. The man in the middle of the road threw a parcel behind him, which struck me in the lip. I did not stop to pick it up; but pursued the prisoner. and took him and brought him back to Mr. Hardy's. Mr. Hardy was following me.</p>

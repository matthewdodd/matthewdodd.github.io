               <p>Q. Do you recollect the day of the week.</p>
               <p>Viator. Tuesday at five o'clock in the afternoon; he has two rooms, his bed is on the back room, I went into the back room, he locked the door of the fore room and put the key in his pocket; then he came into the back room and threw me by force on the bed, and he lay with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Viator. Nothing at all, he put his hand upon my mouth and stopped my crying. I could not speak, he offered me a gown, a silk cloak, and half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>Viator. As he lay with me.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he lay with you?</p>
               <p>Viator. He came into my body of a sudden, and hurt me very sadly, and I was wet; he lay with me a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was at home?</p>
               <p>Viator. Nobody, but my mistress and Lucy Jones, and the other apprentice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell it to them?</p>
               <p>Viator. I told the maid first.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told your mistress of it?</p>
               <p>Viator. She did first on the same night. My mistress said dont you tell your father, for if you do, he will ruin me and kill you. She repeated it several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found yourself disordered?</p>
               <p>Viator. Yes; I have the foul disease.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you ever know a man before?</p>
               <p>Viator. No; never.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason had you why you did not tell your father before this?</p>
               <p>Viator. Because my mistress made me so frightened. I complained to the maid and my mistress the same day.</p>

            . I put my daughter apprentice to Mrs. Ryan, in Great Castle street, Oxford Market; she was to exempt her from all house work. I gave her five pound; my daughter came home often, and said she did but very little of that work, but her mistress sent her on errands, &amp;c. I told her mistress not to go on so. She complained about lying in the rooms, without locks to the door, when they had so many men in the house; as sometimes they had five or six. My wife sent always to fetch her home; she lay there ten weeks at the beginning; she always laid at my house afterwards. On Good Friday Miss

            ; I had heard it a fortnight before from my wife. I went to Mrs. Ryan's; her apprentice denied she was at home, though she was. I desired she would call upon me next morning, which she did. Next morning, Saturday, she came with another man that lodged in her house. I told her of what I had heard, of her ill treating of my daughter. I said she had disposed of my daughter to Phillips, and if she would not give me an account where he lived, I would prosecute her; she said she would know where he lodged. I went to several places, and could not find him. Last Saturday se'nnight was the first time

On the night of the 23d of June I went to bed about twelve o'clock - my doors and windows were perfectly secure. I was alarmed at four o'clock in the morning, by the watchman; I got up, and went down. My house was under repair; the prisoners lived next door, at No. 19: I have a parlour behind my shop - it is separated from the shop by a door, which I locked that night, and had the key in my bed-room. Upon getting up I found my shop rifled. I lost nearly one hundred yards of broad cloth, and other property - in value above 100 l. in all, and have recovered all but about 40 l. worth. I received information from the watchman, and placed people to watch the back and front of the prisoner's house. I received information from my son, Philip, which led me to suspect the prisoners. I went to Queen-square a little before six o'clock - Pace returned with me, and examined my premises; we got a search-warrant, and searched the elder prisoner's premises, and in the cellar found in a large grape jar some black silk twist, and four remnants of cloth, containing nine or ten yards in all - in another part of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150004"></xptr>cellar I found some of the property in a sack, and the rest tied in bundles; part of them have been returned to me: Woodbury has had possession of the rest. The elder prisoner had called at my house two or three days previous to the robbery; I was at the door as he passed, and he said, "Mr. Woolf, you are having a grand alteration made here;" I asked him to walk in to look at it, which he did; and the afternoon before the robbery he came in and went back, and asked the workmen to lend him a screw-driver. About five o'clock on the morning of the robbery I saw him looking out of his window - it might be ten minutes past five; the alarm had then been given. The elder prisoner is a carpenter - his son lives with him. There is a cow-house behind my house; the loft window of which looks into my yard. My shop ticket still remained on the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How long have you lived there? A. Twelve months. I believe he has lived there seven years - one Ratcliff lodged with him. I saw Ratcliff looking out of window at half-past five o'clock; I do not know whether he had his shirt sleeves up - I believe they were. I searched the premises about eleven o'clock; the elder prisoner and his wife were there: I told him what we came about; he said we might search, but should find nothing. When we asked for a light one was brought. Pace asked him to go into the cellar with us, which he did, and was then taken into custody; his son was taken soon after.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The door between the shop and parlour was broken open - but how did the persons get into your house? A. The box of the lock of the parlour door was wrenched; the back of my house was quite open to the yard, as an alteration was being made; any one in the yard could come into the parlour without obstruction, and a ladder had been put down from the window of the hay-loft of the cow-house into the yard.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Sparkes, a cow-keeper. On Friday morning, the 24th of June, a few minutes before four o'clock, I went to the cow-house to work, and when I got there I found the door open, which was shut overnight - a ladder was taken from the cow-house; it was there at night. I went to the bay-loft window, which looks into Woolf's yard, and saw the ladder there - any one could get down by the ladder from the window into the yard. I found a piece of shalloon on the floor of the loft; I also found some remnants of kerseymere and other things in the loft; Mr. Woolf took them. On finding the ladder moved I alarmed the watchman - he came to the loft, and saw what I have described.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Plunkett gave me information on the morning of the 24th of June; I went to Mr. Woolf's, and alarmed him. At half-past one o'clock that morning I saw two persons, seventeen or eighteen years old, come out of Hop-gardens - I knew one very well; his name is Reedy. I did not particularly notice the other; it was not day-light: I did not speak to them, not suspecting them; the cow-house is in Hop-gardens. About ten minutes afterwards I went to this spot again, as the lamps had not been lighted that night, and I saw another young man going out of Hop-gardens into St. Martin's-lane - I took it to be the younger prisoner, and knowing that he kept company with the others, I thought they had been together; I believe it to have been him. I went and tried the cow-house door several times - it was all fast at three o'clock, which was the last time I tried it. I could not see into Woolf's yard. When I called four o'clock a milkman called to me, saying there had been a robbery, and shewed me the cow-house. I called Woolf, and went into the cow-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not one of the lads named Roody? A. Reedy or Roody, as I have heard - I knew him by sight, and knew they kept company with the younger prisoner. I have driven them off my beat several times.</p>

            . I know the younger prisoner. On the 24th of June, the morning of this robbery, I saw the younger prisoner going to work, with a board under his arm - I was at my own door, No. 41, Bedfordbury; I did not speak to him. About half-past ten o'clock that morning I saw Woolf's son taking candles into Rippen's house, to search, and knowing where young Rippen worked, I went to him, and said, "Bill, what have you been about, they are searching your father's place?" he said, "Are they?" and scratched his head; I said they were: he said he thought how it would be. I asked him if John Reedy, John Flannergin, and Davy were in the robbery; he said they were, and told me to go up and see how it went on, and then to come and let him know. I then left him, went home, and told my mother of it. I then went down to young Rippen, and found him in custody of Woolf's son.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he told you who committed the robbery, and that he knew nothing of it? A. Yes. I knew him very well, and the others by sight.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. On the morning of the 24th of June Mr. Woolf came to my house - I went with him, and found his shop in confusion - the parlour was under repair, and open to the yard. I examined the door between the parlour and shop very minutely; the box which holds the catch of the lock had been forced aside. I found a chisel on the bench in the parlour; it exactly corresponded with the marks. I then went into the yard, and found that a ladder was let down from the hay-loft window of the cow-house, as if the parties had got in that way. I found there was a vacancy over the cow-house door in Hop-gardens; it is a yard and a quarter long, and fifteen inches wide, sufficient for a person to enter. I desired Rottenbury to examine the back of Woolf's premises in Hop-gardens, and placed Woolf's son to look after Rippen's house while we went for a search-warrant - I went to Rippen's house with Woodbury, about a quarter past eleven o'clock; Rippen, sen. and his wife were at home: I read the warrant to him; he said he knew nothing about it, and it was very strange Mr. Woolf should suspect him. We proceeded to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150005"></xptr>search the house; we searched the parlour floor, and then asked for a light to go down stairs; young Woolf fetched a light from his father's: Woodbury took it into the cellar; Rippen and his wife remained with me in the parlour - and in half a minute Woodbury hallooed out, "Pace, it is all right." I then took Rippen and his wife down stairs, and saw Woodbury pull some silk twist and cloth out of the jar. I handcuffed Rippen in the cellar, and in a recess in the cellar, between the front vault and a kind of back kitchen, he found the rest of the property - it was in a very dirty hole. We sent young Woolf and Woodbury to apprehend young Rippen, in consequence of information. We brought the property up stairs, and Mr. Woolf claimed it; we took it to the office, with the prisoners: the Magistrate ordered Mr. Woolf to have most of it back, and Woodbury has had the rest ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not appear astonished at the charge? A. He certainly did; he did not object at all to my searching, but declared most solemnly that he knew nothing about it, both before and after it was found; he appeared much agitated: both he and his wife offered every facility to the search.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found some of the property in a jar? A. Yes; there was a little barley: there were fowls in the yard. I suppose it was to feed them. I found the rest of the goods in a recess at the foot of the stairs - the recess has a door to it; it could not be seen without opening the door: the jar had a lid on.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Could the stolen property be conveyed into the recess without being taken through the prisoners' house? A. There is an area at the back of the house; it could be conveyed through there into the cellar.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. On the morning of the 24th of June I was sent by my father to watch the back of Rippen's premises; it was as soon as the alarm was given, a little after four o'clock - it was quite day-light. I saw Rippen, sen. look out of the staircase window; he was dressed, but without his coat, and had his shirt sleeves up; I think he saw me. I was there when the watchman was calling five o'clock; I then heard a man and woman talking in a kind of back kitchen, on their ground floor, on a level with the pavement; I heard a female voice say, "They are on the watch now," and heard the man distinctly say, "D - n their eyes, let them watch - we have got it safe enough here." I had never talked to Rippen, sen., except saying, "Good morning," or so. I have often heard him talking to his children, and was familiar with his voice; I really believe it was his voice. I told my father immediately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were you when you saw him at the window? A. In Hop-gardens; his house is at the corner of Hop-gardens; I was standing there when I began to hear the conversation, but went near to listen. I was walking up and down, a yard or two front his house - he has no yard; there was nothing between my house and his. We were not on terms of intimacy - I have heard him speaking to his family. They talked loud enough for any one to hear.</p>

            . I am governor of Tothill-fields Bridewell. The prisoners were committed there on the 24th of June. On the 1st of July Mr. Markham, the committing Magistrate, sent word that young Rippen might have a sheet of paper, and on the 2d of July he applied for one - I went to him; he had pen and paper: I left him entirely to himself: I neither threatened or promised him any thing. He returned this written paper to me (looking at it;) I am certain this is it: I saw him writing, and after he had done he delivered it to me.</p>

               <p>SIR - On Friday evening I went out with my mother and father, for a walk, about eight o'clock, and returned a little after nine. A little after ten I was shutting up my father's shop, and I met

            , and a lad they call Dave - they asked me to go to a public-house in Chandos-street, and have something to drink; I said I could not go: they asked me to lend them some halfpence - I told them I had none. I gave them a silver sixpence, and they gave me threepence out, and then they went away. At eleven o'clock I went to bed, and about half-past twelve I heard somebody knocking at the shutters, calling Bill - I answered, "Who's there?" and John Reedy said, "It is me, I want you, come out." I got up, and went out - they told me they were going to rob Mr. Woolf's; they asked me to come with them, and I went; they went away, and came again at two o'clock, when Dave got into the cow-house, through a hole over the door, and unfastened the door - they went in. We all went up into the loft, and John Flanergin John Reedy, and Dave all went into the yard of Mr. Woolf's house; I stopped in the loft: they brought the cloth into the loft, and all came up. They said that the cow-man would soon be there, and asked me to let them put it into my father's kitchen while they fetched a coach to put it in - I said, very well, and left them in the cow-house I went in doors, and John Reedy took down one of the kitchen shutters, and shoved it in the window. They did not come for it, so I put it into the cellar, and I have not seen them since. I can tell where they live, but do not know the names of the streets.</p>
               <p>WM. RIPPEN.</p>
               <p>After I had put it into the cellar I went to bed till my father got up and came down stairs, and knocked at the door, which was about six o'clock. My mother nor father knew nothing about it till it was found.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH WOOLF. These are my property - the cloth has the number on it, and my shop ticket, with my private mark. I know it all. The value of what is found is 60 l. or 70 l. I always thought the elder prisoner a very honest worthy character.</p>

            . On the 23d of June I lodged in the prisoner Rippen's house - I am a silversmith. On the morning of the robbery I got up early, being very busy; I got up about a quarter past four o'clock: my journeyman called me up. I dressed myself; I live on the first floor. I keep a shop over the kitchen, and a sleeping room in front; I had no coat on, and think my shirt sleeves were turned up. I looked out of my workshop window, and saw one or two of Mr. Woolf's sons - young Rippen slept in the parlour below, and the father and mother at the top of the house. I went into the front room at intervals, seeing persons watching the house; I was at home<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150006"></xptr>till nine o'clock; I looked out of the stair-case window also. Old Rippen might come down stairs without my hearing him - I met him on the stairs about a quarter before or a quarter past six o'clock, coming down from his bed-room; there are other lodgers. I had not seen or heard of him till I met him on the stairs.</p>
               <p>PHILIP WOOLF re-examined. I am quite positive that old Rippen is the man whom I saw looking out of window - it was just before the watchman called five o'clock. I know the last witness by sight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What window was it? A. The stair-case window, which looks into Hop-gardens. I did not see the last witness looking out of his window, to the best of my knowledge, but there are two windows looking into Hop-gardens, his and the stair-case. I only saw him at the stair-case window.</p>
               <p>HENRY RATCLIFF re-examined. I did not see Rippen at the window that morning. I saw Philip Woolf several times when I was looking out of each window, both at the back and front of the house.</p>

            . I lodged with my husband at Rippen's at this time, and slept on the second floor back room - Rippen slept on the third floor, above me - there is only a thin partition between me and the stair-case; nobody can come down without my hearing them. I saw Rippen and his wife go to bed rather before eleven o'clock - I heard him come down stairs about a quarter past six. I sleep very light, and must have heard if any one had come down.</p>

            . I am the last witness's husband. On the morning of the robbery, at near three o'clock I was awoke by something, and remained awake till near six; no person could come down stairs without my hearing them. Rippen always awoke me when he came down. - I went out at six o'clock, and he had not come down then. I heard Ratcliff open his shutters about a quarter past four.</p>
               <p>Several witnesses gave the elder prisoner an excellent character.</p>

I went round the corner to let the mob pass - some people surrounded me, and I found the prisoner's hand in my pocket - he had hold of the notes; the button was cut from my pocket. I took his hand out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the notes in his hand when you took it out - A. Yes, I kept hold of him. The mob dragged me into the Fountain passage, and knocked me down; I saw him hand my notes over to a companion - I never got them again. I never lost sight of the prisoner until he was secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Which way were the mob coming - A. Up Wych-street, across Newcastle-street; I was knocked down by two of them after I had laid hold of him. I got up immediately, and collared him again. I charged nobody else with it.</p>
               <p>Q. When he stopped you he desired you to go into the public-house with him - A. Never, the mob dragged me into the passage - I cried out Murder! The publican opened the door to let them in, and they called for beer. I sat with them to prevent the prisoner from getting away, and sent for an officer; I told the officer that I saw him give the notes to another man, who ran down the street. I should know that man again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go before the Magistrate - A. I went before Mr.

             that evening - this was Monday. He was to come and have another hearing on Thursday; he appeared there, and Mr. Birnie told his clerk to tell me to go to Hicks's Hall to the Grand Jury - the prisoner was let go then.</p>
               <p>Q. He was discharged by the Magistrate, and you had him taken up the night before last on a Judge's warrant - A. I had him taken up - he was at his own house. He gave his address to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any witnesses to the Magistrate - A. No, that was the reason he was discharged. I have witnesses to-day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you got the constable here who apprehended the prisoner - A. No, they wanted to make money of me.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Did Rock go before the Grand Jury with you - A. No, he is quite a gentleman. I never found him till yesterday; he then gave me his card. He saw me robbed, but was afraid to speak.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you was robbed did you see Rock - A. Not till Yesterday. I met him in the street the night before last - he did not come to my house.</p>

            . I am a builder, and live in Angel-court, Strand. I do not know Sullivan, only by seeing him selling fowls about - I have seen him about the neighbourhood for ten or twelve years. I was coming home on the 1st of November, and saw a crowd towards the bottom of Newcastle-street. Sullivan cried out Murder! - he had hold of the prisoner's hand, and said he had robbed him of ten 1 l. notes. They went into the Fountain, public-house - I did not see any body strike him. I could not get into the public-house for the crowd, and so went home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the man where he could find you - A. I left my name at the Fountain, in case I should be wanted to give evidence. His wife called at my house yesterday, and begged I would come down. I did not know the prisoner before, but I am sure he is the man. I saw no notes in his hand. I only know Sullivan had hold of him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The man's wife called at your house last night - A. Either his wife called last night or the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever spoken to the prosecutor in the street since the robbery - A. No; I have seen him about the street but never inquired of him about it.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you never been at Serjeant's Inn - A. Yes. I never bailed a man in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see Sullivan the night before last - A. No.</p>

            . I live at Walthamstow, on my property, at my uncle's, who keeps a boarding-school. The prisoner is my brother. I was with him on the 1st of November. We dined together at a chop-house in Drury-lane, and staid there till twenty minutes before six o'clock, and were then going home to tea to my mother's, in Brunswick-street, Blackfriars-road, where my brother lives. We were arm-in-arm, got to the top of Wych-street, and saw a great number of people collected. We went up, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010085"></xptr>before we came close to the crowd I heard a man crying, or rather bellowing,</p>
               <p>"I am robbed." He appeared to be raising off the ground, covered with mud and blood. We were endeavouring to get out of the way; he instantly put his hand out and caught hold of my brother, saying,</p>
               <p>"You have robbed me!" My brother said,</p>
               <p>"If you think I have, send for an officer and search me." We entered the public-house at the corner - I do not know the sign, the man followed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he continue his hold - A. He did not. He persisted in charging my brother with robbing him, and said,</p>
               <p>"If you will give me the 10 l. I will not send for an officer, and you may go about your business." My brother said,</p>
               <p>"No, send for the officer, I insist on being searched." We went into a private room, remained till the officer came, and were both searched; nothing was found on us. We were tied together, taken to Bow-street, and examined. The man appeared at first, to say, he had been collecting money at the west end of the town. We had only one witness, who was a young man, and in the crowd. The Magistrate told the prosecutor he must make a mistake. He appeared very drunk. My brother gave his true address to the Magistrate, and was desired to attend again. We went again on the Thursday following; Mr. Birnie was present. The prosecutor said he had seen Mr. Birnie at the Finsbury Meeting - the charge was dismissed. He has since preferred a bill against my brother. I am positive the prisoner could not have committed the robbery without my knowledge, and I am sure he did not.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Sage, a liquor-merchant, who lives in Clare-market. Sullivan generally has a stall under our window, and brings us notes to investigate. I saw him on the Monday after this happened; I cannot say whether he was drunk or not. On the day of the examination he charged me with not giving him the notes.</p>

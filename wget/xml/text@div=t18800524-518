                  </hi>. I am a wharfinger's clerk, and live at Wellington Road, Bow—on 28th April last I saw the prisoner in Fenchurch Street examining a case of wine in a very awkward manner in the fore part of a van—I was on the opposite side of the way—I saw him put it on his shoulder and walk towards the horse's head—I there lost sight of him—I called the car<lb></lb>man's attention, and saw a boy run after the prisoner.</p>

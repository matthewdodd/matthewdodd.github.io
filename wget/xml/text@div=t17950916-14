               <p>I am an officer belonging to the police office, Whitechapel. On Friday, the 17th of July, about the hour of one in the day time, I was walking in Rosemary-lane, and see the prisoner at the bar go to Mr. Levi's shop door; I passed by him and I heard him ask two shillings and four-pence a yard for the cloth; I walked about a hundred yards further on, then I stopped while he came out of the shop again, and then as soon as he came out of the shop, I went to Mr. Levi's shop, and asked him if that person offered any cloth for sale? he said, yes; I asked him what he asked a yard for it? he said, two shillings and four pence; I told him it was very well he did not buy it, as I suspected it was stole. I went after him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160046"></xptr>and followed him about two hundred yards from Mr. Lewis's door; I said, my friend, and I catched hold of the piece of cloth, is this for sale? he said no; I said it is very odd; you offered to sell it to a person in the lane, and not to sell it to another; I took him into a public house over the way, as there was several came round, seeing me lay hold of him; he told me that Mr. Webb had given him this piece of cloth to sell for him; I told him he must go before the magistrate; I went to Mr. Webb's house, Mr. Webb was ill, he was not able to attend before the magistrate; the magistrate committee him from Friday the 17th, till the Friday following for. further examination, when Mr. Webb attended and swore to the cloth; this is the cloth, I have had it in my possession ever since.(Deposed to by Mr. Webb, as the same kind of cloth which he sent to Matthews and Hollies for their inspection, about ten or twelve days before he sent the prisoner to bring it back again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg leave before I speak to the indictment, to speak to a few transactions relating to Mr. Webb and me since our first of all knowing one another.</p>
               <p>My first acquaintance with Mr. Webb was about seven years ago; I was placed by my father as a shopman to him, he kept a cheesemonger's shop in Fenchurch-street; I lived two years with him as shopman, and then I got another place, at one Price's, in Whitechapel; I lived with him two years and a quarter, in the same capacity, and where Mr. Webb called on me frequently, to see me; a few days after I left Mr. Price I met an acquaintance of Mr. Webb's, who told me that Mr. Webb wanted to speak to me; accordingly a few days after I called on Mr. Webb, Mr. Webb told me that he had heard I was out of place, and he wanted a person to mind his counting house and warehouse; I lived with him fourteen months; in the course of that time I had the care of his counting house and warehouse, the first opening of it in the morning, and the last shutting of it up at night, sometimes there have been six or seven hundred pounds worth of property in that warehouse, likewise I have had notes and cash to the amount of seventy or eighty pounds, to pay bills, likewise I have received money for Mr. Webb, for money that has been due to him; at the end of fourteen months my friends thought of fixing me in business for myself, but it was knocked on the head; however by the character I had borne, they got me into a place in the fore part of the day, which brought me in a very competent livelihood; accordingly Mr. Webb said, if you choose to come and call on me in the afternoon, to see if I have any thing to do for you, you may; accordingly I used to call every afternoon on him, to see if he had any thing to do; I acted in that capacity I suppose nine or ten months, sometimes I have had the amount of ten or twenty pounds worth of linen, sometimes I have been to receive money for goods that he has sold, and sometimes I have had money to pay to the amount of forty or fifty pounds, not only for him, but for another gentleman that used to come to his house, that I can mention; in all which Mr. Webb on his oath must say that he has always found me act to the utmost, with regard to the integrity that he reposed in me. The very day that this affair happened, having nothing particular to do; Mr. Webb was exceedingly had, and he told me that he had two pieces of linen to carry to the other end of the town; one piece was two shillings and nine-pence a yard, and the other was two shillings and eleven-pence; I carried these two pieces for him to Covent-garden; when I came back I asked him if he had any thing else for me to do? he gave me a note to go to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160047"></xptr>Messrs. Matthews and Holmes, to bring back four pieces of linen; accordingly I went to Messrs Matthews and Holmes, I went to the shop and the gentleman told me to go round the corner to the private door, and I should have them; accordingly I went round to the private door, and waited about five minutes, when a woman came down with the linen in her hand, they were tied up in a brown paper, and rather loose; I received four pieces of the woman; as I was coming home with the four pieces of linen I called into a public house where I generally resort to read the news paper, or have a glass of ale; in order to tie them up; the woman of the house said to me, what is the price of this piece? (taking a piece up) I told her two shillings and five-pence a yard; she said she thought it was very dear; I told her I would leave it with her, and she might consider about it, accordingly I left it; I went home to Mr. Webb with the three remaining pieces, I told him as soon as I came in with the pieces, where I had left one of the pieces of linen, and there were three; he immediately sent me with one of the three pieces to Cornhill, to a shoe-maker's there, which I carried and delivered safe; I came back to Mr. Webb again, and fetched several things in for him; says he, if you are at leisure you may call on me again between two and three o'clock I left Mr. Webb then and went immediately to the public house where I had left the aforesaid piece of linen; I asked the landlady whether she liked it? she said by comparing it with some that she had in the house, she thought it was not equal to some she had bought at two shillings and three-pence a yard; I told her that I had a customer for it, and I would take it away; I took the piece of linen to a customer which I had for it in Ratcliff-highway, one Mr. Price; when I came there I was informed that he was gone into the country, as I had not brought the linen before he was forced to buy a piece; I then took the linen and immediately thought of bringing it home to Mr. Webb, and had no intention of offering it to sell. As I was coming along with it under my arm, along Rosemary-lane, there happened to be a kind of noise, several people were assembled together, I just stopped to see them, accordingly this gentleman he was walking up and down his shop, and it is customary in Rosemary-lane, if they see a man with a bundle or any thing under his arm, they say, will you buy or sell, accordingly that gentleman says, young man, will you buy or sell, he says, what is that under your arm? I said, it is a piece of linen; says he, don't you want to sell it? says he, let me look at it; I said, you may look at it, if you choose to give the price you may have it as well as another; accordingly he walked towards the shop door with the linen in his hand, and he stood at the shop door and opened it, and asked the price of it; I told him two shillings and four-pence, he told me then that he would give one shilling and eleven-pence a yard; I told him I could not take no such money, I went away with the linen, and he called me back, and I understood that he said he would give me a penny a yard more, which was two shillings; I told him that he had no occasion to trouble me any further, that if he did not choose to give me two shillings and four-pence I could not sell it, for it I sold it at that rate I should not get a farthing by it. I took the linen and went off with it, I had not gone above thirty or forty yards before I was accosted by a gentleman who came over the way, he said young man, have you got that to sell? I said on my first answering, no because my full purpose and intention was to carry it back to Mr. Webb, but however there came up another man behind him, and said, I think that linen is stole, stole, says I, I don't know what you mean by that; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160048"></xptr>said, you must go along with me, so he took me over to a public house, there I staid a quarter of an hour or more; while I was in the public house he asked me where I had it from? I told him, he took me to the justice, and he went to Mr. Webb, and I was confined two days and two nights before Mr. Webb came; when he came I had no examination at all, the justice told me I must be committed, accordingly I was committed to prison, where I have been nine weeks.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I always found him strictly honest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you when you bought the four pieces, where he had left one of them? - I was so exceedingly unwell I could not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever suffered him to sell pieces of cloth for you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he ever brought you the money instead of cloth before? - No; I had let him have some pieces of cloth on his own account, and he had spoke for some linen yard and half wide, at two shillings and four-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. What was this piece, a yard? - Two shillings and four-pence. The note that I sent with the linen to Messrs. Matthews and Holmes was not sealed, it is possible he might see the price.</p>
               <p>Q. But when you sent for the things again, you did not send in your note for four pieces of linen, but only for such things as were to be returned? - That was all.</p>
               <p>Q. To Levy. When this lad was coming up Rosemary-lane, did you propose to him to buy or sell? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Levy. Is is not a customary thing for people that walk up and down their doors, if they meet any person going up or down, or with a parcel, to stop them? - It is customary for some.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Webb at a former time had four or five dozen of pattern waistcoat pieces; accordingly he gave them me to carry to a house for sale, they did not like them, he sent me back for them, I got them, and kept three dozen of pieces, and brought him the other two, and I told him, and I have kept them for a week or more, and I offered them for sale, but the price he affixed on them was so much that I could not get any thing by them. Mr. Webb in former times has told me, that any time that I wanted to dispose of a piece of linen, he would affix a price, and I might sell it, and get what I could over to myself. This piece of linen, I would not sell under the price that was affixed; it is well known to every person in Rosemary-lane, that they sell cheap and buy it cheap; but my full intention was, which if I could not fell it to a man that wanted it to wear, to carry it back to Mr. Webb.</p>

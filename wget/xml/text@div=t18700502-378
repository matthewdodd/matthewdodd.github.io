On the 12th April, about 1.30 in the afternoon, I was in St. Panl's Churchyard and saw the prisoners there—I watched them—there was a lady and gentleman coming in an opposite direction to them, from Cheapside; and the prisoner turned and followed them—Cummings placed her hand in the lady's pocket—Richards followed up close behind—she did not succeed in getting anything—two other ladies were passing, and they immediately followed them—the ladies went to look into a shop window—Cummings went up to the right hand side of one of the ladies, followed by Richards—Cummings put her hand through a large muff she was carrying, into the lady's pocket—Richards pushing up close behind—I was standing behind Richards—when Cummings watched her hand from the pocket, I noticed there was something in it, and I watched—them into a doorway, and Cummings dropped this purse from her hand—I called out to the lady—Cummings said "Don't show us up, we shall plead guilty to it"—I took them to the station, with assistance—the lady followed us and identified the purse—it contained a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, a gold pencilcase, and three or four silver coins.</p>

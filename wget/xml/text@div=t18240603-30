I returned about four o'clock, and was informed of this loss. There was 15 s. 6 d. left in the till.</p>

               <p>"Those girls have robbed me." I examined the till before they were brought back, and missed some silver, but I cannot tell how much. I had not given change to any one. They were searched in the shop, but no money was found upon them. I asked how they dared to rob the till - they accused each other of the theft. I sent for my husband.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner, she looked after me when I was sick, and she was in distress, she was with me from the Saturday to the Wednesday, on the Wednesday morning she got up to light the fire, and went out to light a candle about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. What did she light the fire so late as nine o'clock in the morning? - The days were very short, and they set up very late as I was so ill, when she came in, she said, mistress, there lays a farthing on the table, may I take it for small-coal, I said, yes; she did not come back again, and I got a woman that slept with me to get up and seek for her; the woman looked for her stockings and apron, and they were gone: the prisoner never came back.</p>
               <p>What things of yours were missed? - When I got upright in bed, I could not find my shoes nor petticoat, and a long Bath cloak that I had to keep me warm in bed, and a clean shirt of my husband's, and a shirt of mine, and two caps, and a small table cloth; I never found any of my things, any otherwise than the Sunday fortnight following, I saw the prisoner with my petticoat on, and my shoes, near the Haymarket.</p>
               <p>How did you know they were yours, could you know your petticoat in the street? - It was a very moonlight night, I walked close by her, the petticoat had a new piece in behind, and it shined; she did not know me, I knew her, I did not stop her, I followed her to Westminster, there she was at a lodging house: I found one cap on her then, that was a month after I was robbed.</p>
               <p>But you cannot undertake to swear, meeting her in a moonlight night in the street, that the petticoat she had on, and the shoes were yours. - No otherwise than by the patch behind; she told the Justice the cap was mine, and she said, if I had had a thousand times more, she would have taken it with her; she behaved very rude before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Court. Was she sober? - Yes; she told me she sold the shirt for two shillings to a Jew, and if I wanted the cloak, I might go to Rag-fair and look it.</p>
               <p>Were there any threats or promises used to make her confess? - When I saw her, I had no constable with me; I asked her, where the things were; and she swore bitterly many oaths I should not have them; I said, Polly, you should not have stripped me, you knew you left me stark naked, I had no other things to put on; she said, she knew that, that was the reason; there was twenty women in the place that threatened to cut my liver open.</p>

               <p>When the prisoner came into the chandler's shop to light the candle, says I, Poll, how is Mrs. Smith? she said with a great oath, Oh; she is well enough now: I said, Poll, how came you to have Mrs. Smith's petticoat on, and her shoes? she said, they lent her them.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to know them? I sewed the shoe up behind the night before my ownself, and the petticoat I knew by the piece, that is all I know.</p>

I picked up Mr. Macmanus one night. I caught the bad distemper in this woman's house; says I, Mrs. Smith, I am badly injured; when she found I was injured, she never came near me, I told her I was better, and she enticed me home to her again, and got me a jacket and coat that I wore to go out to look for money, and a Portsmouth<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260099"></xptr> hat: as for the things, I know nothing of them; I did go away in the morning, I never said, I had her cap on: she owes me a spite, and she thinks to lay me in gaol, I have got her a great deal of money, and there are young creatures that she kept to go on the town; and there is her next door neighbour is the same sort of person as herself; if the truth was known, she has girls at home now, and she gives them a shilling a night and a pint of beer, and every farthing that we take she gets; the man comes home along with us, and he pays half a crown for the room, and if the man calls for any thing to drink, she gets a bottle of wine, and she mixes it up, and calls it a negus.</p>

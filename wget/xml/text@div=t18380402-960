                  </hi>. I am a slop-seller, and live in High-street, Shad<lb></lb>well.

Allen, by whom it purports to be signed—we are in the habit of giving money for these notes if we do not know the parties—the captains write them for the owners—the prisoner wanted 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in clothes and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—he picked out the clothes bet<lb></lb>tween seven and eight o'clock, and wanted to take them away—I said I would bring them the next day on board the ship, and see if he belonged to it—he wanted 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, "No, I will give you a half-crown, and to<lb></lb>morrow I will give you a half-crown more"—when I came on board the ship.</p>

               <p>What was the reason of your suspicion? - By her shuffling about the counter, and about her clothes; she was not nigh the shawls, when I had suspicion of her; she was going out of the shop, and Mr. Mackey took the corner of her cloak, and gave it a bit of a toss on one side, and I then saw the shawls under her right arm; she dropped the shawls in the shop; I saw her; they were picked up by Mr. Mackey, and he delivered them to me; I examined the shawls, and found them to be the property of

               <p>You did not see her take the shawls? - I did not; she was a long distance from the shawls after Mr. Mackey came into the shop, and she never went nigh them after he came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Now young man, can you take upon you positively to say that she did not go nigh the shawls after Mr. Mackey came into the shop? - I am confident of it; there was another young man, and a customer, who had bought a shawl; the other young man was shopman.</p>
               <p>What was his name? - I absolutely cannot tell his name; he is called Robert always; I do not know his other name.</p>
               <p>How long had he been in the shop? - He had been nigh a year in the shop; I have only been a month.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - He is not.</p>
               <p>What part of the shop was he in? - He was at a distance from the shawls; he had been selling a shawl to a lady.</p>
               <p>Then he had been near them? - Yes, but he was at a distance then; he was wrapping up the shawl, and writing upon it what was to pay.</p>
               <p>Who was the lady? - I do not know her name; the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

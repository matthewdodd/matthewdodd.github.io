                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Marquis of Hastings, in Castle<lb></lb>ton-street, Somers-town—on Thursday evening, 24th September, Margaret Kelly, a person who was tried here last session, came to the bar with the present prisoner, Thomas—Kelly called for some gin and beer, and I served her—a florin was given in payment by Kelly—I put it into the till, gave Kelly the change, and they both went away together—after that my sister took the florin out of the till and showed it to me—I examined it, and found it was bad—it was put on one side, and afterwards given to the con<lb></lb>stable—I am quite sure it was Mrs. Kelly—who gave me the florin, and not the prisoner—it was between 9 and 10 in the evening—I was serving in the bar that night from between 4 and 5 up to about 12 o'clock—Kelly and the prisoner were only there once that night—I was examined as a witness on Margaret Kelly's trial, and I then said that she was the person who gave me the florin.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you were examined do you mean? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; because I saw her—I never said that Thomas gave me the florin, and not Kelly—I am quite sure that Kelly was the person—they came in together—I did not see who opened the door first—they both stood together at the bar, and I saw them talk together—I am not sure which took the beer or the gin—they both went out together—I think I mentioned Mrs. Thomas as being with Kelly when I went to Clerkenwell, but I don't think I did here.</p>

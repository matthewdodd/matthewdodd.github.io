               <p>I took her in to bring her up, and tried what I could do to make her comfortable—I gave her every thing which laid in my power, and she be haved very well till Tuesday morning, the 5th of September—when—I got up, and saw a bundle lying at the foot of my bed—I went into the next room, and missed some money from the table and missed my shawl, and Ball was absent—I went with a policeman to Ball's mother, and found the prisoners both together and gave them in charge—I asked Ball what she had done with my shawl—she said she had left it at No. 206, Kent-street—the other said, "Policeman, I will tell you the truth, I stood opposite the house and received the bundle and money from her, and ran away with it"—the money was half-a-crown—the policeman found the shawl—Ball is a relation of mine, and I took her to save her from ruin—her mother it a very notorious character, and I am fearful it is her that has brought her to what she is.</p>

On the 5th of September I was on duty in Trafalgar-road, Greenwich—the prosecutrix came and gave I me a description of the girl—I could not find her till last Sunday, when I found her in Bennett-street, Greenwich, with Connolly and Ball's mother, all three in bed together—I said to the prosecutrix, "Which is your? servant?"—she pointed her out, and asked her where her shawl was—she said, "At 206, Kent-street"—on coming out of the house, Connolly said "Policeman I will tell you the truth, I had the money and the shawl, we spent it between us"—I went to No. 206, Kent-street, and found the shawl pawned for sixpence—Ball said it was true she had taken it—her mother is a very bad woman indeed, and the prisoner was on the tows twelve months ago, and was put into the workhouse.</p>

On the 17th of May, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner in the lobby of my house - he was a stranger; I cannot say whether he had been in the tap-room - it was Saturday night, and my doors were not closed; he was in company with two or three more; I saw him go from the lobby into the yard - he never came up stairs afterwards to my knowledge; this harness was in my kitchen; I had seen it safe at six o'clock - he must go down stairs to get to the yard; I went down stairs after twelve o'clock, and closed the doors - I went into the yard, and found the back gate undone, which I am certain was fastened before; both the top and bottom bolts were undone; I did not go into the kitchen till seven o'clock on Sunday morning; the harness was then gone - I have not found it. The prisoner was brought to me by the constable about eleven o'clock that morning; he was dressed the same as the man I saw in the lobby, but I never saw his face. I have not found the property.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Hart, a slopseller, of Ratcliff-highway - he lives seven or eight doors from Davis. I went into Davis' house on the 17th of May, about half-past ten o'clock; I saw something going on, and saw the prisoner and two others coming out of the tap-room; the prisoner has another dress on now, but I am certain he is the man; I saw him go down the stairs, but whether he went to the yard or the lobby I cannot say- I waited there till after twelve o'clock, when the house was cleared; he never returned up stairs while I was there, or I must have seen him, for I sat right opposite the door; I saw him in custody on the Monday, and was certain of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Had you seen him before? A. Never; he came out of the tap-room about eleven o'clock; he went down stairs, and the other two went out at the front door; I had seen him for five or ten minutes before; I saw him standing at the back room door - there were two lights; my attention was directed to him, as I knew he was after no good; I mentioned it to Mr. Davis: I sat opposite the door, drinking ale; I had my eye on the door, and did not see him return.</p>

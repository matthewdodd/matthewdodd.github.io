                  </hi>. I live at No. 49, Bishopsgate-street; my wine-cellars are in Sweetland-court, under a house which the prisoner occupied under me for some time; he was to leave on the Saturday previous to the robbery. On the Monday afternoon, between four o'clock and half-past, my cellarman came to me—I went with him to the house, and into a closet there, in which</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602020010"></xptr>
               <p>I found one board taken up, and space enough for a man's arm to go into the cellar—there was a bin just under the closet, containing pint bottles of port wine—I miss eighteen bottles from that bin—I went up stairs with my cellarman, and found the prisoner in the top room—he was without his coat, and his shirt sleeves were tucked up—I asked what he was doing there, as he ought to have left on the Saturday—he said he was merely removing a few things—I afterwards went to the prisoner's lodging, in Worship-street—the policeman and my man were there before me—when I arrived the officer pointed out to me five pint bottles, and a hole in the ceiling, from whence he had taken them—four of those I feel confident I can swear to—they had contained port wine—they were wet, and three, if not four of them had the corks forced in, evidently with the thumb, instead of being drawn with a screw, similar to the bottle found in the closet—these are the bottles—I have no doubt they were such as had been in my port wine bin—I have no pecu<lb></lb>liar mode of corking my bottles—I speak to them from comparing the crust and the smell, the chalk and dirt marks, and I compared them with those left behind, and they corresponded—the wine had been about three years in bin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and lodged in the house in Sweetland-court. Mr. Barker allowed me to remain in the house after the Saturday—between one and two o'clock on the Monday afternoon I saw a light under the stairs—I had never seen that before—I called out, "Mr. Barrett!"—the prisoner answered me—he had been doing something there—he was under the stairs in the place where the hole was made—I saw him come out, and he asked me what I wanted—I told him Mr. Barker had given me leave to live in the house a fortnight—he then went into the cupboard again—between three and four o'clock I went up stairs, hearing a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, and saw the prisoner in the top room—he was then without his coat, and with his shirt sleeves tucked up—I did not take any of this wine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cellarman in the service of Mr. Barker. On Mon<lb></lb>day, the 19th of Jan., I was at work in my master's cellar under the house in Sweetland-court, corking bottles—I heard a noise in one of the bias—I immediately jumped up and went towards the bin where I heard the noise, and I saw a man's naked arm, which appeared to come from the coal-cup<lb></lb>board—I had a light with me—I tried to grasp at the arm, but he, having a lath in his hand, I did not succeed—the arm was pulled up immediately, and the lath fell down upon the bin of wine—I immediately ran up stairs, but did not find anybody—I went and told my master, and was not a minute before I came back with him—he was close by—we then went up stairs, and found the prisoner in the top room of the house, which was entirely empty, in the act of stooping with an old bit of matting in his hand, somewhere near the fire-place—he was in his shirt sleeves, which were tucked up just above the elbows—I afterwards went with my master into the cupboard under the stairs—I found a board had been taken up and partly moved—there was a hole which looked into the bin of wine where I heard the noise—I put my arm through, and could reach the bin—it was as much as I could—I brought up one or two bottles—the prisoner's arm is longer than mine—I afterwards went to the house in Worship-street with the policeman—the ceiling there was of board—aboard was pulled down, and in different parts of the ceiling, between the rafters, I found a bottle here and there, with some of the corks pushed in—these bottles exactly resemble the pint bottles in Mr. Barker's cellar in all respects—they have since been washed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman C</hi> 250). On Saturday morning, 22nd Sep<lb></lb>tember, I was in Dean Street, and saw the prisoner come out of St. Ann's Church, close the door after him, and walk away—I followed him and he ran—I ran after him—he got twenty yards in advance of me—I sprang my rattle, and another constable came towards me—before I got up to the prisoner he threw away this piece of steel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took him in custody, and at the station he tried to throw away this other piece of steel—both pieces have some sticky substance still attached to them—he said that he picked the steel up on the church steps—I found on him six florins, six shillings, a sixpence, and two halfpence—they have a sticky substance on them, and have evidently been wiped with this duster, which I found on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am churchwarden of St. Ann's, Westminster—several weeks before September 22nd I opened the money-boxes in the church and found some sticky stuff where the money is put in, and the slits were very much marked—there was also a good deal of sticky stuff adhering to the bottoms of the boxes—here is a specimen of it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on the morning of the 22nd I went with the policeman and unlocked all the boxes—the prisoner had then been taken to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was not coming out of the church—I was on the steps, and I passed the policeman—he examined the church and found the door open—I had no keys and no tools to break in or break out—the doors must have been left open—they were both open right and left.</p>

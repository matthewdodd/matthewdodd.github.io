                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at Hampstead. The prisoner applied to me for employment—I employed him about two months, and gave him wages—I then told him he had better return to his friends, as there was no person in London I could recommend him to, but be could remain with me till he wrote to his friends to remit him money to take him home—he left one morning before I was up—while he was with me, I missed a yard and a quarter of silk, worth about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know it by the pattern, and by its being faded, and marks of the flies on it from being in the window—it is exactly the quantity I missed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, S</hi> 36). Mr. Jones applied to me on 25th Sept., and I went to a shop where the prisoner was at work—I asked him to allow me to see a piece of silk that I understood he was going to have raffled for—he said he had no silk, and he was not going to have anything raffled for—I then asked him to allow me to see his coat—he said he had on coat there, but he afterwards acknowledged that a coat there was his, and in the pocket of it 1 found this silk—I said, "How is this? this is the silk"—he made no reply.</p>

I went to his house with two quarters of oats—Ruffell was groom and coachman to Mr. Sheppard—I saw him in the stable, and by his orders I shot two of the sacks of oats into the bin, and the other two I pitched in the corner—on the 1st of Dec. I was seat there again with a sack of bran—I saw a new coach<lb></lb>man there, and asked him for the sacks I had left before, which had my mas<lb></lb>ter's name on them—we could not find them—I saw Green there—I was after<lb></lb>wards taken to Lambeth-street—I saw two of my master's sacks there, which had his name on them—they were similar to those I had left with Ruffell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am gardener to Mr. Sheppard. On the 1st of Dec., between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw Wood at Mr. Sheppard's—in consequence of what he said I looked about for some sacks with Mr. Coleby's name on them—I could not find them—I went between five and six o'clock to Bush's stable at the Spotted Dog, at Upton—I found Bush and his man in the stable—each of them had a light—I saw a sack of corn, which had Mr. Coleby's name on it, standing on the manger, and two empty sacks hanging across the stall—I asked Bush how many sacks he had got of Mr. Coleby's there—he muttered something that I did not un<lb></lb>derstand—he then took his light, and ordered his man to take the other light—they went into the barn, leaving me in the dark—when Bush opened the door that led into the barn, I saw a cart standing just inside the barn, loaded with straw—I went home, and told my master?—I then got M'Gregor, and went back with him to Bush's, about half-an-hour after—the sack which I had seen on the manger when I first vent was then gone—I asked Bush what he had done with the sack that stood on the manger—he said he had emptied it into the tub which stood close by—I looked into the tub—there were oats, beans, and bran in it—Bush had the two empty sacks in his hand, which I had be<lb></lb>fore seen hanging across the stall—I asked him where the third sack was—he said he did not know—we then went into the barn—the cart which I had before seen full of straw was then empty, and a quantity of straw was packed up on the floor, of the barn—we began to move it about—Bush seemed very much confused, and said, "It is no use looking there, you will find no sacks there"—we continued our search, and found a sack of oats, near the bottom, under the straw—we pulled it out—that sack had no name on it—if the oats were the same that I had seen before, the sack had been changed—Bush said that was one sack of a quartet of corn which he had bought of Mr. Tanner, and he had sold the other sack to Mr. Pottle—I went to Mr. Pottle's, and got a sample of oats from his bin, and gave it to M'Gregor—they were very different to those we found in the sack under the straw—Ruffell left Mr. Shep<lb></lb>pard's service on the last day in Nov.—he gave the keys of the stable to George Poulton, the errand-boy, and I saw him, take them into the kitchen—Bush was in the habit of coming to our stable—my master used to buy hay and straw of him.</p>

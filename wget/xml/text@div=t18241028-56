            . I have been sixteen months in Mrs. Parker's service; her Christian names are Eliza Peters Washington. On Friday, the 1st of October, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I went to look for the tea pot and it was missing. I had seen a man go up the area<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280021"></xptr>steps, between half-past nine and ten o'clock that morning, but thought he had been to the house on business, and did not notice him. I afterwards saw the tea pot in the possession of Waddington.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On Friday, the 1st of October, I was coming out of a house in Jerusalem-court, Clerkenwell, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner and another man coming along as fast as they could walk; their shoes were very muddy, it was a wet day; they were going towards Sutton-street: I was about one hundred and fifty yards off at one time, but got closer. I saw the prisoner look round after me; I went up to him, he had a blue apron round him; I laid hold of him, and the other immediately ran through Cross-street, into Wilderness-row. I found this silver tea pot in the prisoner's apron, wrapped in a handkerchief; there were tea leaves in it, and it appeared warm. I said,</p>
               <p>"You have been a good way to get this, have not you?" he said it had been given to him, but did not say by whom; I said it was given you by your pall I suppose. I asked him a second time where he got it; he said he had picked it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was passing down London-street, he laid hold of me, and said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got?" I said I do not know, I picked it up; he took me into a public-house, and took me to Clerkenwell, by the Sessions-house, gave me a glass of gin, and said, if I would give him the property he would let me go - Witness. As we crossed Clerkenwell-green, a man asked me to go and have something to drink; I said</p>
               <p>"No, I want nothing - but give it to this man," and he gave him some gin. I said nothing what ever about his giving me the tea pot.</p>
               <p>ALITHEA EDWARDS. This is my mistress's tea pot, I have been in the habit of using it for fourteen years.</p>

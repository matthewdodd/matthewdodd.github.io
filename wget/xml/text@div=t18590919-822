                  </hi>. I am the wife of Jacob Butt, who keeps the Blue Boar public-house in Long-acre—on Friday evening, 9th September, the two prisoners came in together—Williams asked for a pint of beer—the price was 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a shilling to pay for it—I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I then tried the shilling in the detector and found it was bad—I said to Williams, "This is a bad shilling; give me back the change"—he said it was not bad—I said, "I believe you know what bad money is"—he gave me the change back—I had bent the shilling, and when he told me it was good, I bent it again and threw it across to the tap-room fireplace—I after<lb></lb>wards found it there and gave it to the constable—Hersey said, "Give me back the beer," and he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoners wanted to kick up a disturbance, and Williams challenged to fight—I tapped one of them on the shoulder and said, "I will have no disturbance in my house"—my husband was upstairs—we had a committee there that night—I sent for my husband and he came down.</p>

               <p>9th September, I was called down stairs to the bar—I found the prisoners in the tap-room—the moment I came down Hersey came out of the tap-room, and called for a pint of beer—I drew it; it came to twopence—he tendered me a bad florin—I asked him how many more of them he had got?—I am not aware that he made any reply, but he would have made his way out had it not been for the customers that were there—Williams was sitting in the tap-room—I sent for a policeman and gave them both into custody, with the florin and the shilling.</p>

I said I was going to have some. He called for a pint; I drank, and then the lady took the porter back, and said the shilling was bad. I said I would pay, which I did with twopence. I then went with the pot, and I said to the publican, "Fill this." I gave him the two-shilling piece; he said it was bad; I said, "You don't mean that; I took it from the conductor of the <hi rend="italic">Bus"</hi> He sent for a policeman, I was searched, but no other money was found on me but three halfpence.

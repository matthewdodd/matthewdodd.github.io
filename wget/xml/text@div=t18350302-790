I know Pye, the officer—I went to him in January last—I have been in difficulties myself—I was in cus<lb></lb>tody on a charge of horse-stealing, but I was not guilty then—on the 24th of January I met William Showell in Newgate-market—from what he said, I went to the Elephant and Castle, on the 29th of January—I met him again in Smithfield, on the 6th of February—I there saw a man named Thomas Douglas, and I went with him to the prisoner's stable in Red Lion-street—Douglas there showed me a cart, which he said had belonged to a grocer at Bushy—it was the same cart the prosecutor afterwards claimed—I bought it for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and left 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I then went with Douglas to White-street, to look at another cart-body—I bought that also—it was the cart and wheels, but the springs and axles had been taken away and pawned—I then went back to the prisoner's with Douglas—there was some conversation between the prisoner and him—we had some gin, and then I drew the cart with Douglas, to the Ram Inn, Smithfield—I pushed behind—on the Monday night following, I took away the other cart from White-street—Stratford, the prisoner, and William Saunders and two others were there—they quarrelled about the division of the money—I took Mr. De La Hunt's cart to Ham's Livery-stables in Gray's-inn-lane, and there Mr. De La Hunt saw it, and claimed it.</p>

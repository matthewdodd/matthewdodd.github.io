                  </hi>. I am a pork-butcher, and live at Romford, in Essex. On the 2nd of July I was at Fairlop fair—I was returning with my brother Thomas, about a quarter-past ten o'clock in the evening, and when we got about a quarter of a mile from the fair I saw a small party collected toge<lb></lb>ther, fighting—a person named Cutts was stripped, ready to fight—I spoke him, and after I spoke to him he went on fighting with the prisoner—they both fell, and when they were down the prisoner's wife came and kicked Cutts—I said it was unfair, and my brother went and took the pri<lb></lb>soner's wife away, picked the prisoner up, and afterwards picked up Cutts—the prisoner immediately came to me, and stabbed me twice in the back Part of my thigh, with some sharp instrument—I felt the blow, and felt</p>

               <p>behind, and felt the blood in my trowsers—I had not interfered in the fight at all—I he stab did not disable me at the time—about five minutes after the prisoner stabbed me, he came to me and hit me with his fist in the forehead—my brother came up, laid hold of him, and I did so also—I let him go—I sent for Mr. Bowers, a surgeon at Romford, as soon as I got home—I was obliged to go to bed, and it was five or six weeks before I was able to do any kind of work—I was under the doctor's care about that time—I was confined to my bed seven or eight days.</p>

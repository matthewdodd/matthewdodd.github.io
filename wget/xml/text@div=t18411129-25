                  </hi>. I keep the King and Queen public-house, in Distaff-lane. Between three and four o'clock in the evening of the 16th of November I was called down stairs—I looked into the bar, and missed a cash-box, which had been on a shelf in the bar about ten minutes before—this now produced is it—I had only bought it that morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutrix's bar-maid. I was coming out of the parlour, between three and four o'clock on the 16th of November, and saw the prisoner coming out of the bar—I said, "You have taken something out of the bar"—he said, "No, I have not"—I said, "Yes, you have, let me see what you have behind you"—I called <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, meaning John Barton—when he came I told him the prisoner had been in the bar and taken something, but I did not know what—the policeman was sent for, and the box was round in the parlour under the seat—I had not seen the prisoner in the parlour.</p>

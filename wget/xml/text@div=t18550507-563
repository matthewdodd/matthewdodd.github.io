                  </hi>. I am a linendraper, carrying on business, with others, at No. 20, Finsbury-pavement. One partner is named William Brown, and one Edward Brown—the house is in the parish of St. Stephen, Coleman-street—I sleep on the premises—on the night of 15th March the premises were made secure—at 12 o'clock the panes of glass were in the windows, and the doors all safe, and the property all safe—I was disturbed about a quarter past 6 next morning—I then found the street door open, a pane of glass was broken in the rear, and an inner door, which had been fast the night before, was broken open—any one by getting in at that window where the glass had been broken, and forcing that door, could get to the shop—when I got there I found evident marks that persons had been ther—I missed property to the amount of about 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in silks; they were bulky and heavy goods—they could not be removed in two or three minutes—I went with the policeman to the station, and stated what I knew.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a costermonger. I use a pony and truck in the way of my business—on Friday morning, a few weeks ago, I was going with my cart and pony to Bow-common to get some coke—about half past</p>

               <p>5 o'clock I was in Golden-lane, St. Luke's, about half a mile from Finsbury-pavement—one person, who is not here, came up to me and asked me if I would do a job—I said I did not mind—he said he would give me a few shillings—he jumped up in the cart, and took me down to Little Moorfields, which is just behind Mr. Brown's—I drove him—he then told me to wait in a coffee shop till he came to me—I waited in the coffee shop—from there I could see Mr. Brown's premises—the cart went to Mr. Brown's warehouse door at the back of the premises, and stopped there, and two gentlemen came out of the warehouse with two good big bundles—they put them into the cart, and covered my coke sacks over them—the third gentleman, who had been in the cart, was standing outside with the cart—the prisoner Williams is one of the two men who brought out the bundles, I am quite sure of that—I had not known him before—all the three gentlemen then jumped into the cart, and drove away as last as they could drive—I came out of the coffee shop, and ran after them as hard as I could run—I kept them in sight till they got to the top of Holborn-hill—the cart turned down Gray's Inn-lane, and I lost sight of them—I inquired of two gentlemen, and went down Gray's Inn-lane—I saw the cart down in a narrow street, leading out of Gray's Inn-lane on the right hand side—I stood at the top of the street and saw the cart—it was eight or nine doors from the top of the street—it had stopped at a house—the three gentlemen were all in it, and I saw the prisoner Price come out of a house with nothing on but his shirt—he took one of the parcels inside, and one of the other gentlemen took the other parcel, and one person, a little short man, brought the cart to the top of the street to me, and gave me two sovereigns—Williams was not in the cart when I got to this street, he was standing on the kerb by the side—I had never seen Price before—I am sure he is the man—Brannan came to me on Good Friday, and I gave him a description of the two men I have been speaking of to-day—Brannan came to me at No. 6, Cherry Tree-court, where I live—I was present when Brannan took Williams into custody—I afterwards went with Brannan to the narrow street in Gray's Inn-lane—before Brannan and I went into the house there, I saw Price come out of another house and go into his own house—I spoke to Brannan, and in consequence of that, Brannan and I went into the house—we found Price there—Brannan said he was a police officer, and some gentlemen had lost some silks and satins, and he must be his prisoner—Price began to cry, and he said he knew nothing about the silks and satins—I did not say anything to Price—I said to Brannan, "That is the man that came out in his shirt," and Price said he knew nothing about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plasterer, and live in Angel-alley, Moorfields.

Williams was not one—I should think they went at ten miles an hour; as fast as they could—I saw nothing at all of Hooker—that is all I can tell you—I was anxious to get to my employ—Mr. Packman, one of the police, came to my place, and I told him what I had seen—it must have been about three weeks after when I first told about it—when the cart went away, it must have been about ten minutes before 6 o'clock—the chimes were going.</p>

               <p>I am a piece-broker; I live in the same street with the prosecutrix: on the 18th of January, about 6 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner brought this piece of silk into my shop and offered it in sale to my wife; I was by at the time, I asked her how she came by it; she said almost every Saturday she was at work with a mantua-maker that employed her to sell pieces; she had brought one piece ten days before, which my wife bought of her; my wife thought this could not be a mantua-maker's piece, because there were there yards and an half of it; my wife saw two marks upon it; upon which the prisoner said, she was ordered to cut the marks off, but had forgot it; she cut them off; I desired to look at the marks; I took them, and said, I believed the silk was the same pattern of some I had seen in my next door neighbour's shop, and I would go and enquire; upon that, she said she could not stay; I went to the prosecutrix with it, and she owned it.</p>

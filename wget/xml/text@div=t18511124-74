                  </hi>. My husband keeps a baker's shop, at Wandsworth. On 15th Nov., Fowler came and asked for a twopenny loaf—he gave me a shilling, which I put in the front part of the till—I do not believe there was other money near it—the officer came in, and asked me for the shilling—I opened the till and I think there was one shilling by itself—I could not say positively—I believe the shilling I gave the constable was the one that Fowler gave me—I looked at it particularly, as I thought at first it was a bad one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective-officer of the City police—in conse<lb></lb>quence of some communication made to me by Mr. Marrible, I went to his place, the Royal Mail Coach Tavern, on 2d April, about a quarter-past 7 in</p>

               <p>the morning—I placed myself in a bed-room on the third floor, and looked through the crevice of a door, which gave me a view of Mr. Marrable's bed-room—I saw some marked money on the dressing-table; a sovereign, some shillings, and some halfpence—after some time, about a quarter-past 9, the next room door to Mr. Marrable's opened, and a person went down stairs—about five minutes after that the prisoner came out—he had his trousers on, but no shoes—he looked very cautiously round, and went into Mr. Mar<lb></lb>rable's room—in about two minutes he came out again and went into his own room, which was a double-bedded room—I followed him in; as he was going in I saw something in his right hand—he was looking at it—it was money, but I could not exactly say what—I went in and said to him, "I want that money from you that you took out of the land<lb></lb>lord's room just now"—he said, "What money?"—I said, "That money you took out; give it me"—I caught hold of his right hand—he said, "Here it is; don't hurt me; I hope Mr. Marrable won't prosecute me"—he gave me a sovereign and a shilling—they were marked—it was the money I had seen on the dressing-table—I searched the prisoner, and found on him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a pawnbroker's ticket for a shilling—I said, "You are not obliged to tell me without you like; you slept here the other night, have you any objection to tell me what you have done with that gold chain and locket?"—he said, "I took no gold chain and locket?"—the landlord came up, and he asked what he had done with the chain and locket, he said it was of great importance to him as they belonged to his poor wife who was dead—the prisoner said he had not taken them—that same morning, in taking him to Guildhall, he said, "Mr. Bull, I will tell you what I have done with the chain and locket; I know I have done Wrong; I hope Mr. Marrable will be merciful to me; I pledged the locket for a shilling, at Mr. Smith's, at Islington, and the chain for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a pawnbroker's in Gray's Inn-lane, which I found to be correct.</p>

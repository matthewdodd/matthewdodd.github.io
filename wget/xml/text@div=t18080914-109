               <p>Q. Was you in the charge of that house on the 8th of September - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you make secure the fastenings of the house that night - A. About four o'clock in the afternoon I shut up the door and the windows, and made them safe. I staid in the house till about seven o'clock; I went out then, having left the house secured; I returned between the hours of eleven and twelve o'clock the same night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then find the house secure as to all its fastenings - A. Yes, I found it the same as I left it. I opened the door and went in, and locked the door. I put the chain on it; I went up stairs strait forward up in the room as usual.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your room - A. The right hand garret. I went strait forward in the room, and pulled the sash down; I returned back to the bed side, I pulled my coat and waistcoat off, and my handkerchief and shoes; I saw the blankets and the matress disturbed to what I left it in the morning; I said to myself, I did not leave them things in this manner; I turned round and touched the latch of the other garret; I had the latch in my hand; the prisoner at the bar catched hold of my collar.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he - A. He was between the doors of the two garrets. He immediately laid hold of my collar; I said Lord have mercy upon me; the prisoner said do not speak a word sir, lye down on the bed, that is all you have got to do; then he shoved me on my breast to the bed, sideways, and threw me on the bed; he stood over me, and the other man behind him, whom he called Joseph; he said Joseph, d - n him, fetch the pistol and we will blow his brains out, he will not lye still; with that I said to myself, if I must be shot, I must be shot, I then gave him a shove and darted to the window; then I received a blow on my head immediately.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was it from the same man who had hold of you and pushed you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it was the same man, and not the man who stood behind - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you got to the window then - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. That was before you got to the window then - A. Yes. I fell towards the window, and as I fell I lifted up the sash; with that I put my head out of the window and halloed out murder, as loud as I could; the people below halloed out come down and open the door; I halloed out I would, as quick as I could; I did, I unbolted the top bolt and unchained it, and the people outside shoving the door so violently to get in, they shoved me down, they knocked me backwards; the persons that were coming to my assistance did that; I got up and went to the door, and while I stood there there was the prisoner standing; the watchman had got him, he was outside of the door.</p>
               <p>COURT. You saw the prisoner in custody - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You are certain it was the prisoner - A. Yes; I knew him directly. I said to him, you rascal, you are the man that hit me on the head; he never spoke to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a blow was it - what effect did it produce - A. It was with a very heavy crow, I could not tell what it was done with; the constable found it was done with an iron crow: I bled very much and it made me very faint.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been attended by a surgeon ever since - A. The surgeon is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you well yet - A No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look round at the prisoner at the bar, and tell me whether you have any doubt that he is the person - look at him stedfast, with caution and deliberation - A. That is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt upon earth that he is the man - A. That is the man.</p>
               <p>COURT You have no doubt about it - A. I have no doubt at all about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The other person has not been apprehended - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you recollect his person - A. No, I should not.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you take particular notice of this man so as to enable you to speak in the way you do - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a moon light night - A. It was, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he was standing over you when you laid on the bed - A. Yes, when I laid on the edge of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was his face towards you - A. Within about a foot, or a foot and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the moon so bright that it gave you an opportunity of knowing him by his face - A. I could not tell the face of the person then, not till I come down stairs; he had on an apron then, and he had when I came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you entertain no doubt at all about his person - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe his speech at all - A. I took notice of that; I could not observe his clothes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was his voice particular - A. I noticed his voice, when he d - d me, and called for the pistol to shoot me, and as the door was opening I heard him speak in the area.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the voice that you heard in the area correspond with the voice that you heard when he used violence to your person - A. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you knew him by person and by voice - A. I did.</p>
               <p>COURT. I believe, if I understand you right, you have not the least doubt of his person - A. No, I have not.</p>

On the 8th of September, about hall past eleven or near twelve o'clock at night, I heard a cry of murder several times repeated; on going into the street I perceived it appeared at the front garret of No. 20; several persons called out to the man who was crying, can you let us into the house; he said I am bleeding to death, I cannot come down, for they will murder me. Four or five of the strongest people began to kick against the door in order to break it open: while they were doing this, a man appeared behind the area, within the rails; he got over them and jumped down in the street; immediately I supposed him to be one of the persons belonging to the house: I laid my hands upon him, and said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180809140056"></xptr>what have they been doing to you; he said they wanted to murder the man that is in the house; I then said who the devil are you; he made no answer to that as I heard, and he was therefore seized by a number of people, among whom I was one, and

All that I heard him say, when he was below, he asked me this - Foy, if I struck this man with a crow, do not you think that I should have killed him with it; he did not say that he did strike him.</p>

            . Q. You are a surgeon - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you called in to look at the wound this poor man received - A. I was; I live at No. 43, Dorset street, Manchester square.</p>
               <p>Q. You looked at the wound. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a wound was it - A. About an inch and a half in length; it was a cut wound.</p>
               <p>Q. It was such a wound as could be done with this crow - A. Yes; it was at the back part of the head.</p>
               <p>COURT. A cut wound is different from a wound given with a blunt instrument - A. It is; the wound was not made with a stick, but it was a cut.</p>
               <p>Q. How deep was it - A. About the eighth part of an inch; it was no considerable depth; it was at the back of the head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have attended him to this time - A. I have, and there was a small wound likewise upon the left arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that appear to be given by the same sort of instrument - A. It did.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then the conclusion you draw is, the blow fell slanting upon the head and come on the arm - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence I was going by at the time of the noise; I went down the area; I found a pair of snuffers and these keys. On-my coming up again I was seized by some people, and I was taken to the watch-house. I am quite unprepared for trial: I should have been glad for people to have been here that knew me years ago - Captain Rolles of the Lion, and the ship I was in in the Mediterranean, his name is Captain Ogle. I have been seven months on shore.</p>

                  </hi>. I now live at 8, James Street, Larkhall Lane—on 24th February last I was living in the Waterloo Road—on that day I met the prisoner at the shop of Mr. Chignell, a watchmaker—Mr. Chignell told me that the prisoner wanted a watch, and he introduced him to ma—the prisoner said he was a foreman in the Government Stores, that a young man under him named Bennett wanted a good watch, and if I would let him have it to take and show to him, he would bring it back or the money, on the Saturday, at latest, if not before—this was on Wednesday—I let him have the watch—I saw him again, either that evening or next day, and he said he had shown the watch to several in the Government Stores, and they all said it was a good watch, and he was very pleased with it, and I should have my money on the Saturday—I saw him again after that, and asked how it was he had not got the money for the watch—he said that he was not at the pay-table when Bennett took his money, so he did not get it; but he always came to his house on the Sunday to tea, and no doubt he would give it to him then; bat he had gone yesterday to his father's house, ni the country—I said, "I will meet you on the Sunday evening"—I did so, and he said, "Well, he has been over, but I was not at home"—it went on till the Monday, and some time after that—he at last told mt he had pledged the watch, and he was sorry for what he had done.</p>

I am a jeweller, of 79, Waterloo Road—I have known the prisoner for some time—he used to be at the Government Stores, and I thought he was there on 14th February—ha was at my shop that day, and Mr. Clark also—the prisoner said he wanted a watch for a young man that had just entered the Stores, of the name of Bennett, and I persuaded Clark to let him hare it—I made an appointment for them to meet and have the watch, and he took it—what I found afterwards that he did not pay for it, I want to the Government Stores and inquired for him and Bennett, and there was no such person.</p>

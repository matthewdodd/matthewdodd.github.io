I gave information respecting this, and the prisoner was taken—I was not present when the property was found, but I believe this is my master's—I had seen the prisoner cut off a piece of cloth similar to this, and wrap it up in a very peculiar shape, which excited my suspicion—he had been about four months in the employ—he was a learner.</p>

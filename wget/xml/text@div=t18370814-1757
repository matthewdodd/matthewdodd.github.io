                  </hi>. I am servant to Robert Salter Stewart, a hatter, in Shoreditch. On Sunday morning the prisoner came to me, who is in his employ, and told me he wanted to go with a parcel to his aunt, and did not want his master to see what he took—I saw him go behind the counter and come back with a hat—I had been watching him—he tied it up in the handkerchief, and came up to me, and asked if I heard any thing of Mr. Stewart getting up—I said, "No, I do not hear any thing of him—he then went out with this hat and parcel, and returned in about five minutes without the hat.</p>

I was in company with my brother policeman, and we met the prisoner—I said to him, "Warren, you are off early"—he said, "Yes," and just as he was going by. Green touched him—he had a bundle, which had a pair of boots in it—there was nobody with a hat—that was at a quarter past eight o'clock—he could not have seen the prisoner and another without my knowledge—he did not say any thing about where did you steal this?—Green could not have seen him at any time this morning without my knowing it.</p>

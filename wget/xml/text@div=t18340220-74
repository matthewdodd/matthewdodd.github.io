            . I was at work on Thursday, the 23d of January, at the Mint - I am employed in the refinery - there was some silver in the Mint in a pan - I left the silver in a pan on Thursday evening next the door, in the drying room - I left work at six o'clock - I left Beville, the foreman, on the premises, and a Frenchman (Chennell) and I left together - I returned next morning at a quarter past seven - I was the first man that got there - I did not lock the door when I went out at night - I saw Beville, my countryman, lock the door - I opened the door next morning - I got the key from the window next door to the office - I went into the refinery and lighted a candle, and came round with the candle and saw silver on the floor, and there was a plank placed on the steps of the door to wheel up coals - we saw some white on the floor, and felt it, and it was silver - I went to the place where I had seen the pan the night before - I saw a round spoon near the silver - the spoon was not in the place it was in the night before - the spoon had been left the night before in the place we melt in - I saw it left there - there were two spoons - I went out at the gate directly and told Canadice, the porter, that the Mint had been robbed, and desired him to call the head porter, Podio, and I spoke to Podio myself - I had not finished speaking to Podio before Beville came up - he saw the silver in the yard - I afterwards went with Beville to the prisoner's watch-box - I saw silver all the way from the refinery to the watch-box, and under the watch-box- I saw some silver on the straw of the ground of the watch-box - I never saw the prisoner in that box - he used to be in such a box - after Podio came, he put his hand under the watch-box and pulled out a red cap full of silver.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Do you recollect the Thursday evening? A. Yes; I was in the drying room, about six o'clock - there was a pan there to dry silver - Beville and I left together; there was no spoon in the pan then - I did not fasten the door myself; I saw Beville shut the door, and lock it, and put the key in the window - when I went next morning I was alone - I went into the same place, and got the key, and unlocked the door myself - I found the door in the same state as I had left it the night before - the refinery is another room - I found the particles of silver on the floor of the refinery.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long have you been employed there? A. Five years and a half.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200051"></xptr>CHARLES BEVILLE. I am employed at the Mint as foreman to Mr. Mathison, and have been employed there five years - there is a process of drying silver which the French people understand; no Englishman understands it- it is a French process entirely - the silver is reduced to a powder - on the evening of the 23rd of January, we made our operations on three thousand ounces of silver - after it is finished, we make the silver precipitate, and put it into drying pans, with fire under them - at six o'clock we go away, and, on that night, I locked one door, and Chennell another - one is the door of the refinery, and the other to the copper-foundry; both the doors open into the yard - I locked the refinery door, and put the key in my pocket; Chennell put the other key on a window, six feet high, where it is generally put, that the first man who comes may take the key and let himself in - I knew the prisoner as a watchman to the Mint all the time I have been there - on the morning of the 24th, I went to the Mint at a quarter past seven o'clock, and I was told something, I directly went into the refinery room, and saw plenty of silver scattered on the ground of the refinery - that silver was in the same state as I had left it the night before, precipitate - I then went into the drying room, and there saw plenty of silver, and there was an iron ladle which on Thursday night had been left in a melting-pot in the foundry where the silver was melted - I found it in the morning in the drying room, and there was plenty of silver scattered about the floor - when you are in the refinery, there are three steps, and there is a plank to enable them to get the coals up the steps - I saw silver on that plank - there was no silver on the top of the plank, but we turned it round, and there was silver on the under part of it - after that I searched, and traced the silver all the way to the window, which had been shut the night before - it was only shut down, there was no shutter to it, and there was silver on the window and outside the window- in the yard there was silver - I traced the silver all along the yard to the watchman's box - it was for whatever watchman might be on duty - the watch-box was shut, but Podio, the head porter, came and opened it; and in the box was plenty of silver, mixed with the straw - at the bottom of the box, and under the box, we found more silver mixed with the straw and earth, and a night-cap with silver in it - that was under the box - there was a little silver in it; it seemed as if the silver had been put into the cap and turned out again - the cap was made of wool - the silver had stuck to the wool inside.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You worked in the refinery on the previous evening? A. Yes; I was in the foundry, and in the drying room - I was in all places - I saw the iron ladle in the foundry - one key was kept in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Any person, who knew it was there, could get at it? A. I believe not; because we go to work at six o'clock, and the watchmen do not come until nine o'clock, and cannot tell where we put the key, as they are not there- it is customary to leave the key there, to enable the workmen who come at various hours, two and three o'clock in the morning, to find it.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a peculiar process of drying the silver - what do you call it when in that state? A. Silver precipitate, or lime of silver.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Precipitate or not, is it silver? A. It is silver.</p>

            . I am night gate porter at the Mint - on the 23rd January I was on duty - the prisoner came at nine o'clock to go on duty as watchman - his place of duty was in the copper-foundry yard - I was there when he went off duty, at six o'clock in the morning - he came and hung up the key and pistol, and went away - some time afterwards I heard from Podio, and accompanied Mr. Barton to the prisoner's house, No. 10, John-street, Cannon-street-road - I knew that to be his house - I had been there before - Mrs. Riley opened the door - I asked for the prisoner - she said he was not at home - I went into the house - I went down below, accompanied by Mr. Barton - after that I went to the Roebuck public-house, Cannon-street-road - I found him there on going a second time, between ten and eleven o'clock - we went back to the house with him - Mr. Barton and Mrs. Riley were there, and Mrs. Riley went up stairs - I went up stairs after her - she took a key from her pocket, and opened the garret-door, which was a bed-room, and went in; and directly I got into the room, I saw something tied up in a silk handkerchief, on a box under the window - this is the bundle - I brought it down stairs, and said to Mr. Barton, in the prisoner's presence, "This is, I dare say, what we are looking for, Sir" - Riley said, "What is it?" - I replied, "Oh, you know what it is," and said he must put on his coat and go to the Mint - he said if he went to the Mint he should never see his children any more - he said to Mr. Barton, "I hope, Sir, you will forgive me" - Mr. Barton said he must speak to Mr. Mathison about that - I then went with the prisoner to the Mint; but, before that, when he came from the Roebuck, into the passage of his house, and pulled off his hat on seeing Mr. Barton, and his hair was all over white powder, similar to this silver - he had his coat off at the Roebuck - I saw his coat down in the kitchen, at his own house - it appeared to be the same coat as he had on when he left duty at six o'clock in the morning - I went with him to the Mint, and when in the Board-room with me and Podio alone, he said repeatedly that he should either be hanged or transported, and I cautioned him to hold his tongue; but in the presence of Mr. Mathison and some other gentlemen, he said he could not tell what induced him to take it; but he thought it was silver-sand - his duty was in the copper-foundry yard that week - the handkerchief contains silver, weighing eighty-one ounces, the same as was in the night-cap.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him in the evening before, in search of his great coat and hat? A. No, I did not see him going to the gas-house - I did not see him from nine to six o'clock - his residence is in the county.</p>

I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint - it is in the county of Middlesex - I have been in Court during the trial - I made no promise or threat to induce the prisoner to enter into conversation with me, but cautioned him not to say anything to injure himself - I asked if he knew me - he said, "Yes" - I said, "Riley, I am going to take you before a magistrate, and I caution you not to say anything, because if you do, I shall be obliged to use it against you" - he went on his knees to Mr. Mathison, and said, "I am a very bad man, and I hope you will forgive me" - I desired him to get up, and said, "Riley, this is a bad business" - he said, "Oh, Sir, I hope you will forgive me; it is the first time I ever did it; I was very drunk, and did not know what I was doing; I found the door open and went in, and that is all I recollect" - I said, "Riley, you must have gone in at the window" - he said, "Must I, Sir? I do not recollect now" - he was then taken before a magistrate - there is a communication from the copper-foundry to the drying room, by means of doors - the refinery is approached by a door from the outer yard - you descend into it by three steps to the melting room, and from that room you get to the drying room - this silver was deposited immediately under the window - a person unacquainted with the building would be very likely to fall into one of the cisterns, which are charged with acid.</p>

            . I am melter and refiner to His Majesty's Mint - I discovered, after this robbery, a deficiency in the weight of the silver, to the amount of about fifteen pounds troy, one hundred and eighty ounces - I understand the prisoner has been employed in the Mint eighteen years, and considered a very confidential man - this silver is the same material as was in the pan - it is a French process, introduced by me, and nobody but foreigners can do what is necessary - I have a sample of it here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you get it from? A. From the drying room - I had put this silver into work, on the Monday morning before the robbery, and that was the last time I weighed it - more silver was delivered out on the Tuesday.</p>

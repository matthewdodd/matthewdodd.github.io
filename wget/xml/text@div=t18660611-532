On Tuesday morning, 27th March, I was on duty in Highbury, close to the New-river, and at about twenty minutes past 5 I saw a child in the river, at the rear of the Pegasus public-house, near a foot bridge—it was floating—I stooped down, pulled out my truncheon, and drew the child towards me—it was dead—it appeared to be from six to seven months old—it had on this red flannel shirt, coloured petticoat, white petticoat with embroidery round the bottom, coloured stays and white skirt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—its face was white—this piece of alpaca was pinned to its shoulder, brought over its head, and pinned so as to cover its head—it was single, so that the child could breathe through it—a small brass chain was fastened round the body, inside one of the white petticoats—I took the body to the Kingsland-road station, left it there, and fetched a doctor.</p>

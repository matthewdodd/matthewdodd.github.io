                  <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM DERRIG</hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 26.) I obtained a warrant from Mr. Secker for the apprehension of a person named Muires—on Tuesday, 5th, I went with this warrant to the Tailors' Arms, in Gravel-lane, and found Muires there—I took him into custody—he was into the public-house—I told him I had a warrant for his apprehension—he said, "Where is it?"—I showed him the warrant—he said he would not go till I read it, and while I was read<lb></lb>ing it he escaped—he ran, and got into a house in Ewer-street—I followed him, and apprehended him there, with the assistance of my brother constable—Baker was there—he came in immediately afterwards—while I was in Ewer-Street I saw Baker struck with a brick-bat, and on turning round I saw the prisoner stoop—I went to him immediately, and said he had thrown the brick—he said he had not—it came in the direction from where he was stand<lb></lb>ing, or rather stooping—there was a great crowd of people—there were others standing where the brick was thrown from, besides the prisoner—I was not struck with any brick-bat—Poole was there at the time—both he and Baker were assisting me in taking Muires to the station-house—we succeeded in keeping Muires in custody—there where several bricks thrown at me, but none struck me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 72.) I was on duty, assisting Derrig, in Ewer-street on the day in question—Muires went into No. 9, house, followed by Derrig, and I followed afterwards—I went into the back-yard of that house—there were several bricks in the black-yard lying about there—the pri<lb></lb>soner was in the yard—no one else was there at the time—Derrig had got Muires in custody in No. 8—he had taken him over the fence from No. 9 yard</p>
               <p>—I pulled down the fence, and came to his assistance, and Muries was arrested—after I got into No. 8 yard, and left the prisoner alone in No. 9, three bricks were thrown from that yard—they did not strike me or the other officers—we then took Muries into Ewer-street, and as we were going to the station I re<lb></lb>ceived a blow on the head—the hat I now produce I had on at the time—the blow struck me on the back part of my head—it threw me forwards on my hands, and broke my hat—it just grazed the skin off my head—I had got ten or twenty yards from the house—who threw the brick-bat I did not see—I had left Connell in the yard—he had an opportunity of getting into the street as quick as us, because the door of the passage was open.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 33.) I was engaged with Derrig and Baker in arresting Muires on this day—as we were going to the station-house</p>

               <p>with Muires, while in Ewer-street, I saw a brick-bat thrown at Baker—brick-bats had been thrown at me before—that one struck me on the back of my head—I turned round after it was thrown, and saw the prisoner throw the brick-bat at Baker—I saw it strike Baker on the top of this head, and he fell down on his side—the prisoner was about a dozen yards from Baker at the time—I took him into custody afterwards on that day, and he was rescued away directly—I am sure he is the man—I have know him six years—there were from 100 to 150 people collected in the street—I had seen him throw a brick when we were in the rear of the house, when we went in after Muires.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were struck first then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Baker was struck not above two or three minutes after that—when I was struck it gave me a bit of a shake—it stunned me a bit—I followed Muires down the street afterwards—there might have been other bricks thrown—the prisoner was about twelve yards from Baker—he was behind him—I was before Connell—after I received my blow, I turned round, and saw the prisoner throw the brick and strike Baker on the head—I was at that time following Muires who was in custody—I saw the prisoner throw the brick and strike Baker—it was the brick striking me on the head that made me look back—I followed Muries and Baker after I had been struck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not because Baker was struck on the head, that you turned back to see where the brick-bat came from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was because I was struck—I had kept looking black all the time till Baker was struck—I was follow<lb></lb>ing them, waking down with the crowd.</p>

            . I was in Rosemary-lane about half-past eleven o'clock at night, and saw Watts lying on the ground at the corner, very drunk. I said it was a pity but what somebody knew where he lived. The prisoner came up with another, looked him in the face, and said they knew where he lived; they got him up and took him up Dock-street. I said I did not think they knew him. They said they did, that he was a cabinet-maker, and lived in Dock-street. I ran up Dock-street, and saw the prisoner running with the prosecutor's coat, and the other with his hat - I am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>"What have you got here?" He said it was his coat. I said I must take him to the watch-house - he wrenched himself from me, and ran away. I called out Stop thief! and the watchman made a blow at him. We secured him without losing sight of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor and draper, and live in London-street, Greenwich. I lost a coat out of my shop, and the policeman brought a handkerchief and snuff-box to me, which I recognised to be my property—in consequence of what the policeman stated, I preferred this indict<lb></lb>ment against the prisoner, as the handkerchief and snuff-box were in my coat pocket, with a pocket-book—the coat was worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Wild the policeman produced the handkerchief to me, and Dyke the snuff-box—I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

On Monday, the 15th of January, Mr. Holding came to the station-house, and said somebody had stolen a great coat from his shop, with a handkerchief, snuff-box, and pocket-book in it—on the following Friday, the 19th, I had occasion to go before the Magistrate at Deptford, and saw the prisoner handcuffed, going to New<lb></lb>gate—I saw this handkerchief round his neck, and asked him where he got it from—he refused to answer me—I said I should take it, as I knew the owner, and asked him where the coat was, which he took the handkerchief out of the pocket of—he made no answer—I took the handkerchief to Mr. Holding, who claimed it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on the 18th, at Deptford, for stealing a coat—I found the snuff-box and the handkerchief, which was taken off his neck, on him—I was told by the Magistrate to give him the handkerchief to put round his neck, as he was about to be conveyed to Newgate—I produce the snuff-box—he was takes about ten minutes' walk from the prosecutor's.</p>

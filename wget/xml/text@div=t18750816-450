From information, I went to Margate, on 8th July, and saw Geoghan there, in charge of the police—I told him the charge, and cautioned him in the usual way—he then stated that he and Marks had crept underneath the door, between 10 and 11 o'clock on the Saturday night, got on a van, and from that to the first floor, broke open the door leading into the office, and then he and Marks broke three desks open; that they then went to the letter box, opened that and took out twelve letters, and took 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of Mr. Harrison's drawer—they then went to Princes-Street, Regent Street, opened all the letters and tore them up, and threw them away—I afterwards apprehended Marks—I told him the charge—he said I had made a mistake; I took him to the station, and Geoghan repeated his statement in his presence—Marks made no answer to that, Geoghan said they got a cheque from one of the letters they had taken from the office, and it was agreed that he should go to</p>

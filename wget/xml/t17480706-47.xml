               <p>* Statute of II George I.</p>
               <p>Coun. for the Prosecution. My Lord, I am council for the prosecution, which is against Mr. Cable, for being guilty of a crime, which the law calls subornation of perjury; and I am sorry to say, that it seems to be attended with two of the foulest circumstances that can be. In the first place it is practised upon an ignorant boy, incapable of judging for himself; and then it is upon a solemn occasion, the election of magistrates for the city of London, and the time of election of magistrates, with respect to the common-council, is a wardmote held on St. Thomas's day, within the city of London. Gentlemen, in the infancy of the city these elections were proceeded upon, and carried on with great calmness, and great impartiality; but as this city grew to be magnificent, and so large as it is, people contended for a share in the government, and it became common to make use of frauds, and other practices, in order for that purpose; and the electors could not have any thing to turn their eyes upon more proper, than to apply a remedy for this evil; for people came with false notions, and took upon themselves a right that they had not, by taking upon themselves to be freemen, when they were not; and there was a remedy made, which remedy is, that it is enacted, That upon a poll being demanded in favour of any candidate, the presiding officer at the wardmote, the alderman of the ward, or, in his absence, his deputy, shall, upon the demand of two persons of the ward, grant a poll; that there shall be clerks sworn, and the poll taken impartially; and every person is to take the strongest testimony, that can be given before man, that he has a right of election for the city of London; for he shall swear, that he is both a freeman of the city, and an householder of the ward, where he is an elector; and the wisdom of this Act of Parliament is obvious to all men; the Legislature had a view to this salutary end, that elections should be made by men of understanding, men of substance, and integrity; and if persons, who have no property to vote, are to be introduced under the names of freemen, of what consequence will this be? I would not be understood to insinuate the least imputation to any of the candidates, for in this election, the competitors on all sides were men of worth and honour; those who succeeded, and those who lost it, from their general characters, would have an abhorrence of this practice, and desire that Mr. Cable may be made an example of, if he is guilty; but I wish it more strongly, that he may make out his innocence to your satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, in the year 1747, according to ancient and annual custom, on the 21st of December (St. Thomas's day) the customary day of election of common-council-men, the Lord Mayor issued his orders for holding wardmotes in the city; and there was an order issued to Sir

            ) to take the poll; the poll continued that day, and was adjourned to the 23d; but whether matters run very near, or whether the zeal of people run to an unreasonable height, I cannot tell, but, as I am informed. Mr. Cable came to the election, and got hold of a poor ignorant man, so inconsiderable as an apprentice to a butcher, and one who, I am informed, Mr. Cable knew, who brought meat to his house frequently, and he advised him to go up to poll, where this boy took upon himself to be a freeman of the city, and an householder in the ward; and gentlemen, I am informed to say, that at first the boy was shocked at the thing, to pretend to be what he was not, but Mr. Cable encouraged him, and clapping him on the shoulder, he was hurried up, and took the oath, and in consequence of taking that oath he polled.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, in such an election as this, it was not an easy thing for a boy to pass under such circumstances, for this boy was neither a freeman nor an householder, but Mr. Cable himself became sponsor for the boy, and warranted him to be as good a vote as any in London. Gentlemen, we shall call our witnesses to prove this, and I am sorry to say it, but, according to my brief, we have more witnesses than one to prove it; and if you are satisfied with the evidence, you will, no doubt, think it your duty to find a verdict for the crown, in order to put a stop to that practice,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174807060033"></xptr> which is prejudicial to the good government of the city of London, which I think is a great guard to the liberties of Britain.</p>

               <p>Q. What is this Walker?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. He is an apprentice to Mr. Hyde, a butcher.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Mr. Cable apply to this Walker?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Give an account of what you heard between Mr. Cable and the boy.</p>
               <p>Caruthers. I was standing in the hall, facing the pulpit, between the two isles, when this Walker was coming up the hall; Mr. Cable spoke to him, and said, Brother Walker, what are you come to poll? I cannot tell what more he said then, but afterwards he said, D - n it, brother Walker, you have as good a poll as any body, you have a right to a single vote, and you shall go and poll for brother Walker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up to the table where he polled?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. I did not go up to the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Does this Walker live near Mr. Cable?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. Mr. Cable lives in Warwick-Lane, and I believe Mr. Hyde lives in a court in Warwick-Lane; but I don't know whether he lives there now.</p>
               <p>Def. Coun. on the cross examination. What officer are you?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. I belong to St. Faith's, and am beadle of the parish.</p>
               <p>Q. What dress was this Walker in, when he came into the hall?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. He was in a dirty frock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any suspicion of hi m?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. I did not think it at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is this boy?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. I believe he is twenty years of age, or better.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, whether you did not declare, that you would swear against the defendant, and he should be kept in Newgate all his life?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. Not upon this account.</p>
               <p>Q. What account then?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. No account.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say you would keep this man in Newgate all his life?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. I will tell you the truth; whenever he meets me, at almost every place, he calls me perjured and forsworn rascal, and all the parish will tell you, that he always used me in this manner; but I told him, if he did not hold his tongue, I would take him up.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between Walker and him?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. Mr. Cable said, Brother Walker, are you come to poll? and he said, Brother Walker, you have as good a single poll as any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon you to say, that he said to him, You have a right to poll?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. I have sworn it.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, whether the words were not, Whether he had a right to poll?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. No, he asked him, whether he was not come to poll?</p>
               <p>Q. Now I would ask you, whether he did not ask him if he had a right to poll?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. How should you like it, to have a man indicted for asking another to vote for his friend?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. No, I should not like it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you make this declaration against this Cable?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. Yesterday, in the market, when he mobbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you declare this at other times?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And did not you say you would send him to Newgate?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you make a declaration, that you would keep him in Newgate all his life?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you declare, before Mr. Newby and Mr. Leversedge, that you would keep him in Newgate all his life?</p>
               <p>Caruthers. No, I don't know that I did; I said I would send him to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you stand by it, that you did not make such a declaration, at the Bell in Warwick-Lane.</p>

The Defendant met this fellow the butcher in the middle of the Hall, and after he had talked with Mr. Cable some time, he came to the poll book, and Mr. Cable had hold of Mr. Walker under the arm; and towards the close of a poll, every body have their eyes upon the persons that come to poll; I saw his name in the book, and said, I do not believe there was any such person in the Ward; and I remember the Alderman's saying, if he would take the oath, he could not refuse his polling; and upon that Mr. Cable clapped him on the shoulder, and said, he was as good a vote as any in England.</p>

My Lord, I think he cannot be a witness, for he appears upon the face of this record to be guilty of wilful and corrupt perjury, for he went voluntarily and swore he was a freeman and an housholder, and now he is to swear directly the contrary, and he must one way or other be guilty of wilful and corrupt perjury, for they are diametrically opposite; and if he had been convicted of perjury, he could not be a witness, because the King cannot restore a person to the credit he had before: and I think there is as much reason for his not being admitted a witness, as if the record of his conviction had been produced in Court; and as to a person's being admitted an evidence who owns he is perjur'd, I cannot see; I never knew it, and for that reason I hope such a president will not be introduced, to admit a person who has been guilty of perjury, to swear against another, when his conscience ought to have flown in his face, and have prevented him. I have taken pains to find out, whether ever any man was admitted to give evidence in a case of subornation of perjury, that was guilty of perjury himself; I never knew it in my life, and I hope he will not be admitted.</p>
               <p>The second Council for the Defendant argued, that if this person, who has owned himself to be guilty of perjury, should be admitted to give evidence, it would be attended with the greatest inconveniences that could be; and hoped that this would be taken to be as strong an evidence of perjury, as if the record of his conviction had been produced: and that this prosecution was bolstered up to convict a Gentleman of subornation of perjury, of as good a character as any man in the City of London; and that there never was an instance of any person, who has been guilty of such a crime, of being admitted an evidence in a case of this nature, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This was likewise argued in a full manner by the Council for the prosecution, when many cases were cited, and a reply made by the Council for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174807060035"></xptr> the Defendant; after which

               <p>Q. What company are you free of?</p>
               <p>Walker. I mentioned the pewterer's company, but I did not know what I said.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to mention the pewterer's company?</p>

               <p>Coun. for the Def. May it please your Lordship, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I am council for the Defendant, Mr. Cable; against whom there is a very heavy accusation, of doing a thing which is of a pernicious nature, and attended with very ill consequences, and whoever is guilty of it, must remain eternally infamous, till he comes to his grave. I hope these instances are not frequent; and I hope no man is so wicked, as, in the face of the world, (though it is as wicked in private) to suborn a person to commit perjury; all innocent and honest men ought to be aware of such an act, as having a tendency to destroy the good government of such a famous city, for I have a detestation of such things; and I am against bringing persons into offices, who are not fit for them, as having a tendency to the ill government of this city. It was very well that the Legislature interfered in this case, and the living Magistrates are testimonies against this practice, and I hope they will be so to the last of times; I do not doubt their integrity, and hope this will never be overthrown. This is an Act of Parliament, made to prevent cases of this nature, and not only for the punishment of the crime; but I hope you will think, that there was no crime committed in this case. It was opened, that the boy was shocked at it, if he had, he would not have done it; but I would not ask him the question, for I would not give him any credit; and if you, Gentlemen, are of opinion with me, I would not convict a dog upon his testimony; for must a man's reputation be impeached, and he liable to be convicted of subornation of perjury, upon the evidence of this infamous fellow? I hope the Court will excuse<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174807060036"></xptr> me in saying so. My Lord, this evidence seems, for it must be taken all together, not to amount to a proof of subornation of perjury. What the witnesses have said, I will recollect as well as I can, and I hope I shall not err. This gentleman never saw the fellow, till he came into the hall, and had laid down his tray. One of the gentlemen on the other side calls him an ignorant boy; look at him, Gentlemen, no body would take him to be the babe he is represented to be, for he is twenty-two years of age. Then they say, Mr. Cable knew that he was not a freeman. I should have thought it as reasonable to suppose, that Mr. Cable could, by looking in the boy's face, know what money he had in his pocket. But the most of the thing lies here, knowing that he was not a freeman How should I know he was not a freeman? he might be in partnership with his master, for what I know, and live with his master. Then they say, Mr. Cable shook hands with him, and says, he hopes he will poll for this person, or that person, or the other person. This is a barbarous doctrine, to call this subornation of perjury: Who would meddle with elections, if this is the case? great is the danger, great is the inconvenience. But, Gentlemen, if you suffer this, you are making a rod to whip all the honest voters in the kingdom; for if a man comes, and swears falsely, then what has he to do? why he comes, and says this man induced me to do it; and a man, that has the best interest, is liable to suffer most upon these occasions; but, Gentlemen, suppose you should give credit to him ( though as I give no credit to him, I hope you will not; especially as you have heard what the other witnesses have said. Is it reasonable to suppose, that a man, in an open hall, where every body must know what he said, would do this?) is every person to be punished under this Act of Parliament for asking another to vote? No, Gentlemen, there must be something more than the bare asking a man to vote. The Act says, If any person shall corrupt, or suborn any person, &amp;c. I, with great submission to the honourable Bench, say, that it is bribery and reward, that tempts people to forswear themselves; therefore it must be something more, under this Act of Parliament, than bare asking a man, that makes it subornation of perjury; for no body can suppose, that any body would come there, without they have a right, and Mr. Cable would not have asked him, if he had known that he had not been a freeman, and an householder. Has there been the least evidence, that Mr. Cable knew that he was not I be, with all his wickedness does not swear a word of this.</p>
               <p>Think, Gentlemen, again for yourselves and your fellow-citizens, whether this will amount to such an offence as subornation of perjury. Then comes Mr. Caruthers, and he seems to be very angry; he is willing to go as far as he can, but he does not make use of any expression that he heard any words come out of Mr. Cable's mouth sufficient to convict him of the crime; but at last he says, he told the boy he had as good a vote as any body; and Mr. Cable must have been a most abandoned wretch to have asked him, if he had known he was disqualified from voting.

             says, that Mr. Cable said he believed he was a good vote: I have heard of people that have been thought to be very good votes, who have been rejected five hundred times in the City of London. My Lord, I will trespass a few words more; I hope by the boy's evidence, we shall establish the character of that Gentleman, as a person incapable of being guilty of any under-hand practice, much less that he should be guilty of a crime of this nature. We shall shew, that he has in all cases in life, acted with the greatest integrity; and I hope it will never be suspected, that a man, who has always behaved well, will jump into the jaws of destruction (which is open before them) to eternity, and D - n them both. Gentlemen, I don't find there was any benefit or reward accruing from this; it is hard and unreasonable to suppose, that a man for nothing at all, should be guilty of this. Can this gain belief with any body?</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, We shall call our witnesses to the Prisoner's character, and the character of the boy: this is the defence we shall make, and I hope for the sake of him, and all honest men, that you will not find a verdict against the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Second Coun. for the Def. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I beg a few words in favour of the Prisoner: the crime that he stands indicted for is the greatest crime that can be committed; and I do say, that all elections of Magistrates should be without biass; and it is necessary, that prosecutions should be set on foot for the sake of publick justice, and to punish the criminal; but this should not be done out of partiality or malice, to punish a person, who, as far as I can see, cannot be guilty of this crime. And Gentlemen, the indictment against the Defendant,

               </p>
               <p>rought, they have not said a word that he is not a freeman, or an householder; which I take to be the offence of the indictment, and therefore I hope the Court will not proceed any further. And, Gentlemen, I beg leave to take notice, that Mr. Cable is an inhabitant of the city of London, he has been for twenty years a householder, and for the space of ten years has carried on a flourishing trade, and reckoned to be as honest a man as any in the city of London, till he fell under this imputation. Gentlemen, he is by business a chocolate-maker, has by this lost his business, and is now almost undone; and if he is entirely innocent, hard is the fate of the man, that he should be ruined, and lose all his fortune in the world. They have brought several witnesses to prove this indictment, but there is not one witness that has proved it. One of the witnesses is so infamous a fellow, that he is not worth any regard; as to another, he shews the most inveterate malice; for it appears, he has declared that he would keep this unhappy man in Newgate all his life. What rancour must this be! Therefore this does not seem to be a thing done for the sake of publick justice, but set on foot out of malice and spleen, and for the sake of rancour, and not for the benefit of the city of London. Gentlemen, is there any evidence that he knew this man not to be a freeman and an householder? Is there any evidence, that he bid this man say that he was a freeman and an householder? Is there any evidence to shew, that he said he was a freeman? If there is no evidence of this, what are you to try? why, that thi s was from a wicked and corrupt procurement, that this man was induced to do this; but as infamous as he is, he has not sworn any such thing. What have their witnesses sworn? One of them says, that Mr. Cable clapped him on the back, and said he had a good vote; but did he procure him to swear? Gentlemen, what crime this is, I am at a loss to know upon this evidence; and I dare say, that the Gentlemen on the other side will give it up, for I must say, that they have not proved any title of this indictment; and then they bring up the rear with a person, who has been guilty of a crime so atrocious as perjury; and I cannot represent the inconveniency of this to be bad enough, that this man should come to prove a fact of this nature, and which fact he has not proved. He says, Mr. Cable said that he should take a single vote, for he had as good a vote as any body there; but there is nothing said of telling him of swearing that he is a freeman, and an householder; he has not proved, that Mr. Cable induced him to swear any thing of that, and Mr. Hyde, the master of this boy, says, he does not think that Mr. Cable was acquainted with this man. Gentlemen, this infamous fellow went into Newgate-Market, and said among the butchers, You are all a parcel of scoundrels, I am a gentleman, and have been voting for my namesake, Mr. Walker. Now, Gentlemen, this is all they have proved against the Defendant, who is a freeman of the city of London, and an householder; with all their learned arguments, with all their flourishing, and great ingenuity, Gentlemen, we shall call our witnesses, and prove him to be a man of the greatest integrity and honour that can be; and give me leave to say, that this prosecution is set on foot out of spleen and malice, and not for the sake of publick justice; therefore I hope you will find the Prisoner not guilty.</p>

               <p>Dorrington. I delivered out bills to the persons who went to poll, and Walker came and looked on; he came and asked me to hold his tray, and then he came and told me that Mr. Cable had asked him to poll; that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Walker come on his own accord?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he by himself, or was Mr. Cable with him?</p>
               <p>Dorrington. No, he was not with him when he spoke those words to me.</p>

               <p>Brett. I saw him come into the market, and he said he had been polling for Common Council-men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say it in a bragging way, or in what manner?</p>
               <p>Brett. He did not say it in any other way, only that he had been polling.</p>

               <p>Def. Coun. What did he say?</p>

               <p>Wilson. I believe not, for he has worked for me as a chocolate-maker almost a dozen years, and if I had thought he was such a person, I would not have employed him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grimstead. I have known him twenty years, and he is a man of a good character, and I hope he would not be guilty of any such thing as that; he is apt to drink now and then, and especially at elections, and he will get drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. I hope they will not indict him for that; do you think he would be guilty of perjury?</p>

               <p>Thompson. Always a very good one, and he is a very honest man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he would be guilty of such a crime as subornation of perjury?</p>
               <p>Thompson. I can't harbour any such thing.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pitts. I have known Mr. Cable six years, he was apprentice to my served him, seven years, and I years as a journeyman, and then he himself.</p>
               <p>Def. Coun. Is he an honest man?</p>

               <p>Def. Coun, Is he a man of an honest character?</p>
               <p>Kemp. I believe no body has a better.</p>

               <p>Mr. Phillips. The Prisoner is a man of a very good character.</p>

               <p>Figes. I was there at the election at the polling-table, and Walker was in a white frock, and the Deputy made an objection against him, and said, I believe this fellow has not a right to poll; and he asked who brought him up, and somebody said he believed Mr. Cable did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with him?</p>
               <p>Figes. No.</p>

               <p>Figes. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you asked Cable whether he brought this Walker to poll; after he had polled, what was the reason of your asking him that?</p>
               <p>Figes. Because the Deputy had made an objection against him.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to fix upon Cable as the man carried him up to poll?</p>
               <p>Figes. Because some persons said they believ'd Mr. Cable did.</p>
               <p>Ri illis. I have known the Prisoner eight years, is as honest a man as any in the world. I saw Caruthers the Parish Beadle (I live in St Paul's Church Yard ) and he said it was in his power to put him into Newgate, and he believed, to keep him there for his life: I asked him his reasons for that, and he said that was best known to himself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dyer, and live at Bow, in Middlesex. Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening of Tuesday, the 1st of Oct., I was going from Poplar to Bow, to my own house—when I got to a place called Bromley Hall-field, I heard quick footsteps behind me, which I thought nothing of, till immediately after I felt some person endeavouring to take my bundle from under my arm—I then turned round, and was immediately attacked by the prisoner, who was endeavouring to get my parcel from me—I then called out for assistance, and immediately a struggle took place between me and the pri<lb></lb>soner, soner, which lasted about two minutes, we then fell on the ground toge<lb></lb>ther, and after that he succeeded in taking my parcel from me—I then got, up and followed him, calling "Stop thief!" as loud as I could—in fol<lb></lb>lowing, I kicked my foot against a stone, or something in my way, and fell—when I got up again to pursue the prisoner he had gained the advantage of me, and got out of sight—I saw no more of him till he was brought to the station, about twenty minutes after—I went towards Poplar, and met a policeman, at the corner of Bow-lane—I told him, and gave him a description of the person as well as I could—he immediately went after the man, and took him—the parcel contained five skirts of children's dresses, and one Iustre<lb></lb>dress—they were found on the prisoner.</p>

I received information from the prosecutor on the evening of the 1st of Oct.—I went in pursuit of the prisoner—I apprehended him at a place called the Copperas-walls, leading to Barking, in the parish of St. Leonard, Bromley—I found this handkerchief on him, and these things in it, and one parcel, which was in the handkerchief, was concealed up his back.</p>

               <p>Q. I suppose you knew that it was false, and that you were not Mr. Stanley's servant? A. Yes - there was some soiled linen in the parcel, I believe - I directed the parcel - the prisoner copied a direction for me on a piece of paper - I knew it was all false - I had a suspicion of that - I went to the hotel, left the parcel, and said I would call on Tuesday morning for the payment, which I did - the landlady was not up - the young woman brought down 1l. 11s. 6d., which she paid me - the landlord's daughter handed me a pen, to receipt the bill.</p>

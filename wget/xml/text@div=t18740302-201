                  </hi>, M.D. I live at 26, Mildmay Road—on 22nd January I was sent for, and found the prisoner standing at the end of the bed, with his throat cut—his wife was holding him—there was an open razor on the floor between his feet, and a pool of blood at his feet—it was a very serious cut, but not necessarily dangerous to life—it was deep in parts—he admitted next day that he inflicted it himself, and it is most likely that he did—I attended him for two or three days—he said that he had done it because, he was tired of being a burthen to his wife and child—he did not seem to be labouring under any particular delusion; he seemed perfectly sensible; but I never heard more than a dozen words from him—I sewed up the wound, and gave up attending him because the police took him away—he never denied having done it.</p>

I was sent for, and found the prisoner in custody—I remained with him till the 26th, and then took him to the infirmary—he told me at first that he had done it himself, and that he was only sorry he had not cut his head off—on another occasion he asked me for a knife, and said that he would do it again the first opportunity—the infirmary doctor said that his brain was diseased, and he was not fit to be at large—he is not here—the prisoner appeared to me to be insane—he was light-headed at the Police Court; he asked me, before I had been there five minutes, what he was there for, and he said that he had been there a week—he has attacked me several times, and I have been obliged to keep every knife and razor out of his way—he has been subject to these fits for fifteen years, and the doctor says that his brain is diseased.</p>

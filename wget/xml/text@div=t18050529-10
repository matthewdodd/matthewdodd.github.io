               <p>Q. Whose flour was it? - A. Mr. Richardson's; it was in a stable belonging to him, the prisoner was carman; there might be seventeen or eighteen pounds in the stable, he took part of it, which is in the bag here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Have you had it in your custody ever since? - A. Yes, locked up.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when you saw all this? - A. In the adjoining building; I was looking through the crevice of a slight partition.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you pretend to say that flour is your master's property? - A. I saw him take it from under the straw.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not the place where your master keeps flour? - A. Certainly it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Neither can you swear to the colour of the flour? - A. I cannot swear to the colour of the flour.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What quantity was there? - A. The whole that was under the straw was seventeen or eighteen pounds, out of which I saw him take just so much flour as is in this bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether your master missed any flour? - A. We could not tell that; I saw the place where it was taken from, there was some spilt upon the ground.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel.</p>

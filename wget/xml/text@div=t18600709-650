I have been able to trace that through the prisoner's books—by his private book, the entry shows that he receives on this journey 4,006<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is the entry, and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it is all in the prisoner's writing—he pays to us 3,850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—to make his private book tally with our book in amount, he deducts from that 4,006<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. various sums of money, amounting to 155<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; deducting that, gives him the amount which he has accounted to me for, 3,850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., so that he actually received 4,006<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and pays to me 3,850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and I can prove each item; there is the name of a customer of our's to each item—he has never paid to me one shilling of those items, making up the sum of 155<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. nor accounted to me for it in any way—the journey in which Nutt's case is, was completed on 24th December, 1859—subsequently I saw the prisoner, and squared accounts with him—we have a customer named Crowhurst, of Bexhill, Sussex—the first item in this old account is Webb's, of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am in a condition, by the prisoner's own writing, to trace out that sum, and I will prove that I never received it—though I received the actual bill, by remitting that particular bill, the prisoner was able to keep back 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money—I have the bill and receipt in Crowhurst's case in my hand; they are both in the prisoner's writing—on 4th February, 1860, he actually received 72<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; here, in the cash-book belonging to the firm, it is 71<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is an allowance in the bill for discount of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the allowance in his private book is 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the 71<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. would be made up by the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. less in cash—the pencil book shows 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—I have never had that sovereign accounted for—the total in the little book is 71<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the same in the private book—we had a customer named Fiers, of Seaford—this bill and receipt are in the prisoner's writing—it appears by this "By cash 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and a "bill for 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on 7th February, 1860, making a total, he received, of 106<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—in the pencil book is "Henry Fiers, 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>"—in our book "105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., "and discount" 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., "the discount allowed being 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—in the pencil book it originally appears, I think, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—the difference is to be found in the discount;

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your book there is a record which must inevitably lead to some explanation about the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There would have been if we had looked at all these particular books and compared them when he returned from his journey, but it was never our practice to do so—this account was given to me six weeks after the bills came into my possession, the reforeit was never compared.</p>

               <p>my memory as to there being an account for some time which remained open—there was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. short—Mr. Dean wrote to me respecling it, and I reserved it for him and told him of it on that journey.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a partner of Mr. Robertson, who is conducting this prosecution—it is not conducted without my concurrence—I have been telegraphed for to come up to town—I was not down at Thrapston when the prisoner was taken in custody; I came there a few minutes afterwards—it is not true that I sat down and had refreshment with him, and shook hands with him in a friendly way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> But did not you shake hands with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am sure I did not; I will swear 1 did not—when he started to come away by the train he put his hand out, but whether I took hold of it or not I do not know—I am quite sure I did not shake hands with him—I did not meet him in Blackfriars-street since this prosecution has been going on; I met him in Holland-street, Black friars-road—I did not shake hands with him then, not when I met him—I do not know that I took his hand in the same way as before; I will not swear that I did not—I did not say to him, "Mr. Dean, wish you every success, you have my best wishes," nor anything of that sort—I said I was very sorry for his position; I did not say I wished him sue<lb></lb>cess—I did not shake hands with him when we met—I have dined at his house once; not more than once—I have been there three times; I was there once to supper—the last time I was there was last July; twelve months ago—I don't think I have complained of the way in which the busi<lb></lb>ness was managed; I won't swear that I have not—I have said something about going into partnership with the prisoner—I did not tell that to Mr. Robertson until this case came out—I have not mentioned it to other people besides Mr. Dean—I have never mentioned it in the presence of any of the other clerks that was going into partnership, or thinking of doing so, with Mr. Dean; I have talked about it with Dean privately—it was only in con<lb></lb>templation—I think that was several months ago—I went to Scotland in Feb<lb></lb>ruary—I have mentioned it to him then—it was the latter end of February that I mentioned it—that was just before he went on that journey—it was not necessary to mention that to Mr. Robertson—it was only in contempla<lb></lb>tion that if the firm did not carry out certain arrangements I should take a business myself—I did not tell Mr. Dean that I had 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the firm, and that I would bring it out of the business, and bring it into business with him—I said I could get 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Dean has often been at my house; dined there—we were very friendly.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do those bills come through the prisoner, or do any of them come direct from Webb? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Through the prisoner, all three; in one re<lb></lb>mittance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have made a good many errors, have you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that must almost necessarily be in a large establishment like this—I have not made a very great number of errors in the accounts which I have kept between the prisoner and the firm in the course of the last three years—I have made some certainly—I could not say now whether there was an error of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in Hursford's account, or whether there was an error in Holden's account in July, 1857, or in Haley's account—I do not recollect them particularly—I may have posted goods to the wrong person; then they I have been found out, and I have generally sent an account of them to Mr. Dean on his journey—I could not swear that the errors did not amount to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the course of 1857 and 1858—they might have amounted to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I would not swear at all that since 1857 to the present time, my errors, as I between the prisoner and the firm, do not amount to 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say that this error in Nutt's account, 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., passed through my hands—I should not think it did—there is a very' great deal of work done in this establishment—the gentlemen in the establishment are not overworked—they are very much worked—the prisoner has frequently complained of the errors made—he has not, to my recollection, complained that he was not allowed to go through the books, and examine the accounts when he handed them in.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

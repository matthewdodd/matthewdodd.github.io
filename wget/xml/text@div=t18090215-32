            . I am servant to Mr. Sherrinew, pawnbroker, Strutton ground; I believe the prisoner at the bar brought these things to me; it was on Monday evening, between the hours of seven and eight o'clock; I cannot downright positively swear to the prisoner; I believe there might be many people like him, and I might be deceived.</p>
               <p>Q. But the person, be he who ever he may be, what did he bring - A. Two jackets and two pair of trowsers; he asked twelve shillings on them; I suspected them to be stolen things, I put them down on the counter, and told the lad to go for a constable. The lad had scarce got out of doors when the prisoner ran out; the shop was full of customers; I was in a deal of confusion; I cannot swear positively to him, so as to acquit my conscience; I believe the prisoner was not one minute in the shop; the prisoner was apprehended the next day; I saw him before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then, or did you not, believe him to be the man that was with you the day before - A. I did, but I made this observation, that there were many faces alike.</p>
               <p>MR. MONDAY. Q. I believe you caused this man to be apprehended - A. I did. He was pointed out to me by the last witness; the moment I saw the man I asked the last witness is that the man; he said yes, that is the man; the prisoner denied it, and said he knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150017"></xptr>any witnesses to character.</p>

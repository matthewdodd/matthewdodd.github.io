                  </hi>. I Live at 12, Central Street, St. Like's—the prisoner is my brother—he did lire with me and my deceased husband, and assisted him in his business as a barber—on the evening of 17th February my husband came home about 9 o'clock the worse for drink—he went upstair and laid down in his bed—about 10.30 he came down, into the shop—the prisoner and my little boy were there—I followed my husband into the shop—the prisoner was wiping his leg with a dirty towel—my husband said "What are you doing"—he made use of a bad word to him, and my husband called him a saucy monkey, and gave him a smack in the face with his open hand, and caused his nose to bleed—the prisoner took off his coat and waistcoat and put himself in a fighting attitude—I got between them and said to the prisoner "You know how queer he is, let him be, and don't have anything to do with him"—the prisoner said "He has hit me, and I mean having a go with him"—they then got together somehow, and both fell together, my husband underneath, and the prisoner at the top—the prisoner had hold of him by the hair and by the waist, and he hit him while he was down, and one knee was on his chest—my husband said "Oh," that was all I heard him say—I sent my little boy for the doctor—I said to the prisoner "Look at what you have done, you have stunned him"—he said "He fell himself"—I said "No, you have done it"—the doctor came—my brother helped to go for the doctor—my husband had been under the doctor for nine months for diseased kidneys and consumption—he was a very ailing man for the last nine months—he died on 17th February—he must have died instantly he fell—he was dead when the doctor came.</p>

I was at the station when the prisoner was brought there—I took down what he said, this is it: "About 9 p.m. on Tuesday, the 17th I was in the shop; the deceased came in and said 'What are you doing?'—I said nothing; he said 'You monkey, I will screw the head off you;' he struck me a violent blow on the lip, and kicked me, and threw me on the floor and fell on me; I fell asleep on the floor, and was not aware he was dead till my sister-in-law woke me and told me; I did not hit him or strike him any blow."</p>

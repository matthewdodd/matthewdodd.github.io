            . On the 8th of last month, my man came up to my chamber, and told me my pigeon-house was broke, and all my pigeons gone. I got up, and went and found the door broke open, and missed thirty-six of them; they are called Toy pigeons: the pigeon-house is over a coach-house, in the parish of Fulham. By searching, my servants found them in the possession of one Reeves, on the Sunday morning, in Westminster: I know them to be my property: I turned them into the lost again. and they all went to their own places as before.</p>

             I was servant to Mr. Dupuis: the pigeons were stolen the 8th of June; we found them on Whitsunday, in the custody of James Reeves, in Westminster. I know them, and can safely swear they are the property of the prosecutor: they were concealed in a little room; he made some objection to our seeing them, till he saw the constable: we questioned him where he got them? he said, the prisoner brought them to him, and said he bought them of a gentleman's servant, in Whitechapel. There were 21 of them.</p>

            . I live in the New-Way, Westminster. The prisoner brought the pigeons on the 8th of June, in the afternoon, and desired they might be along with mine; I consented, and in the evening, about eight o'clock, he brought two pair: after that, he went and fetched the rest the same evening.</p>

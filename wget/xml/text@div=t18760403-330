On Saturday, 19th February, I was on duty at the top of High Street, Deptford—I was fetched by the landlord of the Fishing Smack public-house—I there saw Richard Maloney, Barry, and Donoghue—they were pushing each other about inside the house—the landlord pointed out Maloney and Barry to me and said "Turn those two men out, they have been very disorderly all the evening"—I took hold of Richard Maloney and put him outside—he struck me in the mouth and ran away; several people came up at the time—I ran after him, struck him across the leg, and he fell on the pavement—I left him there and went back to the house after Barry; he was drinking at the bar—I said he was to go out—he said he would throw the beer over me, or some remark of that kind—I was then kicked by Donoghue on the leg—I succeeded in turning Barry out—he stood outside in a fighting attitude and struck me on the head and shoulder—I then drew my truncheon and hit him on the leg—he ran away; I caught him a short distance down the street—he began to cry and begged me not to strike him again—I said I would not do so if he behaved in a proper manner—on going towards the station I received a blow at the back of the ear from Richard Maloney—I tried to catch hold of him, he slipped through ray hands, got between ray legs and pulled me down, and when I was down I was kicked by both of them—a man who was lying on the ground beside me kicked me with his heels—I got up and still kept hold of Barry—I went down a second time in a doorway, and while on the ground I was kicked by a number of men round including Barry and Maloney—Barry came up a second time after he got away and kicked me in the eye; I had to put my hand up to receive the blow or 1 should have suffered severe injuries—I was thrown across the doorstep and Maloney was a-top of me and bumping my head and there was a number of others round me; among them I saw Rooney and Thomas Maloney—I was lying on my back and Richard Maloney was on the top of me—somebody got hold of him and got him off me—I then got up and followed him for a short distance, and he turned round and butted me and I was kicked in the back and lower part of my body.</p>

               <p>—I saw the constable, Richbell, first of all on the Sunday 20th, the day after the occurrence—he was suffering from severe contusions, large cut on the right eye, and on the left knee, he received an injury at the lower part of his back, and great numbness of limbs—he is still under my treatment—he was in danger at one time.</p>

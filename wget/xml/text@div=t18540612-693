                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>). On Saturday evening, 13th May, I was on duty near Mr. Sparkhall's, in Cheapside, I saw the prisoners together—I watched them, and saw Lindsey take a pair of trowers from off a bracket at the door, and give them to Jones, who ran down Old Change, and at the corner of Watling-street he stopped till he was overtaken by Lindsey—I took Lindsey, and handed him to another officer, and I ran and pursued Jones, who had run away—I met him being brought back—I had not lost sight of Lindsey from the time I saw the trowsers taken, till I took him into custody—I searched the prisoners; I found on lindsey a dupli<lb></lb>cate for a pair of boots, and this knife, and this picklock key dropped from. Jones.</p>

            . I am an odd-boy to Lord Ellenborough. On the 3rd of December I was coming from Roehampton to town, with a cart, and some hay in it; I left four trusses of hay with the prisoner, at the Old George, in the Brompton-road - he gave me some liquor to drink, and said at any time if I left hay with him he would give me something for it - I received 1s. a truss for the first two trusses, but nothing for the last.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you steal the hay? A. I brought it from Roehampton; I saw the man taking the hay off the cart - I did not try to prevent it, nor ask for it back; I knew I was doing wrong - he gave me nothing for the last trusses; I had 1s. for the first - I thought it was not right; he is ostler to the inn-keeper - I did not pull the hay off the cart; I took the shilling for the hay - I dare say I expected to get 1s. for the last hay; they were tied up as trusses, but had not been weighed; I do not know how much there is in a truss.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure there were ten trusses? A. Yes; I pitched them up one at a time - a truss of hay has two hands, and a bundle has only one.</p>

I am servant to the prisoner, at the George - he ordered me to take two trusses of hay off the cart on the 3rd of December; I do not know what was done with them; I believe they were put into the yard - I did not see them any where else afterwards; Mr. Ball keeps the yard, but the prisoner has the stable - I do not know whether he rents it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not customary for gentleman who send their horses along a road, to leave a bundle or truss of hay to feed them? A. Yes, Lord Durham does it for one; this was taken openly - I have seen Lord Ellenborough's horses fed with hay that has been left; I have given it to them - that carter was in the habit of borrowing hay to feed Lord Ellenborough's horses, and I believe they have taken it to pay themselves - I never saw any horses eat the hay that was left belonging to Lord Ellenborough but his own.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What man in Lord Ellenborough's service did you know to borrow hay of the prisoner? A. Kennedy has several times - I cannot tell whether a truss of hay is worth 2s.; I do not mean that they were put in any place for Lord Ellenborough's horses - they were only put into the yard: Kennedy said, "Here are two bundles of hay - I will leave them till I come back."</p>

I was told about the prisoner, and looked for him, but could not find him - he was brought to Queen-square Office on the 23rd of January, by Hughes, but he said he had surrendered himself; Hughes said he brought him there to be discharged, as Lord Ellenborough would not do any thing against him - I went to inquire by the Magistrate's order, and they said they had not said so.</p>

            . I am servant to Lee and Co., who live at Nos. 14 and 15, St. Thomas-the-Apostle. On the morning of the 3d of March I was cleaning the window of master's house, and saw the prisoner standing by the side of Mr. Mortimer's house at Mr. Hindes' door - I do not know the number - I saw another man go into the house, bring a coat out under his arm, and give it to the prisoner, - I followed the prisoner, and saw him put it on - he went up the steps of the house, and came down again without going in - the door was closed - the other man walked up to the door and opened it - I do not know how - I followed them as far as the foot of London-bridge - the prisoner was secured - I gave information to the officers, who took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said before the Lord Mayor, that I was at the corner of the street, twenty yards from the house, and never went near the house. Witness. He was about a yard from the door when the other came out and gave him the coat - he had been walking up and down the street - it was the shop door his companion opened.</p>
               <p>BARTHOLOMEW NORDEN HINDES. I live at No. 8, Great St. Thomas-the-Apostle - Mr. George Mortimer keeps the house - I am a lodger - he pays the rent and taxes - I do not exactly know the name of the parish - I had a coat hanging up at the end of the shop, by the side of the kitchen door - the outer door, I understand, was open, but the shop door was shut - my coat was within the shop door - it must be opened to get at it - I cannot be positive that the shop door was closed.</p>

            . I live in this house, and was at home when the coat was taken - I know the shop door was shut - nobody could get to the kitchen without going through the shop door - I had shut the shop door myself ten minutes before - it was not locked - the street door was open - I was up stairs.</p>

             (policeman No. 40). I know this house is in the parish of St. Thomas-the-Apostle - I took the prisoner in charge - when he got to the station-house I asked where he got the coat - he said he bought it the week before in Petticoat-lane - he had it on.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the other man in the street, and bought the coat of him. I was not within twenty yards of the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lieutenant in the 11th regiment Hussars. In Sept. last the part of the regiment I was with was quartered at Hampton Court—I had a small watch with a gold chain, and lost it, with a dark morocco case, from my dressing-table in a private room in the mesa-house—I had acquired that watch by changing it with a Mr. Joel for one for which I gave 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the chain I gave 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for—I gave notice in the regiment, and to the police next morning, that I had lost it—I did not see it again till about a month ago, when I found it in the possession of Sergeant Churchill, at Twickenham—I at once knew it to be mine—the prisoner was a servant it the mess-house—I cannot say she was there at the time I lost the watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BIRNIE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the prisoner the only female servant you have seen about the mess-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have seen several others—I have a private servant of my own, who has access to the room all hours of the day—I generally leave my bed-room door with the key in it, so that anybody can turn it, and get in—I did not wear the watch every day—I have often left it in my room—I had come down from London that day in a carriage, and wore it—I had not been walking, except across the green, to Hampton Court—I saw it safe at seven o'clock, when I went to mess, and when I came up at eleven I missed it—I remember having it on when I came from London—at that time nearly all the officers had private servants of their own—two of the officers had bed-rooms on the same floor as mine—one of them had a private servant, and the other's servant was a soldier of the regiment—those servants would have to pass my room to go to theirs—my servant answered my bell, and never any of the female servants.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the prisoner anything to do with your room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing at all—each of the officers have one of the soldiers' wives to attend to their sleeping apartment—they have access to the rooms as well as the servants of the officers—there were not above a dozen persons in the barracks that would have access to the rooms—there were from ninety to one hundred soldiers in the barracks, but the mess-house is quite detached from the barracks—there were three soldier's wives who had access to that floor—I believe they are not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the 11th Hussars, and acted as waiter in the officers' mess, in Sept. last, at Hampton Court. The prisoner was acting as a kitchen-maid at the mess-room on the evening Lieutenant Garland lost his watch—her sister Eliza was taken into custody—she had no employment there—I saw her there about a fortnight before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> She was there as a visitor I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the servants frequently have visitors—there was one female servant in the kitchen besides the prisoner, the cook's wife—their duties are entirely below-stairs—I have seen two or three visitors there at a time—the prisoner's sister was only there a few minutes—I have seen her since—she might visit the kitchen, and I not know it—I saw the prisoner the whole of the evening, from seven o'clock till half-past eight or nine—she was in her usual employment.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185004080022"></xptr>
               <p>9th Nov. the prisoner brought me a gold watch and chain—I cannot swear to the watch—it was of the size of this one—I do not recollect anything about the chain—I recollect having a chain in my possession, but do not recollect the prisoner bringing it—she brought the watch to me to sell—I asked her questions, to satisfy me that it was her own—to the best of my recollection, she said she had the watch from abroad—I cannot pretend to say now what she asked me—she said she had it when she came from abroad—I did not buy it the first day she brought it—to the best of my recollection, she asked 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I gave 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took the chain to be a plated one at the time—I did not try it—I threw it on one side, and it lay in my drawer for a month, along with a lot of rubbish—I did not know it again till Lieutenant Garland drew the pattern of it; I then immediately told him about it, and traced the watch for him—I took this receipt from the prisoner—she sent the watch by her sister on 9th Nov., and I told her to send the prisoner, and she came the same afternoon, and that put me off my guard—I was not suspicious at all—she would not take the price I offered at first, and afterwards sent her sister to say she would take it—there was a dark morocco case with the watch, and a small gold key with it—the watch was out of order—this is the receipt she gave me—I wrote it, and she signed it in my presence—I paid her the balance, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had sent part by the sister—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—" Windmill-lane, New Hampton, Nov. 9th, 1849. Received of Mr. Saunders 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for Geneva watch and key. Jane Griffin."—I have no recollection of purchasing the chain—I have no doubt I did, but I looked at it as a common chain at the time, of no value, and therefore I did not name it—I afterwards found it in my drawer among a parcel of rubbish—it turns out to be a gold one, and worth about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you had not sold the chain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you do with the articles you bought of the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I sold the watch to a person in London, among a lot of silver and old watches—the prisoner described herself as coming from Windmill-lane—that was when she first came—I sold the watch, in the case, to a person named Solome, at the foot of Westminster-bridge—I ultimately sold the chain for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to a person named Page, a butcher, in Twickenham, being perfectly unaware, that it was gold—I have no doubt this is the chain—I have never seen the case since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The prisoner first came a few days prior to 9th Nov.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; when she came the second time I was satisfied about her—I had watched her about Twickenham—I was satisfied by her conduct—I had often seen her previous to 9th Nov., and after she called on me I saw her about Twickenham, and I saw her with persons I believed to be respectable—she stopped for a quarter of an hour opposite my house, and spoke to a man who I believe was butler to a gentleman at Twickenham-green—she had offered the watch for sale to Mr. Beale, a watchmaker, opposite me, and he said it was worth nothing, it was a mere toy—she behaved with no secrecy during these three days—she carried it about openly and publicly—it appears that it had been put up to be raffled for at Hampton—when she came to me on the 9th I was perfectly satisfied as to her honesty, from her conduct both in my shop and out of it—in my judgment there is no intrinsic value in the watch—it is gold—it did not go when I had it—there was no pivot to wind it up with—it has passed through three or four hands since I sold it—I understand there has been 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. laid out on it since—I have not seen many watches as small as this—I could not identify it again—if I were to see it with twelve or thirteen others I could not identify it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you able to speak to that being the watch you bougbt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to a certainty—I sold a watch to Solome—it has passed through three hands since that—I have no mark at all to identify it by, except that it is a similar one—I should not be able to identify it unless there was a mark—there is nothing I can point out in particular—it has undergone repair.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BIRNIE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you cannot say positively whether you ever had it in your possession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my belief it is the same, because when Churchill came I told him who I had sold it to, and be traced it from one to the other, and brought me this watch—it is similar to the one I sold—I will not say it is the same—I can positively swear to the chain—I have no more particular mark about it than I have about the watch—I know it by the make—it has been out of my hands—it is a heavy chain—it never occurred to me that it was gold—the person who bought it is not here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember the inspector of police sending to you after the loss, to give you notice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I am pretty confident it never happened—I have no recollection—if I had had information I should of course have stopped it—I did not purchase the watch without opening it—I saw the maker's name; I do not know what it was—it is so many months ago—I cannot say whether the name was in a square or in a round—I have very little recollection of the watch, except the size of it—I know it was about the size of a shilling—I believe this to be the watch—it is a frequent thing to put on a watch the name of a celebrated maker, who really is not the maker—I cannot say whether the watch I bought had a duplex escapement, or whether it went on rubies.</p>

Buckley, Bennett, Maley, and Ginivan were there; while we were there we saw a boy, and in consequence of what he said, we all five went with him to a cellar in Dudley-street, where Mr. Andrews lives; the boy opened the door, and left us standing to watch for the policeman; the boy brought up some boots and shoes; I had some of them; we had them between us; we went to Covent garden, where Ryan keeps a stall for coffee; I sold her two pairs of shoes; I asked her 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; she gave me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; during the same morning I saw Isabella Buckley sell her a pair of boots for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; she said if we brought her thirty or fifty pairs, her friend would buy them; her friend appeared, and he bought nine pairs and a half of them.</p>

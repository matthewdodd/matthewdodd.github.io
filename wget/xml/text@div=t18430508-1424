                  </hi>. I am a light porters, living in Coopers-row, Upper East-Smithfield, in the parish of St. John, Wapping. It is my father, Charles Morgan's house. On the evening of the 12th of April, about half-past nine o'clock, I left home—I saw my mother lock the door—the house was all shut up—the shutters were fastened—I am sure it was past nine o'clock—the Dock<lb></lb>bell rang at nine, which was half an hour before—I went on an errand, and was coming back—I saw a light in the first floor window—that room has got no shutters—I went back for my father and mother—when I came home I saw the prisoner standing in the middle of the room—I did not know her—I said, "I have caught you"—I saw a bundle tied up in a handkerchief on a chair, which she was standing by the side of—the policeman came—I observed the staple of the street-door lying on the floor, by the door-post—this is it—there is a back yard door—I am sure that was shut when I left home—I did not notice it when I came home—it had only got a latch to it—I do not know whether there was any possibility of getting in at the back—it is a low wall—there is a public-house at the back of it—it appeared the staple had been forced off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I came to the house a little before ten o'clock, and saw the prisoner standing in the bottom room—the bonnet was on the chair by the side of her—I asked her where she lived—she said she had come from Wapping, that a girl gave her 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and told her to go up stairs, but when she came down the girl was gone—she did not say what she was to go up for—Wapping is half-a-mile from the prosecutor's house—I did not ask her name—I asked her where she lived, and went to the place she told me, next day—it was not correct.</p>

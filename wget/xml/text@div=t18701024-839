                  </hi>. I am the wife of the prosecutor—on the evening of the 6th October we were on the platform, waiting for the train; when it came in there was a crush at the moment my husband went away with a fried to the carriages, and the prisoner passed, and a moment after I felt my pocket pulled—I caught hold of the prisoner—I saw the purse on the ground—I did not see prisoner drop it, but it was found just by his feet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am husband of last witness—I was with her on the night of the 6th October—I heard an exclamation from my wife that a young man had got her purse, and the prisoner rushed past me; I seized him by the left hand—I felt his hand close, and I swung him round to get back from the carriage, and immediately I felt his hand open, and the purse was at his feet, and the prisoner picked it up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-constable employed at the Ludgate Hill Station of the Chatham and Dover Railway—the prisoner was given into my custody on the 6th October, by the Inspector, at the platform—on the way to the station prisoner said "Don't hold me, I shan't run away"—I said "I don't intend you should"—at that moment he was passing with this hand what I thought a watch, but it is something of a locket—he dropped that on the pavement, and as I stooped to pick it up he made a desperate attack to get away, and the prosecutor picked this locket up—on the way to the station prisoner said "I don't suppose there is much in it."</p>

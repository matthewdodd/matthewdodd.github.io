                  </hi>. I am a dairyman, living in Bryanstone-street, Mary<lb></lb>lebone. On the 25th of February, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner Mulling came into my shop—my wife served him—after he came into the shop my wife brought me a bad sixpence—I went into the shop—the prisoner was still there—I said it was a bad sixpence, taking it out of my hand, and giving it to him—I said, "Are you not going to take the butter?"—he said, "No, I have no more money about me or upon me"—he went away—I followed him—he turned round into Quebec-street, and then into Oxford-street—soon after he joined a second person, who was similar to Walsh—I could not swear to him, I only saw his back—they went down Oxford-street, through Portman-street, on to Lower Seymour-street—there I saw Mullins go into Conrath's shop, and purchase some bread—he gave some money, but what I do not know—he took something like change—Walsh walked down the street—Mullins came out, went after him, and joined him—they went through a court into Marylebone-lane, and walked up and down each side of the street, sometimes together and some<lb></lb>times separate—the other man went into a public-house in High-street, Marylebone, and Mullins went into a baker's shop, purchased some bread, and took something like change—he then went into the public-house where the other man had gone—I went to Mrs. Daw's, the baker's—she showed me a bad sixpence—I took it into my hand, and returned it to Mrs. Daw—I saw a policeman, and went into the public-house where I had seen the two prisoners go in—I found them there together—I saw them searched, and in Walsh's cap were eleven sixpences, which the policeman took.</p>

I have got no sixpences"—I said, "I think you have, and I think some of them are bad"—he said, "No, indeed, I have no money at all about me"—I said, "Stand up, let me look"—he hesitated a little, and then stood up—I found eleven counterfeit sixpences in his cap—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—I have kept them ever since—I searched the other prisoner, and found this small piece of metal on him—I took them to the station-house—on the way Walsh made a struggle to escape—I re<lb></lb>ceived this bad sixpence from Mrs. Daw.</p>

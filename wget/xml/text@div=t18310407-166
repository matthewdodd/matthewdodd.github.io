I received the prisoner in charge, having heard the nose-bags were stolen full of corn - I traced them to Neale's yard, where the prisoner had offered them for sale, as I understand; I found them there in possession of the prisoner's wife, who was endeavouring to conceal them - they were full of corn - I took them into my possession; the prosecutors' names are on the straps.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, staring that he had found the nose-bags under some bricks in Ncale's passage, and that the two he offered for sale had been given him at the Red Lion brewery.</p>

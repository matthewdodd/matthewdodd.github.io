                  </hi>. I keep the British Queen public-house, Acton-road—on 1st January the prisoner came there for half a pint of beer, which came to a penny—he gave me a shilling, and I gave him sixpence, fourpence, and two halfpence—I kept the shilling in my hand, finding it was bad—I then went out after him across the road, and brought him back—I said, "The shilling you gave me was a bad one"—he said, "I was not aware of it," and gave me two good sixpences and a penny, and went away—I afterwards gave the shilling to the policeman, with some directions—this was about half-past 8, and about half-past 10 I saw the prisoner in custody.</p>

My husband keeps the Askew Arms, at Shep<lb></lb>herd bush—the prisoner came there on 1st of January, for a pint of beer, which came to twopence—he received some money from a tall man who was with him, and then offered a bad florin—I bent it easily on the edge of a drawer, and returned it to the prisoner—he picked it up, broke it with his teeth, and showed it to another person who was there; not the person who was with him, and said, "It is a very bad one"—I believe he threw the pieces away—he paid me with two penny pieces, and they both left together.</p>

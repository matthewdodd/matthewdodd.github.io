             sworn. I am a constable. On Wednesday the 16th of July, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was going up Petticoat lane, I saw this man with the copper on his head, offering it for sale in the street to a Jew, he asked him a shilling a-pound for it, and the Jew rather saw me I believe, then he would not buy it, else he was going to buy it apparently to me; I then asked him how he came by the copper, he said he bought it of a man in the street, a stranger to him, and had given half a guinea for it, I told him he was selling it a considerable deal under the value of it, he said he did not know that; I took him in charge, I produce the copper, he had an old set of fire irons, he offered them all for fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>(The copper identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Crown street, Moorfields, with a set of fire irons, there was a man before me with this copper on his head, he asked me if I would buy it, I asked him what he wanted for it, he asked me half a guinea, I bought it of him for my wife, she takes in washing; when I took it home it was too little for the place, I was going to sell it and buy another.</p>
               <p>Q. You was going to sell it to a Jew. - A. Yes, there was a boy walking with the Jew, I said put him in your bag, the man made answer he would sooner put my copper in the bag; with that I said I was going to sell it, if he was a mind to pay for it he might have it; he offered me a shilling a-pound for it, I did not let him have it.</p>
               <p>Court. No, the officer came and hindered you.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

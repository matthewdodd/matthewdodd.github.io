I am a surgeon at Whitechapel—early in August I was called to 95, Wentworth Street, and saw the prosecutor—he was in a fainting condition from loss of blood—he had a wound in his chest, passing over the front of the rib—the rib was not quite bare—it might have been a dangerous wound—I attended him for a week, and then he went to the hospital—I have not examined him since.</p>

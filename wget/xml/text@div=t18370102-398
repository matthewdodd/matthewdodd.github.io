                  </hi>. I am a whitesmith, and live in Duke-street, York-street, Whitechapel-road. About twelve o'clock at night, on the 20th of December, I was coming from a club in the Borough—just as I got to Aldgate, the prisoner laid hold of my arm, and said, "Won't you go home with me?"—I said, "No"—she asked me to give her something to drink, and we had a pint of ale in a public-house, we were a very few minutes there—she then took me up a turning—I did not like to go, but she hold of my arm—I would not go any further—we stood talking a few minutes—she was handling me, and all in a minute she ran away from me—I immediately put my hand into my pocket, and missed my money—I could not find her—when I came out of the club-house I put my hand into my pocket, and had 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am not certain which—I spoke no other person—she was the only person who had an opportunity of taking it—l had three half-crowns among my money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. The money is my own—I had been to the theatre, and hid changed a sovereign—I went into a public-house—the prosecutor was there, he insisted on my having a glass of something at his expense, I refused, and said I had money, and showed him the change—he would make me take a glass—I then went out to look for my friends—I was going home, when the policeman and the prosecutor came and took me—he was so much in liquor as to be hardly able to stand.</p>

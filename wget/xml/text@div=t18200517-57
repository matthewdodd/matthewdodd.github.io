            . I am a cheesemonger, and live at No. 18, Suffolk-street, West, St. Pancras. On the 13th of March I became acquainted with the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. In any after-dealings with them had you directions from the Bank - A. Yes, my first connection with them was not by the direction of the Bank, I did afterwards communicate with them by direction of the Bank, and all future transactions were by that direction.</p>
               <p>Q. On Thursday, the 16th of March, was anything given you by Mr. Fish - A. A 1 l. note - he is one of the inspectors of the Bank - it was for the purpose of purchasing forged 1 l. notes of the prisoner, Gardiner, who lived at No. 13 or 15, Rose-street, Covent-garden; the female prisoner lived in the same house with him. I went, gave the 1 l. note to Gardiner, and told him I wanted two of the best, or three of the common, if he had not got the best.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by the common or best - A. Forged notes. There are two sorts, as he had informed me; that the best was 8 s. a piece and the common 5 s. I was to have 1 l. notes. Harrison was present at the time I spoke of the notes. He said he could supply me with three of the common at 5 s. each, but he had none of the best. He told me I should mark or blot them with ink, and be very cautious how I passed them, for nineteen out of twenty went to the Bank. I gave him the 1 l. note I received of Fish. We were to meet again that evening between six and seven o'clock. I was to have three notes - he gave me 5 s. change. It was in the afternoon when I paid him for them. I think I went with him to Burn's, the Sun, public-house, Windmill-street. I saw him again the same evening - I think it was at the Sun; we met there for me to have the three notes. After we had sat drinking there sometime, he told me to put my hand down; I put my hand down on the seat by the side of us, and he put some paper into my hand; I put it into my breeches-pocket, and shortly after we parted. I am not certain that this was on the 16th, but it was the same evening that I gave him the note. I went home, and in my bed-room I took the notes out of my pocket, put them into a small box on my mantle-shelf, got up in the morning, and took them to the Crown tavern, Clerkenwell-green, and delivered them to Foy in the presence of Mr. Christmas, having first marked them myself - (looks at three) - these are them. I first marked them with the number of the note, and then the letter S.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see either of them again - A. I went again next day, the 17th, early in the day; Wales, an officer of Bow-street, went with me to Rose-street; he parted with me, and saw me enter Gardiner's house. I saw Harrison; she said Gardiner was not in, but I might find him at the Sun, in Windmill-street. I went and enquired there for him; he was not there. I saw him that day at his own house, and purchased three notes of him for 15 s. I paid him 10 s. in silver, and 5 s. in copper. I delivered the copper to Harrison. Gardiner was not by at the time. I was to have the notes at the usual time, which was between six and seven o'clock. I was to apply at Rose-street to see Gardiner; I saw him at the time appointed, and had the three notes of him, in his own room; he took them from the cuff of his coat, and marked them with a pin, at the end of the word</p>
               <p>"England;" he said they would then appear to have been filed from the Bank, for all notes had a hole in that place. I took these notes to the Crown, and delivered them to Christmas and Foy - (looks at three) - these are them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see him - A. On the Saturday afternoon. I am not sure whether Wales was with me that day. I went to his house and saw Harrison, and asked her when Gardiner would be in; she said she did not know; and, after having some conversation together, she asked if I wanted to do anything that evening? I said Yes: I wanted to go to work. She asked how many I wanted? I replied, two. I paid her 10 s.; she took a piece of whitey-brown paper out of her pocket, containing a great number of notes; after looking them over on the table, she picked out two for me, and said</p>
               <p>"these are two very good one's;" wrote on the front of each, and then delivered them to me. I went to the Crown tavern, Clerkenwell-green, and delivered them to Foy; these are them - (looks at three) - there is</p>
               <p>"Hilman, Brownlow-street," written on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with her respecting another person - A. I said I had a companion that was helping me to pass these notes, and I wished to introduce him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170028"></xptr>into the company the next time I came. I cannot rightly remember what she said then; the next dealing I had with her was on the 21st.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, on the 21st, did you go alone - A. I was accompanied by

            ; I went into the house in Rose-street, leaving Liberter in the street; he was introduced to me by Foy, Wales, and Christmas, for the purpose of seeing the transaction between me and Gardiner. I went in; Harrison was at home. I asked for Gardiner; she said he was not in, but would be home between one and two o'clock. I left, and found Liberter in the street, where I left him. I went at the time appointed, accompanied by Liberter. I went alone into the house, and saw both the prisoners; after some short discourse, Gardiner said, he would take me to the man he got them from; he took me through a passage, by his own house, to the Red Lion public-house. I do not know the street; he went out two or three times, returned, and said he could not introduce me into the man's company to deal with instead of himself, but I had better have half a score. He had two in his hand, which I had paid him for before, he looked at them, said these are prime one's and he asked if I knew what to do respecting the wire-mark. I said, No. He then took a silver tooth-pick from his pocket, made a hole in each note, and said they then appeared to have been filed, as all Bank-notes were filed in that place. I took them to the Crown tavern, and delivered them to Foy, in the presence of Christmas, after first marking them - (looks at them) - these are the same.</p>
               <p>Q. On Wednesday, the 22d of March, were you at the Crown tavern - A. Yes - Wales, Christmas, Foy, and Liberter, were there. I was searched by Wales - I had nothing but a 6 d. in my possession; a 1 l. note, and, I think, 2 l. in silver, was given to me, but I am not positive. I went to Gardiner's house with Liberter and Wales. I went into the house, and left them in Rose-street. Liberter followed me, and passed as I went in at the door; and Wales was at the end of the street. I cannot remember whether I had any transactions there then, or who were there. Gardiner, I now remember, accompanied me from his house to the Sun. He asked how many I wanted; I told him seven or eight, or half a score. He asked if I had got the blunt, meaning the money. I belive I said I had. He said,</p>
               <p>"Have you two ten?" I understood this to mean 2 l. 10 s.; and at the door of the Sun I gave him a 1 l. note that I had received of Mr. Christmas. I gave him 10 s. in silver, and was about giving him the remainder, when he said,</p>
               <p>"I have enough." We then went into the Sun; and after being in company some time, he went out, returned again, and shortly after said,</p>
               <p>"Put your hand down, here are three and your own back."</p>
               <p>Q. What was that - A. Three forged notes, and the Bank-note I paid him, as he had not got half a score. I put the paper into my breeches-pocket, returned to the Crown immediately, opened it, and found the 1 l. note I paid him and three forged notes. I marked each note - (looks at three) - these are them. He said, If I would come next day, he would complete the half score. I am not sure whether I did not ask him if I could not get them from him at home. I think he said No, it was dangerous, and he never kept any in his house. I saw him again the following day, accompanied by Liberter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any dealing with him on the 23d of March - A. I bought one note of him; I think it was at the Sun. I gave it to Foy, after marking it - (looks at one) - this is it. I then owed him 10 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen Liberter between the 23d of March and the 10th of April - A. I had not, nor had I seen the prisoners. On the 10th of April, I went with Liberter to Gardiner's house; he was at home; and after waiting sometime, I said,</p>
               <p>"I owe you some silver." He said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, you owe me 10 s." I paid him the 10 s., gave him 10 s. more, and told him I wanted two notes; and, at the same time, Liberter gave him 6 s. and said he wanted one. He returned Liberter 1 s. and said,</p>
               <p>"You have given me a shilling too much." We all three went to a public house in Rose-street; left that and went to another house, next door to his own; and after being there sometime, he called me out, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here is ten I will complete the order to-morrow." I put them into my breeches-pocket. I gave them to Foy and Christmas, at the Crown; I never opened them till I got there; and then found there were fifteen - (looks at them) - these are them. Before I went to the Crown, I went to his house, and told 
               <persName id="t18200517-57-person619">Harrison</persName>
             I had got ten from Gardiner, and to tell him to get the other half score, as I was to complete the score by to-morrow; we were to meet the following day.</p>

               <p>Q. On the following day, before you went, was any thing given you by Christmas - A. Yes; I had two 1 l. notes, and 2 l. in silver; and Liberter had 5 s. in copper. I and Liberter went to Gardiner's house together, and saw both the prisoners. I got in conversation with Gardiner, and asked how many he gave me last night; he said,</p>
               <p>"I gave you fifteen." I said,</p>
               <p>"You said there were only ten, but, when I opened them, I found fifteen." I gave him the two 1 l. notes and 2 l. in silver I received from Christmas, and Liberter gave him the 5 s. in copper which was left on the table. Shortly after he received the money from me, Wales and Jefferson came in, followed by Christmas and Foy.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you pay him 4 l. 5 s. - A. It was for the score of notes; nothing was mentioned about the other five, because the officer came in.</p>

            . I live in Captain's-walk, Vine-street, Narrow-wall, Lambeth. I am a labourer, and deal in coal and corn, or any thing that comes up the River. I was requested by Wales, the police-officer, to employ myself in detecting the prisoner. He directed me to Christmas, Foy, and Saul. On the 20th of March, I went with Saul to the end of Rose-street. Saul returned to me at the end of Rose-street. I went to the prisoner's house with him again that evening; he left me at the corner of the street; remained in the house about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, or little longer, then joined me again. I do not know where he joined me; we went to Clerkenwell, and saw Christmas and Foy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany Saul next day, the 21st - A. Yes, we went to the prisoner's house again, and waited at the corner of Rose-street. I saw him go into the prisoner's house and come out again; he joined me in about half an hour. I do not recollect whether we went again this day or not.

He went into the house, remained about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and then joined me again - I do not remember that he had anybody with him. If I recollect right we went from there to Clerkenwell-green.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any of your visits to Rose-street see Gardiner - A. The first time I saw him was on the 28th, at his own house - that was the first day that I went into the house. I took a letter which Christmas and Foy wrote. I saw Harrison when I first went in, but Gardiner was not there, and I gave her the letter, said I had got a letter from Mr. Saul, and I was to take what he had written for; she said</p>
               <p>"Gardiner is not within, if you step in in half an hour, he will be in to his tea." I left the letter and money with her. I saw a 1 l. note and 10 s. put in it. I went again in half an hour, he was then at tea - he said,</p>
               <p>"Stop a bit, I will take a walk with you;" he asked me where Saul was, and what had happened. I told him he had sprained his ankle at the Black Horse, Tottenham-court-road. He went out, and I followed him - he said he was going to see about the things. We went together to near St. Giles's church; as we went along he said,</p>
               <p>"I must call in at a friend's house, just wait a bit, and I will come to you." He returned me the money I gave him, and the letter. I asked him if the things were in there which he had written for - he said No. He left me by St. Giles's church, to call at his friend's. I saw no more of him that evening. I saw him again next day at his own house; he said I missed you last night, and did not fall in with you again. I went up to St. Martin's-lane with him, and then we parted. I asked him if he had got anything yet; he said No, he had not, they were not come out of the country, and that he had got orders then for fifty fives, besides others; we appointed to meet next evening, as he said he expected them to come by the six o'clock coach. I called next evening - I saw 
               <persName id="t18200517-57-person622">Harrison</persName>
             every time I called. I saw her that evening, she said she expected he was at Brown's, the Rising Sun, Windmill-street. I do not recollect that I found him that night. I went next day or the day after, but do not recollect that I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any dealings with him for notes - A. I had, on the 4th of April I went to his house between six and seven o'clock in the evening, Harrison opened the door; she said,</p>
               <p>"Do you want anything to-night?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I was to have half a score, but I can't take more than five to-night." She went to the table drawer, took a paper parcel, which contained a great many notes, and said I will pick you out five good ones; which she did, and told me they were good ones. I asked her how much they were - she said 1 l. 5 s. I gave her a 1 l. note and 5 s. in silver, which I had received from Foy and Christmas (I had returned them the money that was in the letter when I came back). I had not put the notes into my pocket when Gardiner came in himself. I said</p>
               <p>"What sort are these?" I gave them out of my hand. He said,</p>
               <p>"They are very good ones - they are all of the 10th." He turned them over, and looked at each. Harrison still remained in the room. He gave them into my hand, and I put them into my pocket. He said to me,</p>
               <p>"Mind, and be cautious in passing them - don't offer two in one shop;" and then said,</p>
               <p>"Jane, has he given you any money?" She said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, 1 l. 5 s." He said that was all right, and nothing more passed. I took the notes that evening to Christmas and Foy, and marked them T. L. before I delivered them - (looks at the notes) - these are them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again - A. On the 6th, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I went to his house, he was not at home. Harrison said I should find him at the Rising Sun, in Windmill-street. I went there, found him, and stopped sometime with him; we then returned back to his own house, and there I got four notes from him. I gave him 20 s. in silver for them - (looks at four) - these are them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you find at the house - A. When I went indoors he shewed me a piece of brown paper, and said</p>
               <p>"Here are these things." When we got in a strange man was there; Gardiner then went to the window-shutter, took out a paper, then went into the passage, putting his hands behind him, and gave me the notes. I went to the Crown, neither Christmas nor Foy were there. I took them home, they remained in my breeches-pocket unopened, and next morning I went to the Crown, and delivered them up to Foy and Christmas, having first marked them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again - A. On the 8th, at ten o'clock in the morning, at his own house; Harrison was in bed in the same room. I said I was come for some more; he said,</p>
               <p>"Jane, where are these things?" she said,</p>
               <p>"They are under the floorcloth, near the fire-place in the front parlour." He stooped down, and picked up something wrapped in paper; he opened it, shewed me the notes, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here are three prime ones, give me 15 s." I did so - there were only three in the paper. He and I then went to Long-acre together, he was going to Covent-garden-market. We wished each other good-by after having a glass of liquor. He said,</p>
               <p>"Did Saul tell you he owed me any silver?" I said</p>
               <p>"Yes, he told me of it; you need not be afraid of the money, you will have it on Monday. He said Saul owed him 10 s.; that he was not afraid, but he did not know whether he had mentioned it or not. I marked the three notes, and gave them to Christmas and Foy at the Bank - (looks at three) - these are them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you meet again - A. On the 10th of March; Saul was with me. We went to Gardiner's house between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170030"></xptr>not at home; we went to the Sun, he was not there; we returned to his house, and he was then at home. I lent Saul 4 s. to make up enough for two. Saul asked for a score. I do not know what passed. We then went out. He wanted us to go to another house, which we objected to. He then called Saul out - I had seen Saul give him the money, and I gave him 6 s. for one - he said,</p>
               <p>"You have given me 1 s. too much." Saul said,</p>
               <p>"I owe you some silver" - he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, you owe me 10 s.," and Saul paid him. We were to have the notes next night; we returned to the Crown, Clerkenwell. We went next night, and took 2 l. 5 s. in silver and two 1 l. notes; we saw both the prisoners at the house; Saul said,</p>
               <p>"Do you know what notes you gave me last night?" Gardiner said</p>
               <p>"Fifteen." Saul said,</p>
               <p>"You told me there was only half a score, and when I opened them I found fifteen." Saul said he had come to pay him for the remainder of the score, and had brought 4 l. 5 s. - he had 4 l., and I had 5 s. in halfpence in my pocket. I gave him the 5 s. in copper, and Saul gave him 4 l. Gardiner said,</p>
               <p>"I will go and get them presently." Harrison was present, and heard what passed. Before he got them the officers came in.</p>

            . I am a police officer. Saul and Liberter were employed by me to assist in detecting the prisoners. On the 17th of March Saul brought me three notes to the Crown, Clerkenwell-green, at eleven o'clock in the morning - I took them in the presence of Christmas. He brought me three more in the evening. He brought two more on the 18th of March, two on the 21st, three on the 22d, at ten at night, and one on the 23d, at ten at night. On the 4th of April Liberter brought me five, and on the morning of the 7th he brought me six. On the 8th he brought me three to the Bank, at twelve o'clock in the day, and on the 10th of April Saul brought me fifteen at twelve o'clock at night; I marked them all. (The witness examined and identified the several notes as he mentioned them.)</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you was present on the 11th of April, when the prisoner were apprehended - A. Yes, I went into the house with Wales, Jefferson, and Christmas; the prisoners were there, Saul and Liberter were there also - the prisoners were sitting by the fire. Wales went up to Gardiner, took something off the floor, held it in his hand, and said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got here?" Gardiner said,</p>
               <p>"I do not know, it belongs to these men (pointing to Saul and Liberter), if they are doing anything wrong it is more than I know." Saul and Liberter were sitting by him in a chair. I said,</p>
               <p>"Who are these men?" he said,</p>
               <p>"I do not know who they are." I asked Harrison if she knew who they were? she said No. We searched the prisoners, found nothing material on them, and took them to Marlborough-street. I left Wales and Jefferson to search the house. On taking them to the office I asked Gardiner what he knew of the two men we found there? he said he did not know either of them; that they came in just before we did, and the short man (Saul) asked him to look at two Bank notes for him, and to give him two notes for 2 l. worth of silver. I asked him if he had any money from either of them before? he said he never had. I asked him if he had given them change at any time before? he said he had not. I said,</p>
               <p>"Did not you think it extremely imprudent that a total stranger to you should come into your house and request you to give him notes for silver?" He said that Jane had seen the short man before, when he used to come to the house with girls - (it is used for such purposes). Harrison was present when he made this communication. He said they were both strangers to him, but corrected himself instantly and said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I think I saw them last night at a public-house near my house." Harrison was close to him. After taking this statement in my book, I read it loud enough for her to hear. Gardiner said it was correct, and she did not contradict it.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I know Saul and Liberter; I accompanied them to the prisoner's house in Rose-street on the 17th, 18th, 22d, 26th, and 27th of March, and on the 11th of April. I was present when Christmas delivered Liberter some money, at the Crown, on the 28th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this note, and see if you know it - (looks at one) - this is it. I marked it - it was given in my presence (No. 47844, dated 10th of Feb. 1819) - Christmas gave this note in a letter to Liberter. On the 11th of April I accompanied Foy - Saul and Liberter had gone into Gardiner's house about a quarter before eight o'clock. I waited some distance from the house for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, then joined Christmas, Foy, and Jefferson, and went to the house; I went in first, and was followed by Jefferson. On my entering the house I saw Gardiner sitting by the fire, and immediately made up to him. I saw him draw his left hand back from towards his thigh, and while I was in the act of taking hold of his hand, something dropped from his hand on the floor, I picked it up, and asked him what he had got there? he said it was what those men had brought - (looking round at Saul and Liberter) - and that if they were doing anything wrong he did not know it. I examined the paper. and found it contained the money that had been marked by me that day, and which I had given to Saul at the Crown - it contained two 1 l. notes and 2 l. in silver; a 5 s. paper of halfpence laid on the table.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Except on the day you took them into custody you was not in the house - A. I was not.</p>

            . I am in partnership with Mr. Lovel; we are grocers, and live in New-street, Covent-garden - the prisoner, Gardiner, was a customer of ours, he also paid us the rent of his house, which we receive for a gentleman in the country. On the 6th of April I received 17 l. 9 s. of him - 15 l. for rent and 2 l. 9 s. for grocery; it was paid by a woman, but I cannot say whether it was Harrison or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these 1 l. notes, Nos. 51633 and 47844, and say if they form part of that payment - A. They do both. I marked them</p>

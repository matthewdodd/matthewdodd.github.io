               <p>On the 4th of July the prisoner brought the deceased to the watch-house, and gave me charge of him. A great many words passed, and Mr. Lister ordered him into the room above the watch-house; he came down again, and blasted and swore at Mr. Lister; he clenched his fist at him, and said he would be revenged of him. About a quarter, or half an hour after that, Mr. Lister was going, when the deceased ran up to him, and clenched his fist at him, and said he would knock his jolt head off. Lister, upon that, gave him a push back with his fist across his breast, the deceased made a couple of steps backward, turned on his left side, and fell over a form. He said, What, d - n you, do you mean to murder me? I said no, there should be no murder done there. I went and took him up, and gave him some beer. He blasted Mr. Lister again. About one o'clock Lister went away; he was in the watch-house about half an hour. The deceased staid till three in the morning.</p>
               <p>After the fall did he complain of pain? - No; he complained of nothing. I left the watch-house a little after two; he was there then. The affair happened between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>When you left the watch-house did he appear to be hurt with the fall? - No; I set him on the form, and gave him some beer, and bid him be quiet. He blasted me, and gave me a smack of the face. I said he had better go home. He said, if he did he would go and break his windows. I said I supposed he would if he went in that condition. Then he gave me another smack of the face. I then took him in my arms, and carried him up into the room.</p>
               <p>When did he die? - On the 9th; this was on the 4th of July.</p>
               <p>He did not complain that he was hurt by the fall? - He did not complain at that time. His brother came to me upon the Monday week, and said he should be glad to speak to me. I asked him what he wanted. He said I hear my brother got his death among you. I said I did not know that he did. He begged I would show him the watch-house. I did so. He said his brother told him that four watchmen took him up into a room, and threw him down, and said he might lie there and be d - d.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the deceased after that? - I saw him twice. I saw him I think on the 4th day after; he then appeared as well as usual.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You have represented him as a troublesome man in the watch-house? - He was as troublesome a man as I ever knew; he was in liquor.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put out his hand and gave him a shove, and he, being drunk, staggered, and fell backwards? - He did.</p>

               <p>On Sunday the 4th of July, between eleven and twelve o'clock, Lister and Bailey came into St. Sepulchre's watch-house. Lister took his leave of them about half after twelve o'clock, and went home. A little after that the deceased, Bailey, and another watchman, came into the watch-house again. They brought the deceased before the constable of the night. The deceased was very much in liquor. Lister said the deceased had like to have pushed him down in the Old-Bailey, and some words ensued, and he would see who and what he was, and ordered him up stairs; he was let down again, and words ensued immediately;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150058"></xptr> the deceased offered his fist to strike at him, Lister warded it off with his left-arm, and the deceased fell over a form in the watch-house. He said, For God's sake do not murder me! Lister meddled no more with him. Trotter took him up, and set him on the form.</p>

               <p>What did he die of? - I do not know. I saw him the next day as I was going to Guildhall; I went into the prince of Denmark's head in the Old-Bailey; the deceased saw me and came in, and asked me where that rogue Lister was? He said, if he could see him he would lick him as long as he could.</p>
               <p>He did not complain then of the effect of the blow? - No, he did not; I saw him on the Tuesday week after, he was dying there.</p>
               <p>What do you know of his death, did you see him about the time of his death? - I saw him on the day before his death.</p>
               <p>What was he ill of? - He was very bad.</p>
               <p>Was it the effect of this blow? - He did not tell me that; he shook hands with me and said God bless you, Martin, you have behaved like a gentleman to me.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>The next morning when you saw him in the Old Bailey was he drunk or sober? - He did not appear to be in liquor, but full of spirits and ready and resolute to attack Lister if he could see him.</p>

               <p>On Sunday night, the 4th of June the deceased, Proctor, and I were drinking together; I went about ten o'clock to the watch-house to set the watch; he came after me and asked me to give him some more beer; I said he had had enough, and bid him go home and go to bed; he went away, and was brought afterwards to the watch-house by Lister: I was present at the time.</p>
               <p>Did you see the blow or push? - It was a violent blow or push, I cannot say which; he fell down with a violent force; there was a form, he fell on the form, and pitched on his side, and his head fell under the bench; they picked him up, and he said, for God's sake do not murder me! they took him up, and he was sent up stairs directly.</p>
               <p>Did Lister give him any other blow? - No. The deceased came to me the next morning and said that he had received his death, he had received a violent blow that he should never recover.</p>
               <p>Did he say he had received his death by the blow given him by Lister? - He said from the fall he received in the watch house. I never saw him afterwards till he was dead.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon. I opened the body of the deceased. Upon viewing the body before I opened it. I observed the right side of the body was swelled, and discoloured; upon the scrotum there was a large black place the size of a half-crown piece. Upon opening the body I found there was no mischief under the appearance of that black place, it was nothing but an outward blackness. I proceeded to examine all the entrails; there was no appearance of any thing but what was natural; it was observed to me that he had made bloody water; I examined the bladder; there was no appearance of any thing amiss there. I cannot tell the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>What do you think might be the cause of his death? - It is impossible for me to say; the fall might have produced a fever, and the fever might produce death; he might have died of a fever sooner if he had had no blow. He was attended by an apothecary in his life time.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You cannot say what was the cause of his death? - It is impossible for me to say what his death was occasioned by.</p>
               <p>There was nothing that you can determine upon of any injury that caused his death? - No, there was no fracture in the skull; no strain of the membranes; there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150059"></xptr> was rather a larger quantity of water than usual in his skull.</p>
               <p>Should you if you had not heard the story of his fall when you opened the body have collected that the man had had a bad fall? - I should not.</p>

I undressed him and got him to bed.</p>
               <p>Did he continue to complain of that? Yes, every day till the day he died he complained of a pain in his head and side.</p>
               <p>Did he complain of the head-ach? - No, of a pain on the top of his head.</p>
               <p>Did he call it a blow or a fall? - A blow he gave him and knocked him over a table, and that the table fell on him; and that he spit blood, and there was blood in his water.</p>

               <p>In what capacity did you live with him; I believe you passed as his wife? - Yes, I did.</p>

               <p>Did you learn how he got that wet? - When he went out he met with no misfortune.</p>

               <p>I am an apothecary. I attended Proctor in his last illness.</p>
               <p>What do you ascribe his death to? - To an injury he had received; by what means I cannot tell; I suppose an inward hurt, by a fall or a blow, I could not determine which.</p>
               <p>How many days did you attend him? - Not till the day before his death. I found him extremely convulsed; I thought him very dangerous and apprised him of the danger.</p>
               <p>Had he much of a sever? - No; his breast appeared very much distended; he breathed with difficulty, and spoke with difficulty; but seemed very sensible. He said that on the Sunday week before that he reeled against Lister, and Lister was not pleased, and being a constable he said Lister said he would press him, and take him to the watch-house; that words arose and something happened to him.</p>
               <p>What happened did he say? - That Lister gave him a fall or struck him, or something to that effect.</p>
               <p>Did he seem to have any hurt in his side? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Did you from his appearance think his story probable that his death happened from some fall or blow? - The woman complained of his making bloody water.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What symptoms were there to induce you to believe he died of a blow or fall, did you strip the body and examine it? - I did not. If the body had been hurt in nine or ten days, I should not have expected to have found the discolouration. I was sent for too late to do him any good. I ordered some broths and a fomentation.</p>
               <p>Was you present when the body was opened? - No.</p>
               <p>Could a blow be given without there being an appearance of it when the body was opened? - Yes; I think a blow in the stomach might be given without any appearance of it.</p>

I met Martin in the Old-Bailey the night before the coroner sat on the body; we went and drank together, and talked of the affair; he said he had a great regard for Jim, he was a hearty fellow; he said he was under obligation to Lister because he owed him for some bread; he said if his hands had not been tied, Lister should not have treated him in the savage manner he did.</p>
               <p>Trotter. I carried him up stairs myself.</p>
               <p>Both times? - He walked up stairs himself the first time.</p>
               <p>Was he taken up after Lister was gone out of the watch-house? - It was after Lister was gone home.</p>

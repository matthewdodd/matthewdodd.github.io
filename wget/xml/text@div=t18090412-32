               <p>Q. Are you a housekeeper - A. Yes. On the 6th of this month, about half past seven in the evening, I heard a window break, that was the first thing that attracted my attention; it was rather a private window that gave light to a desk; it looked into Drury lane; the other window was shut up, this was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a light was there at that time - A. There was no light but what was in the shop; there was no day light nor no moon as I know of; it was half past seven o'clock. I heard the glass fall; in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120024"></xptr>about half a minute or a minute I went to the place from whence the sound proceeded, of the broken glass. I saw a man's hand had got hold of my handkerchiefs, that was fastened to a line; he was pulling them out of the window, through the glass that was broken. They were silk handkerchiefs, he was drawing them out of the broken pane of glass.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that the pane of the small window that you spoke of - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe how these handkerchiefs were hanging before you heard the glass fall - A. They were hanging on a line of red tape, nailed on each side of the window for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they within the shop - A. Yes; within the shop; they were fastened with three large pins.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any part of them drawn out of the house - A. Yes, as much as half a yard at least; he could not get them off; he gave them a sharp pull at the time I got to the window; I saw the handle did not get them off; he tore the corner of the handkerchief. When he saw I saw his face at the window, by the glimmer of light that was in my shop, and likewise his hand, he ran off.</p>
               <p>Q. What light had you in your shop - A. There were several candles in the shop, there were two lamps in the Broad street side, but in this window there was nothing but a candle alight standing on the desk.</p>
               <p>

            There was light enough to distinguish him so as to know him - A. Yes; I saw his face and I knew it was the same man; when I saw him afterwards I suppose the prisoner saw me; I laid hold of the handkerchief, he ran off or walked off; he was gone very quick; I sent my boy after him, I did not pursue him myself; my boy assisted in taking of him;

             took him. The prisoner is the man I saw attempting to take the handkerchiefs out of my shop; he was brought back in about two or three minutes after he was gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When Mr. Meycock was at the office he charged me with breaking the window; he then said he did not know whether there were four or five handkerchiefs; now he has indicted me for two.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There were two handkerchiefs at the office; there were neither four or five handkerchiefs mentioned; I did say two or three; I did not know which till I counted them.</p>

            . Q Were you near the house of Mr. Meycock on the 6th of this month - A. Yes; I was standing on the opposite side of the way in Drury lane, about half past seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark then - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Meycock's the corner of Drury lane - A. Yes; on the left hand as you go from here. I saw the prisoner come up Drury lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come up alone - A. Yes; I saw the prisoner go up to Mr. Meycock's window; it is a small window that looks into Drury lane; he stopped there about a minute; I heard the glass break.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he standing when you heard the glass break - A. He was standing close by the window; I saw him with his hand put on the glass at the bottom of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his hand touching the glass of the window - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the glass breaking what did he do - A. He walked off about two yards to the corner of Drury lane and looked up Broad street; he found nobody come out; just at that moment he turned back again to the window that was broke, he put his hand in through the broken pane, and gave the handkerchiefs a pull.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any handkerchiefs at that time - A. Yes, they were hanging outside of the window, about half a yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the handkerchiefs hanging - A. Inside.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the consequence of this pull - A He drawed them out about half a yard; he then walked five yards away, he left the handkerchiefs there, about half a yard hanging out; he walked off five yards from the window; I crossed over the way, with intent to take him; he turned his head round a little, and seeing me behind him - I was about half a yard behind him - he ran away; I pursued him to the Coal yard, there I took him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was that - A. About fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same side of the way - A. No, the other side of the way; he crossed over the way. I took him and brought him back to the shop again.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Meycock's shop you mean - A. Yes; he was there delivered to the watchman.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

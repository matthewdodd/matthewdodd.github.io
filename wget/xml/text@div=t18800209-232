I am 25 years old—I was working with my father at Brooker's Farm, at Stonewall, near Edenbridge, Kent—I left him just before Christmas—he has a machine of Clayton's; he goes round the country with it; I used to drive the engine—I have known Collins ever since I could run alone—he is a fanner and landowner—he had the Old Bannister Farm, and Mr. Diver holds a farm tinder him, and I hired one under him of about 35 acres last Michaelmas—I called that Bannister Bank Farm—there are some sheds and barns on it—I had no machine of my own, only the one of my father's, which I worked with—about 28th November I applied to the National Deposit Bank, Covent</p>

               <p>Garden for a loan, in consequence of an advertisement in a newspaper—I first wrote to the manager, Mr. Thompson—I saw Collins when I hired the farm, and told him I had no money to stock it with—I dare say I had got 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but I had got no pounds—I ask him if he would go up to the bank with me—he said he would, but he would not be no security, and would not put his hand to anything—I showed him the letter I received from the bank, and we went up to London—he paid for my train—we saw Mr. Cochrane, and I said "I have brought up this friend, who is my landlord"—I then asked Collins whether he had let me the farm, and he said "Yes, Bannister Bank Farm"—I told him I had got a machine and engine working, and I dare say he could have that for security, but no horses and nothing else—he said he would send a man down to inspect the engine—this is my signature, but there wornt so much wrote upon that when I signed it: I can tell you that—this is the letter I received from the bank. (<hi rend="italic">This was addressed to Messrs.

(<hi rend="italic">This stated that the engines and machines were all there, giving the numbers of several engines and elevators, and stating that four of them had no numbers.</hi>) I took that to the bank when I went with Collins—Mr. Cochrane asked me what we had got—I said that we had got a traction engine—he said "I will send a man down"—I had told Collins I wanted to borrow 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I wrote this letter produced—I did not show it to Collins, he never saw it. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Sir,—I have nothing to do with my brother now, he has paid me my part") I produced that at the bank, but not when Collins was there; it was the one which is dirty that I produced at the bank—all that Collins said at the bank was that he would not distrain on the engines for no rent—the manager asked him whether I had got the engines mentioned in this list, and he said "Yes"—the manager said that he wanted my brother's receipt—I said "I will very soon get it for you,' and I afterwards took up a receipt—Collins knew my brother—my brother never had no machines; he does not live in the same place—he Uvea four or five miles off—this was written by John Harris; I asked him to write it; it says: "George Killick paid William Killick his part belonging to him. Settled November 5, 1879"—I did not show that to Collins; he never saw it; what has it to do with Collins 1—he said "Has your brother got anything to do with it now?"—I said "No, he don't work for me"—he said "You can get his receipt then"—I said "Yes," and he asked my brother one day whether he had anything to do with it, and he said "No".</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the directors of the National Mercantile Bank, Covent Garden, which is registered as a limited company—this letter of December 2nd is my writing—I had seen Killick when he called previously, but had no conversation with him—he came again with Collins on the 12th, and brought my letter; he said "I have come up about the loan; I am unable to find sureties to guarantee the repayment of the money, but I have brought my landlord, Mr. Collins, who has let me a farm of 400 acres, and he can speak to my respect<lb></lb>ability, and also will tell you that the machines are my own"—I said "I require the receipts for the machines"—he said "I have no receipts, but the machines were left to me and my brother by my father, who died three years ago; since I applied for the loan I have paid my brother's share out that he has in the business, amounting to 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I should feel obliged if you will lend me 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the machinery and other effects that I have—I said to Collins "Is this correct?"—he said "Killick's father died three years ago, and I know the machines belonged to Killick, and to my know<lb></lb>ledge he paid his brother 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the half share of the business, and I am willing to be answerable that I shall not distrain on any of the machines for rent on the farm that I have let him, or on any other farms I have adjoining there; I have let Mr. Killick a farm of 400 acres; I have known him ever since he was a baby, and I wish to assist him"—with that information, and partly at Collins's dictation, I wrote this undertaking, and he signed it—I said "I shall not grant the loan to-day, for I require the brother's receipt for the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he received, also a letter from the brother stating that he has no further claim on the machinery"—Collins said "We must go and get the letter and the receipt which you require," and that Killick was to bring up an inventory of the machines, together with the numbers—on 18th December Killick came by himself and brought this inventory and a letter from his brother and the receipt—I asked him to make a statutory declaration, and he made it before Mr. Irving, and he also executed a bill of sale—350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was handed to him in bank notes and he went away—we have not received any of the money; it is not due yet—we have not received the interest.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have prosecuted about four times, but have only con<lb></lb>victed once, the other cases never came on for trial—they were not settled, they satisfied Mr. Besley, our standing counsel, and that satisfied us—we brought an action in the Nottingham County Court two or three months ago—the case was lost, and I am appealing—it was not an action, it was merely a motion at the suit of Mr. Henry Isaacs, who is a shareholder in the bank—I was a witness for Isaacs—the Judge did not say, "The execution of the bill of sale has been obtained by conspiracy"—he de<lb></lb>cided that it was bad through want of consideration—Isaacs was simply the transferee, the innocent holder—the bank was registered on 23rd May, 1878—it is partly a money-lending office, but it is a registered bank, where cheques are issued—we have about 250 accounts with depositors, but hardly a dozen current accounts—there is about 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposited—the nominal capital is 500,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in 10,000 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. shares—I am the principal shareholder—I have 1,978 shares—I am not the bank—I have nothing to conceal—Isaacs has 40 shares—this is our prospectus—we discount good bills at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent—this loan to Killick was at 20 per cent—the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the messenger to go down, was paid into the bank, and I should think the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had made no demand whatever on Collins or on Killick—I know nothing about it, I simply went down to see the machines—the repayment was to spread over two years, at 20 per cent.—this hill of sale was read over to Killick by the solicitor who prepared it, and explained to him—we do business to the amount of half a million a year—we have from 5,000 to 6,000 clients, some of whom have been with us 10 or 15 years—I lost 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over the matter at Nottingham; some one had given a bill of sale to another person, which he transferred to Isaacs, and the County Court Judge said it was not a legal document—Mr. Isaacs suffered the loss and has appealed—I was only a witness for him—I made inquiries at Edenbridge, in consequence of which I discharged Taylor.</p>

On 19th January I went to Bannister Bank Farm, near Edenbridge—there was a house on the farm and two or three little sheds, nothing more—I found Collins at work there—I had a warrant granted at Bow Street—I said "I hold a warrant for your apprehension for conspiring with George Killick to obtain 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by false pretences"—he said "I thought it had all blown over; I don't know anything about the money, except the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which Killick paid me for the quarter's rent for the farm; I don't know anything about any more"—I took him to Bow Street and charged him—on 23rd January I went to Tonbridge Police-station, and found Killick in custody—he said "I wish to tell you all about it"—I took down what he said at the time; I said "What you say I shall write down now, and use, as evidence against you"—he said "I was about to take a farm of Collins, and I told him I wanted some more money; we had a conversation, and 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the sum men<lb></lb>tioned. Collins put me in the way of getting it, and said 'If you get the money I want 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to deal with.' After I had been to the bank once I told Collins I should have no more to do with it. Collins said 'Oh, go on, put down more tackle than you've got." He said that he had paid 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Clayton and Shuttleworth, and the rest had been spent in going to Paris and paying odd bills.</p>

I am anoverseer of the parish of Hythe in Kent, and carry on farming business there—on 20th December I was in the Grey hound, near Hythe—the two prisoners were there—Collins asked me to come in, and asked me to write out a receipt for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never knew him to write—I went into the public-house to do it, and while I was writing it I asked Killick what it was for—he said it did not matter what it was for—I said "Let us have a name for it"—they said it was for a quarter of a year's rent for the Bannister Bank Farm—I did not then know that the prisoner occupied that farm; rent is sometimes paid in advance in our part of the world—I know the farm, it is about 35 acres; there is a barn and sheds on it and other buildings, but not belonging to the ground—I do not think Collins ever lived there or Killick—there is no dwelling-house on it—Collins said the rent was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a quarter—I occupy about 40 acres of land of Collins, and pay him 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—my farm is called Meachland—I haw occupied it eight years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Stanlake, of 23, Park Street, Islington, a French-polisher—the prisoner has been living with my husband's mother between eleven and twelve years—as far as we knew they were man and wife, they always said so—on the night of 5th March I went to meet my husband in Goswell Road at his place of business—at that time and up to the present my husband's mother was living with us, and had been for about three months; she had ceased to cohabit with the prisoner because he ill-used her—he was not in the habit of coming to our house; he was forbidden, but he has watched my husband and me several times—this happened in High Street, Islington—my husband and I were coming home arm-in-arm together—we had passed about a dozen yards from Barnsbury Street when the prisoner rushed out of a dark corner, seised hold of my husband, and held him by one shoulder with one hand, and dug the knife into him with the other (this was between 10 and 11 at night)—he said "I will kill you"—I kept screaming "Murder 1"—my husband struggled with him; he never ceased digging the knife into him; they fell together; my husband fell on his face, and the prisoner fell on the top of him—he said "I will do for you," and dug the knife into the spine of his back, the lower part of his back—I ran towards the police-station; the prisoner ran after me with the knife—I called out "Murder!"—a constable came up to my assistance, and the prisoner turned on hie heel and went a different way in the dark towards Highbury; the constable</p>

                  </hi>. I am a French-polisher at a pianoforte manufacturer's—I have known the prisoner these twelve years—he has been living with my mother over eleven years—I was under the impression for some time that they were married; he told me so—I discovered that they were not married about eight years ago—my mother ceased to live with him because he broke up all the things and got a month's imprisonment—that was about four months ago—after that my mother came to live with us—I don't think the prisoner knew where we lived; he never came to the house—on the evening of 5th March my wife came into the city to meet me, and we were returning home together; we were going along Upper Street, Islington, and had got about three doors past Barnsbury Street, when all of a sudden I felt as if a load of bricks was falling on my head; it gradually knocked me down—I received a number of blows on my head—I turned and got up the best way I I could and faced the prisoner, and caught a large knife in my hand as it entered my throat—I struggled with him for two or three minutes, off the pavement into the road, on to the team lines—I fell on my face after all the blows—the blood was all over me, and it blinded me; I got exhausted, and he drew the knife from me and stuck it into my back, and said "You b—I have done for you now"—in pulling the knife out it pulled me up—I was taken to the station and then to the hospital, and was there three weeks—my hands were cut, and I have lost the use of a joint—as far I call tell this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the knife he had, or one exactly like it.</p>

About a quarter to 11 on this night I was standing at the door of the police-station in Upper Street, Islington, and heard a woman calling out "Murder!"—I ran to the comer of Barnsbury Street and there saw the prosecutor standing staggering, bleeding from the head; his wife was in the road, she pointed to the prisoner, who was about a dozen yards off, I don't think he could hear what she said; I went after him and told him he would have to go to the station with me, he turned round and walked quietly to the station with me; he said nothing—he was placed in the dock and the charge was read over to him, it was for attempt<lb></lb>ing to murder the prosecutor—he said nothing.</p>

               <p>line, he had lost a great deal of blood and was very much exhausted' this knife was shown to me, and is exactly such an instrument as would inflict such wounds; the measurement exactly corresponds with many of the wounds, they were clearly stabs—there was blood on the knife—the pro<lb></lb>secutor was perfectly sober—I examined the prisoner, there was dry blood on his cheek and both hands, and wet blood on both sleeves of his great-coat—he is a large powerful man, very much more powerful than the prosecutor.</p>

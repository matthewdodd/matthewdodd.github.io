The prisoner was in my service, and used to go out with potatoes, and take the money for them—he ought to pay me the money as soon as he came home—on 30th Oct. my mistress, who is not here, sent him with a sack of potatoes to Mrs. Hurley, of 2, George-street, Spitalfields—he did not pay me any money—he did not return, and I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>

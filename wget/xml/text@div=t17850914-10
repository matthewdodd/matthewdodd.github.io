               <p>Court. What kind of goods do you deal in? - Hats, on Friday the 29th of July, while my partner and I were settling our accounts, the time I believe to be about half past nine in the evening, when I happened to leave the shop, and went into the comptinghouse, and in about three minutes I heard a most monstrous noise in the shop I went first to see the occasion of it, and found the prisoner at the bar, with two or three other people, who said, they had seen him go out of the shop with such and such property, and they believed it to be mine, being goods that had been packed up for an order, I knew them immediately, they were my property, they were a dozen of hats of the value of six pounds; the prisoner was then secured, and in the shop; I do not know who found the goods upon him, I know nothing more.</p>

               <p>On the 29th of last July, about half after nine, or rather better, I was going up Cornhill, and I saw the prisoner stand at Mr. Hardy's door, I thought he was a lad belonging to the shop, till I saw two others about a yard distance come up, and speak to the prisoner, then that gave me a suspicion it was thieves, and I went across the way, and stood behind a hackney coach, and in about a minute or two I saw the prisoner stop himself, and go in at the door.</p>
               <p>Court. What occasion had he to stop to go in at the door? - I do not know that, my lord; the other men paraded backwards and forwards the mean while; he was in the shop, as near as I can guess, about two minutes, and I saw him come out with two parcels under each arm, two bundles of hats, then he crossed over the way, and the other men followed him, the other two were men grown, they were a great deal taller than him, as soon as he had crossed over, I went and laid hold of him directly with the property upon him; as soon as I laid hold of him, he cried out Shimerah! Shimerah! as loud as he could, which I understood to be his companions, he struggled to get from me, and my foot slipped, and I cried out stop thief, for fear the others should come up to take the goods away, and a waterman belonging to the coaches came up, and laid hold of him, and picked up the things, and gave them to me; we took him into Mr. Hardy's house, and he was committed, the other two made off.</p>
               <p>You are sure the things that were given to you were the same he had under his arm? - Yes, they were never out of my sight.</p>

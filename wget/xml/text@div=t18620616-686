                  </hi>. I am a waterman and lighterman, of Choppin's-court, Old Gravel-lane—I knew George Courtney, the deceased—on Friday, 16th</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186206160088"></xptr>
               <p>May, about 1 o'clock in the night, I saw Courtney and the prisoner in High-street, Wapping, near the Thames Tunnel, pushing each other and quarrelling—two other men were with them, of whom Henley, who does not appear, was one—they were all intoxicated—the prisoner and the deceased took off their jackets and commenced to fight—Courtney was knocked down twice, and the second time he said that he had lost a sixpence, and would not fight any more till it was found—the prisoner was struck several times by the deceased—he said that the deceased had got the best of it, and the deceased said that the prisoner was bound to fight him—the prisoner knocked him down a second time, and then he went back seventeen paces, struck him in the face, and his teeth were knocked out—he said that his ancle was sprained, and he could not fight any more—the deceased struck him again on the chest and ribs, and his head went against the palings—Courtney tried to defend himself from the blows, and a friend of his got between them, but was pushed away, and then the prisoner drew a knife from his pocket and struck the deceased with it shut, I believe—he struck him several more blows, and how the knife got open I cannot say, but it must have, or he would not have been stabbed—I saw blood flow, and Henley got hold of Cochrane and put him down—he said, "For God's sake, Courtney, I hope you are not dead"—he made several strong observations—I held his hands, and a policeman came and took the knife out of his left hand—I went with them to the station, and as we went along the prisoner seemed very sorry, and he ran with us to get a doctor—at the time the prisoner struck the deceased he said, "If I am to fight you, you b—, I will fight you with this," and I think he showed him the knife to intimidate him—a man came in between them, but was kicked, and was obliged to hop away—the prisoner was endeavouring to avoid the fight for nine or ten minutes—he retreated seventeen paces; I measured it—he was stopped by a paling—the deceased got him against the paling, and struck him and knocked a tooth out—the deceased was a very powerful man, much stronger than the prisoner—he is what they term a <hi rend="italic">rough,</hi> which is a man who can go and beat another man who does not understand the pugilistic system—I saw the commencement of the transaction—I did not see the prisoner struck on the stomach, but I saw him struck on the chest—he said two or three times that his uncle was sprained—the prisoner ran as far as he could, and the deceased was striking him on both sides.</p>

                  </hi>. I went up at the time Courtney was struck down by a blow from the prisoner—I was going up to stop the fighting and when I was within thirty yards I saw the prisoner strike the deceased with his left hand—the deceased turned away, staggered about ten paces, and fell—I saw him bleeding from the right breast—I took the prisoner in custody, and took this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from his left hand—I took him to the station, and then went to the hospital and saw Mr. Biddle there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital—the deceased was brought there by the last witness, and I found an incised wound on the right side of the chest, two inches long, extending from a little within the breast bone, near the insertion of the cartilage of the third rib, downwards and outwards—it was shallow at its commencement, but an inch and a half deep at its termination—he died eight days afterwards from</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 18th of August, I went with Cole to Queen-street, and saw some baskets laying under a stall, at the corner of Queen-street, I took them from there, and the prisoner came back with a cart, he was pointed out to me by Cole - I went up to him, and asked if he wanted those seven baskets; he said, No; he wanted a halfpenny worth of pears of the girl. I said, I wanted him for stealing those baskets, he said, he knew nothing of them, they did not belong to him.</p>

            . I live at No. 16, Shorts-gardens, Drury-lane. I was selling pears at the stall, the prisoner came and asked me if he might leave the seven baskets, for ten minutes. Fryer and Cole came to me soon after; the prisoner came up and asked for the baskets - I said they were in a shop, at the cornor of the street; he asked who took them, I told him, that gentleman, pointing to Fryer. He was then with a cart, which went down Queen-street; another man was in it. Fryer, asked if he came after the baskets, he said, No, he knew nothing of them; he wanted a halfpenny worth of pears - he appeared to be in company with the man in the cart.</p>

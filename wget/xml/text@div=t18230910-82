            . I was employed to cook this supper. The prisoner brought me a table-spoon to wipe, and said he wanted two more. I gave him two gravy spoons off the shelf. He went away, between eight and nine o'clock, with them. I did not see him afterwards. They were missed in five minutes, and he was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They had been in use a long time - A. One of them had. He did not sup in the house.</p>

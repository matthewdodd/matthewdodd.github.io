                  </hi>. I Live at 11, Adam and Eve-court, Oxford-street and am a valet—about the middle of June I was seeking a situation and was introduced to the prisoner, he asked me if I could go to St. Petersburg to take his master's, the Count de Medoc's money, 12,000 roubles, and asked me to come and see his master at Brompton-square—I did so and the Count spoke Russian to me in the prisoner's presence, and showed me a document, I read it all and said, "The document is right enough"—he said, "I will give you an answer to morrow by my courier," pointing to the prisoner, and</p>

               <p>they both said that I had better leave my place as soon as I could—the pri<lb></lb>soner came to my place next day and asked me how much I wanted for the job, I said that I did not know, he said "The banker, Mr. Spielman, was to take 500 for the job, but 1 suppose if you have half that it will be enough," said, "Oh, yes"—the same day the Count came to me at New Bond-street, and asked me if I could lend him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said that I could not but I gave him 10., the prisoner was not present—next day I saw the Count at St. James's hotel, and he asked me to leave my place and go to him next day at St. James's hotel and I did so—the prisoner was there with him—the Count said, "I am not ready yet, but I will try and prepare all my papers for you to go to Russia"—next day he asked me for more money and I think I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the prisoner's presence, who said, "It is quite right, you are very lucky that my master trusts you for 12,000, he is a regular gentleman and he will pay you everything," he told me that three or four times—after that the Count asked me for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I said I cannot give it to you—the prisoner swore at me, and said, "How is it that you do not be<lb></lb>lieve my master when he shows you the document which is right enough"—I lent him altogether about 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked the prisoner for it three or four times and he said, "It is quite safe enough, do not you trouble yourself at all."</p>

Foking, not as Count de Medoc—I went to a Casino with Foking and drank champagne there, he asked me to treat him—I did not give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay the landlady, nor did I see the receipt—you asked me for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to send to your wife in France and I lent it to you on the security of a ticket of your watch which M. Foking gave me—M. Foking said that he would pay me my 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and send me off next morning—I swear I did not take the watch out of pawn nor did I pawn it for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it was in for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Foking said to you that he might give me 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it but he never did—I tried to sell it, I have the ticket now.</p>

I let apartments at 22, Brompton-square—about the end of January the prisoner came there with a person calling himself Foking, they stayed about twelve weeks—the prisoner told me that Foking rode with the Emperor in Russia, and that his wife was Countess Demidoff in her own right—they were recommended to me by a respectable tradesman and came as master and servant, but they did not appear so at all, they lived together, ate together, went out together, and came home together, and if they were out all night they were out together, and they lived very disre<lb></lb>putable lives—the prisoner said that his master was very rich and had plenty of money, and Mr. Spielman was his banker in England—I was not paid my rent or anything else.</p>

I took the prisoner on 2d April in Burton-street, Pimlico, I had been looking for him some time—I had a warrant for him and Foking as well, he understood English very well—I told him the charge was obtaining several sums of money from Rosenoff—he shook his shoulders, and said something about Count Demidoff, and com<lb></lb>menced to swear in English.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not somebody interpret the charge to me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; four Frenchmen and one lady were present—there was not a police-officer there who spoke German and French, but at the station there was—it was</p>

               <p>the landlord of No. 34, in the opposite street who was with me, as I did not like to go into your house alone—I took your pocket-book from you—I do not know whether there was a 1,000 franc-note in it; the papers are all in it now, I can't read them, they are in French; and here is a French dupli<lb></lb>cate (<hi rend="italic">One of these was a receipt for</hi> 1,000 <hi rend="italic">francs, signed "Soria Foking"</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I came from Paris with M. Foking and his children, and governess and lady's-maid, he owed me a thousand francs for a year's service and gave me this bill instead, he sent away his family and came to London with me. He made the acquaintance of M. Dennison, a chemist, who advanced him money, M. Dennison said that he knew a Russian valet who had about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of his own who would, no doubt, advance some money to another Russian. My master said that if he was a respectable man he would send him to Russia with some documents to deposit at the bankers there. M. Dennison took me to Rosenoff, who afterwards saw Foking, they spoke Russian together, but there was no mention of Demidof—I have three wit<lb></lb>nesses to prove that Rosenoff has said that Dennison was the cause of his lending the money to the Count. I was only paid 18 francs altogether, and had to pawn ray clothes to send money to my children; Foking has gone away leaving me entirely destitute—he owes me 1,600 francs.</p>

               <p>SARAH STEELE. On the 13th of January I left the service of Mr. Henry Bond, of Park-road, Regent's-park - I left a box there in care of Moore, my fellow-servant, which contained all this property - he was to send it to my sister's, in Castle-place, Pimlico, where I went to lodge - I have not seen the box, or its contents since - my property was worth 13l.</p>

            . I was Steele's fellow-servant, and took charge of her box on the 13th - it was locked - I delivered it to the prisoner (whom I knew before) on the 17th, to deliver at No. 2, Castle-place, Castle-lane, Pimlico - that direction was nailed on it - I saw no more of him or the box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are there any other servants beside you? A. Only one - I gave it to him outside the gate, locked and corded, as she had left it - I have known him two years - he was formerly a watchman.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner in the Uxbridge-road, between Tyburn-gate and Bayswater - he was talking to a woman, who saw me within twenty yards of them - she then turned her head, and he instantly walked away very sharp - he did not run - she knew I was a constable - I overtook, and collared him, saying, "I have got you at last, Young" - he said, "What is the matter?" I said, "I believe your name is Young;" he said No, in a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310023"></xptr>low tone of voice - I said I took him for stealing a box from No. 10, Park-row - he said he knew nothing about it- as I was going to lock him up, he said, "It is of no use for me to tell you any lies; I did receive the box, but I had been drinking that morning, and in my way I met with a friend - we got drinking and tossing together, in the meantime some person came, and took it away."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not appear to have been drinking? A. No; this was four months after - I found nothing on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge in Cirus Street, Marylebone, and am a labourer—at the last Session of this Court I was indicted for uttering counterfeit coin and acquitted—a man named Murply was tried with me (<hi rend="italic">see page</hi> 305)—on Sunday the 18th January I met the prisoner at the Welsh Harp—he asked me to meet him next day at the railway arches at Kilburn at 11 a.m. to pass some bad money—I communicated with the police and met him at 11.30 on the Monday, having waited for him—he was with another man—he asked me to stand back, as he did not want the other man to see me—he then tooke me into the Volunteer public-house, Kilburn, gave me some drink, and paid with a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said "How much bad money have you got?"—he said "I have got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, I have got two half-sovereigns, two of the finest made, which cost me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, and when I have smashed them there will be 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to be divided between us"—I said "Show</p>

               <p>me," and he pulled out a pocket from his right-hand coat pocket, and was going to showing me, but the barmaid came to the front of the bar, and he put it back in his pocket—we came out of the house and went down cariton Road, kilburn—I said "I should like some bacca"—he said "I have not got bacca-shop—I put it in my mouth and felt it was bad, it was soft—I looked at it—I pulled a penny from my pocket and paid for a pennyworth of bacca—the officer came by, I gave him a sign and he took the prisoner—I gave the shilling to the constable at the station—I marked it with my teeth.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had known the prisoner about six week before he was taken in charge—about there weeks of the time I was a waiting my trial—I had seen him about there times, first seymour place—the first time I said anything about the money was at the welsh Harp—he promised me a coat three weeks before—I did not ask him for one—I was not wearing my own coat—I did not take it off and ask him if he could let me have an old coat—agreed to let me have an old coat on the Monday—he was to meet me on the monday to pass bad money, not to let me have a coat—he left a lamp at my place and I went to his house about it on the saturday—he gave me the coat honestly like a man—I will swear I was not to pay him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I did not pay him anything—I had only 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.in my pocket on the monday—I was tried last Sessions with william murphy—I was wrongly accused—I was acquitted—murphy got eighteen months—I told the police about the prisoner—I was with the prisoner about twenty minutes at the most on the monday—I went into only one publice-house—I did not say anything the first time at the police-court about the prisoner pulling out the packet of money—I was not asked—I mentioned it the second time—the prisoner struggled with the policeman when he was taken, and asked him to show his authority—I was on opposite side looking at him—I did not see him throw the money aways—I was agood bit behind—I station—I never said I gave it to him as he got hold of the man—I knew nothing about a packet of money being picket up then.</p>

John Peek. I am a builder, of 7, Offenham Terrace, Carlton Road, Kilburn—I was in the Carlton Road on 19th January about 12.45, and picked up these 19 coins, in a paper parcel, with some paper between each coin—I put them into my coat pocket, went home and looked at them, saw they were counterfeits, and as some one came to look at the house I have to jet I put them aside, and did not think more about them till I saw something about it in the Kilburn Times on the following Saturday, the 24th—X then took them to the police-station—I afterwards went with Sergeant Samers to the Carlton Road, and pointed out to him the spot where I picked up the coins—they lay on the kerb, and a little black bag lay in the gutter—I threw the paper away—this is a similar mark to those I made on the back of the neck on each coin.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM TILLEY. I live in New Inn-passage, Clare-market. On the night of the 2nd of July I was passing <placeName id="t18320705-148-crimeloc791">Aldgate</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18320705-148-crimeloc791" type="placeName" value="Aldgate"></interp>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where was I taken? A. In Mitre-street - I had been to my club, but was not tipsy; I saw nobody round you - I did not see you taken; I cannot tell whether you was standing up, or laying down - I saw you turn down Mitre-street; I followed, but I slipped down.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Will you swear you were sober? A. Yes, I had taken nothing after my dinner; I will not swear I was exactly sober - I was not very sober, but could walk about my business.</p>

            . I was with my father, and saw the prisoner take his watch out of his pocket; he ran away, and was stopped in Mitre-street, I think - I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where were you walking at the time? A. On my father's right side; I was looking in front of me - you came round in front of my father, and took the watch.</p>

            . I was the night-officer. I received the charge; I told the prosecutor I thought he was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Could this boy see me at the time? A. I did not see him open his eyes; I consider there was something the matter with his eyes - the watchman who brought the prisoner, is not here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I heard a cry of Stop thief! near Mitre-street, and I met a man running, who knocked me down; ten or twelve men then ran up the street, and while I was on the ground, the prosecutor gave me in charge - it was half-past eleven o'clock at night.</p>

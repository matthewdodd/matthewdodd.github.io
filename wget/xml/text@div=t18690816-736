                  </hi>. I am housekeeper to Mrs. St. John, of 3, Houghton Place, St. Pancras—on the night before the burglary I was the last person up—I saw the house all fastened up about 11 o'clock—there was no fastening to the back-kitchen window, but the shutters were shut, and there was a bar across—I was knocked up about 4 o'clock, and found the back-kitchen wide open, and the ventilator broken—I missed three pairs of boots, and a jacket of mine, and a mustard-pot and a pepper-caster.</p>

On the night of 13th August I was on duty near Houghton Place, St. Pancras, and heard a rattle springing at the top window—I got over the back-wall, went to the back of the house, and found the back-kitchen window undone—I stopped there till the sergeant came to the back from the front door—he searched the home while I stopped outside, but he found no one—I got on the wall, and, while he had gone for assistance, I saw the prisoner concealed under the chimney of 219, Seymour Street, about twenty-two yards off, level with the back of No. 3; the houses are back to back—I followed him—he picked up a slate to knock me down with—I stopped to get out my truncheon, and he escaped to Ampthill Square, where he was apprehended.</p>

On 14th August, about 4 a.m., I was in Houghton Place, heard a rattle, went to the front of the house, and was let in by a female—I searched the house, and found the kitchen in great confusion, and en the window-sill found three pairs of boots, and a black cloth jacket—on searching the grounds, I found a mustard-pot and a pepper-caster—a muffineer was missing, which has been found.</p>

I am salesman to Dean &amp; Co., ironmongers, of 3, Arthur Street, next door to Messrs, Bond, Forbes &amp; Cunningham, wine merchants, where the prisoner was employed—the prisoner has left parcels on our premises six or seven times this year—the first time he brought them he said that it was bottles of wine, which had been given to him, which he did not want to take into the stores, and I let them be there, among the ironmongery—on the day he was taken, he brought a basket con<lb></lb>taining three bottles, which he said contained catsup—I had communicated with Bond &amp; Co.—I saw Mr. Forbes passing, and knocked at the window—he came in and examined the basket, and took one of the bottles out—he then went into his own premises, and Mr. Freshwater came in, examined the bottles, and marked them—about ten minutes after he left, the prisoner came and took the basket away—that was before 11 o'clock—Mr. Fresh<lb></lb>water followed him and brought him back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Bond, Forbes &amp; Cunningham, wine merchants, of Arthur Street, West—the prisoner has been in their employ seven or eight years—he bore a good character—he was assistant to our dock clerk, and had access to the stock as much as myself—I had some conversation with Mr. Forbes, and on the morning of the 17th went to Messrs. Deane's, and found a basket containing three bottles, two of port, and one of brandy—I marked them with a cross on the corks—the basket was tied up tightly over the necks—I left them there, and went back to my master's premises—I heard the prisoner say that he was going to the Custom House—I saw him leave Dean's premises with the basket, followed him, stopped him, and said "Strong, what have you got here?"—he turned, round, and looked at me for a moment, and said "Cranberries," and there was a very small parcel at the top—I said "I do not mean that," and then he said "Catsup"—I said "You have made some mistake, I have seen the bottles"—he said "Well, it is wine"—I said "You must come and explain the matter to Mr. Forbes, he wants to know where they came from"—he turned to go up King William Street, but I said "Oh, no"—I put my arm through his, and we walked together to Mr. Forbes—I said "I wish Strong to explain, Sir, where he got these bottles from"—Mr. Forbes said "Strong, where did you get these bottles?"—he said "I brought them from home this morning"—Mr. Forbes said "Where did you get them, to take them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187104030048"></xptr>
               <p>home?"—he said "They are part of two dozen I bought for a friend; he did not want the whole, and returned me some, and this is one of them"—Mr. Forbes said "Strong, I know you are a thief; you have been leaving parcels at Messrs. Deane's for some time past, and always told the same story about it being catsup"—he denied it, and again said that he could prove they were his property—I come to business about 8.30 or 8.45, and the prisoner comes about 9 o'clock—everyone employed there has access to the wine—the prisoner was taken to the station, and Mr. Forbes said to the policeman "Of course you will go and search his lodging?" the prisoner made no remark—I went with the officer, and searched the premises, and he made entries in my pocket-book of twenty-nine bottles, including brandy, and two ullage bottles, and twenty-five or twenty-six capsules and labels of our firm—I recognized the writing of a clerk in our establishment, on a sample bottle—those things were taken to the station, and shown to the prisoner, and the inspector told him he would be charged with stealing them—I was not near enough to hear what he said, but he claimed two or three of the bottles—the inspector said "What about the samples?"—he said "Well, I obtained them from the docks, they are country samples"—as to the capsules and labels, he said "I know I took them"—in December last he bought two dozen of brandy, which he said was for a Mr. Casey, and another dozen in January, for the same gentleman—that is all the brandy we have ever sold him—he has bought a bottle of sherry or claret once or twice, which is down in the book—I found, at his house, this long foolscap paper; part of it is in his writing, but one page I am rather doubtful about—I believe the bulk of it to be his—I have compared it with oar bin<lb></lb>book, and find it is a copy, with the numbers of the bins and all, and the date and name of the wine; also our private mark, which we were not aware he knew—he had no authority from us to make that out—I have tested the brandies, and find thorn all of the same strength, between 17 and 18 under proof, and similar in quality and strength to the brandy on our premises—these two bottles have not been drawn, but I can tell by the cork that it is old port—we have 300,000 or 400,000 bottles, and it is impossible to miss one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner has borne a very excellent character—his duties were merely to take the re-gage papers to the docks, and pass them—he paid the duties in the docks by cheque—he only had crossed cheques entrusted to his care, and sometimes gold, but very limited—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a book in which I enter when I let the men have bottles at cost price—I have the name of the prisoner here, and several other members of the firm—the largest number sold here is three bottles, except at Christmas, for their friends, when one man had nine bottles at cost price—four dozen of brandy is all we have sold to the prisoner since July, 1870, and a bottle of sherry and a gallon of gin two days before this affair, and a bottle of claret—I did not enter what was sold before July, as that was before I took to that branch—the dock sample is a glass bottle which will hold nearly a pint. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He would not have authority to take the dock sample—it was only a month or six weeks before this that we commenced capsuling our brandy, so this must have passed through my hands—I am positive I did not sell him brandy before this book was in existence—another little book was found at his premises.</p>

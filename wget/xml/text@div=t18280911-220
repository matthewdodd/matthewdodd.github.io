            . I am servant to Mr. Joseph Rankin, of Ulster-place, Regent's-park. On the 17th of June, I paid the prisoner some money for his master; I cannot tell how much, but I paid him when he brought the meat - the last I paid him was, on the 1st of July, 1s. 1 1/2d. - he gave me this receipt, and these other receipts are his writing: here is June 16, 1s. 8 1/2d.; June the 11th, 8s.; June the 25th, 2s. 1d.; June the 27th, 7s. 2d.; and June the 26th, 2s. 9 1/2d.; the prisoner wrote the receipt to them all, and I paid him the money for his master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not he always give you a receipt? A. Yes - in his own name.</p>
               <p>MR. GREEN re-examined. Q. What was the habit of the prisoner's settling with you? A. Every day at first; and then I never had any money since October last; I suffered it to run all that time - it is upwards of 34l.; he said at first the lady was ill, and then he said he wanted the abstract of the bill and I gave it him - I have asked him for the money several times; I think the first time was before Christmas - the debt began on the 12th of April, and it went on till the 1st of July, and is 34l. 17s. 10d. - I thought they had had all this; I do not know whether they have or no - the prisoner has never accounted to me for these sums of money paid in these bills; he told me they had not paid - I said several times "It is very strange Mrs. Horton don't pay her bill;" he said at one time she was out of town, and another time she was ill - I think I spoke to him about it in June: but in July he asked for the abstract te be sent, and I said I supposed she was going to-pay.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Up to October she used to pay daily? A. Yes. for a little time prior to the 12th of October, and from then I have received nothing: he brought orders for meat and he took it; he told me part of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110131"></xptr>time that she was out of town, but there was part of the family there - I let it go so long because she was a respectable lady, and I did not like to ask for fear of offending her; my books are not here, but there is an entry in them of the bills, and of the money I received - I was not ordered to bring them here; I took them to Mary-le-bone Office - the books are the things that would tell what I received.</p>

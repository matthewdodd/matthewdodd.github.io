                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer, and live in Oxford-street. The house, No. 17, Edward-street, Portman-square, belongs to me—it is used as the Marylebone Literary and Scientific Institution—the secretary and porter live in it. On Friday morning, the 14th of January, in consequence of information, I went there and found a dial had been taken from the theatre of the institution, and a rope from the lower part of the premises, which are occupied by me, and some padlocks from the barriers or avenues through which you pass to the theatre—I also missed two or three glass-holders belonging to the lamps—the clock and padlocks belong to me as one of the members, and the fixtures generally were mine—I had not seen the things for a long time before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter of the institution, and live on the pre<lb></lb>mises—I went to bed on the Thursday night about twelve o'clock. On Friday morning, about twelve, I observed a trap lifted up between the seats in the theatre, which communicates with Mr. Ball's warehouse below—the whole of the house is let to the Institution, but not the ware-house—that is over a stable, and the theatre over that—the theatre is part of the house, but there is no internal communication between the stable or warehouse and the house—the trap-door is never used, indeed I never knew there was one there—it fastens underneath by two bolts—there is a separate entrance to the warehouse and stable—we have nothing to do with them—I missed the clock and other articles, which I had seen safe on the Thursday morning—the parties must have entered by the trap-door—I found no mark of an entry in any other place—the secretary, Mr. Wil<lb></lb>liam Holl, and his family live and sleep on the premises—he has the second and third floors—he has nothing to do with the rest of the house.</p>

On Monday evening, the 18th of January, about half-past nine o'clock, I accompanied the witness Drakeford to No. 1, Manchester-mews, North, and saw the prisoner—I said, "I am a police-sergeant, I am come to apprehend you for stealing a rope-fall, the property of Mr. Balls, No. 170, Oxford-street; likewise on suspicion of stealing an eight-day dial, two gas-holders, and other articles, the property of the Marylebone Literary and Scientific Institution, No. 17, Edward-street, Portman-square"—I said, "I caution you—you need not say any thing unless you like, as whatever you say I must state on my oath before the Magistrate"—the prisoner then said, "I certainly did sell the rope, but I did not steal it, I bought it of a man named Davis, and gave 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it"—I asked where Davis lived—he said he believed it was somewhere about Hampstead, or Hampstead-road—I then said, "I must search your room"—he said, "That you may do, you will find nothing there but my own property"—I searched, but found nothing con<lb></lb>cerning this matter—I then took the prisoner to the station, and on our way there we called at Mr. Alcock's, a builder, No. 4, North-street, Man<lb></lb>chester-square—I showed the rope-fall to the prisoner, and said, "Is that the rope you sold Mr. Alcock?"—he said, "I did not sell it to that gen<lb></lb>tleman," meaning Drakeford, who is Mr. Alcock's foreman—Drakeford immediately said, "I paid you for it," and the prisoner said, "Yes"—next morning I went again to the prisoner's residence, and found there two</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Caunter. On Saturday morning, the 26th of September, about half-past nine o'clock, Pheny came to the house with some fish; I said I thought it was a mistake, as there was none ordered - Miss James came out of the dining-room and said he might leave it or take it away, which he pleased - he left it and went away; he had not then been in any room - he came again in half an hour; I went up stairs to speak to Miss James, leaving him on the mat in the passage - I was gone about five minutes; when I came down I told him to wait a few minutes - a person came in, and I paid him for the fish; the parlour opened into that passage.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's niece. I was writing at the desk in the parlour - one seal with a crest on it was attached to the ring and key, and one seal was loose; Evans came and said there was a boy with some fish - I went and said I thought it was wrong; he might take it or leave it - he left it and came again; I was then in my bed-room - I had left the seals and key safe; I went out about eleven o'clock and returned about three; my uncle asked me if I had touched the seals and key - I said No; I saw Pheny the same evening; he had been brought to the house by his mother - I asked him why he had entered the parlour; he said he had not - I said it was of no use denying it - he then said he had taken them from the desk, and pointed to the place.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Then he did not deny it? A. No - he said he bought them of a lad, who told him he had found them in some dirt or ashes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Would you like to give more than 1l. for them? A. If I was going to buy them, I perhaps might; I should not think these others are solid.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Tyler's Defence. I told the officer I gave 15s. for them - he knows I went with him freely; the lad came to me while I was working at my board: he said, "I have found two or three seals in some dirt, bigger than this one"- I said I could say nothing to it; he came in half an hour and brought them - he wanted 30s. for them; I kept him some time, while I tried them with aquafortis - I said I would not give more than 15s.; I gave him 2s. then, which I borrowed, and he was to come again for the rest, as I had no change - he came again just as I was going out.</p>

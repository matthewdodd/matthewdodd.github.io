On the 25th of August, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop and bought two ounces of tea and a pound and a half of sugar, which came to 2s. 6d.; he took a dirty linen bag out of his pocket, and took a 1l. note out. He asked for the change; I told him I thought I had not got it. I suspected it was a bad one, but did not tell him so. I gave the note to Jones, my shopman, to go out and get change. The prisoner heard me sent him. I had observed the name of"Hoares and Co." on the right side of the face of the note.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you asked the prisoner any questions about it - A. Not any. My young man was gone ten or fifteen minutes. I kept the prisoner in conversation, by talking about the country, as he appeared a countryman. He said my young my man was a long while gone. I said I was obliged to send across Smithfield for the change, and it took some time. He went towards the door, I followed him to see if my man was coming, not seeing him, he said he would walk round Smithfield, and come back for the change and goods, then left. Jones afterwards returned with the note, and gave me information about it. I locked it up by itself, but did not mark it. I took it to the Bank that afternoon, where I ascertained it to be a forgery. I then marked it at the Investigator's office (looks at in), I am sure this is the note the prisoner gave me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever return - A. Never.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Rickett. The prisoner came into the shop. my master gave me the note to get changed (looking at it), this is it. I had observed" Hoares and Co." on the face of it, and "Willian and Co., Bull and Mouth-street," on the back, before I took it out of the shop. I could not get it changed; it being a bad note.</p>
               <p>JOHN MASTERS. I am a bookbinder. On the 28th of August I heard Mr.Rickett had taken a bad note, and the description of the man who uttered it led me to suspect the prisoner, whom I had formerly known, by his going about with earthenware. I went round to where he resorted, and saw him in a coart in West-street, on the right hand going out of Smithfield; he was with another man; I heard that man say to him.</p>
               <p>"The note is up yet in the grocer's window, and I thought you was out of the way." The note was then up in Mr. Rickett's window. This led me to suspect he was the man. The prisoner said he was going out of the way that evening, he then pulle a bag out of his right hand pocket, opened it, and took a 1l. bank note out, and put the bag in again, doubled up the note and put it into his fob. The other man walked away. I said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"I presume you are the man that passed the note to Mr. Rickett," he said he was the man, and told me if I wanted any, to appoint any public-house, and kept him in conversation for about an hour. We walked to the corner of Jewin-street, Aldersgate-street; he said he would not walk any further diwn Aldersgate-stree, for he knew Aldersgate-street very well. He wanted to go down Jewin-street. I immediately called a coach which stood in the road oppsite to Jewin-street, and told him I apprehended him for uttering the note to Mr. Rickett, and having one then in his possession.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How came you to know that the note in his possession was a bad one - A. He told me that the note he had in his bag cost him 8s. and the man whom he had it of paid 7s. 6d. for it. I forced him into the coach; he resisted a good deal, at last when he saw a mob) coming round, he went quietly into the coach. I got in with him. He threw the dirty bag out at the door; Payne picked it up, and gave it into the coach to me. I found the note in it, which I afterwards put my name on (looking at it).</p>
               <p>MR. RICKETT. (looking at the bay.) it is the same sort of bag that he liad at my shop. I believe it to be the same-this is it. I had never spoke to him before. I do not know how he came to be so free with me.</p>
               <p>ROBERT PAYNE. I work at a glass-house in Aldersgate-street. On the 28th of August I was selling fish about the street and saw the prisoner and the las witness hustling together. I put down my tray to see what was the matter. Masters asked him to go back to the man where he passed the note, if he was innocent. I tried to peersuade him to go back, and so did a gentleman who got out of a gig, and others, but he would not. I saw him put into the coach. Masters and another amn got in with him.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090040"></xptr>I saw the prisoner, with his left hand, throw a dirty bag out of the coach, I picked it up and gave it to Masters at the coach-door, in the same state as I picked it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not drop it - A. No; he threw it out under the hind wheel, while Masters was getting in. It must have come from his hand, as neither Masters nor the other had got in.</p>
               <p>CHARLES CHRISTMAS. I am Inspector of bank notes.(Looking at the notes.) That uttered to Rickett is forged in all its parts, paper, plate, and signature. That found on the prisoner is of a different plate, and is forged in every respect, and is not the signature of the signing clerk.</p>

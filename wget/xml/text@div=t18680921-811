                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—I lived with him up to the time he was taken into custody, at 21, Bell Street, Marylebone—on the evening of 7th September, I went out with a female friend of his and mine—I returned home a few minutes before 10; my husband was not at home then—I waited up for him till after 1 o'clock, when, thinking he would not come home, I undressed and went to bed—about 2.30 he came home—he said to my little boy, "Is your mother here?"—he said, "Yes, father"—he then lighted a match, and began kicking me—I was in bed—I rose to get up, and as fast as I got up, he knocked me down, over boxes, and chairs, and different things, a great many times—at last, I sat down on a box, when he struck me down—he then went to the fireplace, and got the poker—I knew if he did that I should be seriously hurt, and I ran under the table, and kept bearing him not to do so—he broke the table to pieces over my head, and then went to the mantelpiece, where there was a set of paper trays, and knocked them to pieces on the floor, and took them up with his hand as well, and beat them up—I rushed to the door, to try to get out, and he rushed after me, and met me as I had my hand on the door, and brought me back, and immediately rose the window and put me outside—I screamed "Murder!" and held fast by his collar with both hands with all my might—I have no idea what the distance is from the window to the ground—we live on the first floor—when I screamed "Murder!" the witness Oliver came in from the front room—my husband has ill-treated me very much before this.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. When I came in did not I ask you to get up and get me a light, and get me some supper? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No, you struck a match, and began kicking me—that did not hurt me—you kicked me three or four times, and kept striking me—you never knew me to go public-houses and spend your money—you know you have ruined my business and brought me to poverty—I had been out with Mrs. Davis, an old friend, to a gentle<lb></lb>man's house at Lower Norwood—I did not say to you, "James, if you do not leave off breaking the things, I will throw myself out of the window"—you have cruelly ill-used me—six weeks before this I had a warrant against you, but I forgave you—I did not get out of the window myself, nor did you pull me in—you called me dreadful names, and while you held me out of the window, you said, "Now will you spend my money, and keep my child in the street till 10 and 11 o'clock"—of course I held you as hard as I could—it wag impossible for me to say whether I should fall or not if I let go of you—it is a large window, as wide as that in the Court.</p>

               <p>peace, I am really in danger with him—I don't think he is right in his head, he is half crazy at times—I think the window was partly open, but I know he rose it up to the full extent, and took me up and put me outside—I don't know that my head and shoulders were outside when he caught hold of me by the hips—I don't recollect when I was on the ledge his saying "Now will you spend my money"—I was so frightened I don't know what I did—I screamed "Murder!" a great many times—a person over my head was looking down at us, and I said to him, "There is a woman looking down at you"—I was attended by Dr. Kirby.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and lodge in the next room to the prisoner and his wife—their window is from twenty to twenty-five feet from the ground—on the morning of the 8th September, I heard the prisoner come home, about 2.15; he works up to 1 o'clock—I think he had been drinking a little—I heard him go into his own room, and heard him use dreadful language—he began knocking his wife about; she screamed—the landlady came up, and said she would send for a policeman—I had to go into his room to try and pacify him—he was then punching his wife with his fists by the fire-place—I asked him to be quiet at this time in the morning—he said, "If I did not go out of his room he would break my b——head—I thought it was time to go then, and I went back to bed—after that I heard the door locked, and then I heard the window open, and heard screams of "Murder!" from a female voice—I got up and put on my trousers, and went and burst open their room door—the prisoner said he would stab the first b——man that entered his room—when I entered the room I saw the prisoner having his wife in a sitting position on the window sill, with only her legs in the room—he was trying to push her out with all his might—there was no light in the room—I could see he was shoving her away from him as well as he could; and she had hold of the collar of his coat—he was trying with all his force to push her out—there was no curtain to the window, and I could see as I came into the room, and went towards him—directly he saw me he left his wife and made towards me, and I struck him a severe blow in the face—he struck at me, and we struck one another five or six different times—he overpowered me, and would have strangled me if assistance had not come—he had me by the throat on the floor—my foot got hurt very badly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. When you first entered my room, did you see me strike my wife? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did—I was asked that question at the Police Court—the second time I came into the room I was not there a minute and a half—I was more than half way in the room—I broke the door open, and the box of the lock was found on the floor afterwards, covered with blood from the cut on my instep—when I first saw your wife she was in a sitting position, outside the window ledge—I did not see you put her there, but you acknowledged at the Police Court that you did—when I struck you your wife ran out of the room—you caught me by my windpipe and gave me a sharp squeeze—I don't know how I got my foot cut, it was in the struggle—I believe it was done by the box of the lock—I lost at least half a gallon of blood—your room and mine was like a slaughter-house—if I had not interfered I believe you would have killed your wife, and you would have been in a worse position—I did not charge you with assaulting me.</p>

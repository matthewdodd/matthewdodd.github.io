                  </hi>. On Wednesday night, the 26th of July, I came out of the Surrey Theatre, and went to the Alfred's Head, and met the two prisoners—I made a proposition to have some supper, and then proposed to go to bed with White—I laid down on the bed—the other prisoner was in the room—this was about ten o'clock—I can swear I had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and more in my pocket—I put the two sovereigns into my watch fob, and then took them out and put them into my sock, and put it under the pillow—Brown shuffled up and took it from the pillow—I was not aware that she was coming to bed—she had laid down for about two minutes—I did not like my company, I turned round and they both went away, and the sock and money were gone.</p>

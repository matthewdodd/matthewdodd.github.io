                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, and live in Bear-court, Blackfriars-road. On 14th December I was coming down Fleet-street about 9 o'clock in the evening—the prisoner came alongside of me and told me a long story, that she had come from Lincolnshire, and she had no money, and she would be very thankful if I would give her a few halfpence to get her a lodging—I went into a public-house in White Friar-street on the right hand side—I had a pint of beer—the prisoner stood between me and the door—I drank, and then handed the pint to her, and said, "Drink that," and I went to pass her—she said, "I can't drink it all, you drink the remain<lb></lb>der"—when I paid for the beer I took the money out of my right hand pocket—at that time my watch was safe certainly, it was fastened to the button hole or over the button with the key across—it was in my left hand waistcoat pocket—as soon as I got out of the house I went on my way home, towards Blackfriars-road—the prisoner walked outside of me in the street—she was after some money, and finding I denied her, she made a snatch at my watch—I made a grasp at her directly, and I received a blow at the back of my head, and down we both came together—I fell upon her; she was under me—it was a man that struck me, but I don't know who—when the prisoner made a snatch at my watch, she got it away, and the guard was hanging down, the ring breaking—the guard was left in my possession—when I was knocked down I had hold of her—with the blow my hat fell off—I kept my hand on her—she got her hand in my pocket—I noticed there was some<lb></lb>thing in her hand, which was my purse with 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—I saw her pass her hand to the man, and the man ran away when he heard some persons coming towards me—I took my purse out of her hand; she made a snatch at my chain—I held her till the policeman came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of the Post-Office—on the evening of the 29th of May the prisoner was employed in the newspaper department—about 5.10 I noticed him push a small packet into the cover, and threw it on to the south-eastern dividing table—I called the attention of the Superintendent, who examined the parcel—shortly after 7 o'clock I noticed the prisoner with the packet in his hand, in the Eastern Counties division—he threw it into a basket underneath the sorting table, and it remained there fire or ten minutes—he then took the basket round to the south end of the office, took the packet out of the basket, and again examined it—he then threw the packet into the basket again, took some more packets out of another basket, and placed them in the basket where the packet was—he then turned the eastern dividing table with basket containing the packets, and took that packet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the bottom of the basket, and placed it in one of the pigeon-holes—he then emptied the packets on to the table—at that time the collector came and took the things out of the pigeon-holes—there were other things there—the prisoner put his hand forward and took this packet back again out of the pigeon-hole, making some remark which I did not hear—he then passed near where I was standing, and passed the packet under his coat on the left-hand side—he then returned to the Great Eastern dividing table—I sought Mr. Swift, and made a communication to him—I could see nothing in his hand when he returned.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been employed in the Post-Office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Eleven years—I am conversant with the business—packets and news<lb></lb>papers were sorted at that table, not any letters—if a man found a packet at the wrong table, he would put it on a place upon his own table for that purpose—the prisoner's hours were from 4 till 8 in the evening—he received 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—sometimes they wear an office-coat and sometimes not—I was examining on this evening—I have known newspapers come out of their coverings, and seen newspapers without an address—a man may sort about ten a minute—I was three or four yards away from the prisoner and in front of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of letter carriers—the prisoner was employed to sort letters at the Great Eastern Division table—if he found one there by mistake, he should have put it in what is called the "Blind Place," which is intended to receive missorted packets—these are cleared by homebody else—between 7 and 8 on the evening of the 29th of May, in consequence of a communication from Willins, I went to the prisoner, and took him into my room and said, "It has been reported to me that you have put a packet in your pocket; if there is no truth in it you will say so"—he said, "It is only a paper"—he took out of his left-hand pocket the packet—I said, "This is evidently a packet which appears to be passing through the office, and not your own"—he said, "No, sir, it is not my own, and I intended to place it on the packet table when I went again for the packets"—I then saw Crocker, and gave him into custody—Crocker searched and found two newspapers and a pamphlet—the prisoner had no right to put the packet in his pocket—it was not his duty to examine their contents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you not known such a thing as putting a packet into one's pocket involuntarily? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—we should not permit it—it would be considered a criminal act—he might have taken the packet in his hand to make inquiry—a person signs a document stating his duties, when he is employed by the Post Office—the general table is at the north end and the packet table at the south end—the overseer appoints one of the men to collect mis-sorted packets from the blind places—I don't know that the prisoner was the one—the cover of that one was broken, but not enough to call it a damaged packet.</p>

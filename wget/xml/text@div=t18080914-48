               <p>Q. When did you take him up - A. I gave him liberty from Saturday till Tuesday, then I sent my boy down to see if he would pay the seven shilling piece; he only laughed at him.</p>
               <p>Q. What magistrate did you go before - A. In Lambeth street.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Gurney. You have sworn to tell the whole truth, do you know that - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>COURT. You know you have taken God to witness that you will tell us the whole truth - A. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You have not told the whole truth - my lord asked you what magistrate you went before, and your answer was you went before the magistrate in Lambeth street - that was the Tuesday after - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you not the same evening you lost the seven shilling piece, go before Mr. Thelwall the magistrate - A. I did not tell the magistrate that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Woman you are sworn to tell the whole truth - did you go before that gentleman - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You went and told him the same story that you have told to day - A. No, sir; I told him he took the seven shilling piece; he told me to summons him and get the seven shilling piece back again. I went to a constable, he told me the court had no business with a street robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. You have known this man many years - A. A matter of two or three years.</p>
               <p>Q. And he knew you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were trying whether the seven shilling piece was good - A. My husband handed it over to me to look at it.</p>
               <p>Q. This man said I will tell you whether it is good or not - he took it out of your hand - A. No, he twisted it out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say if you would examine your salmon kit you would find it there - did not the seven shilling piece fall in the salmon kit - A. I do not know where it fell.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not both of you search the ground to see whether you could find it - A. I did, I could not find it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look in your kit - A. I did not, nobody asked me; the kit was not within two yards; he twisted it out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath was not he searched upon the spot, and no seven shillings found - A. No; upon my oath he walked into the middle of the road; he was twenty yards off when he was searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing was found upon him - A. No, but he might easily shift a seven shilling piece.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she sober - A. Yes, and I was sober; we have never a drop hardly any day till we have done our business; I was selling pickled salmon that day; I sold six pennyworth of salmon to a gentleman, he handed me a seven shilling piece, I handed it to my wife and desired her to look whether it was a good one; the prisoner twisted her hand and took it out; I entreated him several times to give it her back, but to no purpose.

At the turnpike we met the prisoner in the high road, he was coming towards us. I wanted to stop him for the officer to search him; he begged me not to lay my hands upon him - I did not. He said he was going into Mr. White's upon business, and when he came out Mr. Wright searched him and dismissed him. On the Tuesday following I brought him before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Not before - A. Unless my wife went, she might go, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did she go before - A. I believe he went before Mr. Thellwall; I believe so, and am sure of it. He gave some advice but that advice would not do.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave her advice and dismissed the complaint - A. I do not know what he did; we went to a police officer; he said he would go and fetch him without a warrant; the people of the workhouse would not let him come without a warrant, so the magistrate wrote a few lines that the man that kept the gate was charged with a felony; so they delivered him up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. You were as sober as your wife - A. We were both sober; and if we were any otherways we ought not to be robbed.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for on that day; when I went I conceived that they were both in liquor. I took him into a room and searched him; I found three shillings and sixpence in silver.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. From their story, and from what you saw, you thought you were not justifiable in taking the man in custody - A I did.</p>
               <p>COURT. You acted right.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, I am totally innocent of taking the seven shilling piece; at the time of this event taking place, I was a pauper in the poor house, Mile end, I had the care of the outward gate, as porter. On the day mentioned, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I heard the cry of pickled salmon by Mrs. Casey; I went out to get three penny worth of salmon; when I came out Mr. Casey was trying a seven shilling piece by ringing it on the stones; when his wife asked him to let her try it, and when it was in her hand I very foolishly put my fore finger in her hand and said let me try if it is a good one; at that time she shut her hand and confined my finger, I pulled my finger out of her hand; at this time the seven shilling piece might have fell out of her hand, but I did not hear it fall; the woman accused me of taking it from her, which I know I did not; several people collected together about the spot, and Mr. Beckit, master of the workhouse, came out and said I should be searched; I went over to the public house and was searched; I had only three shillings and six pence about me, and no gold. I have known the prosecutor and his wife several years, and was rather intimate with them; it is about two years since I was afflicted with a rupture, I was obliged to go into the poor house; my late master, Mr. Mount, has known me forty years; I had no inducement to steal being well provided for in the workhouse, they allowed me fourteen shillings a week; and they have further informed me of reinstating me to my situation at the gate. I am innocent of taking the money, nor do I know what became of it; it was lost by the prosecutor or his wife.</p>
               <p>MR. BECKIT. - Mr. Gurney. You are master of the workhouse; in consequence of this charge being made did you come upon the spot - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the prosecutor and his wife both sober - A. They were both drunk, but the woman was the most affected with liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. They made the charge against him of this seven shilling piece. - A. They did; he was taken into the parlour and searched directly. I have known the prisoner twenty years; I never knew an honester creature, I should not be afraid to trust him with money untold.</p>

When I was in the room with her, I took my watch out of my fob and put it in my waistcoat pocket; I had not been with her five minutes before I missed my watch. She ran down stairs; I pursued her. I did not find any thing of her, till the Monday morning following, I took an officer with me; he took her in the same room; he searched her, but could not find any thing of the property. I never have found the watch; it was taken out of my waistcoat pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not feel her take it out, did you. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain you did not drop it any where. - A. No, I did not; I was a little elevated with liquor.</p>

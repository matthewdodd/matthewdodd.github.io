            . I am constable for the parish of St. Mary-le-bone. On Tuesday, the 16th of August, I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's lodgings; she lodged in the house with the prosecutor; the house is divided into two apartments, one stair-case to them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. to Hutchins. Who pays the rent and taxes - A. I pay my part, and Penny paysthe other part himself; it is divided into two different tenements; one outer door, and one stair-case to both of them. Penny lives in the house.</p>
               <p>Piall. I took the prisoner into custody; I charged her with the offence; I neither threatened her or promised her any thing. I asked her how she could rob so poor a man as Mr. Hutchins, with a large family; she told me, she believed the devil was in her when she did it; she said, she opened the drawer with a key. I found a number of keys in her room. She pointed to this key; it opens the drawer of the box. She told me, she paid one of the notes to Mrs. Chapman, the other to Mrs. Goodage. I have known the prisoner some time; I never knew any thing against her until now.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hutchins. Does the prisoner bear a good character - A. Yes; I never heard any thing against her.</p>

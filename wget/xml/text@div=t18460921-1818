                  </hi>. I am a police-officer of the London and North Western Railway. I was at the railway last Saturday evening, at a quarter past nine o'clock—there is an express train comes in from Newmarket—I saw the prisoner with two others—one of his companions had a coat or cloak over his arm—they were walking up and down, as if waiting till some one came by the train—they staid till the train arrived—I saw the prisoner go and touch two or three ladies by their side—he touched Miss Lillywhite on the right hand side—he then walked away up the platform—I walked after him—he looked round to see if I was following him—his friend ran away, and he ran up the platform.</p>

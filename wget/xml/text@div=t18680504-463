                  <hi rend="italic">The Defendant pleaded to the whole indictment, that he had been summoned before a Justice for assaulting the Prosecutor; and the Justice, after hearing, had dismissed the complaint, and given his certificate of such dismissal; and the plea further averred, that the assault charged in the indictment was the same assault</hi>.</p>

In the plea, the certificate is pleaded only to the said offence, reference is made but to one offence, and there is not a plea to each Count in the indictment, therefore the plea if good and proved, can only be an answer to one Count, and not to the whole indictment</hi>.</p>

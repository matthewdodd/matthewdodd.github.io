            . I am a Policeman. On the 19th of February, I saw Mr. Hornby near the London Apprentice- I saw the prisoner in company with another boy, lay hold of Mr. Hornby's coat pocket; I was in plain clothes - he turned round, saw me, and I suppose knew me, for he let go of it; I crossed over to the other side, saw him following Mr. Hornby, watched him, and near the City-road, I saw the prisoner put his hand into the pocket, take the handkerchief out, and give it to the other, who ran away with it directly - I informed Mr. Hornby, and fetched the prisoner back, without losing sight of him; I had seen him before - I think I should know the other lad.</p>

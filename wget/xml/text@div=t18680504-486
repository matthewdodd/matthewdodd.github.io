I am a publican in Drury Lane—on 14th April, I was coming along Bankside, and met the prisoner coming towards me with a little girl following him, a few yards behind—she was crying, and said, "Don't, father"—he said, "Come on," and took her in his arms, and passed on down the steps of Southwark Bridge—he took off his coat and hat, and walked into the water, nearly up to his knees—he seemed to throw the</p>

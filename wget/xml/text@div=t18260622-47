On the 21st of May, at five o'clock in the morning, I was at my bed-room window, and saw three men standing at Morgan's gate - one of them went and pulled something out of his pocket and unfastened the front door - it appeared to be a key - the prisoner was one of them, but I will not say he is the man who unfastened the door - they then walked away, as two men were coming by - in two or three minutes two of them returned and walked in - the third man walked down Lark-row - the prisoner was one who went in - they came out in about three minutes - I had dressed as quick as possible and went to the door; I said "Halloo,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220025"></xptr>what business have you there?" the first man immediately swung two bundles of clothes at my head, to knock me down, but he did not succeed; the prisoner threw the beef, sugar, tea, and butter out of his apron before me - I called to John Morgan, who seized him; he was never out of my sight - he was secured within fifteen or twenty yards of the house.</p>

            . I am a turncock. On the 21st of May, at five o'clock in the morning, I was passing the prosecutor's house, and saw the bundles thrown at Monk's head- the sun shone in my eyes, so that I could not distinctly see what was the matter, but Monk called Stop thief! I immediately put out my instrument and stopped the prisoner; before he came up to me he shot the things which he had down into the street - I seized him directly.</p>

            . I am the wife of Peter Morgan - we rent this house, which is in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green. On the 21st of May, at five o'clock in the morning, I was not up - we had fastened the street door the night before; I heard a noise of Stop him! I got up, went down stairs, found the street door open, and the prisoner in custody; two bundles lay in the street, containing our property, which had been taken off the front room table - the meat and grocery were in a cupboard in the same room. The property is worth more than 40s.(Property produced and sworn to).</p>

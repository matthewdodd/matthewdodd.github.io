                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Wednesday the 14th of September, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw a cart, with "Henry Gray, Barking," on it, and a sack in it, stop opposite the Cape of Good Hope,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184209190142"></xptr>
               <p>opposite Limehouse church—I saw Warboys get on the cart, and saw Cliff at the same time, standing by the side of the cart—Warboys threw the sack off the cart, and drew it a little way towards the Cape of Good Hope—he then walked towards the horses, came back, and drew the sack to the house—Cliff walked away—Warboys emptied the contents of the sack into an empty sack which he had there—Cliff was by the side of the cart all the time—he then walked into the house—I remained there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and then saw Haydon in conversation with Warboys—they walked towards where the sack was placed-Haydon put his hand on it, felt it, and pushed it towards the house—Warboys went to the horses, and Haydon went into the public-house—Cliff afterwards came out, and went away—Warboys went towards the house—I left Sheen, another constable, in charge of the sack, and went after Cliff and the cart—I asked him if he had lost any thing from his cart—he said no—I asked if a boy had not been up in his cart, and stolen a sack off—he said no, he had no sack on his cart—I took him to the station—the other prisoners were brought there, and the sack—I examined it, it contained a mixture of oats and beans, and chaff.</p>

I received Warboys in charge from Hagar, with the sack, while he went after the cart—I asked him what he threw the sack out of the cart for—he said he did not throw it, and did not know any thing about it—I remained there till Hagar cam back, and then took the sack and Warboys to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am watchman to Mr. Henry Gray, a farmer at Barking—Cliff was in his employ—he went away on the Wednesday morning, about a quarter after two o'clock, with three horses in the cart—I carried the provender down, and gave it him in the cart—there was chaff, oats, and beans—he took it on the cart—he was to go to Spitalfields market—the provender consisted of this sort of stuff—there are some flags cut up in it, which is usual with persons who have marsh-land, which my master has.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you known Cliff? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between thirty-seven and thirty-eight years—he always bore a very good character—he has been on and off in Mr. Gray's employ ten years—I cannot say how much chaff he took with him—he put it up himself out of the chaff and corn-bin—I saw him do so—other farmers have marshy land, and pos flags into their chaff—I cannot swear to this—I cannot say what quantity Cliff had—he was to come back at three o'clock in the afternoon—he had only about sufficient food for the three horses—the sack was not full.</p>

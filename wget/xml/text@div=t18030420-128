             sworn. - I live in Bury-street, St. Mary Axe, and keep a green-grocer's shop; I know both the prisoners, and saw them together on the 15th of March; Joyce came to my shop to buy three pennyworth of greens, which I sold him; he offered me a shilling, which I thought was not a good one, and shewed it to my wife; she said to the prisoner, how can you think of coming here to pass bad money, and returned him the shilling; upon which he made use of bad language; my boy came in, and gave me a caution of the man; I said to Joyce, don't kick up a bobbery here, but be careful how you get rid of your bad money, otherwife I shall secure you; he went away; I watched him, and saw Halfpenny join him; they went into Bury-court, where they were in conversation about two minutes; I then saw Halfpenny go into Mr. Lye's shop; Joyce waited in the street at first, and then followed Halfpenny; I am a constable, and followed them in; I heard Halfpenny ask for half an ounce of tobacco; when the tobacco was weighed, Halfpenny threw down a shilling; Mr. Lye said, am I to take both half ounces out of the shilling; Joyce said, no, I shall pay for mine; Lye said, this is a bad shilling, and Halfpenny threw down three halfpence to pay for it; I made reply to Mr. Lye, those men are in the habit of passing bad money, they have been to my house and Mrs. Singleton's, and I mean to secure and search them; they seemed flurried, and said it was no such thing; that they had neither been to my house or Singleton's; that they did not know each other; I shut them in the shop till I sent for Mr. Singleton, and saw Halfpenny shuffling his pocket; and when we came to search, we could not find the crooked shilling which had been offered to Mr. Lye; in searching him, we found one more bad shilling, and two good sixpences, and copper; we then attempted to search Joyce; and I found the shilling he had offered to me under his feet, and six good sixpences in his pocket, and copper to the amount of one shilling and nine-pence farthing, therefore he had no occasion to offer me a shilling; we then secured them; I have got the shilling Joyce offered me, and the shilling I found upon Halfpenny.

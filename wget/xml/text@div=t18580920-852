                  </hi>. On 24th August, about half-past 10 o'clock at night, I was coming down Munster-street, and stopped at Clarence-gardens to tie my shoe, and the prisoner and two others came up—the prisoner shoved me up against the railings, and took my watch from my waistcoat-pocket—a pocket-handkerchief was put over my face, which took away my senses, and I do not know what happened afterwards—I saw the prisoner again next morning, coming to the police-court with other persons and police<lb></lb>men, and pointed him out.</p>

I was on duty, and saw a female run<lb></lb>ning after the prisoner, who was running—I ran after him, and he was stopped in Mary-street—he ran away again into Charles-street, Hampstead-road—he was there stopped, and I heard others say, "Mix up with us, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>; change your coat"—he said, "No; there is no <hi rend="italic">copper</hi> here;" that means a policeman—I was in plain clothes—I said, "Yes, there is;" and took him, and brought him back, and the female said that she saw him go up with two others against the fence and do something—she is too near her confinement to be here.</p>

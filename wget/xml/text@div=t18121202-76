Its throat was cut, and life was hardly out. It was quite warm, bleeding fresh, the entrails were out of it, and laying down by it, at the time that we saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the sheep been cut open - A. Yes, it was, and we pursued the man directly. As soon as he saw us he ran away. We bid him stop. He ran away; he would not stop. We told him we would shoot him if he did not stop. He went into the wood, and we lost sight of him. Then I sent my brother home to alarm the neighbourhood. A great many people surrounded the wood until almost night. We could not find him. Then we went over to Mr. Jones, and gave a description of the man, and Mr. Jones advertised the man. He was taken on Saturday, the 8th of November. I am sure the prisoner is the man, and I knew it was Mr. Jones's sheep by the mark.</p>

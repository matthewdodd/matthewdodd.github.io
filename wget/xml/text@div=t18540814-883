                  </hi>. I was in the employment of Mr. Taylor, of the Elephant and Castle, Newington. On 22nd May he sent me with a letter and a parcel—I did not know what the parcel contained—he told me to go to No. 15, New Boswell-court, Strand—I went to Old Boswell-court—I did not know that it was Old Boswell-court—I have since discovered that it is—I cannot read—I am nineteen years old—when I got to Old Boswell-court I showed the letter to a man; he directed me to a side door—I went there, and a woman who was standing by the door said, "I will show you the door"—I went up to the second floor of that house, and knocked at the door—the prisoner opened it—I said I had brought a letter from Mr. Taylor, of the Elephant and Castle—I gave her the letter—she looked at it, and said it was all right; and I afterwards gave her the parcel—I asked her whether there was any answer—she said no, there was no answer required—I did not see her open the letter—the parcel was a brown paper parcel, tied up—I then went home—next morning my master asked me who I had left the parcel and the letter with—the letter had a direction upon it—I saw the prisoner look at it before she said it was quite right—the parcel had no writing upon it—in consequence of what my master said, I went next morning to the house where I had seen the prisoner—I did not find her there—I have never seen her since, until she was apprehended.</p>

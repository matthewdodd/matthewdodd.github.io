                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant G</hi>). On the night of 2nd October I was passing the Pindar of Wakefield public-house, and saw the prisoner and his wife—a woman, named Draker, came out and spoke to them, and. They all three went into the house—I sent for assistance and placed two con<lb></lb>stables in a dark place to assist me—the three then walked to the corner</p>

               <p>of Swinton Street, and I directed the two constables to seize Draker, I followed the prisoner and his wife—I heard a noise, looked round and saw Darker in custody and another constable picking up something—I said "Don't let go of her hand"—he said "She has thrown something away, but I have got it all right"—I went back and took Wilson, who said that he was going home—I said "You have been in company with coiners and I shall arrest you on suspicion"—I told Dickens to seize her other arm—when they were placed in the dock at the station, Draker used an oath, and said "You have done this for us"—I found in the prisoner's trousers pocket this packet, containing two bad half-crowns, with paper between them, and a halfpenny and a bad half-crown loose—Peckham handed me this handkerchief, containing two packets, in one of which were ten bad half-crowns, and in the other five, with blotting paper between each—on Draker was found 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a purse—the prisoner's wife was discharged by the Magistrate.</p>

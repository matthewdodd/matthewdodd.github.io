My Wife said she had her Diamond Ear-Rings; the Prisoner asked her if they were worth 20 s. she said they were worth a great deal more: My Wife gave the Ear-Rings into her Hand; the Prisoner asked her if she had got any Salt; my Wife gave her some, and the Prisoner wrapped the Ear-Rings up in a piece of Paper with the Salt; the Prisoner at the Bar said I must not be there, for if I staid it would spoil the Thing, for it was my Wife's good Fortune and not mine; for by Virtue of this the Stones were to rise in the Cellar, and the Treasure would appear; so I went into the Shop, and left them by themselves: My Wife came into the Shop, and told me she believed the Prisoner had a mind to steal her Ear-Rings. The Prisoner told me, my Wife was troubled with an evil Sprit, and had no Faith; and that she thought there was something more than ordinary the Matter with her; and she told my Wife, that she seemed mistrustful, and that because she was mistrustful the Planet would be spoiled. I saw her slip the Ear-Rings away, and I thought that she had changed the Packet ; upon that, I immediately seized hold of the Prisoner's Hand; and in the Paper instead of my Wife's Ear-Rings there was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174312070003"></xptr> a pair of brass Buttons; and in the struggling one of the Ear-Rings dropped down, and the other I found between her Finger and Thumb. She put the Ear-Rings up in the Salt: they were not tied up, they were only wrapped up in a little bit of Paper.</p>

            . The first Time the Prisoner came I was at the Door, and there was a Quarrel in the Street facing our House; the Prisoner said to me, what Quarrel is that, Madam? said I, I cannot tell, I know nothing of it: She asked me if I had any old Clothes to sell; I told her no. Says she, you have a lucky Planet in your Face, I will tell you your Fortune: I said come in; she asked for some Coffee, but I had none; so she said she had a Law Suit depending, and she must make an end of it; that she could not stay then, but would come another Day; and when she came she made me say, In the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, that I would do all that she proposed to me. She asked me if I had any Paper that was never wrote on; I told her I had; I fetched her a Sheet, and she divided it into three Parts. She asked me for some Salt; I fetched some Salt, and she said by the Virtue of that Salt the Mould was to rise in the Cellar, and the Money was to come up. I cannot tell the Sum of Guineas she mentioned to my Husband, besides broad Pieces, and Silver; then she asked me if I had got the 20s. that I told her I would get against that Day. She made me make that Bargain with her before, but I did not intend to give her the 20 s. She asked me if I had the Value of 20 s. about me; I told her I had a good deal more; that I had a pair of Diamond Ear-Rings; she asked me how much they were worth; I told her they cost me 3 Guineas; then she said, In the Name of the Almighty God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, put them into this Paper, and then she said, God Almighty prosper what we are a going upon: Then she asked if I could say the Lord's Prayer, and said I must fall down on my Knees and say the Lord's Prayer three Times over, and by Virtue of this the Mould in the Cellar was to rise, and I should find the Treasure. I stepped out and told my Husband, that I had a Fancy the Woman wanted to steal my Ear-Rings, so he bored a Hole through the Door to watch her, and if he found I could not deal with her, he was to help me: She had the Ear-Rings in a Paper, I looked at her and saw her slip them away, and I thought changed the Parcel: They were to be tied up in this Handkerchief, and I was to swear that I would not open the Handkerchief before she came again; my Husband seized hold of her Hand, gave me a Paper, and said to me, look what you have got there, and in the Paper there was a pair of brass Buttons; when my Husband seized hold of her Hand, he said my Wife's Diamond Ear-Rings are here; she denied it, spoke a great many scandalous Things, and swore and cursed very much; but in the Skirmish one of the Ear-Rings fell down and broke in two, and the other he took in her Hand.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner owned she had been there three Times, denied that she knew any thing of the Ear-Rings, that he must force the Ear-Rings upon her, in order to charge her with the Robbery. <rs id="t17431207-1-verdict6" type="verdictDescription">

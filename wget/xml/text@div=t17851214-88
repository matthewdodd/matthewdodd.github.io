            , against the statute.</p>
               <p>The Case opened by Mr. Attorney General.</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury. This is a prosecution against the prisoner, for an offence against an act of parliament, that has been passed so long since as the 19th of Geo. II. and Gentlemen, it is a lamentable consideration, that it has been necessary for the legislature of this country, from time to time, to make laws more and more severe, against those persons who openly, and violently resist the laws of their country, and resist them in a manner which calls for resistance again, even to the risque of the lives of the persons employed in collecting his Majesty's revenue: Gentlemen, I am extremely sorry that ever these laws were necessary, I am much more sorry that it has of late been so frequently necessary to call for their execution, it is now come to such a pass, that if the law will not protect the officer, nothing but ill-will, and everlasting battles must ensue, between the officers of the revenue, and those that are concerned in defrauding it: you have heard of many of these affrays, most of them have been attended with bloodshed, and if the laws already enacted are not sufficient, it will become necessary to have recourse to force, and the laws must be put into execution by that which every civilized state would wish to avoid: it is to avoid that horrid alternative, that these prosecutions have been begun against persons acting in this outrageous and tumultuous manner: it is to save the lives of persons of his own description, and hereafter to protect the lives of his Majesty's officers, and to preserve the laws that were originally made, that this prisoner is now brought to the bar: Gentlemen, I do not expect you will convict the prisoner under these laws, unless upon the evidence adduced, he clearly falls within the guilt of breaking those laws: I will state to you very briefly, and very fairly the evidence I have to offer, I will state to you the act of parliament, the meaning and construction of which, in point of law, you will receive from the Bench; you will take this into consideration carefully, together with the facts that will be given in evidence, and coupling the facts with the law, you will decide whether the prisoner falls within it; that is your province; it is mine to state the law, as I humbly conceive it to be: I am instructed that he certainly is guilty of the offence described in the indictment, which is stated as the offence of being tumultuously assembled with others to the number of three or more, armed with offensive weapons for the purpose of rescuing and taking away from the officers of the Excise several goods, the duties of which had not been paid or secured; it is likewise charged not only that he was assembled for that purpose, but that he likewise, with three other persons<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140093"></xptr> so armed, actually did rescue from the officers of Excise such kind of goods. Gentlemen, the act of parliament of the 19th of the late King, begins with reciting</p>
               <p>"that whereas divers dissolute persons have</p>
               <p>"associated themselves, and entered into</p>
               <p>"confederacies, &amp;c. to the loss of the public</p>
               <p>"revenue, and whereas several several</p>

               <p>"officers of the Excise," &amp;c. for remedy of these evils, it enacts</p>
               <p>"that after the 24th</p>
               <p>"of July, 1746, any persons to the number</p>
               <p>"of three or more, armed with fire arms</p>
               <p>"or other offensive weapons, who shall be</p>
               <p>"aiding or assisting, &amp;c. every such person</p>
               <p>"shall be guilty of felony, without</p>
               <p>"benefit of clergy;" so that you see the offence described in this act of parliament, is that of being assembled to the number of three or more armed with fire arms, and rescuing, or endeavouring to rescue, such goods as are described in the indictment: this being the law, I will now state the facts: it will appear to you, Gentlemen, that on the 24th of April last, one

            , an officer of the Excise, called to his assistance two other officers, named Burdett and Carter, and they planted themselves in an orchard, near to the Roebuck, where the goods were to pass by: Brock remained in the lane, the two others went into the orchard; they had not been long there, before Carter saw two men come out of a cottage that joined the Robuck, and come into the orchard loaded with tubs that were flung in such a manner, as the witnesses will describe, which I understand is the usual way they carry geneva or other liquors, for the convenience of throwing them over horses or over their shoulders; he immediately called out, throw down your tubs; Brock called to them, one of the men run away, and the other attempted to secure them; however, he was more than a match for them, and he escaped, and they secured the two tubs; upon this they went with the two tubs into the lane, and there Carter seeing six or seven men in the lane, he was ordered by Brock, to go and see if they had anything with them; he went, and they had not; he heard a whistle, and coming back from these men he found Brock engaged with eighteen men, of whom the prisoner was at the head, with large sticks, such as the handle of a fork that is used in stables, and hop-poles, and at the head of them, the prisoner, who was at that time levelling a blow at Brock, he did not strike with one hand, but was seen striking at him with both; the prisoner called out, it is Brock and his crew; upon which the officer told them they should not have the tubs, to which the prisoner replied you may be d - d, and swore if they did not leave the tubs, they would murder them; upon this a scuffle ensued, and the officers of Excise found the smugglers were more than a match for them, after considerable struggles, and several blows had been aimed at the officers of Excise by some men, Carter and Brock who had got fire arms with them, told them, that if they did not desist, they must fire, and he said they might fire and be d - d; upon which he gave orders to those men to fire, and that man did fire, which is a strong circumstance to shew how active the prisoner was; the only person wounded by that shot was the prisoner, who will appear to you to have been very much wounded; they at last took the resolution of abandoning the tubs, and only staved one, and tasted it to know what it was, they went away: Gentlemen, this is the evidence; it is necessary first of all, to prove that they were assembled to the number of of three or more; next that they were armed with fire arms, or other offensive weapons; and my Lord will tell you his meaning respecting the words of the act of parliament, concerning offensive weapons, it is impossible to give any definition what should constitute an offensive weapon within this act of parliament; I humbly contend, and, I think, contend with the concurrence of the learned Judges, who have tried these kind of causes, that the meaning is such a kind of instruments as were peculiarly proper for resistance and assault, and such<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140094"></xptr> as men engaged in the ordinary business of life, ought not, and would not take along with them, such as they had for the purpose of resistance, such as was proper for it; it seemed to be the unanimous opinion of a learned Judge lately on the Bench, that that was the meaning of this act of parliament; that if a man had but a common walking-stick, or a common whip, such as men ordinarily carry, though he might accidentally, or though they might be made use of to the degree of offence, yet in considering this act of parliament, those were not the kind of weapons, and it was necessary they should be such as were used for the purpose of offence: now, Gentlemen, it will appear that by much the greatest part were armed with what could not be used for any other purpose than offensive weapons, and that the prisoner had himself (though it would have been sufficient if he had been with three other persons at the same time, for I should have thought it would have been carrying it a long way, to have said in such a case, that he himself was not so armed) but he himself had a weapon of the nature which is described; I cannot produce to you the weapon itself, but there will be produced to you, a weapon of the same nature, which the witness had from smugglers, and which is the same sort of weapon used by them: It is not that sort of stick which men usually carry, because the method of using it required two hands to use it: Gentlemen, this will be the evidence that will be laid before you, if the prisoner does fall within the act of parliament, and I prove this case, as I am instructed I shall, it will be your duty to find him guilty: I should be most happy to find these offences were not committed at all, but as they are, I should be happy if the examples made might prevent that dreadful scene which I am affraid will happen, if these laws are not protected: I am sure you will give it that attention you ought to do, I am sure you stand indifferent to both parties, and I am sure to both you will discharge your duty.</p>

               <p>How many tubs were there? - Two.</p>
               <p>What are tubs? - They are four gallon casks.</p>
               <p>What sort of appearance have they? - There were sling cords upon them, which is a small cord, a three braided cord to carry these tubs; in the scuffle he broke loose from me, he slipped under the rail,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140095"></xptr> I had hold of his frock, and he being too strong for me, jammed my hand against the rail, and I was obliged to quit my hold; before I heard Carter call out Brock, I heard these people, that I took for Carter.</p>
               <p>Did those persons say or do anything that you mistook for Carter? - Not then, after the man made his escape from me, I took the tubs over into the road, and Mr. Carter immediately followed me; I asked Carter and Burdett to go up the road in search of more goods, and they went up nearer to the Roebuck, and left me with the tubs, and they soon after returned back with some people following them, who swore they should not have the tubs.</p>
               <p>How many people might there be that followed Carter and Burdett when they came down to you, those people that were following them? - Why, there were, I believe, eighteen or twenty, and those persons that were following them at first, there were eight or ten, they increased directly, then I left the tubs ten or a dozen yards off, and joined Carter and Burdett, apprehending that there would be a riot.</p>
               <p>Did you hear anything particular before these people came up to Carter and Burdett? - I heard a noise in a house, it was but a small distance, the Roebuck is by the side of the road.</p>
               <p>Between the time that this man escaped from you, and the coming up of these eighteen or twenty persons, did you hear anything particular that struck you at the time? - I heard somebody say it was Brock and his men.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any further expression, or anything else at the time? - I heard somebody say, it is Brock and his men, d - n their eyes, they shall not have the tubs; when I was in the orchard, I heard somebody make a soft kind of a whistle, and I thought it was Mr. Carter.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after you saw the men, that you heard this whistle? - I had seen nobody when I heard this whistle.</p>
               <p>Then when was it that you heard these expressions? - When they were following Mr. Carter, and coming down the road.</p>
               <p>When these men came up, and you had an opportunity to see them, had they any thing with them? - Great sticks, large sticks.</p>
               <p>What number of them had large sticks? - About five or six, the highest comparison that I can make of the sticks, is I believe, they may be about four or five feet long, and something smaller than a pitchfork shaft.</p>
               <p>What did they then do? - They began to threaten, and swear that we should not have the things, repeating that it was Brock and his men, and d - d their eyes, that we should not have the tubs; and they d - d their eyes, if they cut them, they would murder them.</p>
               <p>Did you know any of these persons? - I know but one, the prisoner

            , he had a large stick, which I fended off with a sword that I had in my hand, it was similar to the fork shaft, I verily believe it was four feet and a half; I warded it off.</p>
               <p>How did he use this stick? - He used it with both his hands, it was a stick of that length that he could not use it with one hand.</p>
               <p>In what manner did he use it? - He struck at me, but I kept it off with my sword, and Mr. Carter he fell upon him very rapidly with a short stick, it might be something bigger than this stick I have in my hand, (a common walking stick); the sticks the other persons had were considerably bigger, after Mr. Carter had knocked him rather down on the side of the bank next the Roebuck orchard, I told him them, if they did not desist we would fire upon them.</p>
               <p>What did you and Carter and Burdett do with the tubs after this? - Spice, after he got up, retreated back in amongst the rest that were behind, and they went into the hop-yard after that, and got some hop-poles, I am not able to say how many.</p>
               <p>How many might they amount to before they retreated into the hop-yard? - I believe there might be about eighteen or twenty, they were all assembled.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140096"></xptr>What number of them were prepared with sticks by such time as these went into the hop-yard? - I believe about five or six, and I heard the others break off the poles to provide themselves with sticks, then we returned back to the tubs in the road, which were not above ten or twelve yards off, I took them up, and I advised Carter and Burdett to stave one of the tubs, as I told them I thought it impracticable to carry them off, and I wanted to see what sort of liquor it was.</p>
               <p>Did you so stave the tubs? - Burdett cut the hoops asunder, and I took hold of the tub, and it ran all down my breeches.</p>
               <p>What was this liquor? - Holland geneva.</p>
               <p>You tasted it? - I did.</p>
               <p>What happened after the staving the tub? - They still pursued upon us very rapidly, and I told them the consequence would be, if they did not desist, I would fire upon them.</p>
               <p>How were they armed then? - With these sticks that they got out of the hop-yard, and those they had before, I believe they all had sticks, I cannot particularly speak to every man.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner among those who so came among you the second time? - He was.</p>
               <p>Did they use any expressions this second time? - They cried we might fire and be d - d, we used every effort to get away before we fired, but we found it impracticable.</p>
               <p>Court. How near might they be to you at this time? - Some of them about a dozen or fourteen yards off, some more.</p>
               <p>What passed afterwards? - They still kept threatening us, I ordered Burdett and Carter to fire.</p>
               <p>How did they threaten you? - Swearing they would be d - d if they would not kill us, and that we should not carry the goods off.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner at the bar use any of those expressions that you speak of? - I cannot say whether he did at that time, it appeared to be all in one voice, and they all joined, we could not distinguish one man from another, but the first time Spicer said himself we should not have it, he said he would be d - d if we should take off the goods, that was at the first time; judging it impracticable to get away, I ordered Carter and Burdett to turn about and fire upon them.</p>
               <p>Were they following you at the time you were running in the manner you describe? - Yes; accordingly they both fired at them with pistols.</p>
               <p>What was the consequence of this firing? - They did not seem to stop, they still pursued us, and Carter called out to me why do not you fire? and I immediately fired.</p>
               <p>What was the effect of your firing? - The effect of my firing seemed to stop them, I heard somebody cry out when I fired; I cannot pretend to say who it was; I have heard since that when I fired, I shot Spice, then we all three made our escape, and they kept throwing their sticks at us.</p>
               <p>How soon after this did you see the prisoner? - The next day.</p>

             there? - I cannot speak to him, I only knew the prisoner at the bar, I saw the prisoner the day after at the Roebuck; there were some people in the house and they exclaimed against me for my cruelty for shooting, and Spice himself complained and shewed me his wound.</p>
               <p>Where was that wound? - Somewhere about the lower part of his belly, it appeared to be a side shot.</p>
               <p>What it had slanted along the lower part of the belly? - Yes, he told me he was shot in the foot too, but I did not see that, he was set on a bench easing his foot, and at that time I gave him sixpence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. What sort of a night was this? - Rather cloudy, the moon was at full.</p>
               <p>Five or six persons when you firs t saw the body had sticks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What sort of sticks, were not some of them common walking sticks? - I never saw farmers walk with such sticks to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140097"></xptr>Had you an opportunity in the darkness of the night and the violence of the affray to make the distinction? - I do not remember that ever I saw a farmer walk with such sticks.</p>
               <p>Were the whole of the five or or six like the stick that is to be produced? - I think so.</p>
               <p>The retiring into the hop-ground and getting the hop-poles was a conclusion of the same business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was at that time in the service of the revenue? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How soon after was you discharged? - In July.</p>
               <p>Upon what account pray? - Why I was discharged when the act took place, the act for staving of liquors, there were no goods sold to produce any money for the officers, and those that were at great expences, as I was, were very much distressed, and necessity, which was the mother of all inventions, obliged me to part with some part of the goods, which I ought to have staved, and for that I was discharged.</p>


               <p>Now this is a very moderate way of stating that you had defrauded the Revenue? - I had no orders to stave the goods, although the provision of the act is, that they should be staved, they are not staved.</p>
               <p>It was for bad practices in your duty as an officer.</p>
               <p>Court. He has told you the fact.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards was you restored? - I have not been restored.</p>
               <p>Did you not apply to be restored on convicting this prisoner? - I never did any such thing, nor never made any application, if I can get any employment in the Revenue, I shall be very happy to have it.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do not you hope it? - I cannot foresee.</p>
               <p>I ask you what you expect and hope? - I believe this, whether he is cast or whether he is not, that neither one thing nor the other will be in favour of me.</p>
               <p>Did not you give the information in hopes of being restored to your office? - I gave the information the day after the transaction, before I was discharged; I acquainted my supervisor with it that very night.</p>
               <p>Did you charge the prisoner by name on that very day? - I did not, I did not know the prisoner's name although I knew his person, I only knew him by living with a miller.</p>
               <p>How soon did you acquire the pleasure of knowing his name? - The day but one after, it might be two days, I told the supervisor about two or three days after, I told him I knew he was a servant to a miller.</p>
               <p>You had learned his name then? - As soon as ever I had learned his name I acquainted the supervisor, when I first told my story I did not know his name.</p>
               <p>These men were engaged in battle with you who had a superior force? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did any of these people attempt to lay hold of the goods? - I did not see them.</p>
               <p>They were beating you, but not attempting to lay hold of the goods? - I did not see them at all lay hold of the goods themselves.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did you describe this man to your supervisor the next day as well as you could, that is, that he was a miller's servant? - I gave all the information that lay in my power.</p>
               <p>Then as soon as you learned his name, you communicated that also? - Yes, the board was acquainted with it in the course of three or four days.</p>
               <p>Had you any reason to fear you should be dismissed at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. There is an act of parliament that gave to the officers an half of all that was seized, and last session but one an act passed, that all the spirits which the officers were entitled to, should be staved after condemnation, the act has not been hitherto executed, but the officers have hitherto been kept out of any reward at all.</p>
               <p>What is the meaning of having them staved? - To prevent the introduction of foreign spirits, and to encourage real ones; not one seizing officer has got any thing this year and a half.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was on a visit to Mr. Brock in April last, at his house, I am an officer's son, not an officer; on the 24th of April last, we went to the bottom of the orchard, and when we came to the cottage house I heard Carter say, down with your tubs, I directly retreated to the bottom of the orchard, I saw Carter and Brock have hold of a man, and Brock came back and said, there are some more men in the road, Carter and me went up to the Roebuck and turned back, and a man followed Carter and us, some blows passed between Carter and Brock and the man got away into the road, I did not rightly see him, then we went into the road, and Carter and I directly went up towards the Roebuck, thinking to meet more as we saw some men up the road, I cannot tell the number that were there then, more gathered together after to the amount of eighteen or twenty, a man followed Mr. Carter and I down, he swore we should not have the tubs, I cannot tell who he was, there were more men behind him that were up the road, some blows passed between Carter and the foremost man, and then they directly cried out, it is only Brock and his men, and they directly jumped into a hop-garden and broke down the poles, and came over into the road again.</p>
               <p>Had these people you saw when you first went up, or had they not any sticks before they went into the orchard? - They had sticks, very large sticks, such as the footpads walk with.</p>
               <p>What size might they be? - About the bigness of a fork stave.</p>
               <p>Do you know how many people you saw at first? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Were there more than three? - Yes, six or seven.</p>
               <p>How many of these six or seven were armed with sticks? - I cannot tell, more than three or four had sticks, one man came rather before the rest, swearing we should not have the tubs; and he struck with a stick at Mr. Carter, and Mr. Brock; and Mr. Carter knocked that man down, whoever he was, on the bank; I did not know any of the men, I was quite a stranger to the country; after that they said it was only Brock with his men.</p>
               <p>What did they do then? - They went into the hop-yard for the poles, then they came into the road again, and cried d - n their eyes murder them; and then Brock said he would fire on them, and they said, fire on, and be d - d; directly Mr. Brock ordered to fire, and we did fire; my pistols were loaded with slugs, and the others with balls, and they cried fire on, and be d - d; after that Mr. Brock turned and fired his pistol, then we were forced to retreat, and they threw their sticks at us, and one of them hit me on the arm and leg.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There had been a scuffle between the officers and men, who were carrying the casks? - Yes, when I came down, that was in the orchard of the Roebuck.</p>
               <p>How many yards off the house? - About ten or twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Did you make a great deal of bustle in that scuffle? - No, not much, I was not down at first; I heard Carter say, down with your tubs.</p>

               <p>(Produces a stick five feet in length, and about four inches round, with a spike at the end.)</p>
               <p>Were the sticks of this size? - Yes, similar to that.</p>

               <p>Are you sure that was the man? - Yes, I know the man perfectly well, he was by himself at that present time, but there were some more coming down the road, they swore at us pretty roundly, they d - d my eyes and limbs, and said I should not have the goods.</p>
               <p>What were the goods? - Tubs, one with Hollands geneva.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is my duty to submit to your Lordship, that the prisoner ought not to be called on for any defence. The first Count in the indictment states, that the prisoners, together with other persons, to the number of three or more, did assemble themselves together, with intent to rescue the goods, and that being assembled, they did rescue; now every other assembling, except that with intent to rescue the goods, I take to be clearly bad; the first objection I would make to your Lordship is, that there is no proof in this case, of that which is a necessary ingredient in it, namely, assembling with intent to rescue; I state the authority of Mr. Baron Eyre, who laid down this law, that though it appeared that the parties did assemble, if they came together without a preconcerted design, that would not satisfy that indictment; now here it is manifest that these men, of whom the prisoner is taken to be one, were drawn out of some place at which they were not assembled with any such preconcerted design or intent: in the two other counts, they have not charged any assembling with such intention: I have another objection still less capable of answer; this charge is not for assaulting revenue officers in the discharge of their duty, this is a charge of assembling with an intent to be assisting in the rescuing of goods, and assisting in that rescue, and in every count of it, it goes on to state this, which the act of parliament renders indispensably necessary</p>
               <p>"uncustomed goods liable</p>
               <p>"to pay duties, &amp;c." I ask with great deference, what proof there is of this fact? it is not because some liquors are carrying, upon which perhaps the duties were paid, and carrying without permit; that will not satisfy this act of parliament; but the Crown must prove to the satisfaction of the Jury, that these goods neither had paid the duties, nor have the duties been paid: in all the cases hitherto, there has been a sentence of the condemnation from the Exchequer, wherever we have been called upon for a defence: you must be satisfied plainly and indisputably; it is clear from the nature of the thing, the defendant is supposed not to be one of the persons carrying the goods, but he is supposed to be one of the persons coming in for the purpose of the rescue; perhaps it may be said, you are calling for what is impossible; to this I answer, that if the officers had acted with that firmness, which the law presumes he will act, backed by that force which the law calls into his aid, these goods might have been stopped and condemned, and the proof of that condemnation ready; but standing as this case does, the act of parliament requiring, and the indictment alledging, that they must be uncustomed goods, I submit it is impossible that the indictment should be supported: in the other two counts, it is not laid to be with intent to rescue.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. I submit this is a case to be left to the Jury, on the first point, the first part of the act is, if any person shall be aiding or assisting, in the rescuing and taking goods, or in case any person so armed as aforesaid, shall be aiding and assisting, therefore it is first charged that they assembled in order to be so aiding and assisting; then the second count is, that being so armed, they assembled for so doing; then the third count is, that they did so; now Mr. Garrow says, these persons were not assembled with that view, but that accidentally they did it; it is to be sure a matter of fact for the Jury, whether two men with these goods, which afterwards proved to be Hollands geneva, which goods are afterwards taken from them by the officers of Excise, there being<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140100"></xptr> some whistle immediately afterwards, and more people made their appearance, six or seven men with the prisoner at their head, and crying out it is Brock and his men; and swearing by God, they would have the goods; if that is not evidence to be left to the Jury, I profess I do not know what is; I think it is very strong evidence; then with respect to the other point, it is astonishing it should be said, that in all cases, we must prove the condemnation: why, if the goods are rescued, you cannot prove the condemnation, wherever they can be condemned we would recur to it: the evidence is, here were two tubs, that they found it not in their power to rescue from the Excise officers, and that they destroyed one in order to taste it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Willes. Mr. Garrow has taken two objections to the first count of this indictment, and a general objection to the second and third count; first he says, it will be necessary in order to convict the prisoner, that this assembling together must appear to be with intent or in order to rescue the goods; he thinks there is not sufficient evidence of intention; I admit his law that there must be sufficient evidence, but it is to be left to the jury whether there is such intention: now it does not appear to me to be casual meeting, but it must now be left to the consideration of the jury, whether under all the circumstances of the case, they should or should not be of opinion that this was for the purpose of rescuing the goods: now from the number of people, the arms they made use of, their threats, their execrations on the subject, that is a matter to be left to the jury, whether they did assemble to rescue these goods, agreeing with his law, that there must be proof of assembling to rescue these goods; again he says, there is no proof of their being uncustomed goods, there could be no condemnation, you cannot be put upon that cannot be given: as to the other point, I think that is to be left to the Jury, how far these appear to be uncustomed goods, for which no duties were to be paid; for you see these are the sort of tubs used by smugglers; therefore I leave it to the Jury.</p>

               <p>Did any of them come back? - Nobody came back with him, he returned alone, he had no stick when he went out, nor when he came in; I saw nobody come back that night, when I looked into the road, I neither saw him nor any body else.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mrs. Martin, and was so on the day that Spice was shot; in the course of that evening, he came in very early, and enquired for the key of the wicket to go to bed, I went to look for it, but my mistress was gone to town, and she took it with her, he continued till my mistress came home, and went into the bar-room with some other company; I was alarmed at some noise in the road, and I went out, and he went after me, it was some time after my mistress came in, and I was met by Mr.

            , the prisoner had unlaced his half boots, and pulled his garters off; when Brock came to the door, he shoved me on the left shoulder with one hand, and hit me on the left shoulder with a sword, and said, d - n your eyes come out, he then took his hand off my shoulder, and forced open the door, he set one one foot in, and said, d - n your eyes come out; Spice was in the passage at the time; then Brock run out and Spice followed him, I was sitting on the steps at the same time.</p>

               <p>Had Spice any stick in his hand when he went out? - He had no weapon when he went out, nor yet when he came in; he went out with his garters in his hand and his boots unlaced, and in less then three minutes, I saw the flash of three pistols, and in three minutes after I heard no noise.</p>
               <p>Did any number of people go out with them? - None went out with them, but the gentlemen that were there were going out, but returned back at the hearing of pistols; he said, he fancied he was done, and I asked him what was the matter, and he said he was shot, when he pulled up his shirt, I saw a piece shot off his belly, he said that was not of much consequence, then he took off his shoe, and took out the ball.</p>
               <p>If this man had been able to have got to his bed, do you upon your oath, believe he would have been in his bed before this time? - I do.</p>
               <p>Could he get over the wicket? - He could not if he had tried, the next morning I saw Mr. Brock and two more, they gave him some liquor, and gave me some, somebody in the room said, there is a poor young fellow, Mr. Brock, are not you sorry, to which the words he made use of were, d - n my eyes, people would never have broils, if they did not buy them.</p>
               <p>Court. How comes this man not to be tried before, when the matter happened so long ago as April last.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. These are always reported to the Board of Excise, they report a case, and they state it, and these are indictments that I should be very sorry to bring, without they are very well considered, and it is not always determined to prosecute capitally.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. When was the prisoner taken into custody? - In September.</p>
               <p>Did he continue to lodge in the same place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Willes. You see we are in a case where a man's life is at stake, and wounded in the belly and in the foot, and what this man has already suffered, all circumstances considered, I own I should recommend<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178512140104"></xptr> it to the crown to consent to his acquittal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. Then I am sure I shall, if your Lordship thinks that public justice will be answered, and that the circumstances of this case, considering what he has suffered, and the behaviour of the officer after, will prevent a repetition of this offence, I had much rather than by the execution of the man; I have brought him here only for the sake of putting a stop to these practices for the future, I am sure I shall be much better satisfied if it may be only understood, let it be well understood before this is given up, that the law is not such a law as never can or will be executed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baron Hotham. There is nobody, Mr. Attorney General, who has heard any thing of these trials, but must feel for your situation; I think you have given every satisfaction and every honourable answer to the delay that arises in these cases, but the fact is, that it is of the utmost necessity that these crimes should be punished where a proper subject should be found, so it is for the honour of the crown that when it turns out that the prisoner is not a fit subject of severity, that the prosecution should be given up.</p>
               <p>Court. It is consented, under all the circumstances of this case, not to throw it out to the world that these are not proper prosecutions, but the Attorney General, on the part of the crown, has consented to his acquittal.</p>

               <p>Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. Justice WILLES.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. You are acquitted, not because you are not guilty of the offence charged, but the crown out of that lenity and moderation, which has always honoured them, have consented to your acquittal; but at the same time you ought to return to your country, and follow your honest trade with industry and attention, and endeavour to avoid these practices yourself for the future, and also endeavour to persuade your fellow countrymen to avoid the same by your example, as it will not only bring yourself but them into ruin and disgrace.</p>

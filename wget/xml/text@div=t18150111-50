On the 31st of December about six o'clock, an officer came in and asked me if I had lost any shawls; I then looked at the window directly; I went out and saw the boys about the window. I saw three boys, these two boys, and another. I am quite sure the two boys now at the bar were two of the three boys.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any suspicion that you had did you watch - A. I watched: I went behind the two boys and stood behind a waggon. I was in a situation that I could see what any person did at my shop window. I saw the two prisoners go to the window, both together taking hold of the clothes, with their hands both in the window, lifting the clothes up; they were both taking a part in it; I went behind them both, and catched them both by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. You laid hold of them - A. Yes this was about six o'clock, on the 31st of December, When I laid hold of them I brought them to the shop.

             dropped a shawl at the door, a lady in the shop picked it up. I brought them both into the shop, I am sure it fell from Kettle.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the worth of that, do you think - A. Eight shillings and six pence; I saw it fall from Kettle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other of your shawls in the possession of the other boy - A. The officer took a shawl from his breast, I saw the officer do it. The officer took a shawl from Reeves he had it in his breast; that was worth eight shillings and six pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine your window to see how they got these shawls - A. Yes I did afterwards: the window had been cut or broken, and the glass removed; they could take any thing out of the shop window.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before that had you occasion to turn your eye towards the shop window, to know whether it was safe or not. A. Another officer came at five o'clock; I went out then and examined the window; there was a small piece out of the window at the bottom, but not big enough to take any thing out.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you by that part of the window which had been broken at five o'clock - A. Yes; that was not big enough to take the goods out; it was cut in a fresh place, large enough to take any thing out at six o'clock. At five o'clock it was only cut a little at the bottom; that is all I know, I know the goods to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partner - A. No.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 31st of December I was at Mr. Hughes's shop about six o'clock. I saw the two prisoners at the window; there was another with them a few minutes before, I was close behind them, I heard the glass break.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the glass of Mr. Hughes's window - A. Yes; the two prisoners stood close against the window when I heard the window break nobody else was nigh it.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that window come low down - A. Yes; the glass is about two feet from the pavement. I kept my eye upon them; I saw Kettle take the shawl out; he came just round the corner he put it inside of his waistcoat. I went into the shop, and told the gentleman of it; I told him there was some things taken out of his window; and when I came out of the shop, they were both at the window again when this shawl was taken out they both had hold of this shawl, they took out this shawl, they both had their hands in the window. I was just going to lay hold of them but Mr. Hughes laid hold of them before me; I did no know that one of the shawls was dropped by Kettle, at the shop door before they were taken into the shop I searched them; on the prisoner Kettle, I found the shawl underneath his waistcoat, Kettle dropped one and the other was taken from him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hughes. I think the constable took that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110029"></xptr>shawl from Reeves.</p>
               <p>Carlisle. I took it from Kettle; it is a mistake of Mr. Hughes; I found a second piece upon Kettle they had got hold of a piece of cloth that laid against the window; they had got hold of that, that would have made a third piece; but they could not take it out.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Hughes. Were these goods laying near the window - A. They were belonging to my shop.</p>
               <p>Kettle. Said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Reeves's Defence. I had been driving beast in Smithfield; I was making the best of my way home I met this boy, he said here is a pretty shawl should you like to have one.</p>

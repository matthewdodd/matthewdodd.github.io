             sworn. The prosecutor lodged in Hampstead Road, at Mr Mane's; I was sent for on the 27th of January, on suspicion of stealing a coat; the prisoner worked for Mr. Rhodes, as soon as I saw him he made his escape; I was informed he left the coat at St. Giles's; I made haste after him and overtook him with the coat on; they both work for Mr. Rhodes.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Prosecutor.) How long had you lost it before you found it. - A. I missed it when I came home at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you found it before it was lost. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had worked for Mr. Rhodes three weeks, I told them I would not stay any longer; when Saturday night came, he stopped three shillings, for fear I should not come on the Monday morning; Mr. Hunt sent for me to the same place as I had left, my coat being dirty, I put that coat on to get my work, they told me I must come again at four o'clock, Mr. Hunt not being in the way; I went back to Mr. Rhodes's for my money, he said he would leave me in the hands of a constable, I thought it was because I would not work there any longer, I ran away and went to Mr. Hunt's for my work, and then when I went home to my lodgings they took me into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop at Wandsworth. I have missed a considerable quantity of money from my till, in consequence of which I marked seven penny pieces, on the 9th of June, and laid them separately in the till under some halfpence—I then left the house, and when I came home the prisoner was in custody—this penny piece is one that I had marked, and left in the till—the prisoner is a traveller, and lodged opposite me.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw my husband mark this money, and place it in the till—he went out, and a few minutes afterwards I had occasion to go up stairs—I was not absent above a minute—when I came down the prisoner was in the shop—she asked for half a pint of beer—I served her, and she gave me this marked penny-piece—it is one that had been marked and put into the till—I opened the till—the money in it had been disturbed, but the till had been closed again—(the prisoner had been in the shop several times before)—I asked her if she had any more money about her—she said, "About 3 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I asked her to show it me, which she did—I said, I could not swear to that, had she no more—she said no—I said I must detain her till my husband came home—she then said she had had change for a shilling in the morning—I sent for an officer, and this money which is produced was found on her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Chief Inspector of the Detective Department—on the 25th January, about 1 o'clock in the afternoon, I went to 36, Bedfordbury, where a man named Pearce resided—he occupied two rooms on the first-floor—I saw Pearce, and after having some conversation with him I went into his room—I found the prisoner there, sitting at the table with a dirty white handkerchief in front of him, containing a quantity of chains, some of which I produce—he had hold of a chain, and at his side was this bottle of aqua fortis—he had the stopper in his right hand and was testing the chain as I went in—I said to him "Joe, I did not expect to find you here "—he said "Somebody has done this for me "—I told him to stand on one side, in a corner, and I then asked Pearce to account for this property—he said "Joe brought it here "—the prisoner said nothing to that—it was property which was afterwards inentified by Mr. Zucher—I searched the room and found a green baize bag full of cigars, and by the side of it was a carpet bag containing several cigar tubes and pipes—I asked Pearce to account for the possession of those—he said "Joe brought them "—the prisoner said nothing to that—the house is let out in tene<lb></lb>ments—the ground-floor is occupied as a greengrocer's, the back is a machinist's shop, which trade Pearce carried on—on searching further I found a large meerschaum pipe, twelve compasses, and a great variety of things—I sent for a constable, who took the prisoner away, and about ten minutes afterwards I heard that he had escaped—he was not apprehended till a fortnight ago—I then went to Bow Street and told him the charge—he said "Somebody has got this up for me, and very well"—he never gave any explanation where he got the articles from—I had seen the prisoner go into Pearce's house on the Monday, and also on the Tuesday previous to my going there—he had not anything with him that I saw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner does not lire there—he lives some quarter of a mile from there—I did not ask him whether he knew anything about the things—I addressed my conversation principally to Pearce—I did not ask the prisoner whether they belonged to him, nor did he say "Certainly not"—Pearce said that the bottle of aqua fortis which the prisoner was using was used by him, Pearce, in his business.</p>

I am a watch maker and jeweller at 26, King Street, Camden Town—I left my house en the morning of tip 27th January, per<lb></lb>fectly safe—I returned about 11.20 at night—I found the street door open, and also the window, and a quantity of goods abstracted from it, watches, rings, and chains—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are a part of them—they are all mine—I can identify every one of these as having been safe in my house when I left it that morning—the goods stolen amounted to between 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

The prisoner was given into my custody on the 25th January, by Inspector Palmer—as I was taking him to Bow Street Station he gave a sudden jerk and made his escape at the bottom of James Street, Covent Garden—I made an effort to recapture him, but did not succeed.</p>

In January last I received a description of the prisoner from Palmer, and on the 18th April I went to 23, Caledonian Crescent, Caledonian Road, about 3 o'clock in the morning, in company with a sergeant in uniform—after getting admittance I went to the first-floor front room and knocked at the door—a female opened it—the sergeant turned his light on, and the prisoner was sitting on the bed—I said "Joe, I want you for that job in King Street, Camdon Town, in Janu<lb></lb>ary last "—he said "That is what I expected; I should like to know who sent you here"—I said "No one, I believe I saw you on Saturday night in the Crescent, and I thought this was the house you came to, and from inquiries I made I found you were living here"—I took him to the Bow Street Station, where he was identified by Palmer.</p>

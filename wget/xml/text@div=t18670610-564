                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, of 1, Downham Road, Kingsland—on 14th January I was awoke by the loud screams of my housekeeper, between two and three a.m.—I saw a man run away from her—she was making a grasp at him, and blood was streaming from her head—I got up and examined my house—I found the washhouse window open, and the yard door—they were shut and fastened when I went to bed—a person had got in at the window, and then unfastened the yard door, which opens into the yard, by which means he made his escape sure—my servant's bed-room was easy of access when they were once in the house—the prisoner had been to my shop, and ask me a question about the repair of a watch, the day previous, and I recognised him immediately.</p>

I am Mr. Barnett's servant—I was aroused by a noise, about a quarter-past one o'clock—I looked into the yard, but saw nothing—I went to bed again, and to sleep—about half an hour after<lb></lb>wards, to the best of my knowledge, I saw the prisoner pass through my room—he opened the folding-doors between my master's room and mine, and I then saw who he was by the gas light in the shop, where my master sleeps, and which is alight all night; there was a full blaze of light—I distinctly saw his face; he was face to face with me—after he entered my master's room I got out of bed, and saw him standing over my master as he lay in bed—I saw his face distinctly—I made a grasp at him, and he turned round and hit me a blow with some hard instrument on the top of my head—I shouted out, and my master awoke—I afterwards found the sash of the washhouse window broken—I had seen that window closed at night—my room door was unlocked, and a person could come from the wash-house into my room.</p>

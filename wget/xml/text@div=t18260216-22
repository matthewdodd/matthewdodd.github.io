            . I live in Bell-court, Gray's Inn-lane, and am a watchman. On Saturday, the 5th of February, I was calling the hour of four in Long-yard, Lamb's Conduit-street, and saw the prisoner standing by two bags by the wall, at the back of Mr. Lane's house, which is <placeName id="t18260216-22-crimeloc105">No. 36, Lamb's Conduit-street</placeName>

I had never seen the prisoner before, and did not see him again till the 6th of February, when he was at Hatton-garden - it was dark when I saw him; I was hardly two minutes looking at him, but am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESSWELL. Q. You held the lantern in his face - did you look at any other part of him? A. No. He had a white coat on - there is a gas-light about fifty feet off. I said at Hatton-garden it was a man rather taller, or about my height; he had a green coat there.</p>

            . I live in Lamb's Conduit-street, and am a straw hat manufacturer - Edward Harris rents my shop and back parlour, for the winter season - his man sleeps there, but was out that night; my bonnets were in his warehouse. On the 5th of February, about four o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed, and discovered three locks broken, and the property gone - it appeared that the thieves had come over the wall in Long-yard, through the kitchen window, and into the warehouse; the kitchen door was cut to let them through. I untied one of the bags, and saw the furs in it; I believe both were tied - one contained bonnets; they were all safe the night before.</p>

I went to the premises at half-past nine o'clock in the morning, and found about two hundred muffs in one bag; I had seen them safe three or four days before. Next day, about half-past twelve o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner and another young man by a public-house, about thirty yards from the premises - he appeared to answer the description given by the watchman: they passed my door, and appeared to be idling about the place. I had them secured after following them to Keppel-street.</p>

            . I am a butcher, of Newgate-market. The prisoner is my nephew; I lodge at his father's, in Black Horse-square, Aldgate; he sleeps with me; I have lived there about three years. On Saturday, the 4th of February, I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock - he went to bed with me, and got up about eight o'clock in the morning; he could not have left the bed without my missing him; his mother generally takes the key of our room.

            . I am the prisoner's father. On Saturday, the 4th of February, I left work at eight o'clock, leaving my two sons to finish a coat; the prisoner left work at nine - he went to bed at eleven, with his uncle - they were locked in, and my wife had the key; he got up about eight o'clock. I sent him on Monday to look after a man who owed me money, which I was to have by instalments - he was a wine porter, and I heard he had got a situation about Bloomsbury. I told my son to search every winevaults and cellar, and if he saw a wine-cellar to stop till somebody came out; he never wore a great coat.

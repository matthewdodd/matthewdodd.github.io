            . I met the prisoner one day accidentally in Bishopsgate-street, with another man; they asked me the way to Bedlam, and they asked me where I was going: I said, as far as Stretham; I did not know the way, so I could not stop to shew them; but I went with them, and shewed them Bedlam. I was going home to clean myself; they asked me to go in and drink; I went in with them; then we proceeded on to Hackney-road, as I know the road since; I really did not know the road then: they went into the Ass and Foal, there we had some dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the road to Stretham?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. No; when they had had their dinner, they went further along the road, a good way.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. In Pans Alley, Aldersgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What business do you follow?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. I <rs id="t17710220-36-viclabel201" type="occupation">work at the upholsterers work</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17710220-36-victim466 t17710220-36-viclabel201"></join>, at Mr. Gilding's in Aldersgate-street. They proceeded farther along the road, and then turned down a lane till they got into some open fields; then they began to pull me about, and d - d and sunk me, and said, that they had not brought me there for the purpose of shewing me the way to Stretham, but for other purpose, and asked me if I had got any money: I told them I had not; they d - d me for a b - h, and threatened my life; they put their hands in my pocket, both of them, one on one side, and the other on the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Has there not been a trial here already about this same matter?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. The other man that was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man in company with this man?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. The other man was Meeken by name, I believe; I never saw either of them before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same man that was tried here before, that was with him?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes; then they took the buckles out of my shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of buckles?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. A little sort of stone pattern; they were silver. After they took my buckles out of my shoes, I begged and prayed of them to spare my life: I begged of them not to murder me, for the sake of my children I had at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, had you any business that road that carried you that way?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. No; they took me that road, and said, it was my way to Stretham.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never been at Stretham before?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. What business had you that day to go to Stretham?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. A young man that lived there owed me some money.</p>
               <p>Q. You told them you was going to Stretham?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you made some enquiry where it was?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. When I met them, I was going home with the intent to enquire.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been to when you met them?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. To Flying Horse Yard, Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the man's name that owed you the money at Stretham?</p>
               <p>Mazemore.

               <p>Mazemore. They appeared civil gentlemen. We went by some trees, down a dirty lane, with a gate to it, that took us out of that road into a field.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see the prisoner after this?</p>

               <p>Mazemore. A person took him by description.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you give a description to?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. I gave the description to a person of my acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you he was taken?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. The person that took him brought him to me, to know if he was the man or not.</p>

               <p>Q. On seeing him, did you know him again?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes, immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. From the Prisoner. Did not we go to drink the wine before we went to Bedlam?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. No, afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. At what time of the day did you dine?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Between one and two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know how far it was to Stretham?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Only as they told me.</p>

               <p>Q. You said you was going home to clean yourself?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Nothing further than an apron.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this place you dined at the only place you called at after you had drank your wine, on coming out of Bedlam?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. No; they called at another house, with an excuse to call for some writings, as they were a-going to receive some money at Stretham: it was a public house; I do not know where it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink there?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes; they had a glass of brandy a piece; I had the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call any where else?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. No: I lost two shillings and sixpence in money; I cannot say which had it, nor how they had it, but I lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Jury. How long might you be at dinner?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. I believe an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you to drink?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. A pot of beer, and a glass of brandy.</p>

            . The second of last November, the Friday before Lord Mayor's day, I was coming from Mile-End, to go to Smithfield. I was coming down Bethnal-Green road; near Lord Camden's head, I met Mr. Meekins and this man, along with Mazemore. Mazemore stopped to speak with me about five minutes; in the mean time these two men stopped with her: I had not seen her before for six months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of them?</p>
               <p>Cross. I had seen them before. Meekins used to be about the turnpikes, dressed like a countryman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mazemore before?</p>
               <p>Cross. She used to wash for me; she had not washed for me six months, for I went to live down at Mile-End. She asked me when I would call to see her, and how I did. I called the Sunday fortnight afterwards: when I went, I asked her what she did along with them two men.

             was remarked for a gambler. She said, I wish I knew who they were; I said, they often resorted about the turnpike. She did not say any more then. A week after that, she told her sister, and she told me, and we went to seek after them. When we came back one day, she had taken Meekins into custody; her sister and I had been out all day long looking after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way were they going?</p>
               <p>Cross. They were going towards Bethnal Green. It was in Bethnal Green new road, that leads towards the Green, or it takes to Oldford, or Hackney, or Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. What time a day was this?</p>

               <p>I was coming by Bedlam wall, before you come to Bedlam. Mrs. Mazemore said, Well, what, you are looking about you, young man; I said, Yes: says she, This is Bedlam: said I, I should like to see it, but should not like to go in by myself: she said, she would go with me, If I would give her a glass of wine. I went up a street, and had some mulled wine and toast. While it was mulling, Meekins came in: I never saw him, neither before nor since, till I saw him here, just before he went out. She called Meekins her cousin. Then it was agreed we should all three go to see Bedlam. We went there, and walked about a good while: we went two stories high: she wanted me to get a coach to take her to the play that night. From thence we went to Dobney's Bowling Green, and we went to the sign of the Sun; we went into the parlour, thinking to dine there, and had a glass of brandy a-piece. I said, You favour a young man that I know; she said, Don't think I am a young man, you may see I am not, for I have breasts, and took her handkerchief aside, and shewed one of her breasts. She said, she wanted a pair of shoes, and she should be a fine woman if she had a silk gown, and wanted me to buy one, and said, she could not have one without ten guineas. Then we went to the Ass and Foal, and dined; and then Meekins and she went out arm in arm together, and I came away, and never saw her after till that day I came to see her at her house. We parted good friends.</p>

               <p>The evidence was nearly the same as on the trial for the robbery; she deposed, that after Meekins and the prisoner had robbed her, they both ravished her.</p>

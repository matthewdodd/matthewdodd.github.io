                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Bennett; we lived near Russell square. On the 23rd of April I went out between eleven and twelve o'clock—I had a purse in my pocked, and a sixpence in it—I took out of it what money I did not want before I went out—my pocket was made in my petticoat—I got t it by an opening in my gown—I went to Skinner-street, Somers-town—there was something to be seen which took my attention—I stooped a minute or two, and saw the prisoner close by my side—I said to him, "Move your foot, you have got my purse under your foot"—he looked at me for a moment, and then ran—I stooped and picked up the purse—it was mine, and the sixpence was still in it.</p>

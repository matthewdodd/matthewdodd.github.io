            . I am an officer. I went to the prisoner's house, No. 4, Southampton-court, Tottenham-court-road - I asked if he ever pawned any thing at Wadmore's - he denied it. I left him with Mr. Mullett's porter, and went over to Wadmore's. They searched the books, and assured me nothing of the kind was ever taken in. Wadmore said nothing had been brought there but rubbish - I said,</p>
               <p>"Did you ever take in any furniture?" - he said,</p>
               <p>"Never". Davis was not present. I came over to the prisoner again. The porter said, he thought the carpet on the parlour floor was his master's The prisoner went with me to Mr. Mullett, and acknowledged that part of the carpet was his, and said he had pawned the bed-furniture at Wadmore's, for 27 s. I went there next morning, and found the furniture of three four-post bedsteads, which were given up, and the carpet.</p>

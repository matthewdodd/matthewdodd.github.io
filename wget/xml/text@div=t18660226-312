                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective-officer</hi>). I was on duty on 6th February, in Parliament-street—there was a great crowd there, and I saw the prisoner and three other men pushing the people about—just close to Richmond<lb></lb>mews, I saw the tallest of the four put his arm on an old gentleman's shoulder, and bend him down while the prisoner took away his watch—I caught hold of the prisoner, and took the watch out of his hand, but one of his companions struck me, and took away the watch—I endeavoured to follow the men—I was stopped by the crowd, but I never lost sight of the prisoner till I took him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 43, Southampton-street, Camberwell, and am a general agent—I was in Parliament-street on 6th February, looking at the procession, which was then passing—I felt myself pressed against by some person—I was most cruelly treated—I was pressed at the first onset, on my left shoulder—my eyes were intent upon the beauty of the horses, and I thought the man that pressed me upon my left shoulder was particularly hungry to see the sight, never dreaming that I was in a gang of pick-pockets—I was very much shaken in my nerves, and ought to have been under the care of a doctor—I was suffering for a week after—I had two pressings—the last was a very severe one, and I was twisted over a large form—I was so confused that I did not know what I was about—when I recovered, I missed my silver watch, a peculiar one, which had a musical tick—I would not take 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—this is the little ring that it was taken off—it was most ingeniously done, and the prisoner has condemned himself, because when I went to the station, he said he did not get it, but his friend had got it—then, I say, let his friend give it up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you say that, in your examination before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said that which was right—it is all down on paper—I said everything which was necessary—it is very likely I made that statement—I should not have withheld it for a moment.</p>

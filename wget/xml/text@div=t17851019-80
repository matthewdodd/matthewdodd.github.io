               <p>I know the prisoner, and I am very sorry it has fallen to my lot to appear against him, but if he had not, in all probability I must have taken a trial in his stead; I have seen the prisoner eight or nine times, I do not know what he is, I am a ticket porter; on Monday, the 30th of last September, about twelve at noon, the prisoner came to the Temple-gate, and he says, porter, will you go and do a job for me this afternoon about four o'clock? I said if I was in the way I would; he said, he would call at that time as he was going away, but he turned round, and says, porter, I have recollected myself, it will suit better for you to go at three; I did not see him that day, at all, on the next day, on the first of October, he came about half after twelve, I was looking down the Inner Temple lane, and about half way down I saw the prisoner, he put his fingers up and I came to him, says he, now can you do the job you was to do yesterday? I said, if you please; he took me down through the Temple in Temple-street, Whitefriars, then he pulled out this note, and gave it to me; I am sure this is the note, I had it from the prisoner; now says he, go according to the directions of this note, and you will receive a parcel, and bring it to me, at the Pied Horse, in Chiswell-street, and if you should be there before me, wait, but if I am there before you, I will wait till you come; I looked at the note, and I saw it was directed to Mess. Harris, Prescott, and Howard, linen drapers, in Bow Church-yard; the note was wafered; I told him I would go immediately, I was going, and he said, porter, I want to speak to you, if they should ask you where you come from, say you came from No. 5, Moor-place, Moorfields, I went with the note, and gave it, as I found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178510190131"></xptr> afterwards, to Mr. Prescott, I believe he went into the compting-house to read it; in about five minutes he came out, and said, porter, did the gentleman mention what price he would give? I said, I do not know, he told me to come for a parcel, and bring it to him at the Pied Horse in Chiswell-street; he said very well, he would go and look them out immediately, and I must give that justice to Mr. Prescott to say, that there is not a tradesman in the city of London could look out a parcel quicker than Mr. Prescott did, but it was not the same sort that the prisoner sent for, Mr. Prescott went to look out the parcel, he did produce some linen to be sure, but it was a great deal smaller than the prisoner sent for, and of a different quality, for instead of looking out the four pieces of linen, he looked out a white night cap, which was on the head of a constable, who took me into custody; now says he, my friend, I shall take care of you, till you find out the person that sent you, I was defrauded out of several dozens of handkerchiefs by a note similar to this hand-writing; I cannot say, my Lord, but what I was a little ashamed, but when I recollected myself I said, I know nothing of it, I am innocent, I came in my profession as a ticket porter; says he, I do not know that; says I, I belong to a society, which the present worthy Lord Mayor is president of, it is called the Guardians; and if I had ever been concerned with any swindler, I must never look them in the face any more; he asked me who I knew belonging to the society, I mentioned many respectable characters about Cheapside; Alderman Plomer is our governor; we give two securities of fifty pounds each; says I, if you detain me here, it will not be the way to find out the person, you had better let the constable go with me to the Pied Horse in Chiswell-street; then Mr. Prescott had a consultation whether he should send any linen, but it was agreed, that it should be a parcel of waste paper, tied up in the form of a roll, for me to carry under my arm, that if the prisoner saw me he should not think any thing was amiss; then it was agreed for me to go, and the constable and his assistants, I was to walk first, and they were to walk behind me, Mr. Prescott was to come behind at some distance, and the constable and his assistants were to go into the tap-room, and take no notice of me, and I was to go in, and go to the bar, and enquire for the gentleman; accordingly we went, and I went in first into the tap-room, I called for a pint of beer, and asked the gentlewoman at the bar, if there was a gentleman there waiting for a porter that had been into the city about some Irish linens; she desired me to sit down; says I, I had rather not, I will go to the door, and may be I may see the gentleman one way or the other, I went to the door, and I had no sooner come there, than on casting my eyes across the road, I saw the prisoner standing in Moorfields, he saw me and held up his hands, I held up my hand, and held up the parcel, he seemed to be very well pleased, then he came forwards out of Moorfields into the middle of the road, and I advanced and met him at the right hand corner of Chiswell-street, where there was a penthouse, and we went down there; says he, well! (and smiled) you have got it; yes, says I, you villain! and I have got you; and I took him by the collar, and I turned round, and saw the constable about ten or twelve yards off, I held him fast, and gave them a beckon, they came up, he trembled, and said, what is the matter? then I delivered him to their charge.</p>

               <p>What did he say for himself? - He said very little, he said what was the matter; we went into the Pied Horse, and Mr. Prescott came in, then it was agreed to take him to Mess. Rogers and Co. at No. 5, Moor-place, whose names he had presented; we all went in together, Mr. Rogers came first, he said he knew nothing of the handwriting; the prisoner was present; Mr. Rogers said he knew the defendant, that he was formerly a clerk in their compting-house: I am sure this is the note.</p>

               <p>You are a city porter then? - Yes, I had seen the prisoner about a twelvemonth ago, but never above eight or nine times in my life, I had not a great deal of conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Did not the person explain the nature of the business? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You was under some apprehension for yourself if you had not found out some person to fix this upon? - I was detained.</p>
               <p>When you came to Chiswell-street, I believe your fears would have been realised if you had not found some person to fix this upon? - I fixed on the right.</p>
               <p>The party was not at the Pied-horse? - No, I know the man again.</p>
               <p>Pray, Sir, as you have been extremely tenacious concerning your character, has it ever been your misfortune to be suspected of any little depredations yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was the result of that suspicion? - Not felony, I never was tried in my life, I was in custody for an assault, and it was ordered up by a general release.</p>

               <p>Upon your detaining him, what story did he tell you? - He said, he knew nothing of the contents of the note, he totally denied it; he said, he knew the man that gave it him, and could bring several reputable people to appear for him, and convinced me thoroughly that he was not concerned, and he told me where the man was to be found.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. You know nothing of the hand-writing, but that it bears a resemblance to one you formerly received? - That is all.</p>

You have been convicted by the verdict, by a very attentive Jury of this fraud; and I am now at liberty to say that I entertain no doubt in my own mind, that the Jury have selected the truth of this case from the evidence; the offence is of a very dangerous nature, a person who has lived in a situation of credit as a clerk to a house of character, making use of the name of that house to obtain credit, and defraud them of their property, is an offence the most difficult of all others to guard against, and which therefore ought to be watched more particularly, and punished with more severity; for few kinds of fraud are more dangerous, and more prejudicial to trade, and it seems to me that there is very little distinction as to your guilt, between the attempt you made by the note you wrote and sent by the porter, and the completion of that guilt, which depended upon the credit that note might obtain with Mr. Prescott, for the delivery of the goods; the Court therefore think they should not discharge their duty to the public, and afford the protection which they owe to the trade of this great City, without sentencing you, which they now do, to be <rs id="t17851019-80-punish388" type="punishmentDescription">

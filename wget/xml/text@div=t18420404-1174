On the 1st of March the prisoner came to me as errand-boy—on the Thursday following, about five o'clock, I sent him to get change for a Sovereign at Mr. Jennings, at the corner of Globe-street—he did not return—on Saturday, the 5th of March, I found him in New Gravel-lane, standing in the road, nearly half-a-mile from my house—a policeman was close by, and I gave him into custody.</p>

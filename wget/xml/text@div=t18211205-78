            . I entered Mr. Johnson's service in June; he lived at Hill's house, Southampton. I was postillion and the prisoner was <rs id="t18211205-78-deflabel488" type="occupation">coachman</rs>

My master was arrested, I and the prisoner attended on him at Radford's house, the sheriff's officer; the prisoner slept in Little Coram-street, and attended at his brother's in Torrington's-mews, Keppel-street. On a Friday, ten or twelve days after my master had been arrested, we lodged together, and were going home from my master; the prisoner said, "Charles, I have got orders from my master that you are to go and fetch his clothes from Hatchett's, and deliver them to me;" he said, "Go, and put all the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050054"></xptr>things in the bag that you can, and bring them to me here;" he waited in Dover-street, I went and got the articles stated in the indictment, put them in a bag, and took them to him; he then said, it was by way of getting his wages, he did not say how much was due to him; I should not have fetched them if he had not said it was my master's order, we went to his brother's stable, and left them there. I told him he should not have done so, considering Mr. Johnson's situation; he said Mr. Johnson would never get out, and he intended to keep them for his wages.</p>

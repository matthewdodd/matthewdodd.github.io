                  </hi>. On the 16th of August, about eleven in the morning, I saw the prisoner Gilson at West Ham, fighting with my son William—I did not see the first of it—whether it was by arrangement I do not know—two constables came up, and Gilson ran away—my son went into his lodging just by—I went to the Angel to have a pint of beer—Gilson came there and challenged my son to fight him in the marshes at Temple Mills at seven o'clock in the evening—they fought, and my son got the worst of it—I saw my son come up very weak at the last round, and saw Gilson hit him on the side of the head—I had asked my boy not to fight, but he said if he did not he should be called a coward—I tried all I could to stop it—my son fell—Underhill picked him up several times, and stood behind him—he was his second, and carried him on his back to his lodging in Angel-lane—he was bled, but died—he had been fighting about a quarter of an hour—he was taller than Gilson and very thin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Gilson.</hi> I did not challenge him to fight—he asked at the Angel if I was satisfied—I said, "I did not like to be struck." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not hear that—I cannot tell what led to it—Underhill did not urge my son to fight longer than he could.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I saw the deceased on Wednesday, at half-past ten at night, in a state of total insensibility, laborious breathing, and incapable of swallowing—he lived about three-quar<lb></lb>ters of an hour—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on Friday—there was con<lb></lb>siderable contusion externally on the left temple and beneath the eye, and within the skull a large quantity of extravasated blood—the brain was per<lb></lb>fectly healthy—I consider the cause of death was the pressure of extrava<lb></lb>sated blood on the brain caused by violence—in my judgment the blow or fall in the fight had caused the violence—it might be a blow against some hard substance—a fall against the ground might produce it, but I think not without being knocked down—I think the extravasated blood could not be caused by his over excitement, but by violence externally applied.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living at Elstree, which is close to Brockley-hill—I worked at hay-making at Mr. Partridge's, and the prisoners worked there also for two or three days—on Friday, 1st August, I was dis<lb></lb>charged, and received my wages at the time—at sunset that day, when it was getting dark, I went to Herrington's public-house, at Brockley-hill—the prisoners were there when I went in—I had a pint of beer, and took out my purse when I paid for it—Williams saw all that was in my purse—I do not know exactly what time I left the public-house, but it was about half-past 10 when I went there—I was not in there more than a few minutes, and then I walked out again—the prisoners followed me out—I was going down to my master's place, and they came out after me, and John Williams said, "Come along," and the three dragged me to a pond there, and knocked me down; I got up, and then John Williams knocked me down again—I got up again, and he said, "If I can't do it, I will stick him with a knife"—I was calling for help, and I was knocked down again—I got no assistance, and John Williams took hold of me by the neck and choked me that I could not speak; the others then took hold of me, one on each side, and he put one hand on my neck, and with the other took all the money out of my pocket, and they all went away—when Williams threatened to use the knife, he took a knife from a case and opened it—he took it out of his trousers pocket—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—during this time the others were kicking me, and I was calling out "Help!" and fighting—the police at Elstree heard me, and were coming down—after being robbed I met with my mate, Patrick Berry—I afterwards met with two police constables—I saw the three prisoners next day at the station—I am sure they are the same three men—I did not go to Mr. Partridge's place since I was robbed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and have worked at Mr. Partridge's the last two summers—I knew the prisoners before Friday, 1st August; the two brothers worked at Mr. Partridge's farm—I met them on this night in the beer-shop at Brockley-hill—I afterwards saw the prosecutor; I met him on the road as I was coming home, and I afterwards met two policemen while I was with him, but he was on before me, for I had had a kick on the hip and could not well keep up with him.</p>

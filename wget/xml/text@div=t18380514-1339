On the 18th of May, between two and three o'clock in the day, I was walking in the Strand—I heard some one walking close behind me—I turned round, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his possession—it had been in my coat pocket a very short time previously—he was walking away with it, but I collared him the moment he was about to start—he attempted to hand the hand<lb></lb>kerchief over to an accomplice, but he did not receive it, and got off—this is my handkerchief—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

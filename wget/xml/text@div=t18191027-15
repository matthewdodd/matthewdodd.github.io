               <p>"Who is that? what is your business?" the answer was,</p>
               <p>"I am waiting for the boy from Water-lane." I said</p>
               <p>"What boy?" he said</p>
               <p>"Tucker, the boy from Water-lane." On going up to him, I found an ill-looking young man, quite a stranger to me, it was the witness, Jackson - I suspected him, asked his business, and at the same time saw a bundle at his feet, which I found to be tea-lead - it immediately occurred to me that it was part of a quantity of tea-lead delivered the preceding day, which had been deposited in the inner room to make stereotype plates. I rang the office-bell, and at the same time collared him. I desired them to secure the person inside the office, which they did - the prisoner was inside the office, he was the bookbinder's boy, and was in the habit of coming to my office at the latter end of every month for monthly publications. Having secured both, while I stood outside the door I desired the lead in the inner-room to be weighed - it was deficient 10 lbs., which was the quantity I found lying at the door. I asked the prisoner why he had gone up to my manufactory, contrary to the order I had given him? We took them to Bow-street. On our way there, finding Jackson worked at Bell's office, I called there, and while they were speaking to him about it he acknowledged it. The lead was like that left behind.</p>

            . On the 30th of September, about seven o'clock in the evening, the bell of Mr. Watts's printing-office was rang; the little girl opened the door, came back, and said Tucker was waiting for some books for his master - I did not go down to him immediately. Soon after I was going down, and he came up stairs to me - he had been ordered never to come up. I told him there was nothing ready. Soon after this the girl came and said I must come down, for the lead had been stolen. I found Tucker down there, and the prosecutor had Jackson.</p>

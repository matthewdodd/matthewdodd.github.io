I was nineteen last July—I—was never connected with a transaction of this kind before,; I swear that—I was at the Standard Music Hall when a barman robbed the master—I had nothing to do with that; I was not accused of having anything to do with it—the name of the master at the music-hall was Mr. Bunt—I was not questioned a word about it—I cannot tell you, the name of the barman who was charged—it was for stealing a marked sixpence and a shilling, I believe—there was once something about a watch and chain; I was not there then—I was not accused; a man was who used to work for a fishmonger; I was not questioned about it—I believe the watch and chain were given up; I do not know who gave it up—it might be two years ago—I think the watch was stolen in the stalls—I was potman there at the time—I was once taken' to the Westminster police-court for stealing mould; never for anything else—I was never accused of stealing a watch—I remember about three months before this, when in the prosecutor's service, a box with money in it being missed by one of the barmaids—I was questioned about it—the box was afterwards found in the house, and nothing more came of it; it was found in one of the barmaids' boxes—I would have stolen. Mr. Watson's cash-box myself, but Robins stopped my doing it—I mentioned it to Robins because I wanted some money; I thought he would go shares with me—Robins cross-examined me at the police court; he asked me about the box, that is all—he did not ask me about anybody else employing me in the matter; I swear that—he said "Wasn't it you who first proposed to get the cash-box?" and I said "Yes"—he did not ask whether I proposed it to Watson—I have never been in Court before; I have never done anything like stealing a cash-box before; I never committed a theft before, only taking mould from Lady Dacre's garden; I forgot that—I have no idea bow-much there was in the cash-box—I was in the service six months—I do not know how often the money was counted; I do not know that it was counted up every night—it was not done in my presence before I went to bed—I will swear I did not see it filled every night with the takings of the day.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector B</hi>). I was sent for to the Queen's Head on Wednesday, 3rd May, at about 9.30 in the morning—I examined the premises; the tap-room is separate from the main building—it is one Story—there is an open yard outside the tap-room, and an area, and a door leading from the front of the bar into the yard—I also examined the window of the bar parlour—the bar parlour is part of the main building, divided from the public parlour where the business is carried on—my attention was directed to a white calico blind in the bar parlour which was covered with soot—I noticed the fastening of the window frame—there were small scratches between the two sashes; I should think they must have been recently done—I closed the window and operated on the outside of it, and found it could be opened very easily by the catch being slipped back with an ordinary pocket knife—a person coming from the tap room and crossing the yard could very easily enter the parlour by the window—there was a desk close to the window, which was pointed out to me as the place where the cash-box was kept—I traced soot from the bar parlour window over the wall into the next premises, and then came to a hoarding; there were still traces of soot there—I got over the hoarding, which is about 6 feet high—I examined the tap room chimney, and found soot leading from the tap room to the bar parlour window—I had had no statement made to me then of a man having concealed himself in the chimney; it was for my own satisfaction—I found a slight mark in the chimney, as if a toe had been against it, leaving a white mark behind it—there is a place 5 or 6 feet up the chimney where a person could sit back very easily—I did not get up to see—I could see the soot had evidently been disturbed—I took the charges against Watson and Humphry—Watson was taken in custody first and Humphry afterwards; on Thursday; Watson was taken about 12 o'clock in the day—I don't know what money he had on him—Watson was present when Humphry was brought in—Humphry did not make a state<lb></lb>ment in Watson's presence—as soon as the charge was taken and he was about to be removed to the cells, he wished to make a statement; he was brought back in consequence of that request—I have got the statement here—he signed it—there were no traces of soot except as I have described, from the tap room to the window and the window to the wall.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer B</hi>). I took Robins a little before 9 o'olock on the evening of the 4th, at the Queen's Head—I told him I should take him in custody for being concerned with two others in com<lb></lb>mitting a burglary at Mr. Watson's—he said "I told <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> I expected you were coming for me, but I know nothing of the burglary"—<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> is his brother-in-law—I had taken Watson early in the day, about 12 o'olock—I said "<hi rend="italic">Chungo</hi>, I am going to take you for committing a burglary down at Watson's"—at the station I said "Show me what you have got"—he pulled out 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., consisting of a sovereign, a half<lb></lb>sovereign, and the remainder in silver—it was 6 o'clock when he was charged, when I searched him and found 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. deficient—he had been in custody and I said "What have you done with the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said "We don't rip up guts here"—I am sure he had no opportunity of communicating with anyone.</p>

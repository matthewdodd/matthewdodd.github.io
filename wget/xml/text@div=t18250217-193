On the 9th of December, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came in alone: she was buying some trifling articles, and was pointed out to me by this young lady as having stolen a card of lace -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170085"></xptr>I detained her, but did not make any charge against her for five or ten minutes - the card of lace was in her hand rolled up in a handkerchief; she did not appear to be ill at the time. I took her to the watch-house myself, as I could not get a constable; I afterwards found she was very near her confinement; she was delivered in Newgate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not she pay for some things that she bought? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the poor woman say that she really did not know that she had it? A. I believe she did. I believe she was brought into Newgate the evening following, and confined almost immediately after she came in. I am in partnership with Gregory Cook.</p>

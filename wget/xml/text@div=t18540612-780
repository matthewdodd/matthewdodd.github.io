                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Stapleton, of Deptford—the prisoner was in the same service—he left on 2nd May—we had no quarrel while he was there. On Wednesday, 3rd May, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening, I was walking down little King-street—the prisoner was minding a barrow with some fish in it—he said to me, "Halloo, <hi rend="italic">Tom"</hi>—I said, "Halloo, <hi rend="italic">Dick"</hi>—he said, "How much did you give for them boots?"—I said, "Three pence"—he said, "Stapleton owes me a shilling; I shall ask him to let me have it, and buy a pair "—I said, "He don't owe you <hi rend="italic">no</hi> shilling;" he said, "You lie, you b—"—I said again that he did not; and then he picked up the knife off the fish board, that lay across the barrow, and threw it at me; it was a sort of a round throw—it hit me in the back, and stuck in it—I was walking round the barrow at the time—it made me bleed—I called out, "Oh! I am stabbed; I am stabbed!"—the prisoner came up to me, pulled the knife out, and said, "Don't say <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, I will give you a shilling"—I fainted away, and was taken to the doctor's, and then to the hospital, where I remained a fortnight.</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. Figg was brought to me by the policeman—he was very much exhausted from loss of blood—he had a wound on his right side, just about the sacrum—it was a severe wound and dangerous—I stopped the bleeding, and ordered him to be sent to the hospital immediately.</p>

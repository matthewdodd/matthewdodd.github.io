                  </hi>. I am a smith, and live at 17, Glasgow Terrace, Pimlico—about one o'clock on the morning of 28th October I was passing very close to Fox Court, Gray's Inn Lane—three men came up in front of me and stopped me by giving me blows—the prisoner is one of them; he struck me on the side of the nose, which is a broken nose now, and the one on the left side struck me in the upper lip, which knocked me down on the pavement and cut me on the back of my head—two of the men fell with me, and as they fell their hands were in my pockets directly—the third one laid on my feet, and as I tried to call "Police!" the one that laid on me bumped his head into my chest, so that every time I tried to hallo it stopped my breath and took my breath away—I have got the wounds now caused by the prisoner's fearful kicking in my trying to resist his hands from my pocket—he kicked me across the loins and across the back—I have twelve yards of bandage about me now—I had 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in a purse, and the ticket of my watch, which was in pawn in Bishopsgate Street—I had been out of work eight weeks—after they had taken my money, when I was just calling "Police!" the prisoner called out "Finish," or some such word, and I received two kicks at the back of my head, which took all my senses away till I found myself in the hospital—I was there for a fortnight—I am not able to work now—I have not been free from head<lb></lb>ache since.</p>

I took the prisoner into cus<lb></lb>tody on this night from information I received—I met the prosecutor in Gray's Inn Lane about half-past one, when he made a complaint to me—he pointed out the prisoner—he was rather the worse for liquor, or appeared so from being ill-treated by the prisoner—he knew what he was about—he pointed out the prisoner, and gave evidence at the station of what he had taken from him.</p>

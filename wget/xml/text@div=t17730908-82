(Looks at the will produced by the last witness) This is the will; he left it with me; I asked him if his name was Sterling, the executor named in the will; he said it was; I told him the nature of the oath, and took him before the surrogate, where he was sworn; he desired me to obtain the probate of it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Debel. This name is entered by myself in the book in the alphabet.</p>

               <p>Grant. From the direction of the executor: we always ask the executor what description we shall give the deceased; I had the description from Mr. Sterling - late of Tooting in the country of Surry, deceased.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he mention to you what the letter of attorney was for?</p>
               <p>Payne. No; the clerks at the South-Sea-House at my request filled up a letter of attorney; I delivered it to the messenger that he sent; the letter of attorney he told me was of no use.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it ever executed?</p>

               <p>Payne. He said the poor woman was dead the letter of attorney concerned; he told me she had made her will and appointed him her sole executor, he should have a probat in a few days, and that he would bring it to me, and get me to enter it at the South-Sea-House, to enable him to transfer the stock. On the 22d of February he brought me a probat; I took it to the South-Sea-House, and delivered it to Mr. Goodall the proper officer; on the 25th Mr. Sterling went to transfer this stock; he came to me at the Bank; he went with me to the proper offices, and the probat was delivered by Mr. Goodall. I transacted the business for him; he enquired the price; he approved of it, and made the bargain for 200 l. to Crofts at 84 7/9; to Jones 150 l. at 85.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether any dividends were received?</p>
               <p>Payne. Two half years; I was with him and saw him receive the money for the stock; I went with Mr. Sterling to Mess. Prescot's and Co. and saw him receive the draught given him for the stock by Mr. Crofts.</p>

               <p>My Lord, when your Lordship and the Jury consider the important slate of my life, I hope you will excuse me the trouble I have given you: the crime seems to be so fully proved upon me that it is in vain for me to make any defence. For the extenuation of it I can safely say at the time I committed the crime I did not mean a fraud either upon the Company or Mr. Crofts. I hope that in consideration of my youth, it being the first offence I ever committed; that the gentlemen of the jury will be pleased to recommend me to the mercy of the Court, and I would humbly hope that the Royal Clemency will be extended to me, though unusual upon these occasions.</p>

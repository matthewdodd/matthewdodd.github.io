On the 1st of December the prisoner came and had a glass of gin, which came to three halfpence farthing - he presented half a crown, I gave him 2 s. 4 1/2 d. in change; he then asked for a biscuit. While I turned to get one he pushed a bad<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010074"></xptr>shilling towards me, it was not the one I gave him. I am sure I heard it ring - it was bad. My master came out and said it was not the shilling I gave him. My master took two shillings, the good and bad one, and insisted on his giving up the other good shilling which I gave him. He ran to the door, my master secured him, and sent for an officer. Before the officer came I observed him shuffling with his hands behind him, close to a cask. Sheppard came, and took him into the parlour. I stooped behind the cask, and found a bag, which I offered to Sheppard, Mr. Parry took and kept it sometime, and then gave it to Sheppard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I wish to have either of them changed - A. No, but he pushed a shilling towards me, which I had not given him.</p>

            . I keep the King's Arms, and have frequently seen the prisoner at my house. I was at the back of the bar when Wood served him. I heard the sound of a bad shilling, immediately went out, and charged him with passing a bad shilling, telling him he had frequently served me that trick - he denied it. I said I was determined to have him searched. He ran to the door, I secured him, and took him into my back parlour, Moore brought in the bag, which contained five bad shillings. I took the 2 s. off the counter myself; one was good, and the other base, and gave them to Sheppard. Some good silver, consisting of a half-crown, a shilling, and some sixpences were found on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Could I drop the bag without your seeing me - A. He had his hands behind him, between the counter and the rum-puncheon.</p>

            , I saw a person leap over the fence into the street where I was, which I am very much acquainted with; I was about eight yards distance, I took him to be

             at that distance; I saw a light, but did not know the barn was on fire, there was a six foot paling that parted the sight, that I could not see so well, it was about half past ten at night, when he got over the pales, he ran about fifty yards, I stooped myself much, he was soon out of my sight, he ran a back way that goes into the church-yard, I called to the watchman; seeing a smoke in the barn, I judged it was on fire, the watchman and me went over the pales into Dr. Chandler's yard, I saw the fire very plain; at the front part of the barn, in the middle of the barn, away from the pales, there was a hole opposite, I handed three or four hats full of water.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever observe whether there was such a hole as that, before you saw the fire? - I cannot tell, the hole was very low down.</p>
               <p>Did you put out this fire? - Yes, we did, me and the watchman and the neighbours.</p>
               <p>Was any part of the barn burnt? - Yes, the bottom of the barn was blacked very much, there was a bit of wood that was among the rubbish.</p>
               <p>Was it a bit of wood that lay on the floor or a part of the floor? - The other witness knows more than I do, I do not take upon myself to say, from my own observation, whether any part of the barn was burnt; after we had extinguished the fire, we came out of the barn; I went and caught hold of the prisoner, and I said this is the coat, and this is the man, or else no man is him.</p>
               <p>You say you saw him eight yards from you? - Yes, at that time I thought it was the prisoner and no other man, I have known the prisoner 13 years, when I saw him come over the fence, I thought he was the man, afterwards when I saw him, I supposed him to be the same man that got over the pales; I challenged him with it, and caught hold of him; we apprehended him about a quarter of an hour after; he got over the fence, he ran fifty yards, he then got out of my sight, in turning the back way into the church-yard, which is a thoroughfare, the church-yard was a little better than fifty yards off, I challenged him with the fire; I did not hear him say any thing, he was about Hampton all the night; I did not take him into custody that night.</p>
               <p>Can you now, take upon yourself to swear that he was the man, that you saw leap over the fence? - He was to the best of my knowledge, not having hold of him, I am not so clear; I have known him thirteen years, but yet I cannot say whether it was him or not.</p>

Dr. Chandler thirteen years, there is a stable joining to the barn, the barn is a distance from the Doctor's house; I have known the barn thirteen years I was there on the 30th of June in the course of the day, I had observed there had been a fire; I left the premises about seven in the evening, there was a hole in the front of the barn that any body might put their arm in, it is a very old barn. I dare say it is 200 years old; I secured the barn when I left it, and every place was locked up, and there is an old fence, and the outside gates were locked up, it was perfectly safe, we never carry a candle there, not for many years, our horses are always done by day light: I took Denton to the magistrate, and he ordered me to take the prisoner, we went before Justice Taylor, the prisoner owned being in the yard and jumping over the pales, he owned that he saw the fire in the barn and he jumped over the pales and run into the church yard.</p>
               <p>Did the Magistrate take it in writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>No examination returned.</p>

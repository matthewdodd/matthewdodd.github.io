            . I live with my father, a hatter and hosier, in Holborn; on the 13th of November last, three women came into my father's shop; I followed three women; I supposed they were shop-lifters.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner one of them? - No; they crossed the way, just by Gray's inn-lane; there I saw the prisoner; then they joined at Staple's-inn-gate; they crossed from Gray's-inn-lane end to the opposite side to Staple's-inn-gate; two of them I saw put something into the prisoner's lap; I saw her receive it.</p>
               <p>Do you know Lloyd's shop? - Yes; it was about five hundred yards from it when she received them.</p>
               <p>It was at a considerable distance? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The Court told the jury the indictment was wrong; she was not instrumental to the larceny, if any offence, she ought to be indicted differently.</p>

               <p>What do you know of the prisoner's taking? - I don't know who took them; I lost two pair of silk stockings, with my private mark upon them. I saw them about a quarter of an hour before she was brought back; I was up stairs in my dining room; it was about four o'clock in the evening, coming into the shop, the stockings were gone, two pair, what we call span silk, with private marks upon them, one mine, one my son's, and a paper of cotton caps, which were gone likewise; men's night-caps, all of which were found in the prisoner's possession; I saw them taken out of her apron, in my parlour; my son seized her, and found these things in her possession; she said somebody gave them to her; first she said, she picked them up, at the magistrate's she said somebody gave them to her.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>

               <p>Mr. Williamson, jun. They are my marks; the paper of night-caps I tied up not two minutes before.</p>

               <p>Williamson, jun. On the 13th of November I tied up this paper of caps, and went into the yard; not long after the maid called me; there were three women in the shop, I saw them go out; I did not see the prisoner in the shop, I saw her receive them together with other things.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>You say you saw her receive them? - I did.</p>
               <p>Where? - Just at Staples-inn-gate I stopt her, and asked her what she had got?</p>
               <p>Gray's-inn-gate is above the bars? - Yes; and my father's is three doors from that.</p>

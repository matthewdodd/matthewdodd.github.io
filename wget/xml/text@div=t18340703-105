The prisoner was in my employ - his father came to me and said he had nothing for him to do, and would I take him; which I agreed to - I gave him 1s. for the two days - he came on Monday; and I was to ascertain what he was worth, and make an agreement with his father for his services - on the 16th of June, I sent him with a coat to the scourer; next morning, I sent him with a pair of trowsers, and he did not come back - on the Sunday morning, I went and found him in bed, and the duplicates were in his waistcoat pocket - I gave him in charge- the Lord Mayor suggested that the goods should be given up, to prevent his coming to trial, as the boy might become a bright man; but the pawnbroker being a servant, could not give them up - he had left me without notice, and I found him in bed.</p>

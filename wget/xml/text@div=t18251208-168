The prisoner came to our shop on the 19th of November, and asked to look at a small hunting-watch, which hung in the window. I shewed it to him with a seal, and said the two would come to 3l. 5s., and which he agreed to give - he offered me this note in payment, it is payable to Messrs. Bernard, Savory and Co. Bankers, London, Dated, 12th July, 1825, for 5l. I said it was a country note - he said it was payable in London I sent my servant out to get change for it, which she brought. I gave the prisoner 1l. 15s. in change, and he took away the goods; next morning but one, the note was returned to me, and I was told it was good for nothing.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CARRINGTON. Q. The prisoner came and asked to purchase a watch and seal for 3l. 5s. and he agreed to give you that? A. Yes; having so agreed I gave him the watch and seal to keep, and he gave me the note in payment - such notes are commonly taken. I took it and gave him change - he went away with the goods with my approbation.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If you had not believed the note good, and genuine, of course you would not have let him had the goods? A. No - I put no mark on the note.</p>

            . I am a stationer, and live at No. 17, Little Queen-street, Holborn. The prisoner came to my house on Tuesday, November, the 8th, and asked me if I could engrave a plate for a promissory note in the course of that week, from a copy which he left me, which I have not got here - he told me it was for a new Bank that was then going to commence. I engraved the plate from the copy he left, and by his orders, I printed five hundred. I have received some letters from Bath, but I have not communicated with the prisoner on the subject of them - there is no one here from Bath; this note is one of my engraving by his order. I think he gave me 3l. 11s. for them. I had not made any inquiry whether there was such a Bank forming, as I had not the least suspicion, till he called for the five hundred, paid for them immediately, and gave me a further order to take the five out, and put a two in, to make 2l. notes, to save the expence of another plate; he had called on the Saturday evening, and had four or five notes, and on the Monday he had the remainder. I never engraved a plate precisely similar to this for any body else.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You employ people to engrave these things when they are ordered, and if a man wanted a cheque plate, or a draft plate, it is quite in the way of your trade? A. Yes; he ordered the 5 to be taken out, and a 2 put in, which is quite a common thing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you ever been to Bath to inquire if there is such a firm as Hobhouse, Wright and Hunter there? A. No - I wrote, and have the letter I received in answer.</p>

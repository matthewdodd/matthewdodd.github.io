On the 17th of August they were let out about eleven o'clock. I missed them about three, they never strayed above one hundred yards or so from the house. I searched for them, but could not find them till the 19th when they were at the Coach and Horses, public-house, near Smithfield. I knew all four of them - the prisoner who was a stranger, was in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you any mark on them? A. Yes; on one - a bit was cut off his ear. There was nothing to hinder their straying, but they never did.</p>

            . I am a cow-keeper, and live in Lock's-fields, near to Wheeler. I knew, on the 17th, that he had lost his pigs, and on Friday the 19th, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was in Smithfield-market, and saw four pigs in a pen by themselves, and knew them to be Wheeler's - the prisoner stood by them. I said - "You have got some very nice pigs there;" he said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150116"></xptr>Yes. I went and informed the officer, and returned to the pen with him, and asked the prisoner what he wanted for the pigs; he said 5 l., or guineas, I do not know which. I offered 4 l. He said he could take no such money, for they cost him more. I then gave charge of him. He said he had bought them at Brentford, and did not take sufficient notice of the person to describe him; they looked very thin, but were not much altered.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you certain they were Wheeler's? A. I knew them immediately; I had no mark on them - they used to run about before my gate. I turn my own out in the same way, and never lost them. The prisoner said he got them from a man named Davis, or some such name. I should think them worth 5 l., or guineas.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was in the market on the 19th of August. Harvey fetched me to the pens - the prisoner was there. Harvey asked the price of the pigs; he said 5 l., or guineas. I said "They are stolen, and I shall take you." He said, he and another person bought them down below Brentford. I did not hear him mention the person's name whom he bought them of.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Matthews to the pen - the prisoner said they were his pigs - and after we took him to the public-house, I heard him say, he bought them near Brentford, of a man with a tilted cart, and a net over it, but did know his name or residence. He said there was another person with him, who saw him buy them. I had apprehended one Davis at that time in Smithfield, on suspicion of being concerned; he saw Davis - and said, he was the person who was with him, at the time he bought them. Davis was discharged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you discharge him. A. He was examined three times. Brentford is about eight miles from Hyde-park corner.</p>

            . I live in Canister-street, and have known the prisoner eight or nine months; he was in the habit of buying pigs and sheep, and selling them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where has he bought any? A. I have seen him take part of a sheep about for sale. His mother is a laundress, and lived in Bedfordbury, and has now moved to Lambeth. I was never present when he bought any cattle, or killed any. I think I know of his killing one sheep at Lambeth-marsh. I have seen him with live sheep, I do not know when - and have seen friends buy meat of him.</p>

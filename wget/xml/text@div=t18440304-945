                  </hi>. I was in a public-house on the morning of the 28th of Feb., I saw Mrs. Fitzhenry there, sitting on a form with her head hanging down, the same as if she was in a faint—I saw both the prisoners there to<lb></lb>gether—I saw Dipnell lift up Mrs. Fitzhenry's cloak and put her hand into her pocket—she was sitting behind the bar, and nobody was in her company but the prisoners—there was some men at the bar—I was sitting opposite Mrs. Fitzhenry—Simpkins was standing at the table with her hands under her own shawl—it was about half-past one o'clock—in about a quarter of an hour I saw Dipnell go to Mrs. Fitzhenry again—she rubbed her hand over her face as if she was trying to recover her, and then Dipnell untied her cloak, took it off and took it out—Simpkins staid there till Dipnell came back—Simpkins was very tipsy—I went and told the barmaid—when Dipnell came back she called for half a pint of liquor, and gave it to the men who were there—Mrs. Fitzhenry seemed to be asleep—I went and awoke her—she recovered herself and came and said to Dipnell, "Pray tell me what you have done with my cloak, if you have pawned it and will give me the ticket I will redeem it, I dare not go home without it, my husband will be so angry"—Dipnell denied having it—I said she was the person who took the cloak, and a policeman was sent for—several persons who were there asked Dipnell for the ticket—she said she knew nothing about the ticket nor the cloak—this is the cloak.</p>

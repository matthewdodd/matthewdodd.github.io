               <p>THOMAS BUNN. The prisoner was apprehended, and brought to my house; Painter charged her with having received two handkerchiefs - no threat or promise was held out to her; she readily acknowledged it, and said if I would allow her to withdraw she would fetch me one of them, and show me what it was; I never gave Painter authority to sell or give away any property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. He has robbed you pretty extensively? A. It is impossible to say, but I have my fears; I had the best of characters with him from his parents - I have examined my stock, and miss the description of goods which he says he has taken, which are gloves, silks, handkerchiefs, and fans; I missed several chequed and figured handkerchiefs and stripes - I cannot tell how many; they were of various colours - the prisoner answered readily all questions put to her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she give you any information of receiving goods from him before he was taken? A.No.</p>

            . I was four months in Mr. Bunn's employ; the prisoner asked me for a silk handkerchief - she first asked me where I lived - I told her, and then she asked if I could not get her a handkerchief - I did not take any notice that day; she asked me again the next day - she was in St. Martin's-le-Grand, selling fruit - she told me to take it into Panyer-alley, Newgate-street; I took one handkerchief and took it there - she was waiting at the corner of the alley; as I went down she followed me, and asked if I had got it - I gave it to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080116"></xptr>her; I believe she gave me 2d. for it - I told my father of it the last day of July: on the 1st of August she was taken up and brought to master's connting-house - I charged he with receiving a handkerchief of me - she said she had received one, and a piece of ribbon which she had round her neck, and that the handkerchief was at home; it was a new silk one, with a pink stripe - I did not bring is back to master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Was she in custody when she was questioned? A. Yes; she was not at large afterwards; I cannot tell what it would sell for, perhaps, 3s. or 4s. - There was a private mark on it, which I do not understand - I was sent home to my father's, to be forthcoming on the Monday morning, and to tell my father about it; I said nothing to my father till I was turned away - he turned me away because he missed some gloves - he said there must be some receiver, and I was to tell my father every thing.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How came you to be concerned? A. I married this boy's mother - I do not recollect that she said she had no idea of the boy stealing it, or any thing of that kind; I never heard such a declaration.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner at a stall in St. Martin's-le-Grand; I brought her to Mr. Bunn's - Painter was present, and so was Carr; but I did not hear the conversation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You are in the habit of passing by St. Martin's-le-Grand? A. Yes; I have seen her selling fruit there ever since the New Post-office was opened - I did not tell her the charge.</p>

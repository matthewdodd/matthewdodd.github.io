                  </hi>. I am a labourer of Westminster—the prisoner is my mother—on 8th July, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening, I went to Old Pye Street, Westminster, to see a young girl—my mother came to the door—another woman opened it and said "Johnnie, it is your mother"—I said "Don't let her in"—but she came in and fell on the floor in a fainting fit—she recovered and then we had a quarrel—I tried to get the young woman out of the room—my mother seized a large carving knife which was on the table and tried to stab me two or three times—I got her by the wrist and she <hi rend="italic">Jobbed</hi> me twice in the face with the knife—I went to the hospital and it was sewed up—it is not well yet—I gave her in custody that night.</p>

               <p>he said "Go out of the room," and I went into the yard, and a little girl came and spoke to me—I did not see him take the prisoner by the throat and strike her.</p>

I am a physician, of Cavendish-square—I saw the prisoner on 17th October, and have not seen him since—his state of mind on 17th October was not such as to enable him to reason or form a judgment upon matters—he is a man of undoubtedly very weak intellect—I have heard from the steward the description of what took place on this occasion, and, judging from what I have observed of his state, and his own description of the circumstances which led to the assault, I have no doubt that he was not at the time in a condition to appreciate in a healthy way what he was doing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Walter Cheeseley, 8, Westrop Villas, Canonbury—on Saturday night, 16th Feb., I shut up the house and closed the windows about 7 o'clock—I went round at 11 to see that everything; was right before going to bed—the following morning I found the top sash of the shutter was broken open and some one had been in and broken open, two workboxes—I found a lot of papers lying about the floor—some had been burnt—3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was taken out of a little box, but afterwards we found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the floor—I identify the table-cover produced—the window had been pushed back, the top sash had been pushed down, and they got in over the shutters.</p>

On the 16th I examined Mr. Cheeseley'8 house—the catch of the window had been pushed back and some one had pulled down the top sash and climbed over the shutters—three boxes had been opened and an attempt had been made to force open a door leading to another part of the house—the window opens into the front garden—some one had been to the back and tried to get in, and had then come round to the front.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective</hi>). I was on duty at half-past 6 on Sunday evening, 16th Feb., in Commercial Street, and saw the prisoner with another man—as he appeared bulky, I stopped him, and asked him what he had about him—he said "Nothing"—I told him I believed he had—I took him by the collar and unbuttoned his coat, when this table-cover fell down under my feet—I asked him how he accounted for possession of it—I asked who</p>

               <p>gave it to him—he said the other man gave it to him—I told him I was a police officer and should take him in custody for unlawful possession of it—he resisted violently, and I got him to the station with difficulty—when charged at the station he said, "I picked it up at Spitalfields Church, and was going to bring it to the police-station"—the other man escaped.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate.</hi> "Coming round Spital-fields Church out of George Street, at 20 minutes past 6, a man ran round, and I saw him drop this thing. I stood still a moment to know what to do, and I picked it up, and a man passing I asked his opinion what I should do, and he advised me to have nothing to do with it. I said I should take it to the station, and being Sunday night I didn't like to carry it openly, and put it under my coat, and at a stone's throw from the station I met the constable, and he asked me what I had got, I said what was that to do with him. He took me by the collar and said that I had something that did not belong to me, and not knowing he was a policeman I resisted him. He said then that he was a policeman, and I said I was going to take the thing to the station, but as he was an officer I would go with him, and I went. At the station I told them I picked it up, and said nothing about a man giving it to me."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a servant, and live with Benjamin Hall. On the 30th of July I met the prisoner in Edgeware-road, about half-past eleven o'clock, or after—I was not quite sober—I entered into conversation with her—I cannot say whether she spoke to me first, or I to her—I took her to my room over the stable, in Old Church-street, Paddington—I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we went to bed together, about twelve o'clock—I awoke about four o'clock the next morning, and she was gone—I looked on the table, and missed my watch—I went to the next room, and saw there was a shirt taken off the back of the chair, and this waistcoat—the watch was found—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>).</p>

I cannot swear it—lam sure she did not drink half-a-crown's worth of gia, because I had not so much in my pocket-when I went to the public-house I had about eightpence or ninepence—I was not sober when I went into the public-house—I was sober when I went to the first public-house—I there spent about eighteenpence—I had half-a-crown when I went there.</p>

On Saturday, the 4th of August, I met the prisoner in Devonshire-street, Marylebone—that was some five days after this occurred—I told her I wanted her—she said, "For what?"—I said, "For robbing that man you went home with on Monday night"—she said, "It could not be me"—I said, "You are the person I saw in company with him"—she said, "I was not out on Monday night"—I took her to the station-house, and just before I got there she asked if she could see the man privately—I asked, "What man?"—she said the man she was with on Monday night—I said, What do you want to see him for?"—she made no answer—she again said, "Can I speak to him?" I said, "What do you want to speak to him for?"—she said, "I know nothing about any thing but the watch"—I said, "Don't you know about the other things?"—she said, "No"—I said, "If you know about the watch, you must know about the other things"—she then said that she had got the shirt at home, and the waistcoat her husband had got—I went to her room with her, and she gave me the duplicate of the watch, which was sewn up in a window-curtain—I have the shirt and waistcoat.</p>

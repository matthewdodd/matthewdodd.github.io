                  </hi>. I live at 7, Chapman's-place, St. George's, and am a labourer—I was standing in Cable-street on the night of 27th March, a little after 10—some men were having a disturbance at the Shovel public-house—there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with some Germans—I went to see what was the matter, when Hill struck me on the shoulders—some people were coming along, and I showed them the cut—my coat was cut through—it was not a serious wound—I saw Coleman brandishing a knife—about three minutes after I was struck—I afterwards saw Pounceby, who had been struck—I do not know who wounded him.</p>

Q.</hi> Were you in the public-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—no man was with me—I did not see an Englishman strike Pounceby—I was struck in the street—Coleman, Hill, and another man, were in the street—the three were standing in a row—I was half a yard in front of them—Coleman was close to me at the time I was stabbed—I saw some men quarrelling together, and three men run down an alley—they were pursued by some other men—I don't know what countrymen they were—the brand<lb></lb>ishing took place after that—all the people who went down the court after the men, turned and ran back—Pounceby pulled me back, and I pulled Pounceby back—I saw some Germans at the top of the court brandishing knives—the police went down about three minutes after that—the Germans then were in a house at the bottom of the court—there were then about thirty or forty people standing about—when the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> commenced, there were but six or so—I had no knife on that day—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my sister's knife—I don't know a person named Able—I never told him or any<lb></lb>body else that they had got the wrong men—Pounceby was quite a stranger to me—I didn't see the beginning of the <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I found the men quarrelling outside.</p>

Having lost several things in the brewery, I suspected him. On Saturday morning, the 5th of February. I missed a bag from a desk, which had been locked. I had seen it two or three days before; it contained a sovereign, five shillings, and twelve sixpences. I made no enquiries about it, but discharged him on Saturday evening, and had a man waiting at the gate to apprehend him; he brought him back to the counting-house. I desired him to empty his pockets: he then brought out a few shillings; I asked him to let me see if I could find the money; I found the bag in his left-hand pocket, with the sovereign in it: it is a farmer's sample bag, with a P marked on it. I have no doubt of it being mine. I then said, "My lad, this is not all." He then pulled from his pocket seven shillings, twelve sixpences, and two half-crowns; the two half-crowns and two shillings my brother had paid him as his wages.</p>

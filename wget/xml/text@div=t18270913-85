            . I am the prosecutrix's son. I had just left my mother, when the reticule was taken - I had seen the prisoner and another person going across the fields, about ten minutes before the reticule was snatched; I am certain the prisoner was one of the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were not they before you? A. They passed us and went into the road to Clapton - I saw their faces as they passed within about two yards of us- I saw their side faces when I left my mother - I saw them again coming towards the stile where she was - they passed by me very quiet - the other man had a different face to this man; but I cannot describe his face.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you before the Magistrate the next day? A. Yes; I saw the prisoner there then; I had no doubt of his being one of them.</p>

            . I am a cow-keeper, and live at Clapton. On the 16th of July, I heard the cry of Stop thief! in the fields - I went a few yards, and saw the prisoner and another coming towards me - I asked them what was the matter; one of them said, "We have only been having a bit of fun with the lady;" the prisoner made to go past me, but I collared him; the other jumped over the bank and got away - there was no other person near; the lady and the young gentleman had been pursuing them, and crying Stop thief! for I suppose, fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It might be the other one who said, "I have been having a bit of fun with the lady?" A. No; it was we have been having some fun with the lady; I did not see the reticule; the lady did say at first, that she thought the prisoner was one of the men, or something to that purpose.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did she say so? A. When I had hold of the man's collar, she was quite in a flurry, but when she recovered herself, she said he was with the thief.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Being rather unwell I left home to take a walk - on my way home I went across this field, as the prosecutrix has stated - I stopped to look at the corn; a young man came up, and we were discoursing, I dare say for two or three minutes; this lady came by - as I was turning down a lane, I heard the cry of Stop thief! and I saw the young man who had been speaking to me rush by me - I put out my hand to stop him, but he got by - I told the witness who came up to stop him, but he let him go, being a man nearly his own size, and took me - the lady came up, and he asked if I was the person, she said No - he said, "Shall I let him go?" she said No - I believe he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130076"></xptr>was with the other, but stop till my son comes up - the young gentleman then came up, and said he believed I was the person.</p>

               <p>Seven witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger. I have two shops; one of them is in Lawrence-lane, and the prisoner, who is my apprentice, managed that—I employed Mr. Stevens to go to that shop and make some pur<lb></lb>chases—I gave him a list of articles and some money—it was the pri<lb></lb>soner's duty to make an entry in the book of all sales, in separate articles, and to bring me the money of the day's receipts—on the 1st of April he brought me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as the receipts of the day—the book, which is in his hand-writing, states that he had received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., omitting 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a pair of hinges that Stevens bought—here is the list of articles I gave to Stevens.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Thomas-street, Clerkenwell. On the 1st of April, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I went to the, prosecutor's shop, and saw the prisoner—I purchased two locks and several other things, amongst which was a pair of hinges—this paper con<lb></lb>tains the account—the whole came to 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I paid him 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he would not take the 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he did not enter these things in any book in my presence.</p>

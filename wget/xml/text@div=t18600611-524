                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, D</hi> 214). On Saturday evening, 14th April, I was on duty in Cumberlaud-street, Bryanston-square, about a quarter past 8—I saw the dining-room window of No. 43, Cumberland-street open—I knocked at the door, the female witness came to the door and answered me, and while we were talking, a man who is not now in custody, came from a room, he said that he was engaged by the gentleman of the house—not feeling satisfied, I was about to push him backwards in the hall to secure him, when he sprang past me; I caught hold of his coat and we struggled together in the road for a minute or two—the two prisoners came up close alongside of me, and I saw them take from their coat sleeves a life-preserver each—they first hit me on the lower part of my back, then twice on my head—before that, when the man was on the ground, be called out, "Give it to the b----" it was after that that they took out their life-preservers—Green struck me first and Thomas afterwards—I turned round and said, "You are striking, the wrong one"—I thought they had come to assist me—they all three then made their escape—my head was cut open—I was unable to attend to my duty till 27th April—I am quite sure the prisoners are the two men that struck me—we were close by a lamp.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a groom in the service of a gentleman of 37, Great Cumberland-street—On the evening of 14th April I was outside the area gate three doors off from 43, the numbers run odd there—it was about a quarter past 8; I saw two men walking up and down on the same side as 43—after I had seen them walking up and down I saw a struggle going on in the street between a policeman and some man—I saw the two men go up to them, and all of a sudden I saw the fall of a stick or some instrument, and then I looked round and saw three men running away and the other lying on the ground—I am able to speak to Thomas with certainty, he was the last to run away; as he was running he made a stumble in the road and his hat fell off, he came rolling against me and said to me, "I will catch the b----s"—I said, "Yes, do"—I thought he was a <hi rend="italic">swell</hi> running after them, they were running on in front—he was close to me when he picked his hat up—he ran after the other two as fast as he could go, when he had picked his hat up—I then went to assist the man who was on the</p>

               <p>ground; I found he was a policeman—his head was streaming with blood all over the pavement—Green is very much like the other man that I saw, but I cannot swear to him—he did not come close to me, Thomas did; I saw him again on the Tuesday week following, at the Marylebone police-court, and recognized him as soon as I walked in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> He was where the prisoners stand I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there were four oi them there—when I saw him in the street he had a hat and a loose coat on, and he looked like a <hi rend="italic">swell</hi>—I am not aware that I had ever seen him before—I was not in employment at that time—I wag standing outside the gate—I am in tho employ of Mr. Franks, the banker-there was a gas-lamp about five yards off at the corner of the Mews—Thomas bad a hat on, the others had caps, one had a velvet cap—I am quite sure that both the others wore caps—I described the men to the policeman, he came and told me that he had caught them, and I went to the police-court and saw them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Green. Q.</hi> How far were you off from this affair when it happened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It could not be far off, it was only three doors—I did not notice what sort of dress you wore—I don't know whether it was the same you have on now—the men ran past where I was standing—I, thought at first that they were drunken men struggling—I did not see that one of them was a policeman at first, it was done ail in a minute—if I had known what you were up to I should have ran after you and made an alarm—you threatened my life at the police-court when you were going out.</p>

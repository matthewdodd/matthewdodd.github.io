On the night of 5th Feb., I went to bed about 12 o'clock; the house was fastened up, and the shutters secure—about 5 o'clock in the morning I heard a violent concussion; I got up, and examined the back and front doors, but finding them secure, went to bed again—I did not examine the shop window—I was subsequently called by the police, and found the window broken, and a number of goods gone—one shutter was sprung over the other, the bar forced out, and the glass broken—the persons had only put their hands in—the window was marked with blood, and so were some of the tickets—I missed seventy-eight rings, some watches, pencil cases, and watch keys, value about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they have not all been recovered—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are a por<lb></lb>tion of them—they are my property.</p>

On 6th Feb., I was on duty at New Cross Road, Deptford, nearly a mile from the prosecutor's premises—Mar<lb></lb>getson was with me—I saw the three prisoners about a quarter past 5 o'clock in the morning, going in the direction of London—another policeman named Edmunds came up, and we went down Five Bell Lane, into the high road again, about a quarter of a mile further up; we watched the prisoners come up, and then walked out in front of them. I took Bailey, and asked him where he came from, he said, "From the docks." I said, "What docks?" He said, "Below," moving his hand in the direction of Deptford—I asked him where he lived; he said, "In the Borough"—I asked him what he had about him; he said, "Nothing"—I put my hand into his right hand coat pocket, and took out this silver watch, and a quantity of rings; four dropped on the ground, I picked up two of them at the time, and afterwards went and picked up one, and another constable picked up another—I searched his left pocket, and found a quantity more rings, in all forty-two—I asked him how he accounted for the possession of this property; he said, "We picked it up near a horse trough at a public house; did we not, Ben.!" Williams replied, "Yes"—when we came past the Marquis of Granby, he said, "This is where we picked it up; did not we, <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi>?" Williams replied, "Yes"—I looked at Bailey's hand, it was cut, and from some remarks which I made to him, he said, "I have met with an accident on the road, as we have just come from Chatham across Blackheath."—I found this handkerchief saturated with blood (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) round his hand; I also found on him a knife, a key, and a pen knife.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. This man had worked some time for you? - About a twelve-month.</p>

               <p>Had you a man of the name of Sullivan?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090095"></xptr>- Yes; he is absent since this happened.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner tell you that Sullivan had brought these things to him, and told him to nail them up against the windows, by your order; and that he would bring him from time to time, such stuff as was necessary? - He made that plea at the justice's.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that before, or after he had told you he was at your mercy? - After.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. This conversation was the 30th of June? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was not in custody till the 19th of August? - No; he set off.</p>
               <p>Did not he send to you, to pay the wages due to him, after he set off? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who did he send? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What answer did you give? - I gave no answer.</p>
               <p>Yes, you did; did not you say you would pay nobody but the man himself? - I believe he sent by his wife; I told her I should settle no bills but with him.</p>

               <p>And did not he come there? - He did.</p>
               <p>At the distance of a month after you had charged him? - Yes.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. On Saturday night, the 16th of February, about half-past ten o'clock, I was walking with my wife in Hackney-road (which is a great thoroughfare) going to market—it was a dark night—we were going towards Cotton-gardens, which are opposite my house—we were crossing the road, and when we were within about ten feet of the curb-stone, I heard the re<lb></lb>port of a gun or pistol out of Cotton-gardens, and my wife fell down, and cried out that her leg was broken—I went to lift her up, and found the blood flowing from her—I took her into my own house with assistance—two sur<lb></lb>geons came, and from their recommendation she was taken to the London Hospital within twenty minutes of this happening—she remained there till Thursday, at eleven o'clock, and then died—her name was Bridget.</p>

I was on duty in Hackney. road, on the 16th of February—in consequence of information I went to No. 4, Cotton-gardens, and knocked at the door, the prisoner opened it—I asked him if he had fired off a gun or pistol that night—he said, "No"—I then asked if he had any in the house, he said, "Yes," and called to his younger brother up stairs, who brought down this gun—I asked him to show it me, which he did, and it smelt of powder very strongly, as if re<lb></lb>cently discharged—I went away for four or five minutes, returned, left him in care of my brother officer, went up stairs, and then found the gun had been put behind the bed—I found some powder and shot there—on the Monday following he was brought to Worship-street office—Mr. Broughton cautioned him not to say any thing, unless he liked, as it would be brought against him—I believe this to be Mr. Broughton's hand<lb></lb>writing—this was taken at the time the prisoner was examined—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"The prisoner says, I stood in my own garden when I fired it off—I fired at a cat—it was the first time I ever fired it off with a ball—I am very sorry for what I have done."</p>

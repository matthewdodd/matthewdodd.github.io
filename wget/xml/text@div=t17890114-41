               <p>On Christmas day last, about a quarter past two in the morning, (I am a watchman in Hosier-lane) I met the prosecutor; he was out of order; very drunk. I took him in hand, in order to take him home; and I waited till the patrole came by; the prisoner, who is a patrole, came by. I kept the prosecutor till he came; and I told him I had a drunken man in my box; he said I had no right to keep him in my box. I assisted him to get home, near to Cow-lane; he said he lived in <placeName id="t17890114-41-crimeloc194">Fox and Hart Court</placeName>

We took him there, and laid him down in the court to rest; in two or three minutes afterwards, the prisoner came behind him, as he was laying on the flags in the court, and put his hand under the prosecutor's leather-apron, and put his hand in his pocket, and took something out, and put it in his own coat-pocket; then he lay the man down, and said to me, go you on your duty, and I'll go on mine; he went about ten or twelve yards, and I said, are you going to leave the man there, and take the money out of his pocket for your own use; he said he knew nothing of the money; I said, give the man his money, and help me home with him: he denied it; and I took him by the collar, and brought him about five or six yards; and he struggled, and d - d the man, and said he knew nothing about the money. I said you had better give the poor man his money; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140055"></xptr>said, I have got it, and I'll give it to you; well, says I, let's see how much it is; I said, had you any of your own; no, says he, only three farthings; he then took out the half-crown and four-pence, and said, here, you take it; no, says I, go and put it into the man's pocket; no, says he; and my lanthorn was open, and he put it in. I then asked him to help me with the man home, and he did; we found it out, and I gave his wife the money. The prisoner was present.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you tell his wife where you had got that money? - I did not. The prisoner came away with me past my box, and said he took it only to keep it safe for the owner. At three o'clock he left me at my box, and went to his duty. The next day being boxing-day, I would not report him before, that he might have his Christmas-boxes; a day or two after that, I did report him to Mr. Ashford, and he was afterwards taken up. I would not have believed it, unless I had seen it, if a hundred had told me. I have known him five years, and always thought the prisoner was an honest man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. Upon your oath, was you sober or drunk? - Upon my oath, I was sober, I was no more drunk than I am now.</p>
               <p>Do you know Hollingsworth, a watchman? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Did he see you that night? - Yes, I believe.</p>
               <p>Do you know Carty? - No, nor M'Carty.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner pay the money to the woman? - No; I did.</p>
               <p>Do not you know Marlow has worked for the prisoner's brother? - I heard so.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner tell you he would have you fined for having a drunken man in your box? - He did.</p>
               <p>You told him you would give a charge in the watch book against him? - That was when he refused giving me the money.</p>
               <p>Then you never reported him? - I never mentioned it to any body, till I told Mr. Ashford.</p>
               <p>How long has he been patrole? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>For some years? - No, no years.</p>
               <p>As long as you have been a watchman? - Not a quarter of the time.</p>

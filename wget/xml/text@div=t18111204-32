On the 3d of the present month, between five and six o'clock, a person came into my shop and asked if I had lost any thing; I answered I was not conscious of having lost just at that time; he asked me if I should know my own goods; I answered in the affirmative. Then another man came in with a bundle, which I recognised to be my goods.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Tuesday coming up Wood-street, between five and six in the evening, I saw the prisoner turn out of Wood-street into Clements-court, about four yards down the court he stooped down and wrapped something up; I stepped up to him and said, my friend, what have you got here; he said, nothing but my own; he seemed to be going off in a great hurry; I said, stop, I have not done with you yet, what have you got; he said, stockings. I put my hand upon the bundle and felt buttons; I said, come along with me, or tell me where you got these things; he said, I will shew you the man; we went on a few yards; I said, where does this man live; he said he could not find him. I then said you have stole these things; he then said he had them of them little boys. I asked one of the boys, he said he did not know any thing of him. I took him into a public-house and opened the bundle; I then took him to the Compter. I went afterwards to Mr. Romanis, he claimed the property.</p>

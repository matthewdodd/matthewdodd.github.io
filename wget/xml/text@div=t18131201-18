It appeared to me to be a whole sheep. I asked him where they got the sheep from; they told me out of Mr. Vass's field. I asked him if it was Mr. Vass's sheep; he said, no; they were taken into grass. He begged forgiveness, and that I would not take him before the magistrate on account of his wife and family; he said it was the first time, and the only sheep he ever had. After I had secured Luck, I secured Taylor; they both begged for mercy; they both informed me it was the first sheep they ever had taken, and the only one.

Walsh and I went to search for the two skins; we first of all called upon Champion, Mr. Vass's bailiff; I asked him whether he had any sheep laying near the ground of Mr. Wilson; he said, yes. The prisoners had described down by Mutton-lane, near Mr. Wilson's; they told me the sheep lay in a field near Mr. Wilson's. We counted the sheep eighty-eight; we searched about for the skins; we could not find it. We could see the places where two different sheep had been killed. After missing two sheep by the shepherd's account, the constable and I went to Taylor's house; Taylor's house is about three quarters of a mile across the fields from where the sheep were; we searched his house; in a sort of a back house there, we found a sheep cut up, and salted down in a large red pan.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the same morning - A. Yes; the mutton was cut in pieces not bigger than a pound and a half or two pounds, not at all as a butcher would cut. The meat was quite warm in the middle of the pan.</p>
               <p>Q. What hour in the morning was this - A. Between nine and ten; the meat was pressed very tight in the pan, and the pan was covered over with a top, and the cover was made of red earth, the same as the pan, it fitted close; there was a bloody sack just by it. I said to Taylor, you told me you had only one sheep, and you also said, you had thrown the skin into a dell hole; he then said, they had throwed the skins into the brow of the hedge, and Champion found them there; in the mean time we went to Mr. Walsh's Champion found them; I left him in search of them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Champion. Where did you find the skins - A. I found them under the brow of a hedge near Mutton-lane, in Mr. Wilson's field; I carried the skins to Mr. Walsh's, the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. to Dawkins. I understood you to say that Taylor said it was the only sheep that then they had taken - A. They both said so; they were both present. When I searched Taylor's house, Taylor was not there; he was in custody with Luck, at Walsh's, the constable. I saw Taylor's wife, I knew it was his house; I enquired; the person that told me said it was Taylor's house, and he said, that is Taylor's wife; she said, she was not. I was with his wife at the house; I never was there with Taylor. He was a prisoner from the time I took him until he was committed. Walsh was with me when I went to Taylor's house.</p>

               <p>MR. EMMITT. I accompanied Dawkins about two o'clock, Sunday morning last; the two prisoners came up, I assisted Dawkins in stopping them; Luck had the sack with the sheep in it. After the prisoners were secured, I took the sheep on my back; I carried it near three miles to Mr. Dawkins's house; about seven o'clock we took the prisoners to Mr. Walsh's house. I was left in custody with them.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed when you apprehended the prisoners - A. Luck said, he had the sheep from Mr. Vass's field. They both begged forgiveness of the crime.</p>
               <p>MR. WALSH. I am a constable of Barnet. Dawkins and Emmitt brought these two prisoners to my house about seven o'clock in the morning; when Dawkins and his partner brought them, the prisoners said they had brought the sheep from Mr. Vass's field, near Mr. Wilson's; we searched about the field; we could not find them. We saw where two sheep had been killed; when we discovered two sheep had been killed, we went to Taylor's house as Dawkins has described before, and after we had taken the meat from Taylor's house, we took the two prisoners before the magistrate. I have had the skins in my custody ever since; these are the skins; I received them from Champion.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I branded the hips, on the off hip with the letter B. and here is the B. on the off hip on both these skins; to the best of my knowledge they are my skins.</p>
               <p>Champion. The marks on the skins are exactly the same as the others.</p>
               <p>Luck's Defence. We did it for want; we were greatly in distress.</p>
               <p>Taylor's Defence. I have got four small children. I was greatly in distress. I had my rent to pay; I did not know which way to get a bit of bread.</p>

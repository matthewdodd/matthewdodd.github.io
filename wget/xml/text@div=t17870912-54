             sworn.</p>
               <p>I found my property in the prisoner's possession; I cannot tell the day of the month; I lost it from the house where I lodge; there was a pair of buckles, a pair of stockings and a pair of garters; they had been in my room; the prisoner and I lodged in one house together; we had separate rooms, and my landlady had them in care; she told me they were lost, and I found them in his possession when he was taken up; her name is Connolly; she is not here; he was taken up at Bartholomew-fair, and he had the stockings on, and the buckles in his shoes; I knew them to be mine; I have had the buckles four years and had them at sea with me; he acknowledges he took them.</p>
               <p>- FORSYTH sworn.</p>
               <p>I received charge of the prisoner at Bartholomew-fair on the 4th of September, for receiving stolen goods, and I took him to the compter; the next day he was taken before Alderman Crosby, at Guildhall; and when I came before him, I found this property on him. (Producing the things which were mentioned in the indictment.) And the prosecutor swore to them; he had the stockings on, and the buckles in his shoes, he confessed he took them out of the room.</p>
               <p>(The things were deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I bought that there property about a month ago; I work at the water-side, and I wanted a pair of stockings, and coming round Tower-hill, I bought those stockings, and I bought the buckles at the same time; I bought them of a woman who I do not know, and who is not here.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called twelve witnesses to his character, three of whom were sworn and examined, and gave him a good character.</p>

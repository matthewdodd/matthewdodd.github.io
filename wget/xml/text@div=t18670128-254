                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 22, Fort Road, Wil<lb></lb>low Walk, Bermondsey—on Thursday morning, the 24th of January, I was in the New Kent Road, about twenty or twenty-five minutes past twelve—the prisoners knocked me down, and Gilbert took my shawl while Morley held me—I do not know which one knocked me down—they came up from behind me—Gilbert ran away with my shawl, and then Morley ran round by the barracks in the New Kent Road—this is the shawl (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it.</p>

I saw Teddeman on this morning, I took Gilbert, and took this shawl from under his coat—I asked him where he got it—he said he picked it up in the New Kent Road—I told him I should take him in custody for knocking a female down and stealing a shawl from her—he said, "You are wrong"—his coat was not buttoned, but he held it as close as he could to him—I could see that he had got the shawl under it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a citizen of Melbourne, and am at present staying at 8, Heath Terrace, Lewisham—on the night of 26th March, about 11 o'clock. I was at the entrance of the Cannon Street Station of the South Eastern Railway in company with my cousin—the prisoner came up and spoke to me—I referred him to the officials—as I was passing the barriers constable spoke to me—I felt at my waistcoat and found that my watch was gone, and my chain hanging down, which my watch had been fastened to—I was wearing my coats open—afterwards at the station, at the suggestion of some one, I searched my outside great coat pocket, and to my profound astonishment found my watch there, it is worth about twenty guineas—when the prisoner spoke to me he came close, and brought his person into contact with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I rather think that he had an umbrella in his hand or under his arm—he asked me some question as to the departure of a train—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187704090019"></xptr>
               <p>I had not been more than half a minute at the station—I think I went with my friend into the refreshment-room and ordered something, but left it on the counter and went out to inquire the time of the departure of my train for Lewisham—no one spoke to me in the refreshment-room—I should have returned there but for this occurrence—the prisoner was about 30 feet from me when the constable asked me if I had lost my watch—I felt and said <hi rend="italic">"Yes</hi>," and he said "This man has taken it," and he immediatly laid hold of him and we went together to the inspector's office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable and ticket examiner at the Cannon Street Station—on 26th March, about-10.45, I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner coming towards the barrier close together, the prisoner was in front, they seemed to be in conversation, the prosecutor seemed to be stooping down listening to what was said—I saw the prisoner's left hand up the pro<lb></lb>secutor's coat and I heard a little bit of a snap and saw a ring fall to the ground; a porter picked it up and gave it to me—the prosecutor went in the direction of the booking-office—I went through a passage, met the prisoner, took hold of him, and asked the prosecutor if he had lost his watch—he said he had—I said to the prisoner "You will have to come with me to the inspector's office "; we went there and waited for my superior—the prisoner was first on the prosecutor's left and then on his right, sometimes close to him and sometimes far away—he was searched, but the watch was not found on him; it was ultimately found in the prosecutor's right hand coat pocket;—I produce it and the ring—at the time the ring dropped there was no one but the prisoner within 2 yards of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw the ring drop to the ground and heard it" as well—I was about a yard from the prosecutor at the time—he and the' prisoner then went together towards the booking-office, which was about 15 yards off—after the prisoner was given in charge to the constable 1 went towards the booking-office to search for the watch—the prisoner had an umbrella in his left hand or under his arm, it was his left hand I saw under the prosecutor's coat.</p>

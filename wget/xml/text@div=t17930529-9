               <p>I am the constable of Dowgate Ward. On Sunday morning the 14th of April at a quarter before six I was standing at the corner of the Mansion House, near to Lombard-street, the prisoner at the bar passed me as I stood at the corner, he had this bag under his arm, he was dressed in a porter's dress, and I thought it rather looked odd to have this bag under his arm at that time in the morning, he crossed the street and went by the Bank, up Threadneedle-street; I followed him up into Threadneedle-street; I got up to him, says I, young man what have you got here? he said he had got pepper; I asked him where he was going with it? he said, he was going to the Vine Inn, Bishopsgate; it was to go into the country; I asked him where the directions were? he said, he had lost it; I asked him how the waggoner could know where to take it to without directions? he said the man knew where to take it to; I asked him what weight it was? he said he could not tell; I asked him where he brought it from? he said he brought it from a grocer's in Bread-street, I told him it had a very bad look, I was afraid he had not come honestly by it, I would wish him to go back with me to see if it was right or wrong; he said very well; he came a little way back and then began to hang<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290022"></xptr>back, and desired I would let him go; I told him I could not think of letting him go by no means; he said he would give me his watch or any thing; I told him I should not let him go, I was a constable, and I took charge of him; when we were going back opposite the Bank he said it did not come from Bread-street, it came from Mr. Whitmell's in Cannon-street; I said, I know Mr. Whitmell very well; how could you get it out that time in the morning? he said, the carman got up to go with the horses, and he followed him out, that he was a porter in the house, and to the best of my knowledge, he said he lived in the house; I then put him into the Poultry Compter, and about eight o'clock I went to Mr. Whitmell's, and I sent word up to him by the servant that I would be glad to see him, and he came to me at last, and I informed him of the matter; I have had the property in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. I understand you to say, that he said, he got it of the grocer's in in Bread-street? - He told me, to the best of my knowledge, that he was a porter there in Bread-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Afterwards he told you he belonged to Mr. Whitmell's? - He did, and I told him I knew Mr. Whitmell very well.</p>

               <p>I am a grocer; I am in the service of Mr. Whitmell; I am the warehouseman; I was informed of this on Sunday morning when I came home from Church, about twelve or a little after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any pepper? - To the best of my knowledge there is not quite so much in the cask as ought to be; this cask was laying in the bottom warehouse, it had pepper in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark or any name on it? - I believe not.</p>

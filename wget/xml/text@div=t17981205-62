               <p>Q. Did you know them before? - A. Yes; he asked me if I had any money; I said, yes, I had got three halfpence; then he said, go back to the Black Dog, and we will have something to drink, and we had a quartern and a half of gin, and four of us to drink it.</p>
               <p>Q. But who was the forth? -

            Another man, I do not know who he was; I parted from them, and coming through Middle-row again, I met with a shopmate of mine that I had worked with for years; she said to me, we will go and have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179812050064"></xptr>something to drink, and we went into the Black Dog, and the two prisoners came in, and said, I should not stay there, because it was a bad house; I had two bundles in my hand, and the man prisoner said, he would take care of me; we went into the Black Dog with this woman, and we had a quartern of gin, or a quartern and a half, I cannot say which, and they would not let me part from them before I went up into their apartments, in a court in Broad-street, St. Giles's, I do not know the name of the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober at that time? - A. I was not rightly sober; I went up stairs, and staid in their apartments an hour by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Without either him or her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You took a nap, I suppose? - A. Yes; then the woman prisoner came up and said, d-n you, what have you come up to be a w-e to my husband? I said, did you bring me up in this place to use me ill? she then took up her sist, and struck me in the face; I ran out of the room down stairs as hard as I could; the gentlewoman of the house said, I did not think you would bring up a woman to use her so ill; I went into her room, and the prisoner followed me into her room, and beat me there.</p>

            Where was the man all this time? - A. I cannot say; then the prisoner said, I am very sorry for what I have done, I will make you a dish of tea, and make it up; then she went up stairs, and brought down some tea and sugar, and we had tea in the gentlewoman's room; after that her husband came up, and said, where is that poor woman, is she and her bundles safe; she said yes; he then sent for me up, and says she, bring your bundles with you; I said, no, I have left my bundles below, because I knew they were safe; then I carried my bundles up stairs, and the man was there very much in liquor; they wanted me to go for a quartern of gin, and they gave me the money to go for it; the woman of the house said, she would send her little girl for it; says she, consider your bundles, I had come down one pair of stairs; when I went up again, my bundle was open, and I missed a night-cap, towel, shift, and a handkerchief; I have found the things, except the night-cap, at a pawnbroker's; when I missed my things, she struck me down stairs, and said she would see my b-y liver; I believe if I had gone back again, I should have lost the rest of my things, and my life too.</p>

             - I had seen him before 1814, but only once, I believe. It was two or three years previous to that time-Mr. Holmes introduced him to me two or three years before that time. On the 27th of May, 1814, application was made to me to sell 500l. stock Navy 5 per Cents for him and Crispe, by the prisoner - Mr. Crispe was with him - I knew him to be the same person that I had seen with Holmes before, and who, at that time, Holmes called Mr. Crispe.</p>
               <p>Q. If that person had come by himself, did you know enough of him to identify him, without Holmes saying he was the man. - A. I should have known him to have been the person I had seen before, but I should have asked him to refer me to some person in the neighbourhood, or some person in the Bank, to identify him as being Mr. Crispe. Holmes told me to sell out 500l. for him - I did so, and prepared the necessary transfer tickets; it was sold to two different brokers. I sold 300l. to Carter and Campbell, who are brokers, and 200l. to Charles Bennett, who is also a broker, the names given by Mr. Giles are correct. The brokers buy for principals, and give me the names of the persons for whom they buy the stock. When the stock was sold, I attended Holmes to the Bank; the person called

When they came to me, the prisoner said, "This is Mr. Crispe, whom you have seen before with me, (or words to that effect) - We wish to sell out 500l. which is standing in our names." I attended the prisoner and that other person to sign the transfer. He only gave me a verbal order-it is not usual to give written orders (looks at the ledger.)-These are the three transfers of the 500l. Navy 5 per Cents. which I sold by the prisoner's direction.

I had not seen him from the 7th of April. 1815, to July, 1816. In July, 1816, I saw Crispe at the Bank. I did not then know that there had been any doubt about him - I was informed of it at that meeting; Mr. Crispe was there-it was the same man that I had sold the stock for. I was told by Mr. Ferdinando, on that occasion, that there was some doubt about him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not immediately point out the real Mr. Crispe, without any reference being made to him. - A. I did; and immediately stated to Mr. Ferdinando, and another gentleman, that he was the man who had signed the transfer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Crispe, at that meeting, desired to write his name. - A. He was, and I saw him write it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that the name he then wrote, was the hand-writing of the same man. - A. I am sure it was the same hand-writing that signed the transfer-It was compared with the hand-writing here-(pointing to the book)-Mr. Ferdinando was present, I believe; I pointed out Crispe as the same person I had seen before - I believe him to be the same man. I have not the most distant doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. When you attended at the Bank, was there any stranger, beside Crispe. - A. There was - I attended at the 5 per Cent. Office.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 16th of July, was there anybody there besides Mr. Crispe and the Clerk at the Bank. - A. It was in the 5 per Cent Office, under the letter H.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not attend at Mr. Domino's office. - A. Not on that day. When Crispe had wrote his name, the gentlemen were so well convinced that it was his hand-writing, that they shut the book up altogether.</p>

I and the prisoner were joint executors to Mr. Crispe, of Leeds, in Kent - He died in 1808. I and the prisoner met in London, for the purpose of managing his affairs. I was in London, in October 1811; I saw the prisoner at that time, to sell 350l. stock, that was in our names in the bank, as executors to Mr. Crispe. We had 3000l. there, before we sold out, it was in the Navy 5 per Cents. When I went out of town in October 1811, there was 2,650l. standing in our names in the bank. I was not in London, in May 1814. Between October 1811, and May 1814, I had not seen the prisoner, Holmes. I had had no communication with him within that period, about selling out any of our stock. Holmes received the dividends - I never received any. They were applied to pay annuities of 150l. per annum under Mr. Crispe's will. I had had no communication with the prisoner, within the times I have spoken of. I was not in London, in April 1815. I never had any communication with Holmes, after 1811 about selling out stock, which stood in our joint names. In consequence of some suspicion which I entertained, I came to town, in July 1816, and went to the bank. I there found, that 700l. of the stock had been sold out, which stood in the prisoner, Holmes's name and mine I went to the bank, on purpose to enquire and see if the money was safe there. I knew the hand-writing of Holmes when I see it, (looking at the transfer.) I believe it to be his hand-writing-there is the name of William Crispe under it; that is not my hand-writing. I think it resembles it-there are three transfers on the same sheet. I am positive that the name of

             there is not my hand-writing. I was not in London at that time. I have my day-book, in which I put down occurrences on that day - I make these entries from day to day; it is my day-book for 1814 (producing it). - I look at it. On the 27th day of May, I was at home in my own business.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is there in your book that makes you know that you was at home. - A. Because the entries are made in my own hand-writing, so that I must have been at home to have made them. The entries in the book were made on the day that the particular occurrences took place, for instance-if they took place on the 27th, I put them down on the 27th. I do not transcribe this book from another - I write the meat down as it goes out of the shop; it is my day-book, and always lays in my shop-the entries are entries of the different quantities of meat sold to my different customers in the morning; they are entered as it is sold; there are thirteen entries on that day(May 27) - They are all in my own hand-writing; there are no other entries of anybody serving in my shop. I have another book, which I keep for my fat and skins-(looking at it) - I keep an account of the days on which I sell fat and skins; the entries are made on the days to which they refer. I slaughter on a Friday, and sell my skins to one person. I am enabled positively to say, that I was at my own shop at Maidstone the whole of that day - I have not the least doubt of it at all. I did not come to town till October, 1815, after October, 1811. I was not in London at all between those times. I came to town for medical advice - I did not see the prisoner there - I did not see him there until he was taken. When I was absent from the shop, Mrs. Crispe always made the entries; she is my wife; upon all other occasions, I make my own entries. I look at my fat and skin-book, and find I sold, on the 27th of May, both fat and skins.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. I know I was not in town on that day. Maidstone is thirty-four miles from London.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you give that as a reason. - A. I was not in town from 1811 to 1815, because I made entries.</p>
               <p>Q.Cannot you come to town, do business, and go back again the same day. - I will swear the entries were made on the morning of that day - I will swear that they were made in the forenoon.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day did your skins go out - A.About eleven or twelve o'clock in the forenoon. I will swear it. There is no hour in my book. I will swear it from memory. You can go to town from Maidstone, remain in town four or five hours, and go back again the same day. I was in town the 16th of July, I was at the Bank. I do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190026"></xptr>not recollect that the broker pointed me out. I was called upon to write my name.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not swear, before the magistrate, that both the signatures of Holmes and Crispe, were in Holmes's hand-writing - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. If your books had not been here, have you a particular recollection, that you was not in London between the times you have mentioned - A. I have, independent of my books.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you make any transfer with Holmes, except that in the year 1811 - A. I did not make any other.</p>
               <p>Q.by MR. CURWOOD. Did you not give as your reason for not being in town, that you was ill - A. I never gave that reason.</p>

I think I have - I looked at the book, there are no entries of mine on the 27th of May; it is my husband's hand-writing, if he had been absent, it would have been my employment to make the entries. Mr. Crispe was not absent in the year 1814, sufficient time to go to London. I remember his going to town in 1811, I remember he went for medical advice - I was with him. I never remember my husband going to town on a Friday, he is always particularly employed, it being slaughtering day, and Saturday is market-day. I never recollect his being absent upon a slaughtering day.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I never remember his coming to London, or his going any distance - He is not absent much, he goes to Rochester market, but he is not absent many hours. You can go to London in the morning, and come back again in the evening.</p>

             went with me - We saw the prisoner. I told him a gentleman wanted to see him at the White Horse, Eden Bridge; he said, if he went he would ride, and called for his horse immediately; I told him he had better walk with me, he said, he should not. I did not tell him what we wanted him for. He went towards his house, and I followed him - He went in doors, and so did I; he pulled off his smockfrock and hat, and went into the wash-house, to wash his hands. I went into his wash-house, and saw him running down his garden; I called to Burgess to run one way to meet him, and I followed him the other. Just as I had got nearly close to him, he turned round, we seized him by the collar, threw him down, and tried to hand-cuff him, without success - He made a great resistance; in the struggle he threw the hand-cuffs away, while we ran after them he got up and went towards his house. I seized him again. He repeatedly asked me to shoot him; we had each a pistol. When we got him down, he had his servants round, I charged a man to assist me, he said, he was his father, and he would not, and went away. The prisoner went into his house with Burgess and me - We took him in. I think I told him he must go to Eden Bridge. I asked his servants to go after the gentleman to Eden Bridge, but he would not let any of them go. After about half an hour, as we could not persuade him to go, Burgess went to fetch the gentleman from Eden Bridge, it was Foy, the officer; he left me alone with the prisoner; after he had been gone a little time, the prisoner said he wanted to write a letter; there were several persons about, and I was much alarmed for fear he should get away, not that he would injure me; he wanted to go up stairs to write the letter - I refused, but he would go up. I went up as far as the room door with him, but he would not let me go in; he came down stairs very quietly, and sealed it. He then walked about, talking to a person who called himself Bright, and asked him if he would write a letter to a man at Chaddy, whom, he said, owed him some money. He went up stairs a third time, and, by some means or other, got out of the window, and went away. I had told him that I had got a warrant for him, but I did not tell what it was for. I looked after him several nights and days, and searched his house several times, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>JOHN PHILPOT. I keep the Chequers, at West Farley, in Kent, it is nearly twenty miles from Eden Bridge. On Christmas Day last, I saw the prisoner at my house, I detained him, and sent a letter to Crispe. I received an answer from Crispe, and told the prisoner that I detained him for selling out money from the Bank of England; he begged that I would let him go back from whence he came. I told him I could not, for I had pledged my word not to let him go; he said he would give me any thing if I would let him go back again. I told him Mr. Crispe had had a great deal of trouble, and I had pledged my word to stop him if he came my way. He said, he was afraid I had wrote to somebody else to come besides Mr. Crispe. I told him I had not, and shewed him my letter, and the answer. He said, he had fully intended to replace the money again, but that he had been deceived by the Earl of Thanet, and times had turned out bad, that he had not had it in his power. I told him I did not exactly know how the money had been sold out; when he said he was very sorry that he had ever ran away. I told him Mr. Crispe had desired me to stop him. I did not tell him the manner in which the money had been sold out. He said, a friend had persuaded him to run away, and he was very sorry he had done it. Sometime after, the prisoner asked me for a sheet of writing paper; when my brother came to the door for the writing paper, I was standing just outside the door, when my brother stood at the door-way, he said, "half a sheet will do;" and at the same time opened the window out of the room that went backwards-the prisoner was in the room; my brother stood at the door, asking me for the writing paper, he said, half a sheet will do, and jumped out instantly. I heard a noise the same minute that the window was pushed up, he said half a sheet will do. He ran away, through my yard, and down a meadow-nobody was with him at the time. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181702190027"></xptr>and my brother pursued him-my brother got up to him first, I was close upon him; the prisoner turned round, and said, "You cannot blame me for trying." We brought him back. and secured him in a room. I do not know what passed afterwards. He said, "I cannot die above forty years before my time, and they shall not have me and the money both." He wrote a letter (a letter put into the witnesses hand), it is the same, I saw him write it. I kept it, I did not send it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not tell you that the money was sold by him and Crispe, for his use, and that he had given an undertaking for it - A. He did not. I came up on Saturday by the Maidstone coach. I did not say, I should make a very good thing of it. I did not say, I should hang one, and that it would go hard with the other. A stranger said so; I did not.</p>

On the 27th of December last, I was sent for, to Mr. Philpot's house - I found the prisoner there, and told him, I was come on some business respecting the Bank; he said, he understood it perfectly well, that it was a very bad job, and that he had not a minute's happiness, since it had been done; he also said, that the stock would have been replaced long before, only his friends had deceived him; he said, he had been to France, and had only returned three days; I said, you have done little Smith; he said, he had, and should have done Philpot the same way, only he had broken a glass getting out of the window. Before that, I told him, it was my duty to search him; I did, and found two papers upon him - I put my initials on them, (one put into witnesses hand) this is one of them. As I was bringing him to London, he said, Lord Thanet had deceived him. When we were at the George Inn, in the Borough, he said, he would endeavour to raise the money then, if that would do, but they should not have him and the money too.</p>

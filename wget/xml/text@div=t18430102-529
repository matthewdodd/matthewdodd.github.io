                  </hi>. I keep the Bell, in Wellington-street, Strand. On the morning of the 29th of Dec. the prisoner, and another man, came in—they had a glass of rum-and-water, then called for a cigar each, and staid smoking—then they called for a pint of beer—I drew it, and went down to call our young man up, during which time the prisoner and the other had left, and I missed a box of cigars—I gave information to the police—they had not paid for the beer—we went, and found the prisoner in about ten minutes, at the Artichoke, counting out the cigars on the table—I said he had robbed me of my cigars—he was trying to get away, and I gave him in charge—I am certain the cigars are mine.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did they appear to be recently killed? - A. Yes. They were warm; I sent for Wild, the constable of the parish, and secured him; I charged him with it, and he told me, that what he had done, was through distressed circumstances, and I told him I was very sorry for it; I thought from that he had a very large family, but on enquiry, I find he had but one child.</p>

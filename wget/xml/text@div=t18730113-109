                  </hi>. I live at 24, Windsor Terrace, City Road, and am a tailor—on Saturday, 28th December, I went to rest about 1 o'clock in the morning, leaving the house locked securely up—I secured the lower part of the house myself; the windows were fast and the area door bolted—my attention was called by a lady in the first floor front knocking at my door—I went down stairs, opened the area door, and let the policeman in who was knocking—we went into the back kitchen, and saw the prisoner stand<lb></lb>ing in the middle of the back kitchen with two chemises, a pair of drawers, and a shirt on his body—these are the things—the two chemises were on his body over his shirt—he had no coat on—three panes of glass were broken in the area window, and a Christmas tree had been shifted from the window sill—the hole would enable a person to get his hand in and open the window—it had been secure when I went to bed—the policeman took the prisoner into custody—he said, "What brought you here?"—the prisoner said, "I don't know"—the things were hanging on the horse the night before—I think he was sober—I did not know him.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 29th, I was on duty in Windsor Terrace—at No. 24, I noticed a Christmas tree standing near the area window, in front of three panes of glass which were broken—I knocked them up—a lodger answered, and the prosecutor came down and let me in—I found the prisoner standing in the back kitchen, and he was given into my custody.</p>

I did break the window and put the tree on one side, so as not to break it, and I laid down by the fire, and put the things on to keep myself warm.</p>

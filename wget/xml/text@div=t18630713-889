                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I do not deny having written the two letters to the secretary, and am ashamed to say with a fraudulent intent, but there my crime ceases. An examination of the declaration will show that there is a marked difference in the writing of that and the letters; the words, "Bow-street, Police-court" are different; I delivered that paper to Crompton, who appears to have escaped, and he affixed these signatures, and placed the words "Bow-street there." With regard to the three deeds, I believe there is a question whether they are legally forgeries; Mr. Lewis has given it as his opinion, that the case resting on the transfers alone would not stand, and for that reason the charge of forging the declaration is brought before you; but although the transfers were carried up to my very bed-room door, I will show that they were not forged by me, for after sending the porter away from the door, I took the three documents to Crompton's bed-room, and he affixed the signatures; he is proved to be not an imaginary accom<lb></lb>plice, but to have existed. If you will examine the signatures to the deeds and the declaration, you will see a marked difference between them and the letter to Mr. Cleghorn; of course they are somewhat similar; they are in<lb></lb>tended to be; the reason is obvious.</p>

                  </hi>, I am manager of the Camden Town branch of the London and South Western Bank—the prisoner and his brother were customers before the composition of December, 1875—we were creditors partially secured—after that composition the prisoner opened an account with us as George Frost—"this is his pass-book for 1878—since the be<lb></lb>ginning of 1878 I saw him when he was in the bank—I remonstrated with him on the way in which he was conducting his account, the cheques being returned and dishonoured—I can't remember when that was, I take it it would be before March, 1878—there were some assets, but not sufficient—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the returned cheque book, it is not kept by me but by different clerks—this 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque of 5th April, drawn by George Frost in favour of "Market," was presented at our bank and marked "refer to drawer"—he had drawn it for more than he had—this one of 6th April for 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in favour of Higginbotham is the prisoner's writing, that was returned "not sufficient"—this 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque of 26th April in favour of "Market" was dishonoured—the last money paid in to the credit of the account was 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 23rd April—the balance at the end of that day was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—at the time of closing the account it stood at 71. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 11. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was deducted for charges—no cheque was paid after that—on the morning of the 5th April the balance was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and at the end of the day 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—at the end of the 12th it was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on the 20th 11. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Kimbell, of 50, Metropolitan Meat Market—I had some few transactions with Frost prior to 5th April—this 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque in favour of "Market" was brought to me by a person named Tailby, who I knew as the prisoner's servant—he took goods to the vaiue of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I believed the cheque to be a good and valid one, or I would not have parted with the goods and cash—the cheque was sent through the bank and was dishonoured—we have never been paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had had something over a dozen dealings with Frost or his man before—they had been invariably paid by cheque or cash—they were nearly all paid at the time to the best of my recollection—I first knew the prisoner at the latter part of 1876, it might be in 1877—I do not know his brother and nephews in the market personally; I know they are there, and that they are respectable and substantial men—there are two separate firms of that name—this was a crossed cheque.</p>

I am a meat salesman in the Central Meat Market—I was aware of George Frost's composition in 1876—I was not a creditor—after that he was a customer, but very rarely, for cash only—on 26th April this cheque was brought to my place by his man between 7 and 9 a.m.—it was crossed as it is now—he got meat to the value of about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd and the balance 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I believed the cheque to be a good and valid one—I would not have trusted him if I had not had the cheque—I paid it in to my banker's, and it was sent back dishonoured.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been acting as solicitor for the defen<lb></lb>dant, and am acting for his defence—this is my bill of costs—it was taxed—the entry 23rd April, 1878, I find from my diary should be the 25th—I defended him in two or three actions, which commenced in March or April—I prepared the petition which was signed the following day—it is also wrong that on the 23rd he was to bring the list of creditors when he came next time; it ought to be the 25th—when he came with the list of creditors he gave instructions about the petition—my clerk attended prior to the petition; "Drawing and engrossing of petition, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 25th," that is right—when I had the instructions on that day, I should prepare it ready for the next—I should put the stamp on after it is signed; "Drawing affidavit, filing petition, and attending defendant to be sworn, paid oath 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and stamp 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," all that occurred on the 26th—Mr. Quick had sued him—I had instructions to defend the action—I think the writ was not sufficiently en<lb></lb>dorsed, and I took out a summons for further, and better particulars—I do not know that the date 23rd is correct, it is copied by a clerk—I have the copy writ here—it is dated 12th April, served 20th; amount 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for goods sold and delivered—I entered appearance, possibly to save judgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not concerned for him in his prior liquidation—there are several writs besides Quick's—several of them sued for goods, Mr. Venables was one; that was why I advised him to file his petition—there were three or four actions pending, and I thought the best thing would be to call the creditors together and for them to get possession—I was at the meeting of creditors at my office—Mr. Peter Tocher was there—more than twenty were there—there was a discussion as to whether it should be a liquidation—Mr. Tocher seemed resolved on a liquidation, and we could not help ourselves—at the close of the meeting I told the creditors that I should be prepared to pay them a composition of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound if they would accept it—Mr. Tocher and Mr. Layton, the solicitor, said it would be no liquidation—I was prepared to advance 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for payment of a composition, on security of his book debts and business—the debts were about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and his book debts about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., then the goodwill, lease, &amp;c., about 1,500—I was prepared to advance that sum; then Mr. Pannell was put in to manage the business and the debtor turned out—I advised him to have as receiver his own nominee—he said, "No, I have been in liquidation before, I paid a composition and no one interfered with me?"—no dividend has been paid; as solicitor of the debtor I have had letters inquiring when one would be paid, and have referred them to the trustee—I believe no one represented the defendant when examined in June.</p>

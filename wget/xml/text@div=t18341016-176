             - on the 10th of October the prisoner came in, and asked if we had any broken glass to sell - I said no - she then asked if I would have my fortune told - I said no - she then said, "My charge is a shilling a piece; but I will tell two fortunes for a shilling" - I said I would not have it done, but she began to tell me over the counter; I found she would not leave; and for fear of my father coming into the shop, I told her to go into the kitchen, and I followed her - she then asked me for the largest piece of silver I had, which was half-a-crown, and I was to cross my hand three times with it - she took the half-crown, and said she was to put it on the planet - she then asked me for three more of the largest pieces of silver I had - they were shillings - she told me to cross my hand three times with them, and she took them - they were to go to the planet - she was to return them to me in the evening - she came back in half an hour, and asked for a pair of stockings, a silk handkerchief, and a shirt, and she would not leave without them - she said she must wait, and I gave them to her, she had had 5s. 6d. of my money - I was to have them back at night - our servant saw her the next day, and she demanded 8s. from her - she said she would not leave without it - she would wait, if it were for a month, till she had got all she wanted - I let her have them - she came again on the Sunday, and said she wanted 10s. to make up the planet - she then wanted 4s. more - she said she wanted them to make up the planet - I was afterwards standing at my sister's door, in Ratcliff-highway - the prisoner passed - she beckoned me to come out, and she then wanted 10s. to make up the planet - she said she must have so much silver, and she must make the silver into gold, to make it all meet - she came again on the Monday evening, and had 3s. more of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you part with the money from time to time? A. She terrified me so much, and talked of telling my father what I had done previously.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you parted with it without exercising your own free will? A. Yes. I am not twenty-one years of age - my father had given me the money to use, but they were his stockings and other things - she told me she could tell my fortune - she said she told by planets - she said she had been over to Mr. Scholey's niece, and got a sovereign of her, and a gold chain - I shall be twenty years old in March - my father is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. When she obtained these things, did she, in each instance, represent that they should be returned? A. Yes; and I believed she would return them - she told me they would all fall into holes if she kept them - I did not mean to part with my property, but to have them returned - the first time was on the 10th of October - she then had a shirt, a handkerchief, and a pair of stockings of my father's - she said she must have them, but did not say what she meant to do with them - she engaged, in each instance, to return the things - I only gave them her to use.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you ask me whether I could tell your fortune, and say you would give me a shilling to tell yours and the servant's? A. No, I did not - I did not say I should like to have my fortune told, as I was deeply in love with a young man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She said she would give me any thing if I would tell her the young man that she was to be married to- I said I could get a person to tell, and she gave me 5s 6d. to go to the person - the person sent me back, and I asked her for either a piece of gold, or 5s., and she told me the hours at which she wished me to come. Witness. She kept teasing me to let her tell me, and I told her to go away - she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160081"></xptr>said she wanted the money to set the planet, and said she would wait and see my mother or father, and have the money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you in each instance part with the money and the articles, not intending her to keep them, but to return them? A. Yes: I never meant that she should keep them - she said they would fall into holes if she did.</p>
               <p>ANN LOW. I am servant to Mr. Mather. I recollect the prisoner coming into the kitchen, but she would not let me stop - she said she could not speak before me - she afterwards stopped me in the street several times - she said she wanted a shirt, stockings, and handkerchief, and a piece of gold; and she wanted something that Miss Mather wore - she wanted the money for the planet - she applied again on the Saturday, and Miss Mather sent her out 8s. - she was to return every one of these things when she had them, but she did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you tell me I could see you any time, and you did not care about Miss Mather's fortune being told, so long as I told you yours, as you were eight years in love with one young man? Witness. No, nothing of the kind - I knew my fortune - go along with you.</p>

            . I live with my uncle, who is a pastrycook in High-street, Shadwell. The prisoner came in and asked if I had any broken glass or china to mend - I said, "No" - she then said would I have my fortune told - I said, "No."</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written)."On Friday, the 10th of October, I went out to look for work, having a small family, my husband being out of employ; and being very much in distress, and meeting with my prosecutrix, we entered into conversation, when she told me she was deeply in love with a young man, and said she would give me what money I should want, or any things else I should want, if I could tell her fortune - I told her "No," but I could tell her of a woman that could tell her true, when she said she would give me what money I should want to give the woman, she gave me a shilling and 9s. for the woman, whom I went to find, and gave her the money; when she sent me back to the prosecutrix, saying, she must have a piece of gold before she could tell her any thing; when the prosecutrix gave me 5s., one shirt, 1 pair of stockings, and silk handkerchief, which I took to the woman; the woman telling me she should return them to the prosecutrix as well as the money she received from me; the prosecutrix's servant being present all this time, and gave me money as well as her mistress - I had been two or three times since the Friday, and received money from them both, which I gave to the woman, not thinking of any wrong, and being in distress - when I could not see her herself, she sent the money by her servant. I do declare on oath that I never put her in fear, nor held out any threat to her whatever, the servant telling me what hour I could see her, between one and two; if not then, at a quarter past eight o'clock at night on Monday; being sent again by the woman when I saw the servant, after going twice, when she gave me 10s. more for the woman, being with me at the time - on our way home we met the mistress at the shop door - she came after me, and said, "Have you seen our servant?" - I said, "Yes, and have received 10s." when two persons coming up to speak to my prosecutrix, the woman calling me on one side, telling me to ask for 10s. more - when she said she could not get it without taking it out of her sister's till - I told her not to do that - she said if I would promise her it should be the last money; I was to come on Tuesday, between three and four o'clock, and she would give me the money; and if I could cause her sweetheart to be with her that night, I was to keep all I had got. I was completely drawn into it by the woman, not thinking of any harm to myself and family; and greatly do I now repent having any hand in it."</p>

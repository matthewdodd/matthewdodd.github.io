I am the mother of the last witness—I had just left his house on 12th June, about 7 o'clock in the evening, and saw the prisoner and Powell pass the house where I live, leading a black and a grey horse; the black one belonged to my son—I ran and said to the prisoner, "What are you going to do with that horse?"—he said, "What has that to do with you?"—I said, "More to do with me than with you; I defy you to go another step, it belongs to my son; though you have disfigured it, by cutting a foot off its tail, I recognize it"—I spoke to a policeman, and if he had been quick he would have caught the prisoner, but he got on the horse and rode away.</p>

I live at 44, William Street, Chiswick—I was con<lb></lb>victed at the Chelmsford Sessions, on 2nd July, of stealing a horse, and was sentenced to two months' imprisonment—on 12th June, the prisoner asked me to go to Smithfield with him—he paid my expenses, and took me on the flats, and told me to sit down and mind a grey mare—I sat there two hours—I was in his company that evening when Mrs. Waterman spoke to him—he had a grey mare and a horse, I was leading both—after the old lady spoke to him he got on the grey mare and rode away—what I now state on oath, I stated voluntarily to the constable.</p>

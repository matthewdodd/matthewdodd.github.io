I said they should not be in my House, and they carried them to another, but brought them back again unknown to me. There were Nutmegs, Tea, Sugar, Cloves, Mace, Chocolate, Starch, Blue, Fig-blue, Powder-blue: The Bundle was as thick as a little Child: As for the Quantities, I can say nothing of them.</p>

On Tuesday, the 9th of May, about twelve o'clock at noon, the prisoner came into my shop; he asked for a box of dominos; we told him we had none; I told him that Mr. Foy was gone out, and probably he would bring some home. He asked what time he would be at home; I said, soon. He said he would call again at seven o'clock in the evening. I saw no more of the prisoner until two o'clock in the afternoon; I was in the parlour adjoining the shop, the door was open; there were some tea caddies standing near the counter. Afterwards I saw the prisoner brought into the shop with the tea caddy in his hand; I looked at the caddy; I knew it to be mine, and had seen it in the shop about a quarter of an hour before.</p>

I was in a shop opposite the prosecutrix's, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner was looking into Mr. Foy's shop, peeping into it; he had a bricklayers apron on; he was looking very anxious towards this caddy. I spoke to a shopmate of mine to have an eye to the place, whilst I went out to the shop door; I saw the prisoner going along with the tea caddy under his apron; I saw the tea caddy; I went out of the door. and laid hold of him by the collar, with the tea caddy under his apron; I took him back to Mr. Foy's house; a constable was sent for, and he was taken into custody.</p>

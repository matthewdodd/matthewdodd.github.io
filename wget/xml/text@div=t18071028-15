I was coming from Queen-street, Brompton, to No. 19, in the Strand; I took a hackney coach at the top of Sloane-street, Knightsbridge. I forgot to take the number of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Who drove that coach. - A. I do not know the man, I did not take notice of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You took the coach from Sloane-street, to Queen-street. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And from there you took your things to the Strand. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Is this your box that was lost. - A. Yes, it was put in the boot; he came to 49, in the Strand; there came a servant to take out the things, and he forgot to take out my box. I went the same evening up the Strand, I saw a man of the name of Williams; he said he saw me call the coach off the stand in Sloane-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this Williams. - A. He was a coachman on the stand at the time; I gave him the description of the man, he said he thought he knew him, but he could not recollect his name nor his number; he said if I came up in the morning, perhaps he might remember it. I went in the morning, he said he believed it to be No. 823, I went to the yard, it was not the man. On the 24th of September, my fellow servant saw him in the Strand, he knew him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your things. - A. No, none of them. He was a short man, and pock fretted; he drove 594.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Williams told you he thought he knew the man. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By your description this man was examined at Queen-square. - A. Yes.</p>

            . I was fellow servant with this young woman, at this present time; I was employed to fetch the things from Brompton; I came from Brompton on the 17th of August, on the coach box, with this coach, and the things in it of the young woman's, to No. 49, in the Strand; the box was put in the boot, and the other things in the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the coachman that drove that coach. - A. That is the coachman. (pointing to the prisoner).</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you help to take the things out. - A. Yes; at the time I was gone in the back shop with some of the things from the inside of the coach, master paid the coachman his fare; as soon as he got his fare the coachman drove off; when I came back, master asked me if there was not a cask in the boot, I said there was; he said the coachman was drove off.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was not only a box in this boot, but a cask. - A. Yes, a four gallon cask of ale.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. How long after you had rode from Brompton to London was it that you saw the coachman. - A. It was the 4th of September, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. That was better than a fortnight, you then said you was positive he is the man. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it you left Brompton. - A. Between five and six o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. It was then getting towards dusk, it was dark when you arrived in the Strand. - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say you was not certain that he was the man that drove the coach. - A. No; I always said that I was certain that he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say to Mr. Burgess, that you believed he was not the man. - A. I never said so in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him in custody when you saw him in the Strand. - A. No, I went and informed my fellow servant; 945 was the number.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite correct in every thing you state, you are sure it was not 594. - A. It was 594.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Now you say 594 was the number, because I said so.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. On the 26th of September I apprehended the prisoner in company with Renny, and the last witness: Reeves gave me the number of the coach 594, we found the coach put up in Greville mews, Guildford-street; we met the prisoner in the street. Reeves said there is the man coming; I asked him if he was sure of the man, he said he was positive of it; when he came up to us, I asked him what he had done with the box and the barrel of ale, that was left in the boot of his coach; he said he had no recollection of ever having such a thing; I asked him if he remembered bringing a fare from Brompton, with a child's cradle tied behind his coach, I was given to understand that was the case; he said he carried so many faces he could not remember any thing about it; I told him I was an officer, I should take him in custody; Reeves being positive of his person, I searched his master's place, and his lodgings; I found nothing.</p>

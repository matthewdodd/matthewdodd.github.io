The prisoner and his wife were with me. After we both got our pensions we went to the back of the College for some refreshment. Nothing happened until we got into the road, and then the prisoner came up to me and put his hand into my pocket, and took out my money. We were both rather intoxicated: I said, you have robbed me, and he immediately knocked me down. After he was taken up he said, Connelly, don't send me to prison, and here is your money back again.</p>

On Saturday, the 2nd of April, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner rapped at the door - I went, and he said he was very sorry, he had dropped half a crown down the area, and would I let him have it; I said certainly - he came in and stood on the mat while I went down stairs to procure a light, and as soon as I got into the area I heard the latch of the street door pull back, but the door did not shut; I looked up, and saw him go out with a great coat on his arm - I ran up the area steps, got over the gate, and ran. but I lost sight of him at the bottom of Argyle-street: I have not seen the great coat since - I saw the prisoner again on the Monday morning following; I was quite sure he was the person I had seen on the Saturday - he was then in custody at Marlborough-street office - I had never seen him before; the great coat had been hanging in the hall - there was a light, and I could clearly see his features.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. What sort of a night was it? A. Fine - there were not many people in the street; he remained but a second or two with me - I went down instantly into the area; I had not seen the great coat before - I cannot tell when it had been safe; I was in the area, and had a candle in my hand, but I saw the prisoner distinctly before I went into the area - I could not discern him distinctly in the street, but there had been no other person in the house - I can swear the person went out of the house with the coat; I saw him go out at the door - he got to the bottom of the street while I got over the area.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did any body else see the person who came to the house? A. The kitchen-maid did, but she said she should not know him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HANKS. I am butler to Mr. Dottin - he came in between five and six o'clock, with a great coat on; I took it and hung it up in the hall, about five or six yards from the street door - I missed it between seven and eight o'clock.</p>

            . I am a special-constable. Between seven and eight o'clock that night the prisoner knocked at the door of General Turner's, which is next door to Mr. Dottin's, and said he had dropped some silver down the area - Mrs. West went to the door to him; she called me(I was at the time in the house), and I took a candle to show the prisoner down into the area - I am certain he is the man; I had seen him before - when he came down into the area I asked what silver he had dropped; he said he did not know, he had been drinking - I said, "I don't think you have dropped any thing;" he said, "Yes, I have - it is all right;" I said, "I don't think it is all right;" he walked up, and went away.</p>

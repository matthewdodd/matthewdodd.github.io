               <p>Q. What description of goods were deposited in that warehouse on the 10th of March last? - A.

               <p>Q. Was there any offer of favour, or any threat? - A. None to my knowledge; the pockets were searched, and a quantity of coffee taken out, I dare say there may be five pounds of it; Mr. Harris asked him how he could think of having such a thing as that in his pocket; he said, it was a small quantity for his own use, as he had a few friends coming out of the country.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The prisoner is a locker? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The duty of a locker, I believe, is to take possession of every thing till it is discharged? - A. Yes, most assuredly.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, he has the possession of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. He is placed there to prevent any frauds? - A. Yes, to see that nothing is taken out without an order signed by the warehouse-keeper.</p>

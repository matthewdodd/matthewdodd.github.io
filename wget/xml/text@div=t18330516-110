             (police-constable E 65). I fell in with the prisoner on the 11th of May, at half-past eleven o'clock at night in Beaumont-place, Tottenham-court-road, about one hundred yards from the prosecutor's, he had this copper, I asked where he was going with it, he made no answer - I then asked where he brought it from; he said from No. 11, Tottenham-place, I said he must go back with me - I went there and found it was from No. 10 - I found on him this latch-key, which opens almost all the doors in that place.</p>

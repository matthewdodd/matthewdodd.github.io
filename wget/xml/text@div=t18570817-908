Between 12 and 1 o'clock, on 23rd July, the prisoner and another man came to the house—the prisoner had a basket—he was knocking at the gate, and I asked him if he came from the village of Blackheath—he said, "Your bell will not ring"—I said, "No, it is broken"—he followed me into the scullery with the other man—he said he was going to repair the gas pipes, and said he should want a candle, and could he see the lady—I said, "Yes," and he followed me into the hall, and saw Mrs. Capper—she said, "Where do you come from?"—he said, "I come from the gas works"—I turned and looked at him, and I said, "I thought you told me you came from the village?"—he said, "So I do, but I am come to look at all the gas pipes, that you may not have any trouble of complaining to the gas company"—I gave him a candle, and he lit all</p>

               <p>the gas down stairs; he told me there was a very great deal of gas, and there were more gas burners than any one had in Blackheath; he said I was not there when he was there eighteen months before—I was not—I did not see what was in the basket—he asked me to show him into the bed rooms; I said, "You will see the housemaid up stairs, and she will do it, I am busy"—while the prisoner was trying the burners, the other man did nothing, only what this one told him—he went up stairs, and did not come down till he had finished every room in the house up stairs—he came down into the kitchen and asked me for some grease to grease the handle of the gaso<lb></lb>meter, and I gave it to him; he said, when he had done he was going to make out a bill, and he must wash his hands first—I gave him some hot water; he asked me what time Mrs. Capper was going to dine, as he wanted to send up the bill—I told him she was at dinner—he inquired for the parlour maid—I said I would take up the bill as she was waiting on Mrs. Capper—I took up the bill—he wrote the bill on the table under the gas meter—Mrs. Capper said, "Has the man done all?"—I said, "Yes, he has"—he charged for six new burners—that is the bill he gave me—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Six new burners, blowing two joints, and easing main cock, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am parlour maid in Mr. Capper's service. On Thursday, 23rd July, I saw the prisoner with a pair of steps a-top of the kitchen stairs—I saw him light the gas burners at the top of the house—the first time my mistress saw him was when he came and told her he had come from the Company—I saw my mistress with him in the dining room and in the drawing room—he lighted the gas in the dining room—he gave his address John Matthews, Market Street, or Market Place, Greenwich—after he had done in the dining room he went up stairs—there are two floors above the dining room used as bed rooms—the two men were in the house altogether about an hour and a half—I saw the prisoner several times—I</p>

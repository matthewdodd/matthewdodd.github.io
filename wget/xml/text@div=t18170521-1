               <p>JOHN HOLDERNESS. I am a constable of Langley. On the morning of the 22d of April I was told of the robbery, and about six o'clock I stopped the prisoner, with the horses, in the parish of Stanwell, on the MIddlesex side; the great coat was thrown over the mare, which the prisoner was riding. Mr. Shepherd saw the horses the next day and claimed them. The prisoner said he was going to take them to Mr. Butt, at Lambeth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not ask you to go to the Borough, and would shew you the man - A. You said if I would go a mile or two, you would shew me the man they belonged to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not say I had a note in my pocket - A. He did, but I found no note on him when I searched him. I told him I should detain him - He wanted me to go on.</p>

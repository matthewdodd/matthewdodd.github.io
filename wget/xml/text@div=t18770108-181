I am seventeen years old and live three doors from Mr. Ford—on Sunday, 17th December, about 7 o'clock, I went out with Annie Berry to Holloway, and returned about 9 o'clock, and when we were in Fernand Street we went over to the North Western public-house and had a pint of ale, two or three lads came in and then Sheehan came in—we came out to the top of Ferdinand Place, and Sheehan and two others followed, but I did not see Shelley or Anderson—we were going home and they prevented our going down Ferdinand Place—we both ran away, and he chased us down the court—after Berry got in I ran down Chalk Farm Road into Fernand Street and got into Sussex Street, from where I could see Mr. Ford's shop, and saw Sheehan kicking the door, and Shelly pushing it with his hands, and Anderson standing at the public-house opposite with his hands in his pockets looking to see there was nobody coming—I saw the door opened, Sheehan went in and Shelly followed him in—I then went past the house to my own door, and then saw shelly come out with something in his hands, I do not know what—he gave it to Anderson who put it into his pocket and laughed—I told my mother next morning and she went to Mr. Ford.</p>

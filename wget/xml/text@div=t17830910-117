               <p>I am a shoemaker; Mr. Barton said, he had been robbed, and I heard the prisoner Thompson, on the Saturday after the robbery, at a publick house discoursing with another young man, and saying, that he and M'Cauley had robbed Barton, and M'Cauley had been a rogue to him; he said it was the night before, and that M'Cauley had got all the things; he did not say what they were.</p>
               <p>Court. Was M'Cauley there? - No, I went to M'Cauley for a pair of shoes, and the same young man was with him the same day, and I heard him say, he sold the things for fourteen shillings.</p>
               <p>What things? - Mr. Barton's things.</p>
               <p>Did he mention them as Mr. Barton's things? - Yes, he said that Thompson might lick him, and take the money from him if he would; nobody was by but the prisoner and me, and this young man.</p>
               <p>I suppose you was intimately acquainted with Thompson? - No, Sir, I was not, I got acquainted with him by using Mr. Barton's house.</p>
               <p>Did not you think it very odd that he should make such a discovery before you who was so little acquainted with him? - He did not make it to me.</p>
               <p>But he said it loud enough for you to hear? - Yes; I told Barton; this young fellow was there, and was telling him he had been a rogue to Thompson.</p>
               <p>Court. Who do you work for? - I work for Mr. Rogers in Goswell-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Thompson. I never was in the house.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. When did Ellis come and tell you of this? - On the Sunday, it was done on the Friday.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you robbed last month. - A. Yes, on the 13th of January, just about eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you going. - A. I was going home from town.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking. - A. I drank part of three pints of wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you intoxicated with liquor. - A. I was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it. - A. Very moon light.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell your story how you was accosted. - A. About half way from Pentonville and my house, I had turned out of the foot path into a grass field, it being the cleaner way to walk; I saw a man step over the rail just before me, and he says rather politely, have you got any money.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by rather politely. - A. He spoke so pleasant; I was surprised at the question, and I said, money! He said give me your money; I said give you my money; he said, yes, give me your money; I put both my hands in my breeches pockets and pulled out a penny from one pocket and sixpence from the other; I rather fumbled with the other, I took them out and held them to him, and he took them; we looked one another full in the face some little time, and he said how much is it; I was terrified at the question, and I saw his eyes recline downwards to the money that he held in his hand; when I perceived his eyes rather bent downwards I struck him on the side of his head, he had like to have fell, but did not; he staggered very much, he was very near falling; I then rushed on him and we grappled a great while, and at last he came down under me; I perceived his face as he lay under me unguarded; I struck him a very large blow on the nose. I struck him once or twice more but it had no effect, and I believe when his face was most unguarded he was pulling a bayonet from before him, I saw the bayonet and he was making towards me; I catched it in my hand; he had got the bayonet in his right hand and I catched it with my left; when I saw the bayonet I cried out very loudly murder, many times; and I held him down; he struggled very hard; I held him down a great while; he then got with his back upwards, each of us holding the bayonet; I was on his back, and when he offered to rise with his hands off the ground I tipped him down again; he immediately gets on his belly, and rose up in spite of me, and we had a long struggle; he was on his back, and when he offered to rise I tipped him down again; we laid looking at one another, and I said, have you met with your match; he says, will you let me up, I have not hurt you; I said you could not deliver your bayonet; he says I will, if you will let me up; I answered I will not; we were pretty still a bit longer; I said deliver your bayonet, he said again, I will if you will let me up; no, I wont, I said again, why do you not deliver your bayonet; he says, will you give it me again; I says I will - upon your honuor - upon my honour - you will give it me again upon your honour; I will give it you again upon my honour; he laid his hands down and was rather flat on his back; he says I have let go, and instantly I saw his hands unclasped; I then went to get up and he laid quite still; I got up and said, you are a dead man if you come near me, I thought he would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170004"></xptr>come and rush on me; he says give me the bayonet, it will betray me; I walked backwards some yards, I thought I heard a noise behind me; I looked and my son was coming as hard as he could; I said seize him, he has robbed me; I turned my head the other way, he was gone off, running very fast. I believe my son would have catched him but he fell down and so he got away; he ran one hundred yards after him, he did not get him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason of your delivering your money. - A. He demanded it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shew his bayonet at that time. - A. No, I saw the round of the bayonet; I thought it was a pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. So then under that apprehension you delivered your money. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar, is that the same man. - A That is the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might this take up. - A. Near a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. He was very agreeable at first I understood you. - A. The first question was very pleasant, the next question was very rough.</p>
               <p>Q. At first you were not alarmed. - A. I knew what he meant, I was alarmed and frightend sadly, I thought I saw a pistol about him.</p>
               <p>Q. You knocked him about pretty much. - A. I knocked him when he was down one blow.</p>
               <p>Q. That was rather cowardly. - A. I think if you were down with a man, and a drawn bayonet, you would have done the best you could.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always been of opinion that he is the man. - A. I know that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe at the magistrate's you said you thought he was the man. - A. You are wrong sir.</p>

            , there can be very little doubt of, after you have heard what the witnesses have said; and I think there can be little doubt of the person, of the prisoner; there can be no mistake in that. He tells you it was a clear moon light night, there was a tussel between the prisoner and him; that he got possession of the bayonet, and that his son came up to his assistance. It appears by the evidence on the next day, the prisoner appeared on the drill with his face bruised, as if he had been struck in fighting; the prosecutor has told you he gave him some strokes upon his face when he was down and he can swear to his person; this continued about a quarter of an hour, here further by the bayonei that i<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170005"></xptr>proved to be a bayonet belonging to a private of the same company, No. 38; the firelock is produced belonging to it, and when Bell went with the prosecutor to Lane, the prisoner saw him; he was going out on seeing Lane coming in; his comrade advised him to stand his ground. There seems to me very little doubt of the prisoner's guilt. The prisoner has called several witnesses, who has said that he was a hard working man till the time of his committing the robbery; that ought not to operate upon your verdict. We can only lament that a person who bore a good character, up to the time of committing such an offence as this, by doing this he had forfeited that good character.</p>

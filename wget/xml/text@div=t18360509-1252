                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Bartram. On Friday, the 22nd of April, application was mad by the prisoner to redeem this piece of silk which had been pawned by Duchene—he said nothing, but put the duplicate down with another, and redeemed two pledges at the same time, one being this piece of silk—that is the way persons usually redeem things—In consequence of what I had heard, I sent to the station-house, and before my messenger got there, Hoods came in and immediately went round, took him into custody, and took the silk from him—I had put the silk down, and he had paid for it, and had it in his possession—he took it off the counter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman, I went to Mr. Bartram's shop, and saw the prisoner there, finishing packing up a brown paper parcel—this silk was part of it—he then put it under his arm—I asked him where he got it from, putting my hand on it—he said, "From my home"—I asked him to walk along with me, and took him to Vine-street station-house—I took it from him at the station-house, opened the paper, and saw it was some silk, which Mr. King had given me a pattern of—I asked him then, where he got it from—he said, "I bought some pawnbroker's tickets of my lodger—I am a house-keeper"—I asked him where he lived—he replied,</p>

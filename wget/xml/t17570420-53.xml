We went to justice Manley and got a warrant to apprehend the prisoner, and a search warrant to search for the curtain. We were informed it was pawned. We soon apprehended the prisoner.

On the 3d of March the churchwarden call'd upon me, and told me he had an information where the curtain was; we went to Westminster together to Mr Appleton, who gave the information; he told us he could find the person presently that had the curtain. Then we went to the justice and got two warrants. I took the other curtain along with me, in order to compare it if I found it. We went to the pawnbroker's and shew'd her it, and she said she had the fellow to it.</p>

            . I live in Strutton Ground. On Monday about one o'clock, on the 28th of Feb. the prisoner came to my shop and brought a piece of crimson silk, which had been a curtain. I asked her whose it was; she said she was recommended to me because I would keep it clean, and said her husband had it in order to make a waistcoat. I lent her 18 d upon it. I never saw her in my life before or since till she was taken up. On the Thursday the overseer came to my house, and ask'd me if I had no prayer books, I said no; then he ask'd me if I had any crimson velvet or gold lace, I said no; then he took a search warrant out, and laid it on the counter. I said, gentlemen, I perceive you have been rob'd, if it is any thing in my possession I'll deliver it to you; he said he would not trust to that, he would search; I said and welcome Then he shew'd me the other curtain which he had in his bosom. I said I had the fellow to it. I shew'd it him, he ask'd me where the fringes and bindings were, and I said it was as I took it in: he ask'd where the person was that brought it, I said I should know her was I to see her; when I saw her, I said that was the person, it was the prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>Bright Wilmot. I was the constable, and took the prisoner up in St. Ann's lane, I have known her six or seven months. I was at the pawnbroker's and saw the curtain deliver'd.</p>

               <p>I was going along St. James's park with a shirt that I had to wash for a man, and saw something roll'd up before me; a man came behind me, who saw it; he ran and I ran, but he gather'd it up. I said halves, so he went home with me to my house, and let me have it, which was this curtain.</p>

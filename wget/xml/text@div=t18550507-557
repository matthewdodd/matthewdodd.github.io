                  </hi>. On 6th May, about 12 o'clock in the day, I was in Harrow-alley, Houndsditch, and saw the prisoner in front of me with his left arm in front of my breast—I felt a sudden pull at my waistcoat pocket, looked down, and saw my watch guard underneath his left arm, it still remaining round my neck—the end of the guard dropped from his hand, and my watch was gone—I took him by the collar; several other persons tried to free my hold to get him away; they tried to wrench my hand away, and then they unbuttoned his jacket and waistcoat, and tried to draw them over his head, but I got his head underneath my arm, and held him till an officer came—I never saw my watch again.</p>

I was sent by a gentleman to the spot, and found the last witness, the prisoner, and a crowd of thirty or forty thieves—I knew a portion of them—they were endeavouring to hustle the prisoner away from the last witness, but he gave him in charge for stealing his watch—I took him—he had no coat, waistcoat, or hat—there was a cry of "Rescue," and they tried to rescue him from me—I had great difficulty in getting him to the station—I found 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a duplicate, and a small memo<lb></lb>randum on him.</p>

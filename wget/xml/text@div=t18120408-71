               <p>Q. Was any body in company with you at the time you left the tavern - A. No. It was in the <placeName id="t18120408-71-crimeloc383">Little Minories</placeName>

               <p>Q. What were you knocked down with - A. I do not know, I suspect it was a fist, I had very black eyes the next day, and a black mark on my chin.</p>
               <p>Q. Were them from the effects of violence that you had received at that time - A. I think they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the person who knocked you down, come before you or behind you - A. I do not know, I believe there were three of them; I was so stunned with the blow that I could not observe what passed afterwards. Mr. Vickers, and a neighbour of his assisted me up and assisted me home; one took me of one side, and one the other. I immediately put my hand in my pocket, and said I missed my pocketbook.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time afterwards see the fifty-pound note, and the twenty-five-pound note? When did you go to the police office - A. About three or four days afterwards; I there saw the fifty and the twenty-five-pound note that I had been robbed of, at Lambeth-street office.</p>
               <p>MR. VICKER Q. On the night of the 11th of March were you in the Little Minories - A. Yes; I was passing through in my way home, I saw Mr. Saunders there, he was laying across the pavement, in the act of endeavouring to get up; I and another gentleman helped him home, he said he had missed his pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the appearance of being perfectly sober - A. No. He had the appearance of being in liquor.</p>

After I had talked to Aswell he took me to his master's work-shop, he took a bit of wood off a work-bench, and between that piece of wood and the work-bench was this fifty pound note, wrapped up in this bit of paper; No. 12,504, a fifty pound note, dated the 25th of January.</p>
               <p>Mr. Saunders. That is one of the notes I lost, I had written upon them the name of the person of whom I took them, and my own initials; I can swear to the notes, I took them of Mr. Price, a clerk in the public office. I took them about two days before I lost them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I believe you caused an advertisement to be made concerning the robbery, did you give the description of the note which was to compose your advertisement - A. I did not, Kinnersley gave it.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave Kinnersley the number - A. I did, he gave a wrong copy.</p>
               <p>Q. Now this is the advertisement, it is described No. 120,54 - A. The 0 is in the wrong place, I corrected the mistake as soon as I saw it, before my note was found.</p>
               <p>KINNERSLEY. I believe it was the printer's mistake, we issued an hundred more before the notes were found.</p>
               <p>NATHAN ASWELL. I am an apprentice to Mr. Aylett, he keeps the Blakeney's-head, Norton Falgate; he is a carpenter besides a publican. Miller and Smith came to me on Friday the 20th, and said they were sent by my master; I gave them the fifty-pound note which I had concealed, I had received that note of my mistress on the Tuesday before; she told me to take care of it; we had so many men in the shop, I did not know who they were, that was my reason for nailing it up in the way I did.</p>

               <p>Q. On the morning of the 12th of March do you recollect the prisoners coming to the public-house - A. Yes, both of them; they came between twelve and one; they had rum and some refreshment. Smith produced a fifty-pound note into my husband's hand, my husband gave it me to change, I gave them change, the prisoners came in together and went out together.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband was taken in custody, you got alarmed, you gave your apprentice this note to keep for you - A. I did, and here is a twenty-five pound note, my husband gave change for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about the prisoners - A. No, they had used the house about three or four months.</p>
               <p>Q. When the officers came to your house, do you mean to say you gave the same account then that you have now - A. I was taken at a disadvantage that morning for the safety of my husband, I said I know nothing of it.</p>

They both came on the 12th of March between ten and eleven o'clock, they staid about an hour and a half; Smith offered a twenty-five pound none to change, my wife was out, she keeps the cash. I went to Mr. Perkins the pawnbroker and obtained change of him; I gave Smith the change, Hayward was by at the time. After my wife came in they asked for change of a fifty-pound note, I gave the note to my wife, and she gave change for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You never said any thing about this until you were taken up yourself - A. No.</p>
               <p>ROBERT SUMMERS. I live with Mr. Perkins, pawnbroker, 52, Bishopgate-street. On the 12th of March I changed a twenty-five pound bank note for Mr. Aylett; this is the note. I wrote upon it the 12th of March, 1812.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. When Mr. Aylett came to Clerkenwell, I asked him if he meaned to swear our lives away, he said no, we were not the persons he took them off. I am innocent of the notes, Mr. Aylett he knows I did not give him the notes, nor his wife.</p>
               <p>Hayward said nothing in his defence.</p>

I heard the glass broken, and ran out—I saw Bowles holding the prisoner, with this watch in her hand—the other was picked up, and given to me—they are both Mr. Jones's—the window was broken, and several watches knocked down—Mr. Jones asked her what she broke the window for—she said, because she chose.</p>

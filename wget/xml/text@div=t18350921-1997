I live in Parrot-court, Playhouse-yard, with my father and mother—the prisoner has lived next door for sometime—on the 7th of September I was at play in the court—other children were playing there—I was playing with my pinafore, whishing it about—the prisoner was in the court—It happened to touch her; and she took a knief out of a little child's hand, and struck me on the face first with it, and then on the shoulder—she then ran in-doors; and from her own door, she ran into Mrs. Pearce's—I screamed out—my mother came and took me off to the doctor's—I had been whisking the pina<lb></lb>fore about for some time—she had not spoken to me about it before this—she told me get a bit of cane away from a little boy; and I said, "I have no business to do that"—I was running about and whisking my pinafore about—at the time she strike me, she caught hold of me by my sleeve with her left hand—I had no quarrel with the prisoner's children before this—they were always <hi rend="italic">heaving</hi> stones at me; and I had spoken to her about it, but she would not correct them—she said she would give me a mark—that was the week before she did it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of a potato-merchant of White<lb></lb>cross-street. On Monday, the 7th of September, I was in Parrot-court, and saw the girl standing against the flat corner of the wall—the prisoner was standing as if she was speaking to her—I saw the little girl run from the wall, and make three or four distinct strikes with the apron or pinafore at the prisoner—the child lost its balance in striking, and the prisoner shut her eyes, and put herself rahter forward, with her eyes partly closed, and rushed forward to catch hold of her, but the child passed under her right arm and ran up the court screaming, "She has scratched me," or "cut me," I cannot say which—she hardly touched the girl—she ender<lb></lb>voured to take hold of the child, but she passed under her arm and went away—I did not see her try to take hold of the cloth—It was mo<lb></lb>mentary—she hardly had time to lay hold of it—I recollect seeing the sis<lb></lb>ter standing at the window, exciting, the child to strike the woman—I did not see Deans there—I have not known the prisoner above a week—I never spoke to her but once previous to the accident.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Parrot-court. The prisoner lodged with me—I was out all day from eleven to after six o'clock on the day in question—when I came home the prisoner came up and said, "You are tired, will you have a cup of tea?"—she brought me a cup, and as she was turning back the girl took a cane from her boy—she wanted it, and would not give it to her—I said, "Do not raise a disturbance about it, I will get it for you"—the girl turned, and gave it to her mother—brother of the little girl came up and did that before her face—I said, "Never mind," then she came forward to my window, and I said, "Mrs. Pearce, I laid my dinner to-day, and laid two knivas on the table"—she staid there upwards</p>

               <p>of ten minutes talking to me with the knife in her hand—It had been found, and the girl came up with a napkin or cloth, and slapped her, first on the right side, then on the left, and then made a <hi rend="italic">glam</hi> at her right shoulder—the prisoner drew back, and she made a <hi rend="italic">glam</hi> at her right shoulder—then prisoner drew said, "God <hi rend="italic">drat</hi> you, am I to be murdered by you?"</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is a brazier, and lives in Long's buildings, Whitecross-street. I happened to go to Mrs. Pearce's on the 7th of September—the prisoner came to the window with a cup of tea, and was speaking about the young <hi rend="italic">girl</hi> taking the cane—I saw the little girl come up, and strike the prisoner once or twice with a pinafore round her face—the prisoner pulled it off her face, and shoved her away with the hand the knife was in, and that is how the accident happened—It was done in an instant, with one blow—I never spoke to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I do not know the prisoner. On the day in question, I law her come up to the door with a knife in her hand—I saw the little girl come and strike her three times in the face, and then she seized hold of her arm, and tore her dress; and when I came down, I saw the little girl bleeding—after it happened, the prisoner said she was sorry for what she had done, that it was done momentarily, only was not aware she had the knife in her hand at the time.</p>

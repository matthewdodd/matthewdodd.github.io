                  </hi>. I live at 13, Bedfordbury, and am an unfortunate—on the morning of 25th February, between 7 and 8, the prisoner came to my room and brought some gin with her—Elizabeth West was present—we all had a glass of gin, and some beer as well—the prisoner was intoxicated—Elizabeth West and I were in bed when the prisoner came home, and she laid down in the same bed with us—West got up between 8 and 9 o'clock, and went out to get some breakfast, and returned at 12 with Ann Allen—they were both the worse for liquor, and West was the worst, she was carried up stairs—the prisoner said to me that she had been robbed of three sovereigns out of her mouth while she was asleep—I told her that they had not done it, and she took up a knife and began swearing a great deal—she said to West and Allen that if they did not return her the change, if they had the money, she would bleed them—West told her she had not got the money, and had not seen it—she stabbed Allen first on her forehead, and then she stabbed West; there was one wound and some slight wounds on the back of her head—she was confined five days, and attended by the doctor at Charing Cross Hospital.</p>

No; they were with me about five minutes - it was not a very light night; I saw the prisoner on the Saturday morning afterwards; he was then going to Mr. Clark, who is a magistrate, with my witness - he did not tell me he was going in consequence of its having been reported that he was concerned in this - I cannot swear to the knife found on the prisoner; I saw the knife when the prisoner used it, but I cannot swear whether it was a clasp-knife or a table-knife - I believe the knife found on him is such as persons in his situation are in the habit of using - it was twenty or twenty-five minutes past eight o'clock; it was not half-past - I had walked my horse all the way from Uxbridge, which was two miles- I had not my watch with me, I had left that and five sovereigns at home.</p>

            . I am a farmer, and live at Ickenham, near Harefield. I have known the prisoner for eight years - on the evening of the 3rd of October, I saw him about eight o'clock, it might be five minutes before or after - he was near Ickenham church; he was running first, and there was a person behind him; that was about half a mile from Mr. Clark's premises - I passed by them, and went into a public-house; they were then standing still - there are three turnings there; one leads to Uxbridge, one to Ruislip - I staid in the public-house twenty or twenty-five minutes; I saw Norris the same night at a neighbour's house of mine - I saw the prisoner on the Saturday morning; he came to my house, knocked at the door, and asked if I was at home; I had seen him, and called to him to come in - he came in and said,"Master, I understand that you have given me a very pretty character - you have set it about that I am concerned in the robbing of this man" - I told him no, I had not, but from the description Norris had given of the man, I suspected it was him - he said directly,"I am innocent" - I said, "If you are, the groom and his master are coming to the magistrate at ten o'clock this morning, and if I were you, I would appear before him and prove myself so" - he went away, and about half-past ten o'clock, I saw Norris and his master come down; they did not stop at my house, but went on to the magistrate's - the prisoner came in about ten minutes after, and he said to me, "Master, they are gone down I understand, and I thought they might have stopped here" - I said, "No, they did not, but you had better go down and meet them" - he went out in the direction towards the magistrate's; he met two men whom he knew, and stood talking with them; I followed him and said, "Come Tom, we will go down together" - when we got to the magistrate's door, we met Norris on horseback; he said to me, "You are the person the magistrate wants to see" - I turned round, pointed to the prisoner, and said to Norris, "Do you know this man?" he said, "Yes, that is the man that stopped me, and I can swear to him from five hundred" - the prisoner made answer, "I am<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170048"></xptr>innocent, I know nothing of the charge" - we then went before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not the place at which you saw the prisoner, about eight o'clock that night, in the direction to Harefield? A. A little; he could have gone to one place or another; there are three turnings - I have known the prisoner eight years, and never knew any thing dishonest of him - he has been a hard-working industrious man.</p>

               <p>MR. DOANE. Q. How came you to recollect the time that night? A. I was just going to bed and I make it a rule to look at the clock when I go to bed - I have always stated the same time as I do now; I have never said it was a quarter before nine o'clock when he came in - I will swear I never said so - I will positively swear that he came in about twenty minutes before nine o'clock, according to my clock.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Do you look at the clock every night? A. Yes; I generally go to bed between eight and nine o'clock; I cannot tell what time I went to bed on the 1st of October, nor on the 5th, but I can remember going to bed at twenty minutes before nine o'clock on the 3rd, by the children saying about my son coming home on that night; they reminded me of it after the charge - my son did not go out again that night - I heard him come to bed, but he did not come into the room I was in; if he had gone out I must have heard him.</p>

My money and Watch were in my Fob. I staid till 2 or 3 in the morning, and fell asleep, and the Woman went away; when I wak'd I miss'd my money and my Watch, I call'd the Chamberlain Wood, and told him I had been robbed, and at last he told me after some Disputes that he had got the Watch; how came you by it? says I. Why, says he, as the Women were going out, I saw the Chain hang out of one of their Bosoms, and so I brought her in again, and asked if you had lost any thing? And you said, No; but when I went again next Day, he told me, that seeing the Watch hanging loose about me, he took it away to take care of it.</p>
               <p>Wood. Was you Drunk or Sober? Salmon. No; I can't say I drunk, I was only a little merry and foolish. Wood. Was it not the publick Taphouse that you sat in? Salmon. Yes. Wood. You said it was a Close-Room. Salmon. Close? Why, yes, it was not in the open Yard.</p>
               <p>1 Watchman. Two or three Nights after this, the Prisoners were brought before me and the City Marshal. Wood said, that the Prosecutor coming in suddled with 2 Women, he mistrusted they would rob him, and therefore desir'd his Master not to let them go, without acquainting the Prosecutor with it, and

               <p>2 Watchman. I heard Peg say, that she had a Guinea and a Half of the Gentleman's Money from Bess. That same Bull-Inn is a House of ill Repute, several such People have been taken out of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Such Houses ought to be suppress'd, they ought to be prosecuted as common Baudy Houses.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wood. My Mistress shew'd the Prosecutor and the 2 Women into the Taphouse; one of the Women said she knew him. I desir'd my Master, to watch the Women; they had 4 Pints of Wine, the Prosecutor gave me half a Guinea to change, and fell a-sleep. One of the Women was making her escape, I brought her back and waked him, and said, Are you sensible? and he answer'd, Yes. Then see if you have lost nothing, says I, 3 or 4 times over; he fell in a Passion, Damn you, says he, what's that to you, they have got nothing but what I gave them freely; so the Women went away, and I perceiving he held his Watch dangling upon his Finger, I was afraid he would-spoil it, and desir'd him to let me take care of it for him, and so he gave it me; I desir'd him to go to Bed, but he said, he would sleep there, and so he did, he lay and slept, and piss'd about the Floor with his Cloaths all unbutton'd; I sat up for him, and he call'd me about 2, and I gave him the Watch without any Words.</p>

My Wife shew'd them into the Taphouse, and then went to Bed; about a 11 I lighted a Man out of the Gate, and 1 of the Women follow'd, and was going to get out too; but the Chamberlain ( Wood ) call'd to me to stop her, and so I brought her back, and both the Women went away soon after. The Chamberlain and I going into the Taphouse, found the Prosecutor with his Breeches down,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173209060052"></xptr> his Shirt hanging out, and all bepiss'd under him, he was fast a-sleep, and we could not wake him, to get him to Bed. The Chamberlain gave me a Watch to take care of, and so I went to Bed, and bid him sit up, and next Morning I gave him the Watch again, and he gave it to the Prosecutor. Wood is a very honest man, I have trusted him with hundreds of Pounds.</p>

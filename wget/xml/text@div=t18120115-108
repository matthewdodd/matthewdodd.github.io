               <p>MRS. YOUNG. About four o'clock on the afternoon of the 30th of December the prisoner came into our house to have a pint of porter; she stood by our fire; she had the child with her; and there was a girl looked in our window about ten years of age. I went out to the door, the girl told me that there was a woman in the tap-room by the fire that took the little boy's pinafore from him and had put it her pocket; I came in and asked her what business she had with the child's pinafore; she said she had taken it to fill it full of apples; it was her brother's child. I told her apples were too dear to fill a pinafore with apples; I detained her; a person in our parlour took her to Lambeth-street office.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the pinafore - A. In her pocket; I told her to take it out, and she took it out; I took it out of her hand.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not take the pinafore off.</p>

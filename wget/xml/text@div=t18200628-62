            . I am a constable of Queen-square. I apprehended the prisoner in Covent-garden market on the 10th of June; I took him to a public-house and searched him - it was with great difficulty that I got this key and a handkerchief from him; he particularly resisted about the key, which was fastened to his braces in his breast - he said he lived in Clare-market; I asked where in Clare-market? he said that made no odds to me, he should stop till he got before the Magistrate. He told the Magistrate that he lived at No. 18, Haughton-street - I went, and found he did live there - it is in the neighbourhood of Clare-market, but whether it leads into it or not I cannot say. I found a letter in his pocket, directed to him at a stand in Clare-market, but could find no stand of his there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The letter has a post-mark on it -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280031"></xptr>A. Yes; it is a summons to the Court of Requests. I have no doubt but Haughton-street leads into Clare-market.</p>

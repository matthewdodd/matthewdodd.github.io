We had not been there long, before we perceived the Prisoner looking out of his Window up one Pair of Stairs; and the Street-Door being open, I sent the Deceased over, and in a few Minutes follow'd myself. When I came to the Stairs-Head, I found him pale and bloody; I took him down, put him into. Coach, and by the Time we came to the End of Gerrard-street, he died, I perceiv'd he had receiv'd two Wounds with a Sword one in the Left side, and a deeper in the Right. I ask'd the Prisoner how he could be so barbarous? And he answer'd, he would have kill'd more of us if he could.</p>

             thus deposed: I had a Warrant against the Prisoner at the Suit of Mrs. Clements for 30 l. and going to execute it, I met Mr. Davis, who I found waited for the same Man. I went to the George Alehouse at the Corner of Mackert's-Court, opposite to the House where the Prisoner lodged. But there being no Room there that commanded the Prisoner's Chamber, I watched the Room of the Oxford Arms, where Davis and his Man were waiting; not doubting, but when they saw an Opportunity of taking the Prisoner, I should see one of them come out, and then I intended to be before-hand with them. But however, Davis's Man stept in before I was aware of him; for the first Suspicion that I had of his being there, was my hearing a Pistol go off; upon which I stept up: I found the Deceased bloody, and the Prisoner walking about in his Wastecoat and Slippers; and perceiving him to have no Weapons in his Hand, I presently arrested him; and in carrying him down Stairs, I met Mr. Davis, who assisted me to get him into the Coach. I asked him how he could kill the Men? and whether his Door was broke open? He said, the Door was not lock'd; but the Deceased coming in without knocking, he took him for a Thief; and if I had been there, he would have serv'd me in the same manner; and ask'd for what he was arrested? I told him for 30 l. To which he answer'd, that he thought it had been for 150 l. and if he had known as much before, he believ'd this had never happen'd. Mr. Moor the Surgeon deposed, that the Deceased had three Wounds; but the only one that he believed mortal, was between the 5th and 6th Rib, and divided the Arteries. The Prisoner then made his Defence.</p>

             thus deposed: I was Nurse to Capt. De le Gall's Wife, who at that time was very ill, and in Expectation of wanting the Midwife's Assistance. She was leaning upon the Captain's Arm to support herself, and I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172508270004"></xptr> sweeping under the Bed, with my Back to the Door, when I heard a Noise at the Door, and presently it was forced open, (for I had locked it but a few Minutes before.) I turned about, and saw the Deceased in the Room. He asked, if Capt. De le Gall lived there? The Captain ask'd him, what he wanted? The Deceased made no Answer, but stood learning upon his Cane, and looking about the Room. The Captain then told him he believ'd he was a Rogue, and bade him be gone at his Peril; but he not going, the Captain stept back to take up his Sword, and the Deceased ran up with his Cane in his Hand, struck the Captain, and said, G - D - ye, I'll have ye. Then the Deceased closed with him, and threw him down in a Corner of the Room: They got up again; a Pistol lay upon the Chest of Drawers; both of them strove to take it up, and in the Struggle it went off; but did no Harm, except burning the deceased's Shirt. The Captain had his Sword in his Hand, the Deceased ran upon him, collar'd him, dragg'd him to the Door, and endeavour'd to throw him down Stairs; but they both fell, at the Stairs-Head, the Deceased being undermost.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner's Son thus deposed: Our Chamber-Door was broke open, the Box of the Lock was almost forced off, and some of the Nails fell into the Room; the Deceased came in and asked for Capt. De le Gall: My Pappa said, What do you want? - Get you gone at your Peril. The Deceased made no Answer, but struck my Pappa with his Cane; my Pappa retreated, and took his Sword off the Table; the Deceased ran upon him, and swore, G - D - me, I'll have you with me; and so he collar'd my Pappa, and threw him down; and seeing a Pistol on the Drawers, the Deceased dragg'd him thither, and endeavour'd to take it up; my Pappa strove to hinder him, and in the Struggle it went off. Then he hauled my Pappa to the Door, and they both fell down together.</p>
               <p>Two or three other Witnesses were produced, who gave an Account, that there was a Lock on the Door, and a Bolt in the Lock; but that the Bolt was defective, and therefore the Door was usually kept lock'd; and that the Nails of the Lock were forced out, and found upon the Floor; and that those Nails produced in Court were the same. It appearing to the Jury, that the Deceased was no Officer, that he had no Authority to execute the Process in the Absence of the Officer, that he never did declare or tell the Purpose of his coming, and that he struck and abus'd the Prisoner, they found him <rs id="t17250827-34-verdict140" type="verdictDescription">

            . I am a waiter at the <placeName id="t18241202-167-crimeloc933">St. Alban's coffee-house, Charles-street</placeName>

I saw the prisoner on the 24th of November, between four and five o'clock, in the coffee-room. I was in the passage looking through the window, and saw him taking a spoon - he went out, and then went into the United Service Club - he asked for some gentleman's address, which I did not hear - he then went into Regent-street, and crossed the way. I followed, and stopped him. I said, he must go back with me to the St. Alban's coffee-house - on our way back, he said, he had got the spoon, and hoped Mr. Thornton would forgive him, as he was in distress - the spoon was found on the sideboard after we brought him back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say I would go back and be searched; but I had not got the spoon. - A. No; you confessed that you had got it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The waiter is under a mistake respecting the spoon - when he followed me and accused me of it, I was agitated, and do not know what I said - when we got back, there was nobody in the coffee-room but us; there was a great deal of exasperating language between us. I approached the table where their tea-tray was, and said, "You said, there were two spoons, and there they are." I have not taken one. I took up one of them; but I had not had it before - we were both in a state of exasperation, and what language I might have made use of, I do not know - the spoon was on the cloth, not the sideboard.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WINTER re-examined. There was no exasperation at all - the spoon had been taken from a saucer on the table, where I had not put it more than three minutes - there were two spoons - the other was in the sugar basin. I missed the spoon, and immediately followed him into the street - when the prisoner was taken, he gave the name of Burgess.</p>

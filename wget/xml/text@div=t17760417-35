               <p>I am a constable; upon Tuesday the 12th of March, when I was on duty, a man came down to the watch-house a little after eleven o'clock, said a person had been robbed; I went and took the prisoner out of bed; I thought his countenance betrayed him; I took him to the watch-house and found four shillings and three half-pence upon him; I desired the people to search the room; they found the half-crowns and a buckle over the door; I asked if they were his; he said, no: while he was getting up I saw a buckle in his shirt breast which corresponded with that over the door. He wanted to see the prosecutor, but I did not take him to him; he hesitated some time, and then declared he opened the man's box on Sunday, and took out a pair of silver buckles, and eleven half guineas, four shillings, and two sixpences; I asked him what he had done with the money; he said the two half-crowns and the four shillings were part of it; that he had laid out some, and had hid nine half guineas in the ground in Paddington fields, but that it was impossible for me to find it unless he went with me, and he would carry me to the place; this was about two o'clock in the morning: I handcuffed him, and with assistance took him near to George's burying ground at Paddington; he shewed me the spot where it was buried; he took up a dirty paper in which was nine half guineas and one guinea; he said he had sold the buckles to a pawnbroker the same evening; I went to the pawnbroker's, but the pawnbroker said he had sold them.</p>

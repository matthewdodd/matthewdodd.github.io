                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector, Criminal Investigation Department</hi>). I have from time to time received information about 89 and 91, Long Lane, Bermondsey; they were one house, but it has been re-numbered—I applied for a warrant at the beginning of May, which was granted, and executed by two officers, Walsh and Harvey—I was at the station when Holmes was brought in; I saw him searched, and I looked over the papers that were taken from him; these are them. (<hi rend="italic">These were three cheques for</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">drawn by F. Jackson and Co. in favour of C. J. Holmes, and various other papers</hi>.) I went to 91, Long Lane, at 7 o'clock on the evening of 10th May, directly after Holmes was brought in; it was baker's shop, with the name of Holmes outside, and arranged on shelves round the shop inside were 23 empty butter firkins, 20 empty cheese boxes, 14 empty biscuit boxes, and some dummy cheeses arranged carefully on the shelves round the shop, and painted in large letters round the shop were "Choicest dairy provisions, rich old Cheshire and other cheeses, prime mild Wiltshire and other bacons, prime Devon and Dorset butters"—I did not find the smallest particle of butter, cheese, bacon, or anything else; I found some bread, and some flour in small paper bags similar to the bag found in Holmes's pocket—outside, on the lamp, was "Bread, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per quartern," and that was also marked on the window with chalk—there was a bakehouse, and two sacks of flour—I searched the house and brought away a sack full of letters and papers; they consisted of orders for goods, and commission from every part of England respecting flour, provisions, and other articles, and a large number of answers—while I was searching the shop a man brought in a County Court writ, and I found about 40 or 50 County Court summonses; there were judgments amongst them—I found no general business books; there were small account books for credit customers—I Handed the papers I found to Mr. Wontner—on Monday morning, 31st May, I went to Lawrence's premises, 19, Charing Cross; he occupied the first floor back room over the shop, and written on the door was "H. Law<lb></lb>rence and Co., the Accidental and General Arbitration Company'—the room was very scantily furnished—I found there papers and books which I took away, and cards with "H. Lawrence and Co., rectifiers and cordial manu<lb></lb>facturers" on them; also a lot of bill-heads of "The Accidental and General</p>

               <p>Arbitration Company, 19, Charing Cross, London, all communications to be addressed to the manager, Mr. H. Lawrence"—I found some large bills on coloured paper, on which was printed "The Princess Royal Arabian Tonic, solely imported by H. Lawrence and Co."—there were no business books such as are generally found in an office—I saw the landlord and he made a communication to me—I looked into the books; I did not find a single entry this year; those that were there were for very small amount; the largest was a little over 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found a mere handful of papers; they are here—I can't recollect whether there were any County Court summonses—I have had charge of several prosecutions of this kind—I remember one against Ruppert, Case, and Grouer, a few sessions back; they were convicted and sentenced to five years' penal servitude.</p>

It was at 7 p.m. that I went to Holmel's shop; I found bread and flour, but no other articles of provision—there were some small tin boxes; some of them had concentrated essence of meat—I only took away a sample of the flour bags, there were a great many on the premises—I saw his wife at the shop, and a publican, who lives within a few doors—there was a girl serving in the shop, no one else—I said before the magistrate that the shop had the appearance of being well furnished; a casual observer from outside would believe that all the cases and casks were filled, that they were genuine—I have seen some dummy cheeses and things in other shops, but I never saw a whole place so filled—I have known this shop a good many years, but did not know who occupied it; I believe, from my inquiries, Holmes's father kept it for some years.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Laurence.</hi> Your place contained about six chain, a carpet in the middle of the room, and a table—I considered it very shabby—your landlord did not tell me that you had paid 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the furniture—I am not aware that you had a sleeping partner named Boss, of Great George Street, or that you had carried on business at 16, Burton Crescent; I made no inquiry there—I cannot speak of the contents of your books; I only looked at the date of the latest order—I found two letters from you as Holmes.</p>

On Saturday, May 29, I went with Harvey to 52, Manor Place, Walworth—I there found Lawrence and a woman who he represented to be his wife in aback room on the ground floor—I told him I had a warrant for his apprehension for being concerned with Holmes—it was a very small room with a bed in it, a chest of drawers, one or two chairs, and several other little things—what I found on him I handed over to Inspector Fox—next day I went to Hiscock's place, 19, Houghton Road, Peckham; I found him in bed in the back room with his wife—it was a new house; he occupied the downstairs part—I found on him some papers, which I handed to Inspector Fox—before I went to Hiscock's I knew of two persons named Laird and Gear; I had apprehended them months before; I had seen Hiscock in their company the day I arrested them, and followed them all through the City—I have also seen Lawrence in Holmes's company—I arrested Vincent at 217, Hill Street, Walworth, on 14th June; he occupied one room, a front room first floor—I found these papers and 16 pawn<lb></lb>tickets</p>

On Saturday evening, 29th May, I was with Sergeant Walsh near the corner of Lower Bland Street, and saw Furington in the street there with several others—I said to him "Mr. Fox wrote to see you at the station about Holmes's case"—he said "I expected I should have been called in it"—I took him into custody and took him to the station—I then went to his house, 52, Great Dover Street, and searched it; I found a lot of papers, which I put together in a bag sad gave to Inspector Fox—Farrington's place was tolerably well fur<lb></lb>nished; he had not the whole house; he had some lodgers upstairs; it was not a place of business; there was not the least sign of business about the place; it was more than one room—I Went with Walsh to the Cemetery Road, Nunhead, where Dover lives—Walsh went to the front door and hocked repeatedly—I went to the back and saw Dover come out at the back and go down the garden—a uniform man called to him, and he turned back and went into a water-closet—we waited till he came out—I read the warrant to him—he said "I have given Holmes bills of accommodation, but I have never swindled any one"—I searched the house and found a bag full of papers, which I took to the station and gave to Inspector Fox—Dover's house was in a beastly state; it was a four-roomed house—all the windows were out in some places—it was not a house of business—it was in a fearful state; if we walked across the kitchen our feet slipped in human dirt and cats' and dogs' dirt—the stink was enough to suffocate one—I went twice to Lawrence's office, 19, Charing Cross—I have heard Inspector Fox's description of it, and agree with him—I was with Walsh when he took Lawrence into custody at 52, Manor Place—the description he has given of the room is correct.</p>

Before trusting Farrington I made inquiries of Seth Taylor and others; in consequence of those inquiries I called on him and he gave me an order—he was not introduced to me by my of the prisoners, and he did not directly introduce any of them to me; Holmes said he knew me through Farrington; I call that an introduction—Farrington came in while George Holmes was there, and seeing him, he said, "what a fool I was to give him your name"—and Holmes said to Farring<lb></lb>ton, "I will wait outside till you transact your business"—I had not made any inquiry of Farrington about George Holmes; I asked Lawrence what he knew about Holmes—I had heard that there was a gang of them trading as a long firm; I told Lawrence that—Lawrence told me that Farrington was a poor man, and could not be engaged in big transactions; that was after I had supplied him—this all took place about a week or so before the affair came on at Southwark Police-court—I can't say the dates—Farrington kept out of the way—I called at his residence several times; I saw him one Saturday evening, and the detectives took him while I was talking to him—he had told me that he could not carry on his trade unless he got the usual monthly credit he offered to pay, and said he had the money in his pocket, but I did not see it, or I would have grabbed it—I saw his brother; I don't think I asked him to pay me.</p>

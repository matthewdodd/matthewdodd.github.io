            . I am an officer. I went to search the prisoner's lodging - I found him and his mother there; I asked if he had robbed his master, he said he had not: I found three keys on him, and this cane was in a drawer - he said, a boy who had lived at Mr. Robinson's before him, gave it to him - and his mother said he had brought it home a long time before and given it to his father. I then asked if they had any other rooms; she said they had a room up stairs - I went up and saw a box which the prisoner said had been his at Mr. Robinson's - he unlocked it, and I found in it some duplicates, which he said related to his own property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you find any thing on his person? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. ROBINSON re-examined. This is my cane - I had seen it on my premises after the prisoner came into my service - the person who lived with me before was William Billinghurst. I did not know the prisoner's father.</p>

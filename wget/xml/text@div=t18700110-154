               <p>Street—I know the prisoner, he came to me on 27th November last, and gave me an envelope, sealed—he did not say anything—I opened it—it contained this cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a note, which I believe to be from the Rev. Mr. Gleadall—I don't know what has become of the note, I have looked for it and could not find it; it was to the effect that Mr. Gleadall was out of cheques, and being Saturday night and past banking hours, would I be kind enough to cash this, as he had not enough to meet demands—I cashed it; I sent it to the bank in the ordinary course, and it was returned marked as a forgery.</p>

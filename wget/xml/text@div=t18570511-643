On 30th March the prisoner came for half an ounce of tobacco—I weighed it and held it in my hand—I saw him lay down a half crown on the counter—I took it up, and told him it was a bad one—he said that it was not—I told him it was, and I would not return it to him—he used very bad language, and said that if I did not return it he would stab me—a person went for a constable, but before be came the prisoner went away—I marked the half crown, and gave it to the inspector at the station in the constable's presence—this was about 8 o'clock in the evening—I had seen the prisoner before.</p>

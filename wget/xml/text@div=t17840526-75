You may think yourself very fortunate, that from some circumstances which the tenderness of the law in favour of life has enabled me to distinguish in this indictment, so as not to render it capital, your life is saved; but your crime is certainly of a very aggravated nature, especially as a servant living in a family, and plundering every thing that came to your hands; this entirely destroys all the comfort and security of private families, and renders it difficult to know whom we can trust: it is therefore necessary that examples should be made; it was the wish of your master (not knowing that the tenderness of the law would do it) to save your life; but I should think myself wanting in justice if I carried the favour of the Court any further, and no punishment short of death is too much for your offence; the sentence of the law upon you therefore is, that you be</p>

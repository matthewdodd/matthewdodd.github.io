                  </hi>. I am a police-constable of the Great Western-railway, stationed at Paddington. On the 21st of Aug. I saw the prisoner loading his cart against the platform in the goods-shed, within the station—he was car<lb></lb>man to Mr. Wright, of Smithfield, and came there for goods he was to receive—I saw him covering over something in the cart, and asked what he was concealing—he said, "Nothing"—I stepped into the cart, took the straw off, and found a bag containing this rope—I asked how he came by it—he said one of the porters gave it him—I asked him to point out the porter, and he pointed out Thomas Wright, a porter in the employ of the Company—I called Wright, and said, "How came you to give this man this rope, belonging to the Company?"—he said they were old pieces of junk and useless pieces, which he had collected for some time, and thought they were his perquisites—I knew very well there were no perquisites allowed for any servant—I detained the prisoner and Wright—Mr. Powell came up, and Wright said to him, "Mr. Powell, I hope you will forgive me, and allow me to take the bag out of the cart"—I then took the prisoner and Wright to the police-station—the pri<lb></lb>soner there said he bought it at the rate of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt., and paid Wright half-a-crown for it—here are pieces of new rope of different lengths, and pieces of old—here are 70lbs. of it, worth 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk in the goods department of the Great Western Railway. On Friday morning, the 21st. of Aug., I went to where the prisoner was—O'Hara pointed out to me a bag of rope—Wright said to me, "I hope you will allow me to take it down again, I did not mean any<lb></lb>thing wrong"—I said I should go and tell the superintendent—Wright said, "I hope you will forgive me this time, I never did anything of the kind before"—at the station Watkins said he bad given at the rate of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt. for it, and he had given half-a-crown—he said it weighed 2qrs. 20lbs.—it was afterwards weighed, and weighed about 70lbs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">cross-examined. Q.</hi> Wright had been for some time in the Company's employ. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About nine months—he had been a sailor, and he had the job of splicing old ropes or replacing the ropes—he had not the care of the ropes—he ought to have given them up—he only had them for the time being—they must have gone through his hands—he had not to give out the rope to others to use—Giles kept the store of the rope, and had to give it out to Wright as he asked for it—no one had the rope to use but Wright—he was to use it for the Company's business—if any part of it became unfit for use it was his duty to return it to the store directly—he had no authority to keep</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of the Railway Company at the Paddington station.

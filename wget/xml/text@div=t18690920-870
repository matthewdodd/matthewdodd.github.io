                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Anderson, and keep a fancy shop, at 90, Plumstead Road—about three weeks before the 23rd August the prisoner called with some fancy inks, and on the 23rd he called again for the money, and was paid—he had a bottle of ginger beer—I had occasion to go up stairs, and left him in the sitting room—I came down a few minutes after, the prisoner was gone, and I missed a watch from the mantel-piece—it was there when I went up stairs—I went in search of the prisoner, and found him on the Woolwich steamboat pier—I said, "You know what I have come for"—he said he had no idea—I then told him he had taken a watch from the parlour mantel-piece—he said he had done no such thing; he was a perfect gentleman—I asked him to walk back to the house with me, and he consented to do so—I changed my mind, and took him to the police-station—before I got there, he asked me not to go any farther with it, and not to be foolish—I then asked for the watch, and he gave it me—it was the very one I had missed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Detective R</hi>). I received the prisoner into custody on the 23rd August, on the charge of stealing a watch—he made no answer at first; he afterwards said he did not intend to steal it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was in the sitting room with her sister. The watch was shown to me. When I went out I had not the remotest idea it was in my pocket. Immediately Mrs. Anderson came to me I said, "Non-sense, "and put my hand in my pocket. I found I had it, and gave it her directly. She said, "Come along with me;" I thought she was going to take me to her home. I said, "It was done in all fun," and asked her not to take me into a police-office. She said she would, and I went with her, and let the policeman search me.</p>

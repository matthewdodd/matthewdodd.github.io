I am in the prisoner's employ—he is an auctioner and estate agent—he was with Mr. Cahill at 8, Atlantic Terrace, Brixton, and then he went by himself to 3, Railway Approach, Brixton, where he carried on business—I took sums of money to the Birkbeck Bank for him—I remember in October this year carrying some money to the bank—I don't recollect the date—I recollect taking 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in gold—it was near the 16th September—there were two gentlemen, one put the folio on the paper and the other took the money—I am quite sure of paying that amount—I was in the habit of paying money in at different times—I recollect taking a parcel to the bank—I don't remember the date I gave it to one of the gentlemen at the counter—I picked him out after I left the Police Court—he opened the parcel, and took the letter in to Mr. Ravenscroft, in the glass case—I copied the letter that I took to the bank in the press—this is the copy—I wetted the paper and put it in the press, and gave it back afterwards to Mr. Barnett—I remember taking some money from Mr. Barnett to Mr. Cahill—I don't remember when that was—I received a receipt from Mr. Cahill's clerk—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "11th October, 1873, 116, Chancery Lane, Received of Mr. Barnett, the sum of 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account of sale of Warrington's effects.

Hoare—I don't know how it came to go through them—it was five days in my possession—I told Mr. Barnett the same day that I wont to the bank, they had marked it "Orders not to pay," and it was taken up the day after—the guinea cheque was to try the bank—when I told Mr. Barnett that the cheque had been marked "Orders not to pay," he said he had never given an order to stop that cheque, but he did tell me that the mistake with the bank was over the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the one guinea cheque was drawn on 6th November, to see whether the bank would pay the amount, and they did not—I afterwards drew the 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I took a letter up with the cheque.</p>

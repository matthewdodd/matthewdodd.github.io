I am a shoemaker, of 1, Blossom-place, Norton Folgate—on 10<hi rend="italic">th</hi> April last, the prisoner, her husband, and three children occupied the second floor of that house—the youngest child was named James, and was 8 or 9 months old—I saw the child after it was picked up—it was not then dead—it died About 6 that night—I had seen the prisoner three times that day—the first time was about 9 in the morning—they were going on very noisily, and I went up and saw her standing near the window with the child in her arms—her husband was with her—she was halloing out in a very senseless state, so that people were coming round to see what was going on—I stopped there till she was quiet, and then went down—about half—past 1, I was called up again by the little boy and girl—I found the prisoner standing in the doorway—I caught hold of her, and she dropped the child to the ground—I thought she was out of her mind—the little boy, ten years old, took the child from the ground—the husband came and took her on his knee, and I went down again; between 3 and 4 o'clock I went up again, hearing a noise, the poor woman was screaming—I saw her standing near the window—the upper part of the window was down, and she had her bands raised like, hanging onto it—the</p>

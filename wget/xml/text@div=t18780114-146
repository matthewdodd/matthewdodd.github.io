I am 16 years old, and live at 30, Alfred Street, Camberwell, with my parents—I was van guard to the prisoner on 27th October—we left the Chatham and Dover yard at 11 a.m.—the van was empty—we went to Thames Street and got some hops, and presently went to Mr. Bowles's in Smithfield—the prisoner then got down from the van, and told me to run up to Wright's to see if there was anything for the Chatham and Dover Company—I went and was away two minutes—when I came back the prisoner was not with the van, but came a few minutes afterwards—the tarpauling was covered over the van—I went to George Yard—Ridley told me to go—I do not know where he went, but he went away—it took me two or three minutes to go to George Yard—on my way I noticed, for the first time, two firkins of butter in the van under the tarpauling—I did not know if they were there when I went to Wright's—Ridley joined me and the van is the Old Bailey—we called at the booking-office there—I was in there five minutes—we then went to Lavender's—I went in—Ridley stayed with the van—I came out, but saw no more of the van—I went to our booking-office—a man outside told me to—I saw the prisoner there—he was not with the van—I went</p>

                  </hi>. I found the two firkins of butter at 3, Park Place, on Sunday evening, 29th October—I showed them to the witnesses, who identified them as Mr. Bowles's property—I took the prisoner—he said he knew nothing about them—he thought there was something the matter as a South-Western man had told him he was suspected of steal<lb></lb>ing them—then he said he had a bad leg, and that accounted for his absence on the previous day.</p>

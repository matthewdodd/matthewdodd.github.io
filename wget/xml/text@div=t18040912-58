               <p>- FURNET sworn. - I am a patrol on the Commercial-road; on the 30th of July, a quarter before four o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner come by on the opposite side of the road; I came out of my box, and asked him what he had got under his right arm; I insisted upon seeing; he said, what was it to me, it was a likely matter he should let me see what he had got; he made a bit of a run, and I ran after him; I told him, if he did not bring to, I should fire into him; with that he dropped the parcel, and run as hard as he could push; I did not run above seven or eight fathoms after him; I knew him; I took up this property, and took it to Stepney lock-up house, and when I let it be known there were most of the people knew him, for he formerly laid about the premises there; I knew him very well by seeing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180409120061"></xptr>him come out of the strawhouse, and by taking him up once before; I told Mr. Escent's carman; he said he knew him very well; he said he would go along with me to take him, and as we were returning from the water side, we saw the same man; I went and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he is the same man that had the parcel? - A. I am very clear in that.</p>
               <p>Q. What did that parcel contain? - A. Several pieces of leaden pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he dropped these things? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never saw that property, nor did I ever see the man before he took me in the day time.</p>
               <p>Court. He says he saw you before and the bundle too, and you ran away.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Buley) Look at these things? - A. I cannot swear to the property myself, here is a man that can.</p>

I have no sheep; he seeing me on the other side the hedge, on horse-back, jump'd off the style, and ran away about half a mile, and push'd into the hedge, there we took him; when we were bringing him along, he flung the person down that had hold on him, and ran away again towards a wood, I rode after him and knock'd him down; then we were about half an hour before we could fasten him: we took him before a Justice.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Tarrant, a pawnbroker, in Cable Street—on 28th July Driscoll came to me with that watch case—she asked me if it was worth anything, and whether it was gold—I asked her where she got it from—she said another woman picked it up in Leman Street—I said "Then you will fetch that woman in, I want to see her"—she went out and brought Caldon in—Caldon said she had picked it up in Leman Street—I detained the case, and spoke to the police about it—the prisoners left the shop—Driscoll gave me their addresses, and I wrote them down at the time, "Mrs. Caldon, Blue Anchor Yard," and "Ellen Donovan, 5, Royal Mint Street"—I gave the addresses to the police, with the watch case.</p>

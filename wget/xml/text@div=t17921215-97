             follow that man and bring him back, I stood at the door and saw Read bring him back, when he came back, he had the basket on his shoulder, I then ordered Read and another person to take the basket off his head, taking the basket off his head, there was the jack that was over the lead, with that I immediately took out the lead and I marked it, I then ordered him to the watch-house, after I had lodged him in the watch-house, I went to the roof of the work-house, there I observed a great quantity of lead cut away all of it fresh. I took the lead in the basket into my possession and kept it, it was taken to the roof of the work-house, I sent for a plumber and had it beat out on purpose, it fitted and corresponded even with the nails.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he examined at the time he was sent to the watch-house? - No, nothing further.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search his pockets or person? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then of course you did not see any instrument by which this could be cut? - There was a bricklayer's ladder just by an adjacent building.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know so despotic a sovereign as a bricklayer is over his labourer, his man was under the controul of such a monarch? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. That is an universal proposition? - there is no rule without an exception.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he taken in his beer that day? - I really do not know, but he had taken in a great deal of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the poor fellow worked there? - I had observed four or five days.</p>
               <p>Q. Is his master here? - I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. He said, he would go back very willingly, and seemed to have his share of gin that day.</p>

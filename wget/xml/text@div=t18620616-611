                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Speakman, umbrella and parasol manufacturers, 10, Silver-street—on 8th April, I received from Pearce a parcel from Messrs. Cunnew—I did not open it—I knew the prisoner, but was not aware whether he was Mr. Cunnew himself or his traveller—he called for orders—after these parcels were received, the prisoner called at the warehouse, and Mr. Speakman told him that he did not order the umbrella bands, and would not keep them—the prisoner said, "You</p>

               <p>had better keep them, as you will want them"—Mr. Speakman said, "No; I shall not keep them"—I told the prisoner he must take them back, gave the parcel to him, and he took it away—that was a fortnight or three weeks after they were left—a short time after that an invoice came from Messrs. Cunnew for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and I gave some information to the lad.</p>

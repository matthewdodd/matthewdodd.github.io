            . I am a farmer, and live at Sutton; on the 10th of December I bought a bay gelding of the prisoner; it was rather a dark bay - I gave him 10 l. for it - I have since shown it to Mr. Waterhouse and Mr. Holloway - I took a receipt for the money - this it (looking at it) read.</p>
               <p>"Received of Mr. Cole, 10th December, 1823, 10 l. for a bay horse, by me, J. ENGLISH."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How near to Hounslow do you live - A. About a mile and a quarter - I had the gelding in my possession a month or more before the receipt was given - I had this and another of him - I paid for it on the day the receipt is dated; they were first lent to me to use, as they were not fit for coach work; I kept them for their use - when I had no further use for them I returned this one, and then he proposed to sell them - the proposition came from him - be fixed 12 guineas on this, and 5 on the other - I only bought this, and used it as occasion required, publicly; I gave a fair price for it; Mr. Waterhouse claimed it about July; I have known the prisoner ten years.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was the horse useful to you. - A. Yes, for slow work; I never communicated with Mr. Waterhouse about the sale of the horse.</p>

            . I carry on business at the Swan with Two Necks as a coach-master; the prisoner was in my employ fourteen or fifteen years - he conducted my business at Hounslow, where I keep from 70 to 100 horses, to forward stages to the west of England; I have stables there for their accommodation; he had no general power or authority from me to dispose of any horses, but has occasionally been directed to sell horses when they were unfit for my work; I have on some occasions fixed a price on them - I always fixed a price on each particular horse, not on a lot; he had no authority to sell any but what I directed and fixed a price for; I saw a gelding in possession of Mr. Cole, and know it to be mine; I never authorized him to sell it, nor did I know that it was sold, till about the middle of June; he had never apprised me of it, or sent the money, to account in any way whatever; I had seen him at least six or eight times between Christmas and June; I sometimes went to Hounslow, and he at times came to town; I never staid any time at Hounslow, and was never at Coles's except when I went to see the gelding - the prisoner lodged in a cottage of mine in my yard at Hounslow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Have you no partner - A. No, I have two sons who interfere in my business: they have no share in it. The prisoner was manager at Hounslow; there are six horse-keepers and two blacksmiths under him. I may have been there five or six times between Christmas and June. I did not miss any horse till June. My sons went down when I did not; but very seldom.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the prisoner been allowed to take a horse in payment of wages - A. Never. I have his accounts here. I have authorised him to sell horses for hay.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this; is it one of your orders - A. It is; it authorises the sale of a horse for four loads of hay. I think he left me the first or second week in June; every thing was settled between us, except some fixtures, and a small account he had against me. I had information about this horse after that; he claimed, for fixtures and other trifling matters, 22 l. odd., which I have paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these papers (producing them) are they not claims existing at present - A. They are not due from me;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160052"></xptr>I have no knowledge of them. I have paid White several bills for drugs and things which English has brought me. I never saw these before, to my knowledge. Good hay in December was about 1 l. a load. I have seen Mr. J. White lately.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation with him respecting some hay, which was delivered for this very horse - A. I had not - I recollect finding some very bad hay in my loft at Hounslow. White said he understood I had had some hay for this horse; my answer was, that I knew nothing of any being delivered to me for that horse, but that I had seen some very ordinary hay in my loft, and that on asking the prisoner where it came from, his answer was, that he had bought it of some person from a place called Firmly, and for which hay I paid him 7 l. I told White I had since been informed that no Frimly waggon brought it, but that they believed it had been sent from English's own field. White said he understood hay had been delivered for the horses. I told him I had been informed by a man in my yard, that four or five little one-horse jobs of hay had been brought; but I knew nothing of it myself: but it was from hearsay, not from my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you told White you had only been told of it, not knowing it of your own knowledge - A. I said my man had informed me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are not asked whether you had been informed of it, but whether you told White you had been informed of it - A. I believe I did - I told him I had been told of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was the management of the horses entirely in the prisoner's hands? - Yes, I went down five or six times to look over the stock, and see what condition they were in, if fit for work; but they were never all in the stable at once. I never enquired about those which were absent. The prisoner had 1 l. 1 ls. per week, and a house to live in; he frequently came to town for money; and if not it was sent down: he never told me he had sent this gelding to Cole, either to use or any other purpose. I paid him what he claimed after he left me; most of it was for fixtures, which he had bought several years ago in a house of mine. I have looked over his books; there is no account of any money received of Cole, or of hay being received and paid for by this horse. I never told him to swap the horse for hay. I have certain horses, but not this.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long is it since this book was in the prisoner's possession - A. I believe he had it up to May last. When horses were unfit for work, it was reported to me generally by the coachman - it was not his duty to report them; there were generally twelve or fifteen extra horses at Hounslow. I never received an account of this horse being disabled either from him or the coachman.</p>
               <p>MR. COLE. I gave 10 l. for the horse, not hay.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I have been in the prosecutor's service twenty-four years, during that period I repeatedly sold horses, not only by desire of the prosecutor, but by the direction of his two sons. On the 1st of September, 1823, Mr. Joseph ordered me to sell the horse in question for four loads of hay, which were cut and sent from my place to the prosecutor's stable immediately after; not having immediate use for the horses, I sent them to Mr. Cole, who afterwards bought the horse in question.</p>

               <p>I asked if he knew of his own knowledge that he had received four or five parcels for some horses - No number, nor any particular horse or time was mentioned.</p>

               <p>Q. Now on your oath did he not say he had been informed that it came from Frimley - A. He did not, Frimley was not mentioned; my brother and two of my apprentices were present, they are not here. He did not say whatever the hay was, it was paid for.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did Mr. Waterhouse come into your shop of his own accord - A. He did; I had heard that the prisoner was in custody. I knew at the time that Cole had horses which where Mr. Waterhouse's</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How did you know that - A.

English accompanied the two horses back - he had been repeatedly to Lad-lane to get them back to work on Mr. Waterhouse's farm at Hounslow, and they were sent back; they were at that time working in the Norwich van, and several applications were made for them to be sent, to draw the tares and things from the field.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. I have been subpoened here on behalf of the prisoner. I remember his bringing a bay gelding to town in September; he wished to take it back to Hounslow to do odd work at my father's farm, and it was to be worked as a stage horse if it was wanted. I did not know of its being sold; it was brought to town to be sold, but he wished to take it back with another, that it might not be sold, as he wanted it for odd work - he never told me that he intended to, or had sold it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he inform you that he had supplied your father with hay, and should take it for the hay - A. He did not. I did not learn that it was sold till after he left my father. My brother interferes very little, and has nothing to do with the Hounslow business, or with buying and selling of horses without my father's authority.</p>

               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Will you swear that you did not know of a bay mare being charged to him in the accounts - A. I do not know of any mare being charged to him, or his being debited for one. I gave directions for the sale of a bay mare.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this book, whose writing is it - A. It is all in the writing of Mr. Emans, my father's clerk, except the initials at the bottom, which are my father's. I know of no horse being sold to Howe in November last; he has at times had a horse or two, but I cannot speak to periods. I had a conversation with the prisoner about the two horses; I do not recollect putting a value upon them - we do not fix a price, but send them to the Repository for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner say if four loads of hay could be got for these two horses it would do - 
               <persName id="t18240916-138-person1183">A. </persName>
            - I have no recollection of his saying anything of the sort, and have no hesitation in swearing that he did not. I should not have taken four loads for them, as I think them worth 25 l. or 28 l. The one Cole bought was worth 12 l. or 14 l. He never told me that he had disposed of this horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever directly or indirectly empower him to part with it for hay - A. Positively not; it is almost impossible to charge one's recollection; but to the best of my knowledge, I never gave him such instructions.</p>
               <p>COURT to MR. COLE. Q. How far from Hounslow was this gelding kept - A. About a mile and a quarter - it was kept in my stables; it has been out in the field for the last two months - the fields join the private road, which is much frequented, and I used it on the public road, five or ten times - I knew that it was the prosecutor's; he said he had no work for it.</p>
               <p>MR. WATERHOUSE, SEN. When I wanted horses to be sold, I gave the prisoner directions for it. I have given him orders to sell five or six at least, while he has been with me.</p>

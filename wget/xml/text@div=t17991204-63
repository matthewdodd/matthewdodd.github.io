Panther and Giles's shop is up that yard; then I saw Martin, the prisoner, come down the gateway, and beckon Turner up the yard; Martin turned round and followed him; then Martin beckoned with his hand, in this manner, for Turner to keep back; Turner then stepped back; he went to Mr. Panther's warehouse, and Turner followed him in; they might be in as much as ten minutes together; then I was joined by John Bolton; I desired him to stay for the purpose of watching them Turner then came out with two coach-springs, one upon each shoulder; he came down the gateway, turned to the right hand, and went across Oxford street; he stopped under the portico of the Pantheon; Martin soon after came out with four springs, in a short bag; he was followed by

               <p>Q. When they had got there, has they gone the nearest way? - A. Certainly not; then they went down Blenheim-steps, which is along side the Pantheon, and along-Marlborough-street, into Poland-street; I then left them to fetch Mr. Panther; Bolton was absent from them about a quarter of an hour; Bolton acquainted me, where he had left them, and then I followed them again; before I left them, I saw them go into the Goldenlion, the corner of Church-street; Bolton and I went into the public-house to hear the conversation, the landlord was not up, and we called for some purl, as well as they did, and we could not have it, they left the springs at the public-house door; I heard the prisoner say to Turner, do you know where you are going with these things? he replied, no; the prisoner said, go straight down and turn to the left, which they did; I saw them go into the Cock, in Graston-street, and then to an old iron shop in Graston-street, kept by

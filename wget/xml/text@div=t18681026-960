                  </hi>. I am a manufacturer, and live at 10, Stamford Street—the prisoner was a servant in my employment—she had been with us about three months—on Saturday the 3rd October, I was away from home from 6.30 to 11.30—when I got home I found the house had been on fire, but was then out and in the charge of firemen—the fire had broken out in the basement—I saw the prisoner, on the Monday, come out of the ground floor office very quickly—she had no business there at all—I went into the office immediately and noticed a fire in the corner near the fire place—there was a quantity of cork in the office which had been set on fire—it was blazing—I had left the office safe ten minutes before—there was a piece of paper and a match box under the cork—they were burning when I went in—I put the fire out—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is that of the cork that was set on fire—I called out, "You diabolical wretch, are you</p>

               <p>going to set my house on fire?"—I then went up stain to the prisoner—she said she did not do it at first, but afterwards she said, "I did it this morning, but I did not do it on Saturday night."</p>

Q.</hi> Did you state that before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe so—I won't swear it, because the Magistrate was rather sharp—I said I had no doubt she did it on the Saturday—I had left her in sole charge of the house for a fortnight before—my wife was away five or six weeks, and she was left with the house—I found her faithful—I had a good character with her when I took her—the fire on the Saturday was in the kitchen, in the basement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am wife of the last witness—I went out with my husband about 6.30 on Saturday, the 3rd October—the prisoner was alone in the house—we came home a few minutes before 12—I found five or six firemen in the house; everything in the house was spoiled from smoke and steam, and the basement was entirely gutted—the kitchen is not used as a kitchen; my husband uses it for his work; there was a large quantity of cork there, and tools—on the Monday morning I heard my husband call out to the prisoner—I was in bed at the time;—I jumped out, and ran to the door—I saw the prisoner rushing up stairs; I said, "What is the matter, what have you done?"—I told her to go into my bed room, she threw herself down on her knees, and put up her hands, and said, "Pray God, strike me dead! pray God, paralyze me! I don't know what I have done it for!"—I said, "You vile girl! you had much better speak the truth than call the vengeance of God down on you!"—she then said, "I did it this morning, but I did not do it on the Saturday night"—she was then given into custody—when the policeman came, I said, "She has just confessed"—she then turned to the policeman and said, "I did it this morning; I did not do it on the Saturday night."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> On the Saturday night there was a great deal of fire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that was in the basement—there was some naptha, which my husband uses occasionally—several persons work in the house—they all leave at 4 o'clock—I left the prisoner in charge of the house for about five weeks—I stated before the Magistrate about not doing it on the Saturday—I had the utmost confidence in her—there were several boys at work—one was discharged some little time before this—they were not there on the Monday, they had been discharged.</p>

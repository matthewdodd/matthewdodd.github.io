While my wife and the prisoner were sitting in the kitchen on the 18th of February, the key of the room lay by her; she went to sleep, and soon after the prisoner came to me, and asked me for 2 s. to buy a pair of stockings. When he was going, he said he should be back in half an hour; when he was gone, and did not return at the time, I began to suspect him. I went to see if he had done me any damage; I went and overhauled my money; I missed about 9 l. The prisoner came back to my house the next day; I challenged him with taking my money; he denied it at first; but after some time he said, if I would forgive him, he would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177202190010"></xptr> confess. I said, tell me what it is: then he confessed that he took three guineas, seven half guineas, three quarter guineas and a moidore out of my drawer. I called in

             M'Carty. I was sitting in Mr. Hill's house when the prisoner came in. Mr. Hill had bid me stop him if I met with him. He had been impressed the day before at the India-house, and Mr. Hill stood bonds-man for him. Mr. Hill accused him with taking his money; after some little time he confessed that he took three guineas, seven half guineas, three quarter guineas and a moidore, out of Hill's drawer. I went with him before the Justice; he confessed the same there, and that he had bought these clothes with the money.</p>

               <p>I have nothing to say for myself. I did not break the drawer open; the key was in the drawer.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 234.) On last Monday morning, about six o'clock, I was requested by Mr. Thompson to conceal myself in a parlour at the back of his shop, which was not open—it was dark—I heard somebody come down stairs about a quarter past seven o'clock—I heard them unlock the door which opens from the passage into the shop—I heard the person come into the shop, and turn round, and go up on the inside of the counter—I then beard a drawer drawn out, and the sound of some money—after that the party came back, in the direction where I was—I then seized him, took him to the light, and it was the prisoner—I asked him what his business was behind the counter—he told me the back<lb></lb>door, which he usually went out at, was secure, that he could not go out that way, and he came back, intending to go out at the front door—Mr. Thom<lb></lb>son came in, and we went to the station—I told the prisoner the back-door was only on the latch—he said he was not aware there was a latch to it—he was taken to the station, and on him was found two halfpence and thir<lb></lb>teen farthings, which he said he had taken out of his child's money-box that morning.</p>

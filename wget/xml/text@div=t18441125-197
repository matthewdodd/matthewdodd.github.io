                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable V</hi> 100.) I reside at Tooting, in Surrey. On Sunday, the 3rd of Nov., about twelve or one o'clock, the prisoner brought a parcel to my house—he had been conductor to an om<lb></lb>nibus—on the paper parcel he brought there was "2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." marked, and he demanded 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the carriage—it had come from the New Inn, Old Bailey—I said, "3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.?"—he said, "Yes, here is the bill, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. paid out, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. carriage"—my sister-in-law paid him the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my presence—unless I had believed that "2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." had been paid out, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was due for carriage, I should not have paid it.</p>

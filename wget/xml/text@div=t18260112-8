The prisoner was in my service on the 28th of December - about a quarter to three o'clock, I was at my desk, and observed him leaving off work - eight o'clock is the proper time; I called out, "Where are you going?" he said "I am going to leave off" - adding that the other man had left and he could not work alone. I called him back, and observing that he looked bulky, said "What have you got?" he said Nothing; I said "Step back;" he did so - my clerk said"You have something, let us see;" the clerk then put his hand under his waistcoat, and drew out a quantity of lead- he then broke from me, and went down into the manufactory - the clerk followed him.</p>

On the evening of 13th Jan., about half-past six o'clock, I weighed eight chests of Pekoe tea, in consequence of something I had observed—the prisoner had no business in that place after I left it—on the morning of the 14th Jan., when I got to the place, about ten minutes after eight o'clock, I found the prisoner there, and he had opened the place—the boy was there as well—about twenty minutes after I had opened the place—the house, I saw the prisoner go to the floor where I had weighed the tea—he remained there about a quarter of an hour—I then saw him return, and go to his desk—he took a blue-paper parcel out of his pocket, and put it into the desk—supposing the parcel to have contained tea, it would have been about</p>

            . Q. Do you know this man Taylor - A.Yes he worked for my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of your master missing any filings - A. Yes. On the 19th of April, when my master and the two lads were gone down to breakfast, the prisoner went to the cupboard where the gold filings was; he took out a little stone bottle out of it; he asked me if I would go and fetch him a little water to drink.</p>
               <p>A. Did you go down - A. No, I took the bottle with me and stood behind the door; I looked through the crack of the door; I saw the prisoner leave his workboard and come to the cupboard; he took the box down where the filings was kept and put it on the lower shelf; my mistress called me down for a letter; I went up directly into the workshop and the box was removed into its proper place in the cupboard.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you tell your master or mistress what you had seen - A. On the Wednesday morning, I told my master.</p>
               <p>Q. What time on Tuesday did you see your master again - A. About half after nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner left the shop then - A. No, he left the shop about one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Masters.) What time of day was it when the prisoner brought the gold to you A - . About two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You live in Sutton street, Mr. Lovell in Aldersgate street; what time would it require to melt filings into a solid mass - A. That would depend upon what fire he had, if he had a fire to light it would take an hour; and if he had a fire ready lighted it would not take half the time; and it would cool in a very short time.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. - (to Mr. Lovell.) I apprehend you could not swear to that piece of gold that was sold to Mr. Masters. - A. I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. And the filings you could not swear to - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The box that Mr. Lovell alludes to, is metal filings. The tin box he puts what they call gold filings; the method of Mr. Lovell's work is all common; indeed the last metal that Mr. Lovell had was twelve shillings an ounce; and that gold that man had was forty two shillings an ounce; Mr. Lovell's metal I could not reduce it into a solid piece.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor and draper, and live at Diss, in Norfolk. I deal with Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs.

Nash and Ely are woollen-drapers—these goods are made at Huddersfield, and Leeds, and other places—there are great quantities of them made—I have been in the business nine or ten years—such goods as these are to be found in various places, but different pieces will vary a little—we have another piece or two of this one—we sell these largely—we have not sold large quantities of this tweed—I can iden<lb></lb>tify this more particularly—I never saw two alike of this—it is a peculiar mixture—we had such in our warehouse—I would not pretend to say that this is the only piece ever made of this kind—other dealers have similar goods.</p>

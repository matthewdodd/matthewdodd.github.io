               <p>On Friday, the 22d of November, I was going from the counting-house to the lower part of the yard about five in the afternoon, I was talking to a gentleman who is now in Court, I saw a man coming from the stables, and going out of the yard towards Smithfield, he held his right hand under his coat, I turned round and asked him as he passed by, what he had under his coat; he made no answer; I followed him to the street-door, and took hold of his coat, and bid him turn back, for I apprehended he had something there did not belong to him; he turned round, made no resistance, but said he should not; he walked a little way down the yard, and dropped a chaise-bridle, he walked further on, and flung away another bridle; I sent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040085"></xptr> for a constable, he said he was not afraid of any thing I could do.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, of 14, Billiter-street, City—I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> in consequence of which I called at Mr. Waring's office in the Poultry—I saw him, and two days afterwards I saw the-defendants—Sutherland came first to my office; he said that he came from Mr. Waring's office in consequence of a call from me as to the loan of some money, in reply to an advertisement; that the lady who wished to borrow the money was at Mr. Waring's office, and if I would remain in for half an hour he would bring her round—I asked the nature of the security to save trouble, he said that he believed it was some ground rents or some leases; that the lady was a person of property, and it was very im<lb></lb>portant that she should have the money at once; that although he ought not to say it, she would pay any rate of interest, but, unless she had it then and there, she would forfeit a deposit made for the purchase of other pro<lb></lb>perty—I said that I would remain in to see her—after that he called again with the prisoner Kay and a somewhat elderly man—Kay said that she had the deeds of the property in her reticule—the elderly man said that she was worth a considerable sum, that she would shortly receive 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was out on mortgage, which they would probably get me to re-invest—they stipulated that the deeds should be given up at once if the money was not advanced immediately, and Kay stipulated that no charge should be made if the money was not advanced—the elder man made the terms as to the advance of the money—they required the amount for four months; either 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. interest was to be charged for the loan of 1501.—I said that without the aid of my solicitor Mr. Baylis, I could not let them have the money; and asked them to meet me at his office at four o'clock; they assented, and I saw them all three outside Mr. Baylis's office at three o'clock—the two prisoners kept the appoint<lb></lb>ment, and not the third person—Kay then produced some deeds—I believe these are them—a deed for ground rent was produced first, and then she said that we could have the leases upon which the ground rent was secured</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186506120028"></xptr>
               <p>—Mr. Bayl is asked her whether she had bought the ground and the houses; she said that she had—one of the deeds relative to the lease was not pro<lb></lb>duced; Mr. Baylis observed that it would be no security without the other deed—Kay said that it was pledged for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with some one, and that if I liked to release it and let the amount of my advance stand at 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I was at liberty to do so; to which I assented—Mr. Baylis examined her as to whether the houses were empty or tenanted—she said at first that they were let at 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year each, and afterwards that they were empty in conse<lb></lb>quence of some dispute about the taxes—the names of the houses were mentioned—Mr. Baylis read over hurriedly some parts of the deeds—Kay said that she used to live down at Weaversfield; I do not know whether she said in one of the houses—I saw the two prisoners again by appointment on Saturday at twelve o'clock at Mr. Baylis's office—I said that we were unable to make the advance that day, and wished for a further appointment—they both insisted on the return of the deeds as time was of importance—Mr. Baylis said that we had gone into the matter and could not return the deeds for the moment—I left before them—next day, Sunday, I went to Sussex—I saw Sutherland at Mr. Baylis's office on the Monday morning—he was there waiting for the deeds—I do not recollect whether that was before or after I went to the Mansion House.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you been long in business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Five years on my own account—I have never heard of the "Cripplegate Loan Discount Company"—I never lost money in this way before—I have known Mr. Baylis three or four years—I had not consulted him about the investment of this money—I had more at my bankers than I cared to keep there, and wished to let some of it out—I have lent money before in a friendly way—I have not charged interest, and I have lent money to customers to secure a sale—I lent 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. less than a week ago, and receive 5 per cent. interest till the sale can go on—I did not charge 45 per cent. to the prisoners, only 30; the money seemed so important to them that I did not think much of charging 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believed the deeds to be genuine at that time—when a person says that they do not care how much they pay, it is an inducement to charge more—I did not hear what Mr. Baylis was to charge—I saw him write an agreement—I did not take it from Kay when she was taken into custody—I did not say anything before the Magistrate about the taxes being unpaid or the tenants running away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor of 30, Poultry—on 24th February I saw Mr. Scobell about a loan—the defendants came to the office while he was there, about three o'clock—I asked Kay if she was the person who re<lb></lb>quired a loan of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., she said, "Yes"—I asked her the nature of her security—she said a ground rent of 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I asked her for written deeds, and she handed the two deeds already produced—I looked through the assignment and found that it purported to contain a freehold, there being a lease of 29th November, 1861, recited in it—I then asked for a counter<lb></lb>part of the lease, which I looked through and then asked for the lease, telling her that as the ground rents had been purchased, the lease and the counterpart should go together—she said that the lease was with a friend, and on my pressing her as to whether any advance had been made on it she said, "Yes, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I then suggested to the prosecutor that he should in<lb></lb>crease his intended advance of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that the lease might be taken up—I asked her who Mr. Allin, the attestor to both deeds, was; she said he was a retired solicitor, and he prepared the deeds—I told them I would see Mr. Allin—Sutherland then asked me for a receipt for the deeds, which I</p>

               <p>gave him, he read it and handed it to Kay—I looked at the plan on the deed—I asked Kay the names of the tenants—she said that the houses were unoccupied, the tenants having left the previous quarter in consequence of some dispute about the taxes—she said the rents were 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—they then left, and the same day I wrote to Allin—they came again next day at twelve o'clock—I told them that I had seen Mr. Allin, and that I required some information relative to the title, which Mr. Allin had promised to procure, and that he would explain all to them if they could see him that morning, and they would know where to find him—Kay said, "This is very incon<lb></lb>venient; we want the money this morning, and as there appears a great deal of trouble about the matter we had better have the deeds back again"—Mr. Scobell was not present then—I said, "I cannot give up the deeds without the instructions of my client"—they left the room and remained outside the door from three to five minutes—I could not hear them talking outside my room—when they returned, Sutherland said I have arranged with this lady that I should wait for the deeds, and she authorizes you to give them to me—Kay assented to that and left, Sutherland remained—I asked him Miss Kay's address, he said, "Hanwell"—I asked him her Christian name, he said that I appeared very particular about the matter, and said, "My name is Edwin, my address is Boston-road, Hanwell, and I am a builder"—I left my office, leaving him there—I returned about three o'clock with Webb, a detective—I had agreed to see my client before twelve o'clock in the day, and Sutherland waited for the deeds—I then found both the pri<lb></lb>soners in my clerk's office—I again told them that I could not give up the deeds without my client's instructions—they were both very violent, and Sutherland said, "We must have our deeds"—I refused to give them up—a tall man. then made his appearance, Kay addressed him and said, "We can<lb></lb>not get our deeds"—he said, "Oh, I will lend you the money on the deposit of the deeds"—I still refused to give them up, and he then said, "Well, Miss Kay, I will lend you the money on your I. O. U." and they all left to<lb></lb>gether—an appointment was made for them to call on the Monday for the deeds—I went to the Mansion House on Monday afternoon with Mr. Scobell, obtained a warrant and placed it in the hands of Sergeant Webb—I saw nothing of the prisoners after I had been to the Mansion House—I do not know whether Kay kept the appointment on Monday, as I was not there—I was otherwise engaged—a person called three or four days after the warrant was issued and before they were given into custody for the deeds, but I demanded 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them.</p>

DALEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long were you acquainted with the Kay family? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Seven or eight months—a Mr. Davis was present at our introduction, but he called himself Dean—I have been a piano<lb></lb>forte maker 21 years—I was in treaty with Miss Kay's brother-in-law for some timber at Rose-bank—it was cut down for me, but I did not take it away because it was represented to me as lime tree for piano-forte keys, and it was a different wood—I never treated to buy any part of the land—I saw the trees before they were cut down—I have not heard the gardener at Rose-bank address the female prisoner as Miss Kay—I have not said, "Good night, Miss Kay"—it is not her brother, but her brother-in-law who is named Kay—Mr. Scobell asked me to give evidence—he went to see a piece of land at Weaversfield about which Mr. Harvey let me in for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by introducing me to Alexander Kay—I have not taken proceedings—it is only lately that I have known it—I sold a pony to Alexander Kay, and received a bill for it—I drew the bill on him—it was not paid—I never sent the pony—the bill is in my hands now—I gave him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash, and was to send him the pony, but I had doubts and did not—the bill was for 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took it up myself—I have known Captain Logan about a month—I had no bills with him—he was transported, he robbed me of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Cripplegate Loan and Discount Society, Limited—In January, 1861, they advanced 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to a person named Honey man, on security of the conveyance of a piece of land, of which these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the two deeds—in July 1861 I advanced a further sum of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the security of a third deed—application was after<lb></lb>wards made to me for a third advance, and I went down to Weaversfield with the female prisoner, and Alexander Honeyman and his wife, David Low, and the secretary to the company—we travelled by railway to Hayward's Heath, and driving in a carriage to Franklands, about three miles—it was at Mr. Tyler's and Coules's place—we talked over the further advance, walked over the land, and I said to the female prisoner, "Now point out to me the identical piece of land which this deed refers to"—a piece of waste land on the side of the road was pointed out, and I exclaimed against the apparent inadequate value of the consideration money expressed on the deed—I said, "You appear to have had a great many transactions with Mary Ann Scott; who is she?"—she said, "Well, she is a lady who has a great deal of property, and she buys estates and chops them up, sells them again, and makes a large profit; I have sold her an estate"—I said, "It is manifest that the considera<lb></lb>tion money is fully beyond the value of the land, and I shall report to the company as to a further advance—the female prisoner could hear Honey-man's statement; we were all close together and dined together—she said nothing—no further advance was made—we never got back our money—</p>

               <p>she addressed Mrs. Honeyman as her sister—we dined in a cottage on the estate, but we mutually agreed that our company was not agreeable to each other, and we got into different carriages and separated—it was not until this case that I became aware that the same person who signed that deed signed "Alexandra Kay."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a laundress, and the wife of William Night<lb></lb>ingale, a marine, and live in Adelaide-place, Woolwich. On the 19th of January the prisoner came to live with me as servant—she left me on the 7th of February, without notice, at about half-past two o'clock—I missed the articles before she left—a little trunk was brought to my door by a person, and I accused her of taking it—she denied it, and left—the piece of silk was in the trunk, and the eye-glass and bracelets—I had seen the trunk about a fortnight or three weeks before—it was kept in a little room, which I used as a sitting-room—she denied having seen the box—she left while I went to get a constable—I found a petticoat-body under her bed—she was apprehended next day, the 8th, at Mrs. Gaymer's, three doors from my own house—I went there and saw her, and said, "You good for nothing girl, to rob me of the petticoat of a lady I wash for; I would not care if you had nothing to eat"—she said, "Oh! forgive me, forgive me"—I sent for a constable, and had her apprehended—the petticoat belonged to Mrs. Cill of Blackheath—I had it to wash.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. She told me there was nothing in the box, and when I unfortunately took it I shook it, and there was nothing in it—it was thrown into a place with my old candlestick rags—she told Mrs. Chapman there was nothing in it. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not—I kept it in a cupboard where my husband puts his clothes—the box has never been opened, and the things are in it now—she could not get a key to open it—she might put rags in the cupboard, but not with my knowledge—I have had no quarrel with her.</p>

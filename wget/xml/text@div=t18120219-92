            . Q. Do you live in Shephard-street, May Fair - A. I do; I am a builder.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep an accompt with Messrs. Birch and Chambers - A. Yes, for several years. I became acquainted with the prisoner at the bar in the month of December.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of December do you recollect his calling upon you - A. Yes, I do; he called upon me with my banker's book, I believe on the 19th of December; he brought my book, and said he had entered two hundred pounds to my accompt. I told him he should not have done that; he said my account was rather low, there is the entry there; he said he had entered two hundred pounds, I told him I wished he had not done that. I told him he must not enter monies to my account; he brought a stamp with him, and asked me to draw a bill of two months for the two hundred pound, which I did,</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing further take place then - A. Nothing further; I do not think I saw him again until the 9th or 10th of January, he called upon me to give me the two hundred pound bill, he brought a stamp, and desired me to write a bill for one hundred more; he gave up the two hundred pound; bill, and I destroyed it - tore it to peices. These are the bills.</p>
               <p>Q. That check and that bill that you have in your hand now, was the check and bill that you drew - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give them to him - A. I gave them to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason of its being made payable to Mr. Plomer - A. At his request.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 10th of January, did you say he called upon you - A. Yes; the 9th or 10th.</p>
               <p>Q. I see, Sir, that check is dated the 9th of January, was there any reason for that - A. Yes, he desired me to date the check the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you paid that sum of two hundred pounds to your banker - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you authorize the prisoner at the bar to pay it - A. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Laws. You had cash at this house - A. Yes. I remember the prisoner a great many years at this house before I went to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you settle your accompt - A. Never, until my accompt came regular from the bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. The impression of your mind was, at that time, your accompt was good with them - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at it, to see how it stood - A. Not exactly; I conceived that I had over-drawed.</p>
               <p>Q. And you would not have over-drawed upon them, not with the idea of over-drawing upon them - A. Not to my knowledge, I would not.</p>
               <p>(The bills read)</p>
               <p>MR. GATTY. You are a clerk in the house of Birch and Chambers, and have been so some time - A. Yes; and the prisoner has also been for many years past a <rs id="t18120219-92-deflabel546" type="occupation">clerk</rs>

               <p>Q. When cash is paid into your house it will first come into the waste book; the waste book is the foundation of all other enteries. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From the waste book, into what book will it next find its way - A. Into the cash book, and from the cash book into the ledger.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, in the regular course of the business, no entry can find its way into the ledger that has not been in the cash book - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep the ledger - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How many ledgers are there - A. There are four at this time, at that time there were three.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181202190044"></xptr>Q. You say you kept the ledger - A. That was my department.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner sometimes assist you by posting into the ledger - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do that asked or unasked - A. Occasionally unasked when I was absent, when I came from my dinner I found him at the ledger; he then chused the last ledger, containing Mr. Vale's accompt. I remarked to him that it was rather singular that he should assist me in that one ledger particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. The clerk who holds the cash book calls, and the clerk with the ledger ticks it off - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that entry in the ledger ticked off - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. When an entry is ticked off, what does that tick denote - A. It denotes that it has been called from the cash book.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore after turning over the ledger in the morning, and it is ticked, you do not tick it again - A. No, we conclude it to be done.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore if a person had put it in the ledger the day before, and had ticked, it would not be ticked the next day - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Your comparison of all your ledgers only takes place anually - A. Only annually.</p>
               <p>Q. Inasmuch as the clerk who holds the cash calls if there is no entry in the cash book, he could not call it - A. Surely not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say your comparison of all your ledgers takes place at Christmas - A. At Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. If false entries takes place in the ledger it can only be found out at the ending of the ballance - A. Only at the end of the balance.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your balance last Christmass did you find there was something wrong - A, A considerable deficiency, it exceeded two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that did your house take a new set of ledgers - A. A new set of ledgers were taken, not in consequence of that.</p>
               <p>Q. You proceeded then to see how this could arise - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, look in the waste book of the 10th of January, and shew how Mr. Vale's draft was paid; the 11th of January, it is my mistake - A. The 11th of January

            . I searched the prisoner, I found three ten-pound notes upon him, this fifty pound note No. 10,790, November 16, 1811, and another fifty pound; I have had the notes ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards learn from the prisoner whether he had put any other money into any one's hands - A. Certainly into Barratt's hands, one of one hundred pounds. I brought the prisoner up to London in a post chaise. Before I went from Barrett's house I gave him a caution not to say any thing. We used no promises or threats. After we had left Hithe we had some conversation respecting Mr. Gatty; he observed that had Gatty looked at him he might have discovered who it was that had done the deed. The prisoner in justice declared that Mr. Bolton had nothing to do with the transaction.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney, Q. to Mr. Gatty. Did you take an accompt of the balance of Mr. Vale on the 19th of December - A. I did. I handed the paper of which I took the accompt; fifty-three pounds four shillings and seven-pence; 20th of December, one hundred and thirty-five pound and a fraction; on the 21st two hundred and seven pounds; on the 9th of January one hundred and twenty-one pounds; at one time the real balance was against Mr. Vale, upon the 2nd of January the balance was against him fourteen pounds fourteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. You have investigated Mr. Vale's accompt - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the real state of Mr. Vale's accompt on the 11th of January last. Do you find any other entries to his credit, for which there is no voucher whatever, particularly to the extent of eighteen hundred pounds, sixteen hundred pounds, besides the three hundred, whose entries are these - A. Upon the 11th of November an entry of cash two hundred and thirty pounds made by the prisoner for which there is no entery made by Vale, it is in the hand-writing of the prisoner, this is ticked, as if there was an entry to compare with it in the waste-book. There is no such entry in the waste-book. Upon the 2d of October there is two hundred pounds, entered by the prisoner, a man, to Vale's credit, marked likewise; there is no credit for that in the waste-book or cash-book. June 28th a similar sum to Vale's credit, two hundred pounds, for which there is no credit in the cash-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it part of the prisoner's business to pay checks when brought in by customers - A. It was not a part of his business, but he might do it for other clerks that were absent or employed.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his regular business - A. The cash-book, which is copied from the waste-book.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Vale. You have heard the clerk state several sums of money to your credit, had you or not any other person that paid this money in for you - A. Not in these instances, I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the 11th of November there is a credit given to you of two hundred and thirty pounds, look at your banker's book do you remember the prisoner coming to you in November - A. I cannot recollect the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the entry on the 11th of November two hundred and thirty pounds, was that paid in by you - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner about that time - A. He called about that two hundred and thirty pounds, and said I have placed cash, mentioning this sum, to my accompt and asked me for a draft for the money back, which I gave him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that occur in several instances - A. Much in the same way.</p>

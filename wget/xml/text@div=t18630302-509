                  </hi>. I am medical officer to the City of London—in the performance of my duty I examined certain portions of meat which were shown to me on 2d February by Mr. Wylde—I have had very considerable experience as a pathologist with respect to human beings and animals—this meat was unfit for human food on account of its being a diseased animal, and charged with physic—I distilled it, and obtained physic from it—I can only tell what the nature of the disease was by what has been stated here—such a disease would produce such a condition of the flesh as I saw—the flesh was in a clearly diseased state, and unfit for human food.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Physic does not much improve anybody, does it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I hope it does—distension of the stomach, by the fermentation of food, is not a disease, it is a disorder—it causes great pain—an animal might have that, and yet be fit for human food.</p>

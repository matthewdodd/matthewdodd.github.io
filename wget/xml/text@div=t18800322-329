                  </hi>, I am an ostler, of 5, Dean Street, Holborn—on 7th March, about 2.15 a.m., I was in Long Acre—I was knocked down at a corner by the prisoner—I saw several others—when I was on the ground my pocket was torn from my trousers with 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a knife—the prisoner held me, kneeling on my chest; the others ran away—a police<lb></lb>man came up, and the prisoner ran away—he ran after him and brought him back to me—I gave him in charge—I can swear to him; I can swear to this knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been to see a friend at Knightsbridge; I had left him about an hour—I had had several glasses, but was not intoxi<lb></lb>cated—I was not perfectly sober—I was hurt; my head was cut open in two places—I was stunned a trifle—it took me some time to recover when I got to the station—I know the knife because the shape of the blade is different—my head was caught on the kerb.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). I was on duty about 2.15 a.m. in Neale Street—I saw two men running—when I got up to the prisoner he was kneeling on Ward's chest—he ran away as soon as he saw me—I ran after him 100 yards, and caught him in Long Acre—I brought him back to the prosecutor, who told me he had been knocked down and robbed, and gave him in charge—I took him to Bow Street—he was searched—on him was found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze', and this knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have seen the prisoner several times before in Drury Lane—I saw him five or six yards off—when I came back Ward was standing against a post—he seemed confused—I saw several persons in the street; the prisoner ran past them—no one was standing close to them when the prisoner was Kneeling on Ward—I have not seen a blade like this before—Ward was bleeding fearfully from the back of his head.</p>

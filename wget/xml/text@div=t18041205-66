               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes; on the 11th of November he came to my house, I asked him to come in and stay, as it was a rainy day; in about half an hour I had occasion to go up stairs, and upon going up I saw the prisoner draw near the fire; when I came down stairs, he was gone; in about a quarter of an hour I found the watch missing that hung over the mantle-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure it was there when you went up stairs? - A. Not perfectly, but I believe it was there; my wife missed it, I left her in the room below stairs; when I went up into the room the prisoner was in; I was out all the morning, I noticed the watch hanging up when I came home, that was about an hour and a half before the prisoner came; I looked to see what o'clock it was, nobody had been there but me and my wife; when I missed the watch, I went to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050070"></xptr>nearest public-house to see if I could see him; I went to two public-houses, but could not see him; I returned, and in about ten minutes, looking out, I saw the prisoner going by the house, he was reeling as if he was intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear intoxicated when he came about the lodging? - A. I noticed he was in liquor when he sat down in the chair; I followed him, and in about a few minutes he got into a house, I went in after him.</p>
               <p>Q. A public-house? - A. No, a private house; I stopped at the bottom of the stairs, and called out Jim; he said, who wants me? and came down; I asked him if he would step over to my house, I wanted to speak to him; he came over to the room where the watch hung, and I asked him if he had seen any thing that hung upon that nail; he said, no; I asked him two or three times, he still refused; I stooped down, and heard the watch tick in his pocket, it was in the lining of his breeches a good way down; after I told him he was the man that had my watch, he asked me to go out backwards, he wanted to speak to me backwards; I told him no, the door should not be opened; he made a stoop, however, by the door, and slid the watch on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the action as well as you can? - A. He unbuttoned his coat, and slid it out under the skirt of his coat on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. He did this in a way perfectly open for you to see? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him unbutton his breeches? - A. Yes, he took the watch from the inside of his breeches; I took up the watch, a labouring man came in, I left him in his custody with my wife, and went myself for a constable, and gave him in charge. (Produces the watch.)</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in any business? - A. I work in the Wet Docks, I am foreman of the warehouse.</p>

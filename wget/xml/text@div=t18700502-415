About 1.30 on the morning of 31st March, I was in Fleet Street, where I saw the prisoners—I saw the female stop several gentlemen—Beech was close behind her, and Johnson was on the opposite side of the street—when the woman stopped a gentleman, the male prisoners remained close by her—she remained with the gentleman two or three minutes, and when she left them Beech crossed over to Johnson and spoke to him, then they separated, and Beech followed the woman as before, some eight or ten paces behind her—then she accosted another gentleman, and Beech stood a few paces behind her and Johnson, on the opposite side of the street, as before—then I saw her stop Mr. Saunders, the prosecutor, and accompany him as Car as Ludgate Hill, the male prisoners following her at the same distance behind—Mr. Saunders called a cab, and the two male prisoners joined in conversation close by—Mr. Saunders would have got into the cab; but the female took him by the arm, and pulled him away; then she took him along New Bridge Street, and was followed by the two other prisoners, who had separated, one on each aide of the street, until they came to Blackfriars Bridge, when they joined company as before—the female took the prosecutor down William Street, when Beech crossed over to the top, and there lit his pipe—Johnson walked</p>

               <p>up to the top of the bridge, returned, and then joined Beech again—I placed myself on a window sill in William Street, close to where the female and Mr. Saunders were standing—in about two or three minutes she coughed twice, loudly, when I crossed and seized hold of both her hands, telling her I believed she had robbed the gentleman, and that I should take her into custody—she resisted very much—I called for assistance, and she was taken into custody—on the way to the station an officer seized her left hand, whilst I took from her dress pocket a watch and chain and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and at the same time 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in silver, fell on the pavement—after I had been to the station I went to the place where I had struggled with the woman, and there I found three receipts for Queen's taxes, made out in the prosecutor's name.</p>

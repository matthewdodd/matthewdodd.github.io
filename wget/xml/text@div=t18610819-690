                  </hi>. I live at 61, Albert-street, White Conduit-street, Islington—I am out of business, living on my means—on a Monday, some where about the 30th July, about half-past 10, I was walking along White-chapel-road, close against Mile-end gate—some man came up and begged of me, and I gave him a penny and half a pint of beer at a public-house—while I was in the house, standing at the bar, the three prisoners and three or four others came in—they stayed there about an hour perhaps, and I was there too—I had two glasses of porter, and I likewise stood a pot of beer for these men—I changed a sovereign while they were there—I went out of the public-house first and went towards the City—all the men followed me—Rogers came in front of me—I had very strong suspicions that they wanted to rob me, and took my purse out of my trousers' pocket and put it in my coat-tail pocket—I saw a policeman and spoke to him, and the prisoners walked forward about ten yards—after that I' left the policeman and went on towards the Minories—as I was going along I saw the prisoners; there were seven men altogether, some were before me, and some behind—I can't say who were before me—I cannot say whether the prisoners were before or behind me—when I got close against Moses and Son's, Rogers asked me to give him some more to drink—I told him I wanted to go home—he said he knew where there was a house open in the Minories, and we would go and have a glass there, and then go home—I went and stood a pot of beer there, paid for it, and thinking that they meant robbing me I went out of the house—as I went out, there were others preventing my getting away—I paid for two pots of beer there—I put my hands in my pocket with the intention that they should see me, but in reality I put them behind, and I then put my hands in front, to make them believe I had got my purse in my front pocket, but in reality I put it behind—the prisoners were at the bar at that time—after the beer was drunk, we all went out together—it was between 3 and 4 at that time—I remember being close to Aldgate-market—I heard a whistle which attracted my attention, and at that moment I</p>

               <p>received a terrific blow on the forehead from the prisoner Rogers—I do not know what with; I thought it was with his fist—it knocked me down—it did not deprive me of my senses—I jumped up as quick as possible and called out "Police"—I saw the other prisoners there—Rogers came up to me first, and said, "Have you been robbed of your purse?"—I said "You know I have"—I then put my hand behind me to see whether it was gone, and Rogers tried to wrest it from me, and scratched my hands—the other prisoners did not do anything to me at that time—Percival robbed me of my pocket-book and keys when I was first knocked down—all of them were there when I was knocked down, but I cannot say which one robbed me—I lost my pocket-book, containing two bills of exchange, several letters, five keys, a pocket-handkerchief, a knife, and almost everything I had in my pockets—they were in my trousers' pocket—I was robbed by Percival—I saw him, and felt him put his hands in my pocket—a constable came up after Rogers had spoken to me, and the prisoners divided—Percival and Gleeson went one way, and Rogers went another way—I gave them into custody—I was sober—a policeman came up when I shouted.</p>

BEST</hi> (<hi rend="italic">for Rogers</hi>). <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you are a gentleman retired from business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I was a wholesale potato salesman before I retired—I had a greengrocer's shop—I have been here in the dock, it was through my wife; she brought a charge of rape against me, on purpose to get what profit I had got—I had got about 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my box—I was tried by a jury and acquitted—my wife was not the prosecutrix, she had one to do it for her—I left home on this day about 8 in the morning—I had been to Covent-garden, and Spitalfields, and stayed there to have my tea—I had not a glass to drink during the day—I am quite sure of that—I had dinner that day in Fleet-street—I never take beer with my dinner—I did not take anything after dinner—I had something to drink before the beggar invited me into the house—I began about 10 o'clock in Cleveland-street, White-chapel—I had a pint of ale there—I went to a friend's house after that and we had a pint there, not more—we had some business there which took me longer than I expected, and as I was coming from Cleveland-street to the City, I thought, as I had a good long way to walk, that I would have a short pipe home, and a glass of ale—I then went to the public-house where these men came in, where the man invited me in—I frequently treat people to porter—I generally have a glass myself—I had two half-pints there—it is my opinion that when I got to Moses and Son's, it was 12 o'clock—I went to the other public-house, in the Minories, about half-past 12—I did not have a glass there—I stood a pot and paid for it, and coming out, there were a lot of people ready to stop me—I was not knocked down then, it was further on—when I got up to Moses and Son's I heard a whistle, and the moment I heard it I received a blow, and down I went—I had never seen these men before that night—I suppose I could not see any better after I had the Wow than I could before—I was not drunk.</p>

About a quarter to 4 on the morning of 30th July, I was on duty in Aldgate High street, and heard a cry of "Police!" about twenty or thirty yards off—I went in the direction of the cry and saw the three prisoners—I noticed Rogers first, going down towards the Minories—the other two crossed the road and went down Aldgate—I spoke to the prosecutor and got some information—police constable 668, came up at that time—I sent him after Gleeson and Percival, and I went after Rogers—I called him back, and 668 brought back Gleeson and Percival—I searched Rogers and Gleeson, but found nothing; but on Percival I found two letters, five keys, a penknife, and pocket handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked him if the keys and letters belonged to him—he said, "Now, policeman, you have brought me to my senses, I have been drunk all night, they do not belong to me"—the prosecutor was sober when I came up he seemed very much agitated, and the blood was running from his forehead—I afterwards found this pocket-book in the churchyard near, containing two bills of exchange, one for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the other for 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and some papers.</p>

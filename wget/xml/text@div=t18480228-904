                  </hi> I am in the employ of Edward Baldwin. On 15th Feb., about nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked to look at some guts-percha soles—I showed him several pairs—he said they were all too stout, and wished to see a lady's par—I left him, and went into the back shop—in about a minute I came back—he had altered his position—I asked what he had put into his pocket—he said he had got nothing, and had done nothing—I said I was pretty certain he had, and put my hand to the left side of his pocket, felt something, and called a porter to fetch the police—he took a pair of soles from his pocket, gave them me, and repeated that he had done nothing—the soles on the counter appeared as if they had been moved.</p>

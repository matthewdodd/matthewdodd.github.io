                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. John Gower, of King-street, Covent-garden. On Monday evening, the 9th of October, I was in the shop—I heard a noise and a knocking at the shop window I went out immediately, and found the prisoner in custody of a policeman named Kirkman—she had a velvet bag and a piece of ribbon inside it, which is Mr. Gower's property—it is worth 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the bag does not belong to him—the ribbon had been in the window for sale, directly in the middle of a square of glass which had been broken.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner in King-street, near Mr. Gower's shop—I had heard the glass crash before that, and saw the prisoner leaving the window—she had got three or four yards from the window, and bad this bag with the ribbon partly in it and part out—it was plate glass, and there was some blood on her hand.</p>

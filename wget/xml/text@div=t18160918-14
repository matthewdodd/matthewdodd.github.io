I never saw any of these things again. When I went down stairs, I did not perceive any thing, because I knew that all the doors and windows of the house were left safe; but they were only so secured that any one inside might have let himself out. I had been in the apartments where these several things were; I saw these things in their proper situations. In the course of the next day I saw the prisoner in the kitchen.

            . I was servant to Mr. Bluck. On the 15th of August last, I went to bed that night about ten; I locked the door and fastenings; I also looked at the articles the over night, and did not miss any thing. I gave orders to the prisoner to go to bed; that was before I went to bed myself, and then he appeared to be going towards the stairs, as if he were going to bed himself. We three were the only persons in the house. There had been a sale by auction the day before in the house. The several articles were in different sets in the sale-room. I went into the sale-room before I went into bed; I observed none of the articles missing. In the morning it was Mr. Sitgraves pointed out the loss to us; we did not perceive any thing missing until he pointed them out to us. I got up in the morning about eight o'clock. I believe the prisoner was up stairs about half an hour after I got up; I had not any conversation with him in particular.</p>

            . I am an auctioneer's porter. I attended the sale on the 12th, 13th, and 14th. I have a catalogue of the goods; they were chiefly household goods. The things that were sold on the 13th remained on the premises; I saw them as late as seven o'clock, and I left the premises as late as half past seven, first looking round the house, as I generally do, to see that no person was secreted. I attended the next morning at half past nine; then I missed the things in the indictment, which had been safe the over night. I missed them by looking over my catalogue. I was the first person that discovered they were missing. Neither Miss Bluck nor the maid bad taken any alarm, that I had heard of, the next morning.</p>
               <p>(Witness here recites from his catalogue the several articles that were missing, which are the same as mentioned in the indictment.) I saw almost the whole of the things again about three weeks after they were stolen. I had a suspicion who stole them; I took steps for the detection of the thief. I went immediately to my master's son, who is an attorney in the neighhourhood; I told him we had been robbed; I communicated my suspicion to my master's son soon after ten that morning. I taxed the prisoner myself; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180031"></xptr>did not tell him it would be better for him to acknowledge it; I did not threaten him. I taxed him strongly; he said he was in bed soon after eight at night, and slept until half past eight the next morning soundly, and he heard nothing in the house to disturb him whatever. I told him he must sleep very soundly indeed. He said what was it to him if they were lost; he had no charge of them whatever. Going round the place to see if I could make any discovery, he pointed out a ladder to me against a pent-house, and said here is where they got in I suppose. This ladder had been taken from an out-house in the garden; and I said that was rather impossible, for there were four feet from the ladder to the top; and then there was a thin leaden flushing which I said if a child had stepped on it, it would have left a mark. He said he did not know any thing about it, and he got out of my sight as fast as he could always. I observed that he had hurt his leg, which was one occasion for my suspicion; it was his foot; he had his shoe cut considerably, and there had been no appearance of lanen as about him the day before; he appeared very different from what he did the day before; he looked jaded. and as if he had been drinking. The moment he let me in. in the morning, I asked him what he had been doing with himself all night, (that was before I knew any thing was lost;) for his appearance was so changed? he said he was lame of a rorn, and he went away immediately out of my sight.</p>

            . We taxed the prisoner with the robbery; he utterly denied it. I asked him what time he went to bed on the preceeding night. I did not hold out any expection of mercy to him. He said it was half past eight when he went to bed, and he never came down stairs till half past eight the next morning. We proceeded to search him; in his pocket was found a written paper, being a list of all the articles that were missing; I did not know whose hand-writing it was, and I found the ticket of a turnpike gate No. 70, on him; it was Cannon-street - road gate. I was present when all the papers were taken from him, also three pieces of matches such as you light the candles with, together with a key which opens the gate into Mr. Bluck's Yard; it goes from there into the school-room, and so into the house; it is a gate which fronts into the street, it is a side door that goes into a little yard, and thence into the house. I asked him how he came possessed of those matches, he said that Maria, the servant maid, had said that she had got no matches in the house, and that she would thank him to go out and get some. I then asked him when that was, and he said between six and seven 0'clock the evening before. That was all that passed.</p>

He brought them on the Wednesday morning about half past seven; he left them at my lodging; I do not happen to know the day of the month; it was in August; he brought two pictures and some books; he brought the pairs of plated candlesticks, in short he brought all the things which Mr. Thompson gave up to the officers; there was no one with him. Mr. Thompson met the young man on the stairs; I mean by the young man the prisoner. Mr. Thompson asked him what he had brought up stairs, and he said a picture and some books; then Mr. Thompson asked him whether I was any relation to him, and he said I was his cousin; I was not so; nothing else passed. The things were taken into my lodging-room; they remained there about a fortnight.

            . On Wednesday morning the 14th of August, I saw the prisoner, at about half past six; he was in a cart; there was one horse to the cart; I don't know whether there was a man or a boy with him, but there was another person with him I know; he was driving towards his master's house; I spoke to him, I asked him if I should call at their house with milk that morning, because they were leaving the premises; he said he did not know; that was all that passed between us.</p>

The prisoner came to me about ten o'clock at night on the night of the 13th, or rather after ten, and asked me for a halfpennyworth of matches, and I said never mind about the halfpenny my boy, here is a few for you, and I reached him down a little bundle, and he said one would be sufficient for him. That is a'l I know. I had seen him before, because I served Mr. Bluck with beer.</p>

            . I live at No. 105, Brook-street, Ratcliffe. I know the prisoner at the bar perfectly well. I remember seeing him on the morning of the 14th of August last, between six and seven o'clock, he was going in a cart drawn by a small black horse; he was going in a direction from his master's house. I observed the frame of a picture or looking-glass in the cart, I said, you are moving your glasses and pictures very early this morning; he did not speak, but rather smiled.</p>

Mr. Sitgraves said I had a bad foot, and it was a bad toe; and a medical gentleman saw it; I was going out in the morning to have it dressed, and I met this person in the cart, whom I knew, and I asked him to let me ride as I was lame, and he did, and coming back again I overtook him again returning, and I asked him to let me ride again.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, D</hi> 2), On Saturday, 24th October, between 4 and 5 in the afternoon, I took the prisoner in custody at his house on another charge—as I approached the door. I saw the prisoner coming towards me dressed, and apparently in a great flurry—as soon as he saw me and another officer, he made a dead stop, and at once took his hat off, pulled something over his head and out of his waistcoat pocket, and shoved it behind him towards his wife, who was in the shop, and said, "Take this"—I put my hand round him, caught hold of his hand, and said, "Want have you got there, I must have that?"—it was this watch and chain—I took possession of it, searched him, and found on his fingers four gold rings, and two more in a purse in his pocket—I searched his house and found some crucibles, which had been recently used (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), some files, which had been recently used for filing gold, and a quantity of other articles which do not refer to this charge—on Monday morning I searched the infor<lb></lb>mations at the police-station and traced the owner of the watch—I then said, "Shaw, I did not ask you on Saturday night how you came in possession of this watch, now I ask you the question"—he said, "I shall not tell you"—he refused to give me any account of it, and also before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was he taken in custody on another charge and discharged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; after three remands—he is a goldbeater at times—I have always said that he took the chain off his neck and put it behind him before I spoke to him—I gave evidence before the Magistrate in the case of a man named Canon and three others, who was charged with robbery in connexion with the prisoner—this is my signature to those depositions in the jewel robbery case—I was about to give the evidence in that case that the prisoner took off the watch and put it behind him, but was told that the one case had nothing to do with the other, and was not allowed to give the evidence—it was after he was charged with the other matter that he was charged with this watch—it was as soon as the owner was found—the prosecutor does not own the chain—the prisoner did not say, "I bought the watch at a sale," he dropped his head and said, "I shall not tell you"—I told him if he did, that I would make further inquiries—there was nothing whatever about a sale.</p>

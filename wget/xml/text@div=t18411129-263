                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, and live at Deptford; the prisoner was in my employ about four or five months. On the 19th of October he went out with goods, and all the money he took he made away with, and I discharged him on the 20th for doing so—I afterwards took him back again—he remained about eleven days—I was to give him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a</p>

I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of it—I sent him to market to buy fish, and when he sold it he should bring the money to me—on the 2nd of Novem<lb></lb>ber I gave him ten shillings, and two sixpences, and he was to receive 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., from a salesman in the Borough-market, which was left on some baskets—I saw him the same morning, and he said he had received it—he never brought me the money—I saw him no more till I gave him in charge, two days after—he said nothing till he was taken before the Magistrate—I have four lads in my employ.</p>

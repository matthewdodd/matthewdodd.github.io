               <p>Q. This was a dark night, and yet in the yard you saw him put the pots in his pocket? - A. Yes; there was a light in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. He ran out into the street? - A. Yes; I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you have him stopped the moment he put them in his pocket? - A. I chose to let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. You chose to let the man commit a felony when you could have prevented it, and then come here and ask a Jury to convict him? - A. I certainly meant to convict him.</p>
               <p>Q. You might have prevented his going out of the house with them? - A. I gave him an opportunity to run out.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might he be from the house when he was stopped? - A. About fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body follow him besides yourself? - A. Yes; Harry Weale.</p>
               <p>Q. You ran pretty fast? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You were determined not to lose your man? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What light was there for you to see him drop the pots? - A. The light of the lamps; it was very light.</p>
               <p>Q. He might have thrown away the fourth pot as well as the other three? - A. No; the man laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. He could not throw it away then? - A. No; I am glad he could not.</p>

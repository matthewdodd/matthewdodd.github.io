                  </hi>. I am a seaman—on Wednesday night 8th January, about 12.20 or 12.30, I was in Whitechapel Road, and when I was about 10 yards past a coffee-stall I was assaulted by seven or eighth men—I received a blow on my mouth, which loosened my teeth, and I fell—the prisoner Perry was over me, and I said "I shall know you again"—Birch put his hand on his throat—I know Birch by a scar on his throat; he was on my left side—I took my watch off my guard and put it in my trousers pocket—they found that it was not where it was Before, and they said "Itis not there, it must be in his trousers pocket"—my chain was across my waist before I met them—I could not eat anything for two days—I recognised Perry ina public-house, and gave him in charge—he said at the station, "You are mistaken in the party; what do you know about me?"—I said "I know You by your face"—he said "I am not the right one, but I know who did it"—I know him, because when I was down his face was over me—I got up, but I was half dead, and hardly knew whether I was standing on my head or my heels—I lost my watch and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had a couple of pots of beer.</p>

                  </hi>. At 10. 30 on the Wednesday night of this robbery, Perry came to my house and asked me to go out—I said "I don't mind, as it's my birthday"—we walked to Mile End, went to a public-house, and stopped there an hour and a half, till it shut up—a young woman came with him about fifty yards through North Street, and wished him "Good night"—he then had some supper at my house, and left—it was 12. 50 as we passed the church coming home again.</p>

               <p>I was going from Egham to Staines with a saddle-horse: when I got to Staines, I saw the prisoner, and he asked me what sort of a job I had, and if I would treat him with a pint of beer; I had seen him before; I did treat him; and I told him, if he would go with me to the Red-lion, I would treat him with another; we went there; and while we were there, he asked me to buy a shirt, a pair of stockings, and an handkerchief; I told him, if I could buy the things worth my money, I would; he went out, and he said he would go down the Bush yard, to fetch the things; I told him I would not go with him, he might go himself; in the mean time, I called the hostler out of the yard, and asked him if he knew any body that had lost any such things; I told him, if he thought the prisoner had come by it honestly, he would buy them, for I thought he wanted as bad as I did; they told me that they knew somebody that had lost such things out of a stable, and they suspected the prisoner to have got them; they told me to go a little way over the bridge, and make a bargain with him, but give him no money; I did so; he gave me a shirt and a pair of stockings, and asked me what I would give for them; I said he should set his own price; he said, a shilling and a pint of beer; then he pretended to go under the bridge, to do his occasions; in the mean time I beckoned to the two young fellows that followed me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080049"></xptr>to come and take him; and they did so, and took the things.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the City Army public-house, Great Tower-street. On the 30th of November the prisoner came with two other persons, and called for a pint of half-and-half—I gave it him, and he offered a good half-sovereign—I gave him two half-crowns, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, and looked at it—I am positive it was all good—one of his companions said, "You need not change, I have got coppers enough," and he put down 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner tendered me 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. back again—I immediately looked at it, and discovered that there was a bad half-crown—I told him of it, and he said, "I took it from you"—I held it in my hand, and one of his companions asked me to let him look at it—I held it up—he snatched at it, but did not get it—I sent for a constable, marked the half-crown, and gave it to the constable—I saw the prisoner searched, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were found on him—I am not positive which—I believe there were two sixpences among it, but no half-crown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Had you any suspicion of me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not look at your change any more than I would at other persons'—I looked at it before I gave it you—you took it off the counter—I swear I gave you two good half-crowns—I did not bite them, or weigh them—I did not take a half-crown while you stood there, that I have any recollection of.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. A person came in shirt-sleeves and gave him a half-crown, and he threw it into the till—when he took my change back he took it into his hand, and turned it over two or three times, and sounded this half-crown—he said, "This is a bad one, if you don't give me another I will give you into custody"—I said I had not got another—he staid then ten minutes, and I said, "If you do not give me change I will send for a po<lb></lb>liceman"—the policeman came, but nothing was found on me—not a farthing—they said so before the Magistrate, <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. He did say, "Why don't you send for a policeman?"—I never throw any thing into the till without looking at it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-police-constable</hi> 6.) I was sent for—I found the prisoner and two others—I took them into custody—I searched the prisoner, and found nine shillings and two sixpences on him—I took them to the station—they were ultimately discharged—I received this half-crown from Mr. Stowell, and have kept it ever since—I swear it is the same—among the silver I took from the prisoner there were no half-crowns—I believe I did on the first examination say I found nine shillings aid two sixpences, on the one that stood next to him, but I made a mistake, and Mr. Stowell told me of it—I went to the clerk and corrected it—I am sure the prisoner is the man I took the money from.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  </hi>. I keep the Pied Horse, in Chiswell-street. On the I 22nd of December, the prisoner came, and asked fox a glass of porter—I served him, and he offered me a good crown-piece—I was in the act of I giving him change—he asked how much it was—I said 1 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said, "I have halfpence enough to pay for it"—he took the crown-piece, and paid me the halfpence—after he drank the porter he called for another, and I offered me a crown-piece—I saw it was a bad one, and charged him with I it—hesaid, "If it is bad, give it to me back, I will give you another"—I refused to return it—he urged it—I sent for a policeman—I rang the bell I for my servant, and the prisoner ran out—I followed him, and he was caught I in the arras of the policeman—I handed the crown to the policeman, who I found on him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I saw two half-crowns, one shil-ling and a sixpence, myself—it was all good money, but no crown was I found on him.</p>

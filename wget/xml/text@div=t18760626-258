                  </hi>. I am manager to William Izzard and another, of 46, East<lb></lb>cheap—the prisoner entered the service on 22nd May, for a fortnight's trial—on 1st June, between 2 and 3 o'clock he asked me to let the lad go to the London and County Bank and cash a cheque for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he produced—he had previously asked me to lend him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the cheque. (<hi rend="italic">This was for</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">in favour of Thomas Dundee, and was signed John Masterman</hi>.) I called his attention to the front of it not being endorsed and he wrote on it "Charles Dundas" in my presence—I sent the lad to the bank and the prisoner left the office half an hour afterwards and did not return—the lad then came back and made a communication to me; I went to a drawer in the sale where the cheque-books were kept and missed a cheque-book marked B, all the cheques in which were marked S. 16,996—three cheques are missing from this cheque-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) so numbered—the prisoner did not come again till Saturday the 3rd, when he asked me if his salary had been drawn; I had sent for a policeman—he then asked me about the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I had lent him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187606260049"></xptr>
               <p>and said "I have a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in my pocket I will pay you back"—I said "Very well give it to me"—he hesitated and said "Are there any little matters in the office I can clear up before I leave"—I said "No"—he seemed fidgetty and I said "Well come and have a glass of wine"—we went and while having it he said "How about the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque"—I said "There seems to bo something wrong about that, the bankers have not cashed it"—he said "Where is it"—I said upstairs in the drawer—he said "You can bring it to me," giving the name of another firm where he said he-had got a situation—we then walked towards Seething Lane police-station where I charged him with stealing a cheque belonging to Mr. Izzard—I saw the missing cheque-book found in his pocket and in his pooket-book this cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., purporting to be signed by Izzard &amp; Betts—this is not the signa<lb></lb>ture of the firm; I asked him where he got the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, he said from a publican who was in business within a quarter of a mile—I asked him to take me there, but he made no reply—the inspector asked him who the publican was, but he gave no name.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi>). I was sent for to Messrs. Izzard &amp; Betts, about 2 o'clock, the prisoner walked to the station, and I there searched him and found this cheque-book in his pocket, and this cheque in his waistcoat pocket, and this letter addressed to the prisoner "Dear sir,—Will you kindly allow me to draw a cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Charles Dundas."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I found several other memoranda—I saw Dawe, and you go to a public-house together—I said to him "Do you require me," and I understood him to say "Presently."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I received the cheque from the drawer in what I con<lb></lb>sidered the most legitimate manner.

               <p>"Yes," and went to Mr. Dawe and asked him to lend me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. The man wrote a cheque on a plain piece of paper on the London and County Bank. I said "Do you bank there? We have several cheques of the London and County," and I got one. He filled it up, and I asked Mr. Dawe to let the boy go to the bank with it. Had I had any knowledge that the drawer had no account there, I should hare known that it was the act of a lunatic to send the cheque there.</p>

             St. Martin Outwich. The Prisoner was found breaking out of a celler window. I went with the watchmen, and found the Prisoner in the celler.</p>

               <p>Vernon. The celler belonging to the parish of St. Ethelburg, and we found the things that were about him, between his shirt and his skin.</p>

               <p>Vernon. There were several sorts of things.</p>

               <p>Q. Look upon these things, and see whether they belong to the workhouse of St. Ethelburg.</p>
               <p>Harman. They do belong to the workhouse; and these things were found upon the Prisoner, between his shirt and his skin.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the saucepan found between his shirt and his skin?</p>
               <p>Harman. The saucepan he had down in the celler, when he was taken, and there was a warning-pan that he left in the celler.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been in the house?</p>
               <p>Harman. He was passed in on Monday, about eleven o'clock, and this was on the Wednesday after; and if it had not been for a door and a holt, he might have killed me; for he said to me, D - n you, you b - h, if I could get at you, I would do for you.</p>
               <p>[It appeared that the Prisoner, since he had been in Newgate, had some signs of deliriousness, and behaved like a crazy man.]</p>

On the evening of the 13th of October the prisoner came to his shop, and bought a pair of black worsted stockings; there was on the counter a drawer of black ribbons - she did not offer to buy any of them, but when she was gone I received information, and looked over the ribbons, and missed one, which had been safe ten minutes before - I knew the prisoner; she lived in the neighbourhood; I knew that when she left the shop; she had gone the contrary way to her own house, and she must return past the shop - I sent a witness to stop her; I went and asked her into the shop - I saw her drop this ribbon outside the door, on the pavement; I said she had better tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What colour were the stockings? A. Black, and so was the ribbon; there were a good many other ribbons in the drawer, but no other of this width; I put the ribbon back into the drawer - I threw it in - my brother got the constable.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did the ribbons and stockings stand so near to one another, that she could take one with the other? A. No; the stockings were in paper, and the ribbon in a drawer; there was no other piece of ribbon in the drawer that I could mistake for this; there is about sixteen yards of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you sell her the stockings? A. Yes, and she had them in herlap when she came back.</p>

            . I was in the prosecutor's employ, and was in his shop; the prisoner was at the counter- the stockings were at the end of the counter, in paper, and the ribbons were in a drawer a very little distance from the stockings - I saw the prisoner put her hand into the drawer, take something out, and put it into her lap; I not know what it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near were the ribbons and stockings? A. A very little distance off - I knew where she lived; there was nothing to prevent her going straight home, but she went a contrary way, and passed our shop again.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was there any thing that mixed the stockings with the ribbons, so that one could be taken with the other? A. No; the stockings were on her lefthand side, and the ribbons on the right.</p>

On Saturday the 21st of February, about seven at night, I made all the sugar smooth where the heads were off, where I thought any body came to it; when I came into the warehouse on Monday morning, I found sugar had been stolen; I made it all smooth on the Monday night again, and on the Tuesday morning I went into the warehouse about a quarter after five o'clock; I took the keys with me over night to let myself into the yard; I do not sleep in the house; I went into the warehouse a little after five o'clock, and concealed myself up one pair of stairs; I waited there till about half past six, then I heard the prisoner open the accompting-house door; I saw him come up the yard with his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110059"></xptr>jacket and apron on, and an empty paper in his hand; I saw him go into the ground warehouse with that empty paper, and I saw him come out again with something in his lap; he then went a little way up the yard and put some chips over the parcel he had in his lap; I being up stairs called to him as he was coming down the yard again, and told him to stop; I ran down stairs as fast as I could, about ten stairs; I followed him into the accompting-house where he was to light the fire, I saw the sugar in his hand, then he was going to put it under the desk; I charged him with the robbery, which I said he had been carrying on a long time; he pleaded hard that I would not tell his employers; in the morning, about nine, I told Mr. Ibbutt, and this man then absented himself; he was away the whole day till late at night; he came to sleep in the house again, and on Thursday morning Mr. Ibbutt gave charge of him to a constable, and he was taken before the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long had the prisoner lived with Messrs. Ibbutts? - A. More than a year and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your situation? - A. A cooper; I had the care of the premisses.</p>

               <p>Q. Perhaps you know to what I allude, something respecting coals? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure you had no anger with him about coals? - A. No; he prevented me having coals out of the house as I used formerly to have.</p>
               <p>Q. As this happened in February, how came the prisoner not to be prosecuted last-sessions? - A. I came, and the Grand Jury was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know, of your own knowledge, that he was not there the whole day? - A. No.</p>

               <p>I am a warehouse-man; I have lived with Mess.

               <p>Q. Is the warehouse lest open, or has the prisoner the key of it? - A. He goes through to get chips to light his fire in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he lived in the house? - A. A year and a quarter or a year and a half.(The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called Robert Oliver, who had known him two or three years, and gave him a good character).</p>

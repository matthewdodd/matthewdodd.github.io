                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in Spring-garden, Mile-end Old-town. On the night of 5th Nov., there was a lot of us there, and there was a little <hi rend="italic">row</hi> between us about Guy Fawkes—the prisoner asked what was the meaning of it, and we said we did not know anything about it—on 6th Nov., about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in my own room, and heard a noise of persons talking in the court—I went out, and the prisoner asked me did I belong to the party last night—I said, "What party?"—he replied, "Oh, I beg your pardon, you are not," and turned away—on that my boy, who is about fifteen or sixteen years old, came out of doors—the prisoner turned about and said, "There is one of them"—he had a knife under his jacket, and he made a stab at the boy, but he drew back and escaped—I then laid bold of the prisoner by the shoulders and neck, and he <hi rend="italic">worked at me</hi> about the head and face with the knife—we struggled together—he gave me several wounds in the face with the knife, one on the left hand, and one in the left thigh—m smallclothes are cut through—I had five wounds altogether; I bled down into my shoes—we struggled for a bit, and it happened that I got him down on his face and hands on the flag-stones of the court—I cried out "Murder!"—he got up in spite of me—I laid hold of the knife, and took it from him, and then he broke off and went into his own house—his wife was there, and she and my boy attacked one another and another woman—I sent for a policeman, and had the prisoner taken—I went to the hospital, and had my wounds dressed.</p>

               <p>old. On Wednesday evening, 6th Nov., about seven o'clock, I was at home, and heard the prisoner speaking outside in the court—I went down after my father—he asked my father if he was one of the party that lived in that house, and then he made himself an answer, and begged his pardon, he was not—as I was coming out of doors, he said, "Here is one;" and he made a blow at me with a knife—I stepped back, and escaped—my father took hold of him to stop the blow, and he turned at my father, and struck at him with the hand; the knife was in it—it cut him, and I saw him bleeding from the head and face afterwards—I was not hit—I laid hold of the knife, but could not get it from him; my father did—I got a little bit of skin cut off my thumb, but nothing of any consequence.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Spring-gardens, in the same court as the prosecutor and prisoner. I am a labourer—on the evening of 6th Nov. I was coming from my door, up the court, and saw the prisoner coming from his own door—he asked me was I one of the party last night—I said, "No"—he said, "Oh. I beg your pardon, you were not"—Spillan then came out of his door, there were a few words between them, and then Spillan's son came out—the prisoner had a knife in his hand, and he attempted to stick young Spillan with it; he escaped, and Spillan caught the prisoner round the neck, I suppose to save his son; and then when I saw the knife going to work, I went back—I heard Spillan cry out, "Murder!" that he was stuck with the knife, and I saw his face and clothes all over blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know that the prisoner is a Protestant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know whether he is or not—I never saw him till that night—I did not see Mrs. Spillan with a brick, or young Spillan with a stick, nor any poker in old Spillan's hand—there was not much of a battle—there was no one there but the prisoner, the Spillans, me, and an<lb></lb>other man.</p>

I was called to Spring-gardens, and found the prosecutor bleeding from the face—I went to the prisoner's house, No. 7, and charged him with cutting and wounding Spillan—he said he had done no such thing, that he had been knocked about the head with a stick by the prosecutor's son, and he had witnesses to prove it, at the same time pointing to the stick which he had by the fire-side—I received this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Spillan—there were some clots of blood on the top of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On 6th Nov. Spillan was brought to the London Hospital, where I was the house-surgeon—he had five or six small wounds on his face, one on his hand, and one on his thigh, a mere skin-wound—two of those on the face were rather deep, but of no great magnitude—he lost a good deal of blood, the parts being very vascular—such a knife as this would cause the wounds—they were very slight.</p>

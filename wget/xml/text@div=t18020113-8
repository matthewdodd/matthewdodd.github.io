            ; the goods were removed from there to No.17, High-street, Shadwell; I was removing my goods; the drawers in which the notes were, were removed on the 22d, between twelve and one o'clock; I opened the drawer to take out the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you employed the prisoners to remove these goods? - A. I had not; I opened the drawer, and missed the money; the upper part of the chest of drawers were divided into two drawers; I looked in the drawer that I left the notes in, and they were gone; the other drawer had been taken out; I observed a piece of paper in the place where the drawers had been taken from; I looked, and found that to be the three twenty-pound bank-notes; I immediately inquired who had been there, and, in consequence of information, I went in quest of the two men who had removed these drawers; I found the prisoner Merriman; Sapwell, the officer, was with me; I don't recollect the name of the street; we found him in the street, and his wife with him; we took him to a public-house on the other side of the street; Sapwell searched him; I observed the woman drop something, watch proved to be a small pocket-book; Sapwell opened the pocket-book, and found two two-pound notes; we inquired of the woman where she got them; she said, she got them by her own earnings; she said, she was a silk weaver, or winder; she had a red cloak with her tied in a handkerchief, which she said she had bought six years ago at Portsmouth, where she bought the cloak she was then wearing nine years ago; Sapwell interrogated her a good deal where she had bought this cloak, but we could not find where she had bought it; Merriman was in the room all the time, in the custody of another officer; I then went to look after Bessiker; we found him, but could not discover any mark of suspicion on him, and the next day he came forwards before the Lord-Mayor, and told the whole story, and the Lord-Mayor thought proper to commit him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You found three twenty-pound bank-notes in the vacant place where the drawer with the other notes had been? - A. Yes.</p>

            They might; I had solded<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180201130011"></xptr>them in a piece of paper not an hour before they were missed; the cover in which they were solded was left in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I understand you to say, that, upon inquiry for the notes, and upon looking into the lrawer, you found the paper in which they had been folded? - A. No, it was found, but I did not find it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. HARWOOD sworn. - Q. You are the wife of the last witness? - A. Yes; on the 21st of December last I lived in the house of my father, David sonter, No. 90, Ratcliff-highway; were moved the goods on the 22d, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom were they removed? - A. By the two prisoners at the bar; they were porters.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you receive any bank-notes at any time? - A. Yes; Captain

               <p>Q. What was the amount of the whole? -

            When had you seen them in that drawer? - A. I saw them about eleven o'clock in the morning of the day that the prisoners removed them; I saw the prisoners take them out of No. 17, Shadwell High-street; I was there when the prisoners throught them in; about ten minutes after they were gone, Captain Harwood came in, with the key in his pocket; I wished him to take the notes but, as we were going out; I saw my husband open the drawers; the notes were not in the drawer, except three that were lying at the side where the other drawer should he.</p>

               <p>THOMAS SAPWELL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Hovell. I am a constable; I apprehended the prisoners; I apprehended Merriman first, on the 22d of December, in Sun-street, Bishopsgate-street; I searched him, but found nothing upon him; I searched Bessiker, but found nothing at all upon him; On Thursday, the 24th of December, Bessiker sent for me, after he was committed; I went to him along with his master.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you -Mr. Gurney. 
               <persName id="t18020113-8-person139">Q. </persName>
            Before he said any thing to you, did you or his master promise him any savour? - A. His master did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hovell. 
               <persName id="t18020113-8-person140">Q. </persName>
            Did you, in consequence of any information from Bessiker, find any notes? - A. I did, at NO. 7, Honey-lane-market, over the privy; I found a ten-pound note, No. 6276, dated September 16th, 1801.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Beibker point out the place were it was concealed? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else there? - A. I did not; I went back with Bessiker to the Compter, and Bessiker and Morman were put into a room together; I could not hear what passed, but Mr. IIell and Mr. Pheney were with them; I thought I heard Marriman say, that the notes were hid in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180201130012"></xptr>the passage of the house where he lived; they were both servants to Mr. Hall; I afterwards went with Merriman to his lodgings, No. 1, Ship-yard, Bishopsgate-street without; and between the passage and the stair-case I found two fifty-pound notes; Merriman put up his hand, and shoved up a paper between the wainscol and the boards, in which I found two fifty-pound notes, No. 9428, December 3d, and No. 758, December 5th; a twenty-pound note, No. 5801, December 3d; a ten-pound note, No. 4228, November 11th; a ten-pound note, No. 8800, October 29th; a five-pound note, No. 2646, August 25th; a five-pound note, No. 9151, November 6th; and a five-pound note, No. 7453, September 11th; I afterwards went to the French-Horn, in Crutchedsriars, and searched the privy with Bessiker, and he pointed out this book, (produces it;) the title of it, I believe, is Fair Rosamond.</p>
               <p>Q. Have these notes been in your custody ever since? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18020113-8-person141">Q. </persName>
            (To Mrs. Harwood.) Look at that book - is that the book you lost? - A. This is the book I lost, but it is very much disfigured.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the title of it? - A. Roach's Beautiful Extracts.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18020113-8-person142">Q. </persName>
            Now look at the notes - did you make any mark upon them? - A. No; the numbers correspond with the numbers of the notes that I received from Captain Harwood, which I put into the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the aperture of the drawer large enough for that book to have fallen out by the accident of removal? - A. It might have fallen out; the vacaney was large enough for a person's hand.</p>
               <p>Bessiker's defence. On the 22d of December, we went to Captain 
               <persName id="t18020113-8-person143">Harwood</persName>
            's with this lady said she would give us six-pence to bring a chest of drawers from her old house; we went, and were told that another porter had got them bringing, and we went back again; the porter was an old man, and could not bring them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Prisoner, you had better let me call your witnesses.</p>

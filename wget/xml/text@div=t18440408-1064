                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in George-street, London-fields, Hackney. I have known the prisoner seven or eight years, selling water-cresses in the street—I took her into my house—she was with me a week—I put a bag, with seven sovereigns and a half and some silver, into my pianoforte, in the back parlour—next morning I let her go out to the Sunday-school, as she represented—I went to the piano, in about half-an-hour, and the bag and sovereigns were gone—she did not return—I went to her father's house, and when she came in, I told her she had robbed me—she said no, she did net have it.</p>

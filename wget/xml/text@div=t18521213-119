                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, D</hi> 288). On Monday, 22nd Nov. I was on duty at the coiner of Prince's-street, Oxford-street, about one o'clock in the morning—I was standing still—the prisoner came up to me, and said, "You b—y thief, I have been looking for you some time; you attempted to rob me just now, I shall take your number"—I was in uniform—I had never seen him before—he put his hand in his pocket, to pull out his pocket-book, as I thought; he pulled his hand out again, and struck me on the side of the head with his list, and ran away—the blow did not produce any serious effect on me, and I ran after him to take him into custody—I overtook him crossing the road—I had come up to him, but bad not touched him—he turned round, took a stone bottle from under his coat, and struck me with it with all his force—he said, "There, you b—r, take that"—he struck me on the left side of my face, just under my eye—the blow felled me to the ground; after I had fallen he said, "I have not done with you yet," and he struck me three times with his fist in my mouth while I was on the ground, and he kicked at me; and after that I cannot recollect anything else—I did not come to my senses till 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning—I cannot say that I remember the medical man coming to me—I have not been on duty since.</p>

I was on duty, and was talking to Spratt when the prisoner came up and said, "You are the b—r I have been looking for; you attempted to rob me, I shall take your number"—he put his hand in his pocket, took it out, struck him, and ran off—I followed, and was half-way across the road; the prisoner took a bottle from his pocket, and struck Spratt to the ground; and when he was down, he struck him one, two, three; one after the other, and kicked at his head while he was down—I did not see him kick him more than once—when he had done this he ran down a passage—the first thing I did was to go and pick up Spratt who was bleeding profusely—I set him against the wall, went after the prisoner, and overtook him three parts of the way down the passage; I attempted to take him—he set his back against the wall, and put himself in a fighting attitude—after some considerable resistance, I took him in custody—I got him out of the passage, along Oxford street as far as a public-house, where another constable came to my assistance—as soon as the other officer put his hand on the prisoner's shoulder, he put his foot between his legs, threw him down and hurt his shoulders very much—I saw these pieces of a whisky-bottle picked up by a female close by where the blow was given—as soon as I had secured the prisoner I went back to Spratt—he was not sensible—I attended upon him until the medical man came—he remained insensible for some hours, and has not been on duty since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Baker-street, Portman<lb></lb>square. I was called to see Spratt on the 22nd. about 2 or half past 2 o'clock in the morning—he was just returning to his senses; I could make him answer questions by speaking loudly—I found a lacerated wound on the side of his face, both above and below the eye—he had bled a great deal—he is still on the sick list, and under my care—when I first saw him there were symptoms of concussion of the brain—the cut was not dangerous, but any blow that produces unconsciousness must be considered dangerous—another medical man had seen him before I did.</p>

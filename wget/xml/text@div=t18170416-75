               <p>GEORGE DONKIN. I am clerk to the post-office at Hull. On the 19th of February the London bag was made up, and forwarded in the usual way; it should have arrived in London on the 21st, if it had not duly arrived, I must have known it-it would have been reported.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. The sorter puts the letters into the bag - He is not here; but he is still living. The letters go through three hands before they are put into the bags.</p>
               <p>MR. LOCKE re-examined. I put the bills in the letter, and sealed it myself.</p>

            -Office; I was on duty on the 21st of February; the prisoner was also on duty on that day - He was stationed by the side of me, we both sorted at the eleventh division; he sorted the franks and paid letters.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. He was not a sorter, it was his own will to act in that department - He had been suspended before that, but assisted me through goodwill; he had not been employed as a sorter for sometime.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN CRITELEY. I am inspector of letter-carriers; the prisoner's employment was as a letter-carrier, he was in arrears, and suspended from collecting the postage of letters, untill his arrears were made up; he was allowed to deliver letters on which there was no postage to be collected. It was a common thing for him to assist in sorting; he was not prevented from sorting them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was he employed by the post-office to sort letters-was it part of his duty - A. He was paid as a person in the employ of the office; his payment, or best part of it, was taken for his substitute.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the course of his duty, before he was suspended, to deliver and assist in sorting-A. Yes; there are eleven carriers to the eleventh division.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was his duty before he was suspended, was it so after - A. He was not prohibited from doing it; he had been suspended a month or two, but attended at sorting times; he had about 70l. per annum; I deducted 15s. or 16s. per week for his substitute; the prisoner would have had the rest, and might give it to the post-office for his arrears; the substitute delivered the letters for which postage was to be received, but the prisoner delivered the paid letters. He attended at the time the sorting was going on.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not a letter-carrier different from a sorter-A. No; the letter-carrier sorts them, and divides them into walks before they leave the office; the letter-carriers of the eleventh division, assisted in sorting the letters of that division generally.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. The office of letter-carrier, and the office of sorter, are quite distinct; the carrier receives wages to one amount, and the sorter to another - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner received his salary as a carrier, and not as a sorter - A. Yes; although he might assist in the sorting, he was not to be paid for it; he did not receive any pay for it.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had not been employed by the post-office, would he have been allowed to sort - A. Certainly not.</p>

I was to be at the door when he went by my house. I slightly examined them, and waited at the door; and, in a short time, he passed. I joined him, and went into the Borough with him, where he had the early letters to deliver. I accompanied him, and after he had finished, we walked up the London-road and over Blackfriars-bridge, into the City. We went the back way into the City, and met Mr. Criteley in the back part of St. Paul's Church-yard, near Doctors' Commons. We dined together, in Fish-street - hill, at a public-house. The next day we met at the Windmill, in Nicholas-lane. I told him I had looked over the bills, and found that part of them were due; and that I did not understand how to get them paid. There was nobody else in the room. from there we went to the Cock and Bottle, in Cannon-street; before we got there, I selected the 195l. bill from the others; he said he thought the money might be got for it. I shewed it to him, and he looked at it. There were some persons in the room. From their conversation, I took them to be clerks. The prisoner told one of them, that he had a small bill from the counrty, payable at a banker's, and that he was not in the habit of having bills, and did not know how to get the money. The gentleman said, if it was payable at a banker's, he had nothing to do but to sign his name, and they would pay it. This was about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon.

The prisoner said, he had received a bill from the country, and wanted to know how he was to get it cashed. I asked him if it was a banker's bill, and if payable in London: he said, it was. I asked him the amount; I think, he said, it was 20l. I asked him whether it was payable to him; he replied, it was. I told him if he would endorse it, and give a reference to any person, I could get it cashed for him. I told him if the bill was not endorsed, it would require his endorsement before he could get it cashed.</p>

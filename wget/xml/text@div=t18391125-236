                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in Samuel street, Woolwich, in the parish of St. Mary, Woolwich. I have known the prisoner about eight years—his father lives about fourteen doors from my house—the side of my house forms the end of Henry-street where he lives—on the 17th of October I went to bed at a quarter past ten o'clock, and left my wife up—I had fastened every thing but the front door—I left my wife undressing the infant, with her mother by the fire—she came to bed after</p>

               <p>me—when I came down in the morning at a quarter before 7 o'clock, I found the front door fast and the kitchen window thown up—I had fastened it the night before—there was a box of lucifer matches on the table—I went into the back yard—nobody could get to the window without getting over the wall, the house being surrounded by a high wall—I saw an en<lb></lb>trance was made by taking ten tiles off the hay-loft, which were safe the night before—the woodwork the tiles rested on was taken away and the parties had then got down to the kitchen window—I then returned into the house and found the till open which I had locked the night before—you could get from the kitchen into the shop—I missed about 30 pence and 20 halfpence from the till—I then went into the parlour and found a work-box emptied, I missed a silver scent-box—a tea-caddy was also emptied—a cupboard was open where I keep papers, but nothing taken from it—I went up stairs and on the mat of the bed-room where I had slept, I found a candlestick and a small bit of candle standing on the mat, that had been left on the mantle-shelf the night before—the candle did not belong to the house, but the candlestick did—I went into my bed-room, and missed from a hook on the right band side of the fire-place, a gold watch, a gold chain, three seals, a gold key, and a metal key—I had used the metal key for winding it up—it was not attached to the watch—I had heard no noise in the course of the night—my wife and two children were asleep in the same room with me that night—I have seen the watch since—the maker's name is Desbois Wheeler.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father and mother, in Plumstead-place: I go to sea—I came home about three weeks before this happened—I went to school with the prisoner five years ago—I saw him on Tuesday night, the 22nd of October—he went to London with me—between seven and eight o'clock at night I met him on Britannia-hill, Woolwich—he asked me if I would let him go to London with me, as heheard I was going to the West India Docks—I left him then—I met him again in the morning (Wed<lb></lb>nesday) about twenty minutes to. nine o'clock—he asked me if I was going to London—I said Idid not mean to go to-day, but I did not wish to make a fool of him, and so I went to London with him—when we got to Charlton turnpike, he said he should pawn his <hi rend="italic">ticker</hi>—I asked him to show me what his <hi rend="italic">ticker</hi> was—he took a watch out of his waistcoat pocket, with a gold chain, three seals, and two keys, and gave it in my hand to look at—I said, did he think I was a fool because I said it was not a gold watch—I said I never had one in my band before—he put it in his waistcoat pocket again—he said he had saved up 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. while he lived at Charlton turnpike, and gave 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for</p>

The prisoner's exami<lb></lb>nation was read over to him, but he was not asked to sign it.</p>

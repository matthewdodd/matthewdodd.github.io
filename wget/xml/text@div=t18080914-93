On the 13th of September, between two and three o'clock, the prisoner came in the shop and asked me if Mr. Shearman was at home; I told him no; he turned round to the cocks, there was a quantity lying on the place. He untied his handkerchief and took cut an apple, and asked me if I would accept of an apple. He had left us, but was then engaged to come and instruct our apprentices. I told him I did not chuse to take the apple; being suspicious of him before, I looked at him, I saw him take the cock and put it into his handkerchief; I cast my eyes over the way, I saw Mr. Mosely, I begged of him to assist me; Mr. Mosely came directly; the prisoner then wanted to go out, I held him till Mr. Mosely came in, and took hold of him; Mr. Mosely shook him, he untied his handkerchief in the struggle; the prisoner shook his handkerchief, and the brass cock and three apples fell out of the handkerchief.</p>

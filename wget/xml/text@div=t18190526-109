            . I am agent to the prosecutors'; the two bales of goods in question were delivered at the wharf, and put into the warehouse on the Paddington wharf, with other goods - it was locked. There are three doors, which are fastened inside, and locked. On the 20th, as we were going to put them in the boat, we missed them; I immediately gave information of it all over the neighbourhood, and handbills were printed. The prisoner lived opposite our wharf. On the 26th, about six o'clock in the evening, I went to his house with Woodbury, he met us on the wharf, and seemed very white and confused. Woodbury asked him how many carts he had in the yard? - he keeps the wharf - he said he had one cart. Woodbury asked him if he had heard of the robbery? he said,</p>
               <p>"No, what robbery?" Woodbury said,</p>
               <p>"have you not heard of the robbery over at Stubbs and Worster's, about some pieces of nankeens and things, that have been stolen." He seemed very much agitated, and said he had found some pieces in the dunghill. We asked him where they were? he said in his house. He consented to our going into his house. We began to search, he pointed to a box full of pieces of nankeen and pillow fustians, and said</p>
               <p>"There is what I found." There were two boards laid by the side of the box, which would make a cover to it - it would then be a complete package; a saw also laid with the boards, as if it was ready to be packed up. The officer asked to search the stable? he said he had not got the key. The officer said he would break it open. He then said he thought he could find a key that would open it. I then perceived a piece of pillow fustian lying in the bed. I said</p>
               <p>"what is that? there is another piece there." He</p>
               <p>"yes, there is a piece there." Woodbury said if that is the case I must search the house, and immediately went to the bed, turned the clothes down, and found another piece of fustian in the bed. We found nine of the wrappers. He said he found them on Sunday morning, and had told nobody of it. It was very wet on Saturday night and Sunday morning, the goods appeared a little dusty, but nothing like dung or wet in the least. The box did not belong to us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. They were soiled - A. Yes, they would get that by moving about. He said there was a little dung scattered over them - there was a dunghill on the wharf. We found nothing in the stable. I had seen the goods in our warehouse. Either me or my nephew received them.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. I went to the prisoner's house with the last witness. On Monday the 26th of April, about six o'clock in the evening,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181905260037"></xptr>and saw him coming out of the door; I asked him how many carts he had in his yard - he said one. I asked him where it stood - he appeared confused, and pointed to a place where it did not stand. He knew I was an officer. I asked him if he had heard any thing of the robbery which had been committed on the opposite side of the water? he said,</p>
               <p>"No, what robbery?" I said,</p>

               <p>"Not heard of the robbery at Worster and Stubbs's, opposite you?" He said No, again. I said, if you know nothing of the robbery, do you know any thing of nankeens and corderoys? he said Yes, he had got some of them. I said then shew me where they are. He took me into his house, and pointed to a box in the middle of the room. I asked him if that was what he found? he said Yes. I said</p>

               <p>"is this all you found, you did not find them in this box, for they were lost in wrappers." He said he found them in the box. I asked where, he said in the yard, in the dunghill, on the Sunday morning. I asked if he had got the key of the stable - he said No. In going out Holt saw a piece of fustian under the bed. I asked the prisoner why he did not tell me he had got it there, and if he found that in the dunghill - he said Yes. I turned down the bed clothes, and found another piece in the bed - he never told me it was there. He said he found that in the dunghill also, and that he found them all in the box. The box was quite full without these two pieces - it would not hold them. I asked him who he had told that he found the property, and if he had told the carter or clerk of the wharf? he said No, he had told nobody. Bills had been posted about, and I had given them about the neighbourhood. The outside of the box was quite dry. There were two pieces of wood laid by it, which appeared just sawed - they quite fitted the box - there was sawdust about. Next evening I went and found several picklock keys.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He said he had told nobody whatever, that he had found them.</p>
               <p>Q. Since the prisoner's confinement has there not been more goods found in the neighbourhood - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was throwing the night soil up in the yard, stuck my fork against the box, and pulled it out; I went to the Horse and Sack, mentioned it, and inquired if they knew who had lost any thing? they said No. I heard nothing more until the witnesses came; I showed it to them, and said there were more pieces in the bed.</p>

            . I am clerk and foreman to Mr. Dove; I confirm his statement respecting the wharf. I saw the prisoner find the keys in the night soil.</p>

               <p>Q. On your solemn oath did you see him find the keys - A. I did, on my solemn oath. I borrowed one of them about five months ago to pick a lock of my own drawers - they were fastened together when he found them, I believe. He shovelled them out of the night soil.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before the robbery - A. About two years ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Where do you live - A. At No. 9, Lisson-green, North. I have been there nineteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. You had heard of the robbery - A. No, I had not. I came from dinner, turned into the public-house, saw the bill up, and went to the wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did you not know of the robbery before Monday - A. On my oath I did not - positively I did not know of it till the the middle of the day on Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear positively that you never heard or knew of the robbery till the middle of the day that the prisoner was apprehended - A. I did not, on my oath.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the librarians of the printed books in the British Museum—Sir Henry Ellis is principal librarian, and has the custody of every thing there. I have seen the prisoner there—I did not know him as a person reading in the library at the Museum, before Satur<lb></lb>day the 23rd of October—I saw him there about two o'clock that day—something had reached me, which directed my attention to him particu<lb></lb>larly—about four o'clock I was told he was leaving the Museum—I went up to him as he was going out at the door, and told him I wanted to speak to him—he came with me into the library—I had two books in my hand out of three which he had had—I said, "You had three of these books, and have returned two, what have you done with the third?"—he said he did not know, he might have forgotten it, left it on the table, or some-body else might have taken it away—he wanted to go and look for it—I said, "No, we must find the book first"—he then said, "Why, if it be lost, I will pay for it"—I said, no, that would not do—he then said, "Do you suspect me?"—I said it was very awkward, he had had some of our books, and I mentioned two which be had had, one on the 24th of July, and another which he had had two or three days before, which were both missing—he said he knew nothing about them—I had sent for Sir Henry Ellis, who presently arrived—I then said to him, "This gentleman has had three books, there are two here, and he says he knows nothing of the third"—Sir Henry Ellis said to him, "What have you to say?"—he denied it again, and Sir Henry said, "Go for a policeman"—I said, "I have already sent for one"—that was in the prisoner's hearing—he then said he wanted to speak to us alone—I said, "No"—he said, "You don't think I am capa<lb></lb>ble of stealing books," or words to that effect—I said, "Well, it is no use, you have a book in your pocket now, and the policeman will find it there when he comes"—he then, after some moments' hesitation, produced the book from his pocket—this is it—it is one of the books belonging to the library of the Museum—we then went on and met the policeman, and we told the policeman to take him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Eyre, and live in Prated-street, Paddington. I take in washing, and had fourteen silk handkerchiefs to wash for Mr. Barnwell—they hung on a line in the yard, on the 8th of December, at the back of my house—I was in the wash-house, and heard a knock at my door, about half-past two o'clock—I went to the door, and it was the milk girl—when I returned to the yard I saw three clothes-pegs lying on the ground—the yard is in closed by a wall four or five feet high—I missed three of the silk handkerchiefs, and went to a back gate to the yard, which I found open—It has a latch to it—I went out at the gate, and looked both ways, but saw nobody but a boy looking over a wall adjoining—he directed me after three boys running up the lane—I went out, after putting on my bonnet, but could not find them—I returned, and counted my handkerchief, and then went back—I met a policeman, and gave information at the station-house.</p>

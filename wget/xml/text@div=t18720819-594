                  </hi>. I am a draper at 43, Fore Street—on the morn<lb></lb>ing of 7th July, about 8.15, I came down stairs—I unbolted the shop door, but left it shut—I went down to the kitchen to breakfast—I heard strange steps overhead, and raced upstairs very fast and very lightly—I opened the door at the back of the shop quietly, and there I saw the prisoner and another man—they had stowed this flannel in a bag, and were about to put in more—I seized them both, one with one hand and one with the other, but they were too powerful for me—the other man made for the door and got out—I called "Stop thief! secure him!"—I still held the prisoner, but he succeeded in getting to the door, and got away—they had overpowered me at the door, and hurt my arm and legs so much I could not pursue them—I called "Stop thief!" as loud as I could—they left their two hats behind, and the flannel on the ground—this is the flannel; it was worth about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I called out, the neighbours took it up, and the prisoner was brought back to the shop in about five or six minutes—I recognised him directly—I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

On the morning of 7th August, about 8.25, I saw the prisoner running as fast as he could in London Wall pursued by a number of persons—he was without his coat and hat—I caught him—he said "I have only knocked a boy down"—those pursuing him said "He has been in Mr. Watson's shop"—I took him back to the shop and Mr. Watson identified him as being the man who was in his place—I took him to the station.</p>

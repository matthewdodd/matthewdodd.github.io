               <p>Pocock. This was the house of Mr. Milton; I went half way up stairs, and could see the fore-room where the two carpenters chests were, and I saw somebody getting out at the window; I ran out at the door and pursued him, and took him in the Shepherd's market, May-fair, it was the prisoner at the bar. I, with others, took him to the Dover-castle alehouse, he was taken before justice St. Lawrence on the Monday, and committed to the Gatehouse for farther examination; we went and found that one

               <p>Q. By whose order?</p>
               <p>Johnson. He sent the key to me to unlock it, and take the plane out, and lend it to a friend that is gone to work in the country, which I did.</p>

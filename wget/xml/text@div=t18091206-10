On the 9th of November last, at ten o'clock in the evening, I asked to go out to receive a letter which had been sent to Mrs. Lambert in Holiday-yard. About ten minutes after twelve I returned to the Windmill, the gates were locked; I had not lived there long, I did not like to ring. I went to the Golden Lion and asked for a lodging, the landlord said he could not let me lodge there. I saw these two prisoners in the house, and when I came out towards the door,

            . I am an officer, I was returning from Bow-street, turning up Cow-lane, I heard the cry of stop thief. I saw Silvester walking fast towards Snow-hill with a woman, and just as I came up to him, I heard somebody say, above I have found found the case. I directly laid hold of him by the arm. I said, there is a cry of stop thief, I must take you back to see what you have got, I perceived him put his right hand to his right hand jacket pocket. I immediately put my left hand into his right hand pocket, I took hold of a watch string, with a key and seal to it; he endeavoured to drop the watch, but I prevented him and took it from him. I took him back to where the watchman was, the prosecutor pointed him out, and said, this is the man that was with the other man. I took him to St. Sepulchre's watchhouse; I there asked the boy if he knew the name and number of the watch, he mentioned the name and number, I found it to correspond. I saw the case, and put the watch into it, and found it fitted. It had no case when I took it from Silvester; in taking him to the watchhouse, he said he found it. I know nothing of Crook only seeing him in the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a patrol, on the 9th of November I was on duty about half past twelve at night I went to visit the watchman in Cow-Lane; I heard the cry of stop thief, the alarm seemed to come from the corner of Smithfield, by the Golden Lion; I observed Crook running: I laid hold of him, and asked him what he was running for, he said there was nothing amiss. I told him I would detain him until I knew what was the reason of his running, in about two minutes a boy came, and said he had taken a watch from him; I took him to the watchhouse; I saw the other prisoner at the watchhouse.</p>

               <p>Crook's Defence. I am innocent of the charge.</p>
               <p>Silvester's Defence. I went into the Golden Lion to have a glass of liquor, coming out I slipped the toe of my shoe upon the seal of the watch; I stooped down and picked it up; I found it was a watch without a case. A woman accosted me going along, and while I was talking to her, the officer came and laid hold of me. I never offered to drop the watch out of my hands.</p>
               <p>Crook called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

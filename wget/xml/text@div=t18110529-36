            . Q.Do you know where Mrs. Pasley lives. - A. Yes, her house is in St. Martins-court. On Thursday night, April the 25th, about half-past eight, or between that and nine, I observed two men standing near about the middle of Mrs. Pasleys window, outside in the court. I observed that Mangham had his right hand, with the flap of his coat up to cover the glass, and his left hand was in the hole in the glass case, the show-glass which comes outside of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Does this show-glass stand in the shop. - A. No, it is outside of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you get at what is within that shew-glass, unless you break the show-glass, without going into the shop. - A. No, the shew-glass draws into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. But you could not get at that without breaking the show-glass or going into the shop. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there were two men standing there. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know them again. - A. Yes, both of them. I went by the shop door. Taylor was one of the persons that was standing close to the shop window, nearest to me, and Mangham was the other, he looked very hard at me.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was another person with Taylor, was that Mangham. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that the person that was with Taylor was Mangham. - A. When I was looking at Taylor, I was astonished at them, I cried out; Mangham turned round, and looked very hard at me: I am sure one of the persons I saw at the window was Mangham, there was a lamp just above his face that shewed a very great light, it hung over the shew-glass, and, by the help of that light, I saw his face perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lay hold of either of the persons. - A. I intended as Mangham was the last of them to seize him, he made off,

               <p>Mr. Ryenolds. Q. Be so kind as to tell me what you are. - A. I am an apprentice to Mr. Bicknell, a printer.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you condescend to tell me what brought you through this passage that night. - A. Certainly, Sir; I was going home, I intended to call at my brother's in Marshall street. I was coming past, it was in the middle of the court, the narrow part of the court goes into the square.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you there observing these men. - A. About a minute, before I seized Taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the whole observation you made before Taylor went off was about a minute. - A. Taylor did not go off, it was Mangham.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen him before. - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Mangham had his hat on - A. I do not think he had.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it you went to Bow-street. - A. When I saw Mangham at Bow-street, after he was taken, it might be a week afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was a whole week that you saw nothing of him. - A. I did not.</p>

I have seen him in company with Taylor at the Carpenter's Arms, at the back of Exeter change; in consequence of his description I apprehended him near Temple bar, near twelve at night. I found this wire in his pocket, they use this wire after they have starred the glass, what their fingers cannot reach out they put this wire in and hook it out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Spice, and live at Chelmsford, in Essex. The prisoner and her daughter came to me at the assizes—the prisoner took my lodging for her daughter and some young man—she used to come backwards and forwards—when she left she told me she should be back in a few days, and take the lodgings again—she came on the 3rd of August, but I was not at home—she dined there, and on Sunday morning she went out, and did not return—on the Monday I missed my cap and some other things—I went and found her on board the bulks at Woolwich with the cap on her head—I asked her if she knew me—she said, "No"—I asked her if she recollected being at Chelms<lb></lb>ford—she said, "No"—I said, "You took my lodgings at your son's trial"—I said I had not followed her for her bill which she had not paid, but for my cap, which she then had on her head—she said it was a bought one—I said, "I know it is, for I paid for it"—I knew it by the particular make and trimming—I gave her in charge of the Wool<lb></lb>wich constable—a key was taken from her which I have examined with my drawers—it locks and unlocks them—when I saw her at the station-house in town she had not got the cap on—it was lost.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to the prosecutor. I remember the prisoner being there on the 3rd of August, and leaving on the 4th—the drawers that the key fits are in the sitting-room up stairs—I saw them locked on the Friday before my mistress left—on Sunday morning the pri<lb></lb>soner left, and said she would come back in half-an-hour—my mistress re<lb></lb>turned on Monday—she found the drawers still locked, but the property gone—the prisoner had the use of that room—no one else had been in it between the Sunday and Monday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is this an eating-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, people go in the rooms, but these were private rooms—the bed-room was not locked—there are four rooms up stairs—I don't know what is become of the daughter—she went away—I saw the prisoner leave—she had her bonnet on—there was nothing remarkable about her.</p>

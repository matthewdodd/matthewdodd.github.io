                  </hi>. On Thursday morning, the 11th of Sept., I left my horse and cart in the care of John Evans, at the top of James-street, Long<lb></lb>acre—it contained damsons, apples, and potatoes—I went into the market—I was away about eight or ten minutes—when I came back the horse and cart were gone, and all its contents—the horse was worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found it at Bow-street, and the cart also—I lost all my things—I do not know the prisoner.</p>

I had the horse and cart to take care of, and a dozen others besides—I saw the prisoner about there for an hour and a half—he then came up to me, said he was ready to go with the cart, and asked for the whip—I gave it him—he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for minding the cart.</p>

                  </hi>. I heard that the cart was gone, and went after it to Bayswater—I there found the Prisoner, with the horse, cart, and fruit—he was coming back again, towards Oxford-street—I accused him of the rob<lb></lb>bery, and said, "I have got you"—he cried, and said he knew nothing at all about it—I charged him with stealing the cart—he said a man gave him the job to do, and offered him some halfpence to do it—there were a few apples and damsons in the cart—I asked him if he had any money, he said 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I drove to the station-house with him.</p>

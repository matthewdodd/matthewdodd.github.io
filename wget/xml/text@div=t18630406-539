                  </hi>. I live at 4, Cleveland-street, Mile-end-road. On Friday, 27th February, I was with Ellen Clark, in the City-road—we met Johnson and two others—they spoke to us, and we thought the man who is not here was a friend from the country; and he, Johnson, Clark, and I, went to the Vernon Arms, City-road; we had some ale—there was some raffling, and the prisoner Beeston came in with a pin, and asked 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it. Johnson said he would give him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, which was refused—Beeston took out three cards to raffle for the pin, and they bet 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that they would win it, and Johnson lost—after they had lost twice, we lent them our watches, because they had lost their money, until they could get a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note changed, which Johnson produced—I did not have it in my hand, but I saw 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—the man who is not here wanted to change it; he and Johnson suggested our lending our watches; the man who is not here said that he had lost 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—mine was a gold watch and a gold chain, worth about 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. together—</p>

               <p>Beeston had both watches in his care—I saw mine in his possession after delivering it up—the man who is not here then wanted me to go out with him to change the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I at first said, "No;" and afterwards I said I would, if my friend Clark stayed with the watches—she stayed in the Vernon Arms with Johnson and Beeston, and I went with the third man a little way up the street—he left me at the corner of the street, and told me to wait there—he ran across to a public-house to change the note and returned in about two minutes, saying that he could not change it there—I did not see the note again—he walked down the street half-way to the Vernon Arms with me, and told me to go and tell Johnson and my friend that he was going to borrow 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Church—I returned to the Vernon Arms, and Ellen Clark was outside the house looking for me—I went in, but the man and the watches had gone—I remained looking for them about twenty minute—I next saw Beeston again at Islington-station—my watch was taken against my consent—I only lent it till the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was exchanged.</p>

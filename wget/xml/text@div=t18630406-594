               <p>it up to us—he sent up journey-sheets every Saturday evening—he remitted money from time to time throughout the journey, when he had it in a re<lb></lb>mittable form—the journey-sheet should be a copy of this book, containing the amount of the bill delivered, the amount of deductions, and the amount paid—the journey-sheets received by us were entered in a book called the travellers'-book—on his return home, that book was compared with this one, the total amount of receipts were agreed, the sums remitted on the journey were deducted, and it was his duty then to hand us over the balance—any moneys received by him after sending the last journey-sheet, it was his duty to enter in the travellers'-book, striking the balance, and paying over the money—there is no journey-sheet including the 5th November; that date is in the book—there is no sum in the travellers'-book of 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Lingford on 5th November, or near that date, but there is a sum of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from J. Lingford on 5th November—the entries I am now reading are in the prisoner's writing—there is no entry on 16th September of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but there is an entry of 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from J.

Signed "George Gingell.</hi>")—Supposing that 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to have been paid before the last journey, Mr. J.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe your father attends more to the books, and knows more about the business generally than you do? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He does—the prisoner sends letters to us, in which the cash remittances are contained; bank notes, bills, and cheques, are all entered as cash—on receiving remittances, we always enter the particulars of each cheque and each form of money that comes, and the total amount is entered in the cash-book as "cash"—half notes and cheques are the usual forms in which we receive money—we have no printed or written instructions for our travellers; we have not sufficient travellers to make that necessary—the prisoner, as clerk in the counting-house, knew the customs of his prede<lb></lb>cessors, and the ordinary routine in our establishment—the sums given credit for at the end of the journey vary from 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on an average, each journey—there are eight journeys in the year—the journey generally lasts about five weeks—the prisoner lived at York, and was in the habit of going home every Saturday night, and spending the Sunday—he only travelled in the north for us—he has lived in York for about fifteen or eighteen months, I believe—he ought to be in London about a week after each journey, but latterly he has not been in London, as far as we know, more than about two or three days after each journey—on the last three or four journeys he has said, for instance, "I hope to be at home on Tuesday evening," and then has not returned till perhaps the Friday evening—we have never had any settlement with him of his salary account since he has been in our employ—I have examined the account made up by my father, as to the salary due to him—there was no regular time when his salary account ought to have been settled—there was a book kept for the purpose, and when he wanted to pay himself salary he would write "George Gingell</p>

               <p>20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and that would be, as it were, a sort of debit to him of the amount of salary received; and more often than not he would deduct the amount from what he handed over—that was not in a book kept for that purpose alone, but an ordinary cash-book which lies on the desk—that has invariably been the practice; all our clerks and travellers do the same—the prisoner had borne a good character until within the last six months—his authority with regard to the amount of discount to be allowed was in the main limited, but of course a representative has always power to take exceptional cases into account, and it was his duty to write to us and ask, or, having taken an extraordinary course, to write and say that he had done so—that would be generally the rule of all travellers—there have been instances where the prisoner has taken off larger discount than we allowed, and he has been spoken to and told not to do so any more—when he handed in the balance at the end of a journey, he generally saw it entered in the cash-book; we often, but not always, initial the end of the balance in the journey-book; it was not the ordinary practice to do so—the entries were always made by myself, or by my father, in the cash-book—the amount of collections is summed up at the end of the book, and carried back to the first page; at the beginning of the journey the first page is left blank, and at the end, the total amount of collections is carried back on to it—the places from which the remittances come are given, with the dates of the remittances—that was the ordinary way in which the book was kept—there was no specific limit given to the prisoner for him to decide when he had enough to render it worth while remitting; if he had 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, I should not consider that worth remitting; but if he had a cheque, and could make up 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he would be expected to remit that—he was taken in custody on 10th March, and taken before a Magistrate—neither of the charges now before the Court were those investigated before the Magistrate—I do not know what opportunity the prisoner has had of looking over these accounts and seeing whether there is any mistake—we could not see him to call his atten<lb></lb>tion to it—I do not know where he was taken—I am quite sure he did not come twice to our establishment—he did not come there to keep an appoint<lb></lb>ment; he was taken on the way to our place—I do not know when he came to town—I went on two, and my brother on three occasions, to his lodgings, and we could not see him; we had written to say we were coming; and the day previous to his being taken, I put the matter into the hands of the de<lb></lb>tective officers—the letter of 9th March was dated from the City—I knew his lodging—I was there on the 9th; his house was watched on the night of the 9th—I believe he was there on the 8th; they told me that he was—he had left there early on the 9th, and was on his way to our house—I had not received a message that morning of his being ill—we heard the previous week that he was ill, and my father saw him; he was confined to the house, and next morning my father saw him on the platform of the railway station—99, Queen's-road, Dalston, was the lodging-house I went to on the 9th—no one from that house is here that I am aware of—the last time he had been in our establishment was before starting for the last journey; (<hi rend="italic">referring to the book</hi>) I should suppose the 14th January would be on Tuesday or Monday, and he had not been, I think, to our place since the previous Saturday; but I cannot say; he might have come on the Monday morning—I am not sure whether he went straight through that journey, or whether he asked leave to be away three or four days in the middle of it; he did complete that journey—26th February is the day of the last receipt, and in the ordinary course he would come to our warehouse on 27th or 28th</p>

               <p>February—the last, entry is from Peterborough, and he can come up from there in two or three hours; the date of that is 26th February, and that is the last place he goes to on coming home—we have a customer named Samuel Sutton Lingford in the same way of business as Mr. Joseph Ling<lb></lb>ford—he had some goods from us on 13th December, the gross amount of which was 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., subject to discounts and allowances—Mr. Samuel Lingford generally pays on the second journey after the receipt of the goods—we never had a journey overpaid before this one in which the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over<lb></lb>plus occurred—I never recollect such a thing happening before—that would not necessarily show that the prisoner had received more money than he had given the particulars of in his journey-sheets—he might have had 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about him of his own, and in remitting the last amount from Hull he might have mixed it up with his own money—I never spoke to him on the subject—I suppose ours is a large business.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the senior partner in the firm—the prisoner at times accounted to me as well as to my son—if I and my son, who has been examined, were absent, my other son might have received money from the prisoner, but I know of no instance in which be ever did—on the first of these three journeys he accounted to me, and handed over the balance of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to his own salary account, as will appear by the cash-book—on his second journey he remitted more from Hull than he had charged himself with as having received—he stated, when we were balancing the account, that that had better go to the next journey account—I went and saw him on 28th March, at Adelaide-road, when I received the 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. brought by the wife—he said then that he was suffering from an attack of bronchitis—I went there knowing that he was ill—I think the conversation was almost exclusively confined to the state of his health, and I recommended him to stay indoors, and not to come down to the factory till the Monday following—I do not think anything passed about the accounts then—he gave me his book on that Saturday, and on my return to the counting-house I looked to see whether the account there corresponded with the account which we had in our book—I found that there was a difference, and that there was a much larger balance due than there ought to have been on the journey—I wrote to him on the subject and had my note posted—I saw him on the Tuesday after; as I wan going by the train, I was much surprised to see him at the Kingsland-station—I said, "I am going to call on you"—he told me that he had been down into Essex to see a relative of his wife's, and I said, "Then you have not received the letter I wrote to you, if you went on Saturday?"—he said, "No"—I said, "It is a matter of some importance, and I will not go in with you now, but I will make a call, and come and see you in half an hour's time or so," in order that he might have an opportu<lb></lb>nity of reading the letter—on my return I told him that if he was unable to pay the balance of that account, e had better pay me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at once—he paid me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said he would make it all right if I would let him go out on his journey—I said that I could not do that till it was satisfactorily explained to me what he had done with the money—I told him that if he would give me a true account of what had become of the money by Friday, I would wait until then, and he could communicate with his friends, if he chose—he did not do so on the Friday, and I then went up to Adelaide-road again, and found that he had left—the lady there gave me the address where she thought he would be found, and I went to Queen's-road, Dalston, but failed to see him—I did not see him again, I think, until to-day—120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd was the amount due on that journey—it was reduced by 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he paid me, and by another 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he subsequently sent down by letter, but no part of the 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been paid—the 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. has not been paid to us in any shape, nor the 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. De Forges—the 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is entirely from the last journey.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you manage the principal part of the accounts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I manage the posting of the credits in the ledger—I have never had a settlement with the prisoner on the subject of his salary since he has been in my employment—I have been through the account to see how much he has received for salary—I have gone through the different parts of our books where he has debited himself with cash—he has retained so much out of his collections for his salary—there was no regular time at which he did that—he simply made an entry against himself of so much money which he retained himself—instead of getting 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of my pocket, he has 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186304060056"></xptr>
               <p>ours, and he hands us in 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with the ticket for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but not invariably so; he sometimes has cash paid to him out of the cash-box—I never sent him money to York—the account shows that his salary is overdrawn—this (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) is the original account that I made out, and I copied it and sent it to him—my books are here—we gave him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from 25th June, 1857 to 1858—120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from 1858 to 1859, and 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from 1859 to 1860—from 1860 to the 1st of March, 1863, we gave him 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—those are the amounts that I have given him credit for—I am not quite certain about the date of the arrangement that he was to have 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, but it was when we removed from Goodman-yard to Bow—we began a fresh set of books, and we then put down the prisoner's salary at 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—whether that was communicated to him at the time I cannot say—I do not know that it was previous to that that we agreed to give him 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; to the best of my knowledge and belief it was not, but I cannot say farther than that—if that were so, it would make a differ<lb></lb>ence in the account—I remember when he broke his leg, and was put to certain expenses of being nursed in the country—I will swear that I did not promise that I would pay those expenses; his salary was continued all the time that he was away from business—he was brought home—he was travel<lb></lb>ling in our service at the time of the accident—I am sure that nothing passed between us about my undertaking to pay the expenses of that acci<lb></lb>dent; neither verbally nor by letter to my recollection—it happened some three years ago, and I should not like to go farther than by recollection—I was not examined at the police-court—I believe the balance on the last journey formed no subject of the charge there at all.</p>

            Yes; the accompting-house is in the shop, and the desk I had affixed to the accompting-house; it was on the Tuesday I found the box broken open, and all the four notes were taken out.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. You cannot know that - A. I know the note to be mine, by my own hand-writing, of the name of the person I took it off. I saw the ten-pound note at Mr. Banton's, a pawnbroker, in Skinner-street, I saw it on Wednesday, and I saw the one-pound note on the same day; I missed it on Monday. On the ten-pound note was my own hand-writing, of the name of the person I took it of; I have not seen neither of the two other notes; the notes I have seen, they are my own property; I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>COURT. When had you seen the prisoner last in your shop - A. On the Saturday prior to the Monday.</p>

I am a clerk to benefit societies; I manage the undertaking for my mother; I look for no pay of my mother, neither have I any of my mother.</p>

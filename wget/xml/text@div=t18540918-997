                  <hi rend="italic">could not point to any precedent which would support his application to the letter; but it was reasonable and fair that persons should be tried only for one offence upon one indictment; here there were three distinct charges, having no connection with each other, separately alleged in different Counts, and affecting differently the parties charged; and although the latitude was allowed at common law of placing any number of misdemeanors in one indictment, yet that had been rather for the purpose of stating in various ways the parti<lb></lb>cular offence (the facts of which might not be thoroughly understood until proved in Court), and adapting some of the several Counts to the nature of the case, according to the judgment or skill of the pleader.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">contended that this was an objection which, if sustainable at all, was apparent upon the face of the record, and the defendants should have demurred, or taken the opinion of the Court at an earlier stage. It was perfectly clear in law that any number of misdemeanors might be included in one indictment; and by a modern act, more than one case of felony might now be included in the same indictment; he therefore submitted that the objection was not tenable.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE ERLE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was of opinion (in which</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">then stated the facts of the other cases to the Jury, after which</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">expressed an opinion that although by the strict rule of law, these cases might each be laid before the Jury, yet it might be inconvenient where the evidence affected the parties charged, in a different manner, and therefore it would be better that the prosecutors should elect upon which case to proceed.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">suggested that in the event of their electing to pro<lb></lb>ceed upon any one Count, autrefois acquit might be pleaded as to the others.</hi>

               <p>no other affidavit of Howe's—this one was sworn before me; I am a Com<lb></lb>missioner for taking affidavits—this memorandum directing the writ to issue, was made on 22nd April—on 27th April, I was in attendance at the Judges' Chambers—I saw Howe there—he presented a paper to me (<hi rend="italic">looking atone</hi>)—the summons was heard before Mr. Justice Wightman, and his clerk has the affidavit (<hi rend="italic">they were produced</hi>)—I cannot swear to the defendant Thompson's handwriting—I have a slight belief about it; I know him, and very likely I have seen him write, and acted upon his writing, but I cannot call it to mind—as far as my belief goes, I think I have seen him write, and I believe this signature of "William Thompson" to be his writing—the signature to this other affidavit I believe to be Howe's—they appear to have been made before Mr. Justice Wightman; I believe they were sworn before Mr. Morris.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued.</hi>) The paper that Howe produced on the 27th, was a notice with a consent at the back—I am certain that Howe produced it; this is it (<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "Notice. 25th April, 1854. The Queen against Mary Ann Blatchford; felony. Take notice, that I shall tender as bail for the abovenamed Mary Ann Blatchford, on Thursday, 27th April, at half past two o'clock in the afternoon, William Hughes, of the Sportsman beer shop, Grange-road, Bermondsey, beer shop keeper, and William Rock, of No. 4, Beaumont-square, Mile End-road, bookseller, pursuant to the order of the Honourable Mr. Justice Wightman, here-unto annexed. Signed, Reuben Simpson, No. 107, Blackfriars-road."—That order is, "Upon hearing the affidavits of William Howe and William Thompson, I do order that the prisoner, Mary Ann Blatchford, be admitted to bail as to this charge, William Blatchford, her husband, in the sum of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and two sureties of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; the prisoner to give forty-eight hours' notice of bail to the prosecutrix"—I really do not know whose handwriting this "Reuben Simpson" is; I do not know Mr. Simpson's handwriting—I should rather think it is Howe's handwriting, but I could not swear it; it was produced to me by Howe—I really cannot say whose handwriting it is—that order would operate as a discharge of Blatchford, upon bail being put in—bail would not be accepted if the forty-eight hours' notice was not given, unless the parties come and consent—if no consent is given, then we require proof of the forty-eight hours' notice; but where consent is given, and parties appear on both sides, it is dispensed with—at the time Howe showed me the notice, he told me that he had got a consent to the bail; and at the same time he produced this paper (<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "I consent to the within bail. R. Hare, 27th April, 1854")—upon seeing that, I said, "Who is R. Hare," or "Mr. Hare?"—Howe said, "The prosecutrix's attorney"—I said, "If so, he must state himself as such," and I gave him back the paper—at that time there were several persons standing round; I did not notice any one, not to know the person—in the course of a minute or two Howe returned the paper to me with these words, "Prosecutrix's attorney" added to it—I did</p>

               <p>not notice anybody write those words—I cannot swear that I saw a person write the words; the paper was returned to me immediately by Howe, wet, the ink was not dry; he certainly did not write it himself—I know Gavin Rickards very well—I did not see him there on that occasion that I know of—upon that consent the order was made for the discharge—I have known Gavin Rickards acting at the Judges' Chambers for many years, as clerk to different attorneys—I think I know his handwriting—I could not swear to this being his handwriting—I have no belief as to the hand writing, I cannot say one way or the other—I could not say I believe it to be his handwrit<lb></lb>ing—I am not sufficiently acquainted with his handwriting to say so—Howe certainly did not write it, he was so close to me that I must have seen him, and I should not have received it if he had done it—the ink was wet when it was handed to me; I remember blotting it up.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As a general rule, the majority of summonses purporting to have the consent of the principals are signed by the clerk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the majority of cases; but for the discharge of a prisoner for a large sum of money, I should not take it—I have known Howe practising for many years in the Judges' Chambers, and should say in all sorts of proceedings—when there is a summons at the Judges' Chambers, and one party is waiting for the other, it is the practice to call out the name of the cause over and over again—I did not on 27th April hear Howe call out, "The Queen against Blatchford," that I know of; I did not notice—I do not remember how long Howe was there upon that day—I cannot say whether he called out over and over again, "The Queen and Blatchford"—I do not remember at what time in the afternoon the order for the discharge was made—I have some-times known the clerks of Magistrates attend before the Judges with the depositions on questions of bail—it is a very noisy place sometimes outside the Judges' Chambers—I do not know that Magistrates' clerks have attended to oppose bail; they may have gone in—I do not attend inside, unless I am required to go in—another gentleman attends inside, but I take</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180037"></xptr>
               <p>it he would not take any notice of what was going forward before the Judge—applications are frequently made to admit persons to bail, who have been committed for trial—counsel have frequently attended to make such appli<lb></lb>cations, and have handed in affidavits—attorneys have attended as well as attorneys' clerks—I do not remember a book of practice being looked at at the time these recognizances were being entered into—I do not remember assisting them as regards the form of the recognizance—they might have asked for the book of practice; I do not remember it—they would have had it if they had asked for it—sometimes it is asked for.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know whether there is any such person as Reuben Simpson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A person was pointed out to me this morning as Mr. Simpson—I do not know, except from Howe's representations, that he was clerk to that person; I have no knowledge of it—I was in the lobby of this Court when some<lb></lb>body said, "There is Mr. Simpson"—Howe has on many occasions, indeed I believe always, represented himself as clerk to Mr. Simpson—it is a very common case, so many summonses as we have, to take the signature of a clerk representing the principal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that you would do so in such a case as the one in which the signature of Hare, as the prosecutrix's attorney, was signed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Know<lb></lb>ing the party in this case, Mr. Howe, who has attended us upon so many occasions, and coming through his hands, I accepted it, because I did not know who gave the consent, I supposed it was given by Mr. Hare—I sup<lb></lb>posed it to be Mr. Hare's writing—if I had not supposed it to be Mr. Hare's writing, I should not have allowed the writ to issue.</p>

               <p>with a felony, is or is not the principal's signature necessary, or would the clerk's be taken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I say again, that would depend upon circumstances—in some offices where I know the clerk, and where he has conducted the whole of the proceedings, and I know that he is authorized to proceed and act in the matter, I should take his consent—until Mr. Hare was pointed out to me the other day, I did not know him as Mr. Hare—I knew him personally—I certainly should not have taken the signature of a clerk of a Mr. Hare—I should not have taken any signature but the principal's in that case, but in some cases, where I am acquainted with the office, and where I know the clerk is authorized to conduct the proceedings, and where he has con<lb></lb>ducted them throughout, I should take his consent—in this case I should not have taken the consent of any person representing himself to be clerk to a Mr. Hare, because I did not know Mr. Hare—if Howe had not represented this to be Hare's signature, I should not have allowed it to pass.</p>

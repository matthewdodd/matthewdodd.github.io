The prisoner has not been employed by me since October - he had been about a month in my employ. On the 15th of February I went to Nottingdal - I knew the prisoner was building a cottage there - I saw from 1500 to 2000 bricks by the side of that cottage; I examined their quality - I had a quantity of bricks at some building in Sovereign-street; I took a sample of those bricks to the prisoner's premises, and they corresponded in every way; none of them had any initials on them - they were all of one colour, and what are called seconds, such as are put in the fronts of houses - it is usual, when builders buy bricks, to receive a ticket with them, and sometimes we have two; one of which we sign and send back - I had a conversation with Beal, and, in consequence of that, went to the prisoner, and said, "Hancocks, where did you get those seconds from?" and asked him where the tickets were - he said he had none, nor never had any; but he could take me to the man he bought them off; he took me to a man at the corner of Polygan-street, about two hundred yards from his own place, and said to him, "Did not I buy those bricks of you?" - the man said, "Yes; you gave me 35s. for the lot;" nothing was said about the quality; I asked where he bought them - he said, of a respectable man in St. John's-woodgrove, and he brought them home in his own horse and cart - it would take two large carts to hold them - I directly fetched Wabster, the officer, who took the man who said he had sold them, and then went back and took the prisoner - the Magistrate committed him, and discharged the other man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You told the same story to the Magistrate about the man? A. I believe I did - here is a sample of each lot of bricks - I swear they are both from one kiln; I believe it is a general custom to have a delivery-ticket - bricks have been brought without a ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. If you bought them of a person who had bought them from the clamp, would you have a delivery ticket from that person? A. No. The prisoner would not want seconds for this cottage, but he has used some of all sorts at it; we do not usually go to different makers for bricks to build a small cottage; I had missed bricks about a month or two before - mine were in a stack before my own buildings. The cottage is about two miles and a quarter from my buildings. My carpenters begin work at break of day; they cart bricks much earlier; his building is in a bye road.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you missed a large or small quantity of bricks? A. I missed a few at a time, but more than 1500 in all. I have seen the prisoner's cart; I never bought so small a quantity as that would hold; I always have a ticket with every load.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Falkus' employ. I did not know the prisoner previous to the 15th of February - I saw him about a quarter past six o'clock that morning, in Frederick-street, which joins Sovereign-street, with his horse and cart loaded with bricks; he was fifty or eighty yards from Falkus' premises; I followed him about three hundred yards - he stopped; I did not speak to him, but took particular notice of the bricks; I saw no reason for his stopping - he stopped, and looked steadfastly at me; the bricks were the same sort as Falkus had in Sovereign-street, as near as it is possible to speak - they are seconds. I went and told Falkus; the prisoner was going towards Edgware-road, which was the way to his cottage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It would not be unnatural to take a load of bricks at that time? A. No - but it is unusual<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150090"></xptr>to use seconds with rough-place bricks. I cannot point out which of these two bricks produced came from master's premises; I cannot say that any of the bricks in the cart have been found, but they were bright ones, of this description. There are bricks called cutters - I cannot tell them from a second, nor a paviour from a front; I speak to the colour of these bricks - they resembled these in colour; I saw the man who said he sold them; it was said he had been carter to the prisoner; I do not know that he has absconded.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are these the same kind of bricks as your master has? A. Yes. I went to the prisoner's cottage.</p>

             re-examined. I asked the prisoner where he got the bricks - he said he bought them in the grove, meaning St. John's-wood-grove; I asked him again, and he said, in St. John's-wood-road - that is a quarter of a mile distant; he afterwards said they came from the foot of Primrose-hill - that is about a mile from the grove; he afterwards named the Uxbridge-road; he said at first that his man bought them for 35s., and then that he gave 35s. for them. This is one of the bricks brought from his premises - 2000 would come to about 6l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In what progress is your house? A. The first story is on. I missed some bricks that day - he said he bought them himself at last; and that is why I took him, because he prevaricated; he said he bought them himself, at Primrose-hill.</p>

            . I live in Polygan-mews. I know nothing about these new bricks; but on this morning I saw the cart loaded with old bricks; there was not a new one among them, to the best of my knowledge; I saw it loaded about seven o'clock the night before (Wednesday), and it was taken away in the morning - I did not see it go away - I believe it was the prisoner's cart; I do not know what became of it - I saw no name on the cart, nor the person who was with it. I know the prisoner - he lodged a year and a half with me. I was at my window, which was open.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could you see where the bricks came from? A. Yes, a person who was digging a sewer wheeled them from the side of a pig-sty. I saw the same cart come back next day, and it was loaded again with old bricks, about the middle of the day. I live about one hundred yards from Sovereign-street; I saw nobody with the cart either time - I think it was the prisoner's cart - I believe he owns it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the prisoner? A. A carman; I knew he was building a cottage; he kept his horse and cart on my premises; I believe it was his horse and cart that I saw - I saw it return the next day. I can swear they were old bricks - the cart was fifteen yards from me.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at Nottingdale. On Thursday morning, the 15th of February, I saw the prisoner, about seven o'clock, with a load of old bricks in his cart; they were not like those produced, but old ones, and some were not cleaned from the mortar - I saw none of this description; I was going for a load of bricks myself, which made me notice his - I knew him. There are piles of bricks where he is building; I do not know who they belong to - I have seen them there for about three months, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? A. Six or seven years; I live about two hundred yards from his cottage; I never examined to see whether he is building it of old bricks; I believe there are some new; there might be two or three loads of new ones there on the 15th of February; I was intimate with him; I never asked where he got them; he generally drives his own cart - I have seen a man walking with him.

            . I am a labourer, and live at Nottingdale, about twenty-five feet from the prisoner's cottage. Last Thursday morning I saw him with his cart, about seven o'clock, close to Notting-hill gate, about a mile from his cottage, going towards his cottage, with a load of old bricks - all that I could see were old; it is usual to use old and new bricks in building cottages; he had a pile of new bricks there; I have seen them there full three months. I have a cottage of my own.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you build it? A. It was built for me; I bought my bricks from Shepherd's-bush; I might not be able to produce the person I had them of. The prisoner may have a thousand new ones; he has some seconds; I call these very bad seconds; I stopped and said, "John, have you got another load of old bricks" he said, "I have;" I knew he had bought three or four cottages, and thought these came from there; he had several men once; he may have a carter for a day or so; his wife asked me yesterday to come here - I did not know before that he was in custody.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see these new bricks there from time to time, for three months? A. I saw them most days, as he asked me to attend a little when he was away.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did it appear to you that for three months there was the same quantity of bricks there, or were they increasing from time to time? A.

I have known the prisoner about six months - I met him last Thursday morning, at a quarter to seven o'clock, at the first mile-stone, by Bayswater, on the Uxbridge-road, with a load of old bricks - I stopped, and talked to him - I knew it to be his horse and cart - I looked in, and saw nothing but old bricks - I saw none like these - there are some by his building - I have seen them there this three months, I am certain.</p>

               <p>COURT to T. VANN. Q. Is not the front of the building new bricks? A. Yes, but they are more common than these - I have not compared them; the lot, which stands before the cottages, is to build another house - he had two sorts of new bricks, new stocks and seconds - the front was built before any seconds were there - I do not think there are any of this sort in the building - I will not swear it; if there are any, it must be just over the windows; the rest of the house is of old bricks.</p>

            . I am the wife of Stephen Millins. I saw the prisoner at our cottage last Thursday morning, near seven o'clock, within a few minutes of it - it is about one hundred yards from the cottage he was building - he had a one horse cart with old bricks; I saw them shot from the cart; they were all old; I saw a pile of new ones there, when the gentleman came to measure them.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long has the cottage been building? A. I do not know; I have not been there above a fortnight; the old bricks were to build another cottage; I did not see the cart till seven o'clock; I have seen nobody at work there for the last fortnight.</p>
               <p>J. FALKUS re-examined. I have minutely examined the front of his cottage; I suppose there are 200 or 300 bricks of this description in the arches and other places; it is stocks mixed with seconds - I have been a builder from a boy; the front would take 300 or 400 bricks; the rest is old and new bricks together; stocks are easily distinguished from seconds, by people who understand building- I examined it last Friday, about four o'clock, with my bricklayer and Mr. Royal, a mason.</p>
               <p>- SHEPHERD. I am a bricklayer. I went with Falkus to view the prisoner's cottage; there are seconds in the arches and in different parts of the front; a builder cannot mistake stocks for seconds.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Will you swear there were fifty seconds? A. Yes; I will not swear to one hundred nor to sixty; I did not count them; I sold the prisoner some bricks about three months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this voucher, and say is it not the memorandum you gave for the settlement of the bricks? A. Yes; they were my own bricks: (read) "August 26th, received of John Hancocks, for bricks, 2l. 5s." I sold him 2000; I never sold him any others; I had them from Berkshire; I was then in business for myself.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What bricks did you sell him? A. Stocks, not seconds.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Mr. Southgate, a trunk-maker, in Crown-court, Old Change—the prisoner was frequently in the habit of calling to sell portmanteaus, and I have often bought of him. On the 5th of March, he came to our ware-room at the top of the house, and offered a portmanteau for sale—I refused to buy it, not being the size we wanted—he went down stairs—I followed him down—he appeared to be wrapping the portmanteau up, and was about to leave, when my suspicions were excited by hearing something rustle like paper—I called him back again to look at the portmanteau—in taking off the wrapper he endeavoured to conceal a parcel—I asked what he had—he said a dozen locks—I accused him of having taken them from Mr. Southgate—he begged I would forgive him this time and said, "Ob, pray don't mention it to Mr. Southgate—for God's sake don't"—I sent for Mr. Southgate, and he sent for a policeman, and gave him into custody—this is the paper of locks—I put my initials on the ticket.</p>

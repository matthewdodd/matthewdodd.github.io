                  </hi>. I am a glass dealer, and live at No. 7, Bedfordbury, which runs from New-street, Covent-garden, into Chandos-street I have known Brown for a long time—on 15th March, I sent a horse and cart to Aldridge's Repository for sale by my boy—I followed, and when I got there saw Brown; and my boy in the cart—about a quarter of an hour after<lb></lb>wards I saw Ayres—he and another man got into the cart with my boy and drove up Long Acre—I asked Brown what sort of men they were that were getting into the cart, and he said that it was all right, that was for the pur<lb></lb>pose of trying it—when they came back they all three went together, and I went to my boy and told him to bring the horse and cart home—I went home with the boy, and we put the horse and cart in the stable—the three prisoners and two or three other men came to me at the stable—Brown called me down the yard, and said in the presence of Ayres and Adams, "That is the master of the horse"—Ayres asked me the price—I told him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and they all went away together—in three quarters of an hour Brown came to me with the address, on a paper, of Mr. Henry Goodall, 19, Henry-street, Hampstead-road, who he said would purchase the hone, if I would go there with him—Brown and my boy went with me in the cart, and at the corner of Henry-street Brown advised me to get out of the cart, at it would be much preferable to let the gentleman see it with only two persons in the cart; and if he approved of the horse he would call me from the corner of Henry-street—I got out and stood at the corner three quarters of an hour—Ayres and another man and my boy came back with the cart and the harness—I asked my boy what had become of the horse—he said that it was sold—I asked him who sold it—he said that he did not know, and then Ayres said that he had sold the horse for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and produced a receipt—I asked him why the gentleman who bought the horse did not retain the receipt—he said that he forgot to give it to him, and then he advised me to go back to Camden-town to see if I could find Brown—I went to the end of Morn<lb></lb>ington-crescent, and he showed me the public house where he left Brown—I looked into three departments of the public house, but could not find him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185604070070"></xptr>
               <p>—I then returned home with the cart and harness—on the Saturday I went to Bow-street—on the Sunday I went to a coffee shop in York-street, Westminster, by the direction of the police, and Brown came in, and was talking to the landlord, and two constables came in and took him outside—he wanted to know what he was charged with—I said, "I charge you with stealing my horse"—he was taken to the station—I asked him what he had done with the horse—he said that he had changed it, and then he said that he had sold it, spent part of the money, and lost the remainder—when Ayres came back with the cart and harness he claimed half a sovereign, and said that he would call at my place on Sunday morning for it—he said nothing about having bought the horse for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in partnership with Adams.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A glass dealer—I never dealt in horses before—I bought the horse at Vauxhall, changed it for an-other—the man lives somewhere by the end of Vauxhall-bridge—Brown went with me, and helped me to change it—the first horse was not broken-winded—I had three horses before that—I believe it was broken-winded—I did not tell the man at Vauxhall that—I did not put the broken-winded horse on to him, and leave Brown to get out of it in the best way he could—Brown remained in the public house at his own option, saying that he was going to Wandsworth—I did not give him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to treat the servant till I could get out of the way—I got the broken-winded horse at Aldridge's—I changed another for him, and gave two guineas—I changed him because he was not fast enough—there was nothing the matter with his legs—I had not fre<lb></lb>quently asked Brown to sell this horse for me if he could—he did not <hi rend="italic">jib</hi>—there was nothing unpleasant about his action—I had had him four days, and wanted to sell him again, because I did not like the colour, which was grey—there was no objection but the colour—I did not tell Brown to sell him if he could, but only to show him—I was there to sell him, but he took me off my guard—I said to the man who came back with the cart, "What business have you to sell my horse? I did not authorise you or Brown to sell it"—I had intended to sell it right out when I went to Aldridge's, not to exchange it—if the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been brought to me instead of the receipt I should not have said that it was perfectly right—I did not say that I ex<lb></lb>pected the horse would be sold when I sent him to Mr. Goodall.</p>

On Saturday, 15th March, I went to Aldridge's Repository with the horse and cart—Ayres and another man got into the cart—after that we went to the Repository and my master sent me home—I was in the stable with my master, but did not see the men when they came, or hear the conversation—Brown and my master and I then went to Henry-street, Hampstead-road, and at the corner of Henry-street my master got out, and afterwards Ayres, Adams, and another man got in—they got out at the Southampton Arms, Camden-town, and went away, and then they came back, and went into the public house—they were there five minutes—Brown then told me that the home was sold, but did not say who to or for what sum—he told me to take the horse out—I took it out, and Adams took it away—Brown told me to take the cart back, Ayres and another man went with me—Brown went to the back to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi>, I was in the shafts, and I afterwards missed him—I saw my master at the comer of Henry-street—Ayres wanted half a sovereign of ray master, saying that he had sold the horse for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my master asked who authorised him to sell it—he showed him a receipt for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but master could not get it into his hand, be would not let him have it—my master said, "Why did not you give the paper to the gentleman?"—he said, "I quite forgot it"—I then took the cart home.</p>

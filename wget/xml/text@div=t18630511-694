                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at University College Hospital—on 31st March, I was sent for to see Cooper—I found him bleeding from a scalp wound, a little at the right side—he remained in the hospital till he died, on 27th April—the cause of his death was pyemia, that is, sundry abscesses—that was produced by the injury to the head, the blow—such an injury could be caused by a small hammer—it was from a quarter to half-past 11 when I first saw him—I did not notice any trace of paint about the back of his head—I do not think that a man striking another with a paint-brush, as has been described, could have produced the injury; it might do so, if it was a very heavy brush.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The deposition of the decreased William Cooper was here read at follows</hi>; "I am now a patient in this hospital. On Tuesday, 31 at March last, between 11 and half-past in the morning, I went to Conway Mews with a cabman, and two women I happened to meet, and we had a pot of beer and a quartern of gin among the four of us. I went outside for a necessary pur<lb></lb>pose, and saw Mr. Clayard there in a stooping position, either tacking the lining or the fall of a cab, just done up, with a hammer. I was buttoning up my trousers; my back was towards him; I said, "Can you give me a job, master," joking with him. He said, "No." I said I could do without his job, and he came behind me with the hammer, and said he would knock my b—brains out, and he struck me with the hammer. I fell down. The prisoner is the man that struck me; he is a bad man. He only struck me once. I got up again immediately, and saw him going into the stable with the hammer, but the policeman was not quick enough to detect him with the hammer. He had loads of time to make away with the article. The policeman came up. There was a woman there that saw him strike me; I think her name was Nolan; she was a young woman, and had a dark cloak on. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw him go into the stable with the hammer after he struck me. I stood in the mews bleeding till the policeman came, while he had gone into the stable. I never went out of the mews. I was in the mews till the policeman came I sat on the shaft of the cab a little while while I was bleeding, and I stood up till the policeman brought me here. I do not recollect going into the public-house after he took me; I am almost confident I did not I walked from the mews to the hospital, bleeding all the way. I was rather insensible after I was struck with the hammer. I do not recollect if I walked up the mews. I had not made water at the corner of the mews a quarter of ah hour before this happened. A man did not lead me up the mews to my knowledge. When he said, "No," I said I could do without him. The last time I drove for him I owed him a few shillings, and I expect that is the envious feeling he has against me. He was behind me when he struck the blow. <hi rend="italic">By the Magistrate.</hi> It was instan<lb></lb>taneous upon my reply that he struck me."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab proprietor, residing at 6 and 7, Conway-mews, Hampstead-road—on the day of this occurrence, I was standing leaning over my loft gate; that is on the same side as Mr. Clayards, further down from the gateway—there is a projecting wall from Claryard's, so that a person standing at the gateway cannot possibly see his coach-house—it projects from twelve to sixteen feet—I saw the deceased come through the gateway down the mews, and go up to where Clayard was—he was inside his Hansom cab, painting the bottom of it—the cab was outside the coach-house door—I was two stables off; about fifteen yards off—I could see quite well—I did not hear whether the deceased spoke to Clayard—the first I heard was Clayard say, "I should not give you a place"—the deceased made answer, "You are a b—old b—; you can put the place up your—"—Clayard got out of the cab, and walked to a wheel that was banging on a spindle on the coach-house—the deceased walked up to him, and told him to put his place where the monkey put the tobacco, and he put his face offensively close to Clayard's, and made a noise with his month; I could hear it—he put his face quite close enough to Clayard's to spit in his face, but whether he did or not I could not see—up to that time Clayard had not touched him—he then gave him a shove, and he fell heavily, with the back of his head on the stones—he laid there for nearly a minute—Clayard called his horse<lb></lb>keeper,</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to an auctioneer, of 26, London-street, Fitzroy-square—on this day I was standing at the auction-room door, which</p>

               <p>is nearly opposite the Adam's Arms, and saw the deceased come up the mews with Holman—he nearly pulled Holman into the public-house, and he called out to his three friends that Clayard had pushed him down and cut his head open—I then went down the mews—I saw Kidd, Johnston, and another woman, come out of the public-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What did you see when you got down the mews? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I followed the deceased and the others down, and saw one of the women point to Mr. Davis as the man that had done it, and the deceased turned round and said to her, "That is not Clayard, you b—fool, that is Mr. Davis"—they were using very bad language the whole of the time—they all came up the mews again—Clayard was up at his window washing himself when the policeman came down—the deceased showed the policeman the stable—I can't say who fetched the policeman—the deceased and the women walked up and down the mews two or three times between Davis's stable and Clayard's before the policeman came—he was bleeding very much—he had his coat on at the time he came to the top of the mews—he took it off when he went down again, and wanted to fight—he had his coat off when the policeman came—I did not see Flowers there—I don't know who assisted the deceased to the hospital with the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coach-trimmer, of 64, Boswell-street—on this Tuesday I was engaged at work for a Mr. Ell, at the bottom of Conway-mews—I saw the deceased come down the yard; he went towards Mr. Clayird's stables and began abusing him; he was alone—I did not observe what happened afterwards—I went on with my work till I saw Holman take him up the yard; there was no woman with him then—he afterwards came down the mews again with two women—he then had his coat off, and his shirt sleeves tucked up; his coat was on the first time—I saw Mr. Davis at his loft—at the time the deceased was picked up by Holman there was no one else in the yard.</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—I had occasion to go to Conway-mews on this morning to see my husband—as I went into the mews I saw the deceased being led up the mews, with his head bleeding, by Holman—they went into the public-house—I afterwards saw the deceased come from the public-house with another man and two women, and go down the mews—I went down the mews—I saw a stone with blood on it, and I pointed it out to my boy—it was a projecting stone, and came to a sharp point.</p>

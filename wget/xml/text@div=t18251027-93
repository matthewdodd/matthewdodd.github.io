On the 23d of September - I was discharging her for having robbed me; but in consequence of the good opinion I had of her, as she suited me very well, I prevailed on my husband to keep her again. I then called her in, and told her we should keep her, but as she was not very well, she might go home for a few days. I thought it right to look over a small box, which she was taking with her, and asked her for the key of it - she said she must go up stairs for it; she went up, and took with her a small basket. I followed her up to the kitchen, and when I got up, the candle was put out, either by her or the other servant. I inquired why it was put out - the other servant made some excuse, and I staid there until the prisoner came down; she then unlocked the box, which I looked carelessly over, and let her go home - this was about eight o'clock; she was to return the following Tuesday. I went up stairs again, and inquired what Winifred came up for - the servant did not give me any answer, but about eleven o'clock she brought me a bundle, consisting of the articles in question, which had been in a band-box in my own room.</p>

            . I had been servant to the prosecutrix five weeks. On this evening when the prisoner went away to see her friends I was in the kitchen, when she came up and said - "Put out the light! put out the light!" I saw her go to the scullery, and I thought I heard the sash of the scullery pull down - my mistress then came into the kitchen, and asked the prisoner for a key. I did not tell my mistress what I heard, as I did not know what it was. I went out on an errand soon afterwards - the prisoner came to me in the street; she took my hand and said - she hoped I would stand her friend, and not tell mistress of the bundle which she threw out of the window, as if I did she would put an end to her life. I questioned her what it was, and she said it was not mistress, but she had got it from an officer in the country. I then swore, on my soul, I would not show it to my mistress until I had seen it myself - but if it belonged to mistress I would return it to her when I came in. I told the other servant who came in the same night, and after master and mistress were gone up stairs, I put up the window, and got the bundle in with the tongs. I shewed it to mistress that night.</p>

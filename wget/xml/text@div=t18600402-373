                  </hi>. I am a gardener and live at Plaistow, in Essex—I had a child named Ann, she was two years old—on 1st February, I was at work in the road, about seventy or eighty yards from my house—I was engaged with other persons to fell trees—between the tree where I was and my house there is a bend in the road—I could see my cottage quite plainly—about five or six yards from where I was, the road is straight—whilst I was at work I saw the two prisoners—Hollamby was on a white pony and Ellis on a dark one—they were going towards Plashett—about half-an-hour later, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I saw them returning, and they were mounted on the same ponies—I cautioned them, as they were coming very fast—they appeared to me to be racing—before they returned an elder child of mine had come to me for the chips and had goue back again, and I suppose had left the gate open, and this little child Ann had come out into the road, and when the prisoners came up I called to them to slacken their speed, or they would ride over my child who was in the road—the other child, Ellen, had got to the house at that time—I saw Ann in the road at the time—I called to the boys—after I cautioned them they went on, and Hollamby's pony knocked the child down, and Ellis's pony rode over the child—I saw it quite plain from where I was.</p>

TINDAL ATKINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you quite sure you are right in saying that you saw the child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I don't know that I have said that I did not see the child in the road at the time that I gave the lads the caution—if I did it was not correct—my house lies off from the road—there is no footpath—there is a ditch with water in it that comes rouud by my house to the road—there was water there, and that is continued on to the other side—perhaps the little child had been able to go by itself for about six months; I don't know exactly—my wife was at home; she had not been out for some time—my eldest child is about five years old, and I have one more that my wife was confined with at the time—there is a gate that cuts off the communication from my place to the road—that gate was open—the door of my house was open when I went back—I don't know whether the door was closed when the child came out—it certainly was not my habit to let that little child go out by itself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say Hollamby's pony knocked the child down: did you see the leg of Ellis's pony touch the child on the ground? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The child moved as the pony went over it—it appeared to be struck—I could not say that it was, but there is no doubt about it—Ellis went clean over it—I saw the child move as the pony went over it—I can't say that I noticed Smith at the time—I afterwards saw him.</p>

On 1st February, I was at work with the last witness, felling trees—on the road leading to his cottage, I observed the two prisoners on two ponies, they were coming back from Plashett at a very fast pace—they were galloping—I heard Priest call to them to mind to slacken their pace, or they would be over his child—Ellis did slacken his pace, and Hollamby passed by him, and Ellis followed him again at full speed—he went at the same pace as when I first saw him—I saw the child knocked down by Hollamby's pony, and Ellis's pony rode over it—I can't say whether Ellis's pony touched it.</p>

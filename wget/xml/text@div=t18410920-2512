                  </hi>. I am a fruiterer and green-grocer, and live at No. 25, Martin-street, Friar-street, Blackfriars-road. On the 30th of August I was at the Yorkshire Stingo, in Blackfriars-road—on coming out the prisoner asked me to drink a little beer, which he had in a quart pot—I refused—he drank it up and requested me to pay for a pot for him—I said no I could not—he then called me an old b—and knocked my hat off—I said, "You are a rogue for doing so"—he then struck me in the mouth—I think he must have been a little intoxicated, but not so</p>

               <p>much as not to know what he was about—I went out and had got about two hundred yards, and near my own house, when I met a bedstead maker, named Lester, and his man, who I had appointed to meet me at the public-house—Lester laid hold of my arm, and while talking to him the prisoner came up again, struck me, and said, "You old b—I have over-taken you," knocked me down, and when down he scraped his foot along from the tip of my nose to my ear, and took off the skin—he was pulled off by two parties that were there, and then I heard him say to his wife, "Fetch my sword"—he went away, went up stairs, and fetched his sword—he only lived about four doors from me—I have known him for two years by sight—I saw no more of him till I felt something very heavy on my head—he must have come back with the sword—I was wounded, and lost a great deal of blood—I was taken to St. Thomas's Hospital—I am quite sober now—I am often times faint from the loss of blood—my con<lb></lb>stitution is more weak than it was, but I have no pain in the bead.</p>

I was in company with the prosecutor and Myers at the Yorkshire Stingo—when we were coming out, I heard the prisoner say to the prosecutor, "Will you drink?"—the prosecutor said, "No I Will not"—the prisoner said, "Will you fill this pot?"—he said, No"—the prisoner said, "Then don't, you old b—"—the prosecutor up with his hand, pushed him on one side, and said, "Go on one side, you old rogue"—the prisoner then struck him across the mouth, and made it bleed—after he had done that, he challenged him out to fight—I and Myers in<lb></lb>terfered, and pushed the prisoner on one side—we advised the prosecutor not to fight, but to drop it, to put up with it, and to come off home, which he did; and just by his own house he met the parties he was about to take a house for; and as we were going across the street, the prisoner overtook</p>

               <p>the prosecutor, struck him behind with his fist, and knocked him down to the ground—his friends we had just met took his part, by turning round and challenging the prisoner to fight—they did not touch him—the prisoner then went into his house, and the door was shut—he came out again in six or seven minutes, with a sword in his hand, flourishing it about, and said, "Now then, I will do for you"—he turned to the right, and was going to make a cut at a man, but he found it was not the prosecutor, and he did not strike him—he then turned round the contrary way, and found the prosecutor, cut him over the head, and felled him to the ground—he was then going to cut him again—he held the sword by the blade, and hit him with the hilt—the blade is not sharp at the edge—I saw the prosecutor covered with blood from the wound—I and two more assisted in picking him up, and conveyed him to a surgeon's in Hlackfriars-road, who dressed his wound, and we took him to the hospital—there was a great deal of blood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a picture-frame maker. I have known the prisoner twelve months, and live in a street or two from him—he is not at all a quarrelsome man—he is married, and has a family—on the 30th of August I was at the Yorkshire Stingo public-house, about half-past ten o'clock at night, with my wife and my brother—we were passing and I saw the prisoner sitting there—he asked us to take a drop porter, and we sat down with him—I had been seated there about half-an hour, when he pointed to the prosecutor, and said, "Do you see that person standing there? he is very drunk, and when drunk</p>

               <p>he is a very quarrelsome temper; if he comes up to me, I shall leave your company"—in about five minutes the prosecutor came up to him and said, "What, is that you, Wells? they talk about locking me up"—the prisoner said, "I hope not; if I can do any thing to prevent it I will"—the prosecutor then left him, and came back again in about five minutes, and said to the prisoner, "Have you got any beer, you old b—?"—the prisoner said, "No, I have not, I am going home"—the prosecutor had got his arms folded—he began to use very bad language to the pri<lb></lb>soner, calling him a b—old rogue and a swindler, without any provoca<lb></lb>tion—the prisoner got up and asked him what he meant by calling him an old rogue—Crawford then put himself in a fighting attitude—I got between them, and told the prisoner he had better not strike, as the police were likely to come up, and they would get into the station—the prisoner did not strike him there at all—he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him when he put himself in a fighting attitude—I got between them, and prevented their fighting—Myers wanted to fight my brother, but I got between them, and parted them—Farmer was not there—the prisoner then went with me as far as the end of the street, and left me—I saw him about a hundred yards down the street, and saw nobody interrupt him, or he interrupt any body—in about half-an-hour I was sent for by the prisoner, stating that he had been very much ill-used—I went to him, and found he had been kicked in the mouth (I have seen Farmer about the neighbourhood—(<hi rend="italic">looking at him</hi>)—swear he was not there) I found the prisoner's head had been cut with a brick, as he told me, and he had a half-brick in his place, which he said he was hit with, and he complained of being kicked in the * * *—his head was strapped up—he showed me his mouth, and he had one of his teeth kicked out—his mouth was bleeding—I am certain no blow was struck at the Yorkshire Stingo, more than the prisoner <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> him away, and then I got between them.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is a pipe-maker; we live in Martin-street, Friar-street.

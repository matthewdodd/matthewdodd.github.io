            . On the 12th of April, about three in the afternoon, both the prisoners came into our shop together, as if they were acquainted with each other; the man asked to see some silk handkerchiefs; I shewed them a great variety of patterns. After they had looked them over, they fixed upon one, which I cut off; in the mean time I saw the man prisoner put his hand underneath something on the counter and take out three silk handkerchiefs; I perceived him put them under his apron; this was while the woman engaged me in conversation; it was done in a very sly manner, he did not suspect that I saw him do it; I took no notice of it. The woman asked to see some calico; she bought half a yard of calico and paid sixpence for it; the man gave seven shillings for the silk handkerchief. Then I called my partner down; I whispered to him that this man had got some silk handkerchiefs; the prisoners were then in the shop. In consequence of that the prisoners suspected that I had discovered them stealing the handkerchiefs; he put his hand under his apron, and I saw him drop them on the floor; they both went out of the shop. Mr. Ingram immediately called the man back and desired him to stop, which he did, and the woman together came back.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the shop did he drop these handkerchiefs - A. Where they were buying the calico; that was as far from where the handkerchiefs were as from here to the window; ours is a very large shop, I charged him then with stealing the handkerchiefs; he denied it; at the same time I saw the handkerchiefs on the floor, which he had dropped. We set for a constable, and they were sent to Hatton Garden Office.</p>
               <p>- HAINES. I know nothing more than apprehending the prisoners. Going to Hatton Garden the prisoner was rescued from me; the court were sitting; we were obliged to go to Hick's-hall, and get Read to assist us.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Cassee's Defence. He served me half a yard of calico; I gave him a shilling and he gave me a sixpence. I came out, and I soon perceived a great many people about the door; I went back to see what was the matter, I went into the shop, that gentleman said I was in the shop likewise; he gave this man and me in charge of the constable; I never was in company with the man in my life.</p>
               <p>Brown said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>
               <p>Cassee called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

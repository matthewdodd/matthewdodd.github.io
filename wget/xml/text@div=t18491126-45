On Tuesday, 13th Nov., the prisoner came to my office with another woman, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning—she said she came to Regis<lb></lb>ter the birth of a child—I asked whether she was the mother of the child: she said she was—she said she resided at 17, Ship-yard—that is within my district—I first took a slate for the purpose of making a preliminary entry, as is the custom—I asked her when the child was born; she said, "On 1st Nov., 1849"—I asked where it was born; she said," At 17, Ship-yard"—I next asked its Christian name; she told me "Mary Ann"—I then inquired, merely from custom, as some names apply to both sexes, what sex it was; she said, "A girl"—I then asked the Christian and surname of the father; she said, "Matthew Daley"—I then, from the promptings and hesitation which I saw, asked whether that was the name of her husband; she said it was—I then asked her own name; she said, "Ellen Daley"—and on asking her name before marriage, she said, "Ellen Cullen"—I asked the trade of her husband, and she said, "A stonemason"—that finished my slate entry—I have in my</p>

               <p>office a printed caution—I called the prisoner's attention to it and explained it to her particularly—I did not read it to her, for I ascertained from her that she could write, and I assumed that she could read—I told her she must con<lb></lb>sider herself in the position of a person who was taking an oath in a Court of Justice, and was giving evidence, and that she would be punished if she said what was untrue—she said it was all right—after having taken the particulars on the slate, I made an entry in the register-book to the extent I have men<lb></lb>tioned—I have that entry here—(<hi rend="italic">reads it</hi>—"1st Nov. 1849. 17, Ship-yard, St. Clement's Danes Mary Ann Girl Matthew Daley Ellen Daley, formerly Cullen f Stonemason")—the next thing was the name of the person giving the information; but before she signed the name, as she said she was the mother, I wrote, "Mother. 17, Ship-yard, St. Clement's Danes," and she wrote the name of "Ellen Daley" above it—I then com<lb></lb>pleted the entry by writing under it the date when registered, "13th Nov. 1849," and affixing my signature, "W. J, Jones, Registrar."</p>

               <p>past four o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming out of the door of Mr. Graves's public-house; I saw she had got something in her lap under her shawl—I stopped her, and asked what she had got—she answered, "Nothing"—I said I was sure she had, and on looking in her lap, I found these two stone bottles, and a glass bottle in her apron under her shawl—I asked where she got them—he said, "O dear, don't tell my master"—I took the two stone bottles from her lap, and while I was put<lb></lb>ting them on the pavement she threw the glass bottle at me, and broke it on the stones—I took the two stone bottles and the prisoner to Mr. Graves—there had been rum in the bottle which was broken, a part of the bot<lb></lb>tom of it stuck up, and there was rum in it—I called up Mr. Graves, and told him in the prisoner's presence what I had stopped her with—he said to her, "This is a very queer way of going on"—I asked him if he would give her in charge—he said he would consider of it—she said, "Oh! dear Sir, do forgive me, I was tempted to do it"—she said nothing more that I can recollect—the signature to this deposition is mine—it was read over to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Three Tuns public-house in Turnmill-street. The prisoner was employed by me as a char-woman—she was engaged to work on 23rd Dec.—I was called that morning by the officer, and the prisoner was with him; she begged forgiveness, and said she did not know what came over her to tempt her to do the act—these stone bottles belong to me, one is nearly full of brandy, and the other of gin; she must have got them from a room up-stairs where I keep all the bottles—neither of them were in the bar the night before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Graves. The prisoner came there to work as a char-woman—on the morning of 23rd Dec. I let her in about half-past three o'clock; she came to wash—I know where these bottles were kept, she would have to go to that room with the things—I did not see that she had anything with her when she came—I saw her go out of the house at half-past four, and she had the bottles in her apron—I saw them as she was going out—she said she would return in a moment—she was brought back by the policeman.</p>

               <p>—I did not tee any bottles when the came in—I said before the Magistrate that the had none—I am positive she had none—I saw her go out, but I was so taken off my guard that I did not say anything—the bottles were in an apron; I do not know whose it was, it was not mine, I do not know where it is—when the officer came I did not say anything—I will swear that—I did not say, "For God's sake, don't call master; I will give you anything if you won't say anything about it"—I swear I said nothing of the kind—the prisoner went out at the bar door—I did not go after her, she was brought back in about three minutes—I will not swear it was not five minutes—in the meantime I did not say anything to my master, or to anyone; I had not time—when she was brought back I was in the kitchen, where I had been before—I was considering what to do—I did not see where she took the bottles from—the bottles in that room are empty—she must have gone in the bar to fill them—I was not there, and no one was—I have nothing to do with the bar; it is the barman's duty to be there—it was not the prisoner's duty to go to the bar; it would excite attention if she were found there—she most have gone nearly to the top of the house to get these bottles, and have filled them at the bar with the spirits—she would not be likely to meet any one then, it was too early in the morning—I let her in, but went back again to bed—she came about half-past three, and went out about four—she had been in the house half an hour—I have not said it was half-past four when she went—I do not think it was half-past four—I do not think she had been in the house an hoar before she went.</p>

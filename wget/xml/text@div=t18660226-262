On Saturday, 17th February, about 7 o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in New-street, Covent<lb></lb>garden—from information I received I went after the prisoner—he was walking up King-street Covent<lb></lb>garden—I said, "You have sent a little boy into a tobacconist's shop for some tobacco, and gave him a counterfeit shilling"—he said, "I took it for good"—I took him back to the tobacconist's, which is kept by Mr. Nesbitt—I asked him where he got the money from—he said he did not know exactly, and mumbled something, but I could not hear what—I asked him where he gave the little boy the shilling—he said in a public-house—I took him to the station—he there said, "I have got more on me, some one must have put them in my pocket—I searched him, and found three shillings and a florin in his left waistcoat pocket, and two shillings in his right pocket—Mr. Nesbitt gave me a shilling—I also found a sixpence, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, good money—the boy's name was John Kennedy—he pointed to the prisoner as the man who gave him the shilling—I found some tea, sugar, and a loaf of bread on him.</p>

I am a tobacconist, of 9, New-street, Covent<lb></lb>garden—on 17th February, a little boy came into my shop, and asked for an ounce of tobacco—he gave me a bad shilling—I asked him who sent him—he said, "A man"—he went away, and came back again in two or three minutes, with his father—the constable brought the prisoner back, and in his presence the boy said that he had sent him for it—I asked the prisoner where he got the shilling from—he mumbled something which I could not understand—I asked him if he had any more money to let the policeman see—he made no reply—I gave him into custody.</p>

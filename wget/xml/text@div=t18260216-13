The prisoner was in my employ for about six weeks - the veil was my wife's; she is not here; I had not seen it for a long time; we did not miss it till it was found at Mr. Butler's, into whose service the prisoner had gone; I know it by a piece which was cut off when it was a net - I compared the piece which I took from my house with it, and it matched exactly - the flowers corresponded just as they were drawn.</p>

The prisoner was in my service; she came from the prosecutor, and had been with us about six weeks; I found this veil in a drawer in her room; we have no other servant, but my youngest sister slept with her; I had never seen her with it, and did not know it was there till my sister told me - she is not here; the drawer is appropriated entirely for the servant's property - it was an open drawer.</p>

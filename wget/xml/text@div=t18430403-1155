On Sunday morning, the 12th of March, I was passing No. 4, Cathe<lb></lb>rine-street, and heard a noise in the front room—the window was about two inches up—when I got to the bottom of the street I saw a man and boy running in a direction from the house—the prisoner was one of them—he was carrying a bonnet, and the other a bundle, which he threw down and ran away—the prisoner threw the bonnet over into a garden—I saw a man who was following him pick up the bundle and take it back to Mr. Swainson—I have known the prisoner eighteen months or more, and cannot be mistaken in his person—he was in company with the man with the bundle.</p>

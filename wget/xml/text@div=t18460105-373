I live in Queen Catherine-court, Brook-street—I was in company with Murphy on the 26th of Dec., and coming home through Vine-passage, somebody came and said there was a fight in Harris's-court—this is a noted party, so we went to see what was the matter—I stopped at the bottom of the court, and asked some women what was the matter—Mur<lb></lb>phy walked up before me, and when I came up he was down, and four or five women round him and on him—I cannot say I saw the prisoners—I do not know them—a rush was made at me—I stepped back and took my coat off—Murphy's mother-in-law came to me and said, "If you don't save his life he will be killed"—I went up, and the first man that came up had the tongs—I took them from him—I cannot swear who it was—I afterwards saw the wound the prosecutor had received—it was a large cut—the flesh was very much separated on the forehead, and shivered up and down—it seemed a blow from some blunt instrument—he had another wound on the head and one on the mouth.</p>

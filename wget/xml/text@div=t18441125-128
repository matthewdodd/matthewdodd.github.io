I have known the prisoner fifteen or sixteen years—I re<lb></lb>member his coming to London eight years ago—I visited him once or twice—there was a woman there who passed as his wife—I cannot say whether she was so or no—that woman's name, before she passed as his wife, was Elizabeth or Betsy Davis—she then passed as his wife, and they lived at Limehouse—that was somewhere about 1836—this is the woman (point<lb></lb>ing to her) who was living with the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 37.) On the 19th of Oct., Elizabeth Davis, or Elizabeth Mills, as she called herself, came to me, and said she gave the prisoner into custody on a charge of bigamy, saying that he was married to her at Devizes, in Wiltshire—she did not say, in his presence, when she was married—I took him into custody accordingly—the prisoner said he was married to that woman in a public-house, by the parish clerk, when he was a mere boy and drunk—I received from Eliza<lb></lb>beth Mills this paper, and went down to Devizes, and proved this to be a true copy of the marriage register—this is the person who gave me this certificate, and called herself Elizabeth Mills.</p>

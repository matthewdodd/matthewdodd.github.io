On the 8th of October, at a little past seven in the evening, I returned home from Islington; while I stopped at the bottom of the court to make water I perceived a man jump out of the parlour window of my house; immediately after that I perceived another jump out; as he came past me he gave me a wheel round; then I saw a third jump out, which was the prisoner. I catched him by the throat and said, I would hold him if he was the Devil. I seised him by the collar and cried out thieves and murtherers! and I held him till some neighbours came; then my wife, who was behind me, came up and opened the door; there was nobody in the house. I went out about half after one; she came to me about an hour and an half after, and we walked up to Islington; when my wife had opened the door I took him in; when I came into the parlour I saw a table-cloth spread upon the oil-cloth, and the sundry things, mentioned in the indictment, laid upon it; they had been taken out of a drawer in the same room.</p>
               <p>When had you seen them in the drawer before? - I suppose three or four days; when I took him in and found these things laid upon on the table-cloth I held him by the throat and asked him if these things were his? He made no answer; the sash was pulled down; there was a pane of glass in the sash broke. I suppose they got the window open by breaking the pane of glass and putting an hand in and opening the fastening to the sash; the pane, which was broken, was immediately under the fastening.</p>
               <p>The other two got away? - Yes. I had not the same presence of mind as I had when I seised this, or they would have stood no better chance than this man.</p>
               <p>Was it dark then? - It was light enough to see him.</p>
               <p>Was it by day-light or the light of the lamps you saw him? - By the day-light.</p>
               <p>You could see him plain enough by the day-light to know him? - Yes.</p>

I have lived there six months. I marked a 1s. 6d. piece, with my initials, and gave it to the officer to buy a yard of Irish; it was my master's money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. You and the prisoner had not been on good terms - A. Very good until this happened; it was on the 18th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not quarreled with him before this - A. I never had any words with him, so as to bear malice. I was more friendly with him, than I was with the other shopman; he had reported me to my employer, but he was robbing him at the same time.</p>

            After he had reported you - A. Yes; when the 1s. 6d. was paid me, we were very busy; he was taken into custody a quarter of an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. He was on the other side of the counter when it was given him, and there was no till there - A. There was no till there; we used to put the money on the shelf.</p>

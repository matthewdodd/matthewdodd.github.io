                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Charles Stephen Moore, a baker. On the 13th of August I was delivering bread for him—I had a barrow with me containing twenty-six half-quartern loaves—I went into a house in St. Michael's-place, Brompton—when I came out my barrow and bread were gone—I found the barrow, about eight o'clock the same evening, at North-end, but the bread was gone.</p>

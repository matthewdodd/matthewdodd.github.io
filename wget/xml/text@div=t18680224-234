I followed them to Serjeant's the hairdressers—Newman went in, Godwin was on the other side—Newman came out, and crossed the road to Godwin, and they walked on—I went into Mr. Serjeant's and then followed them to Mrs. Thorpe's—Godwin went in there, and Newman stopped outside—Godwin came out and joined Newman—I spoke to Mrs. Thorpe, and when I came out Newman had gone over to Glover's, and Godwin was on the other side—Newman came out and joined Godwin, and I followed them to the Ro<lb></lb>chester Castle—Newman went in and Godwin remained outside—I spoke to two constables, and N 49 took Godwin outside—I told him, in her presence, that he had better take her for passing bad money—she said nothing—I went inside with N 249—Newman was at the bar, and I said "That is the the other one, take her likewise for passing bad money"—she said nothing.</p>

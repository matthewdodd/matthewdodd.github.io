                  </hi> I live in Amelia-street, Bromley; the prisoner is my son. I left home about eleven o'clock on the 24th of Jan.—I left all my property safe, the box and other things stated—the back door was bolted, and the front door locked—the window was secure all but one broken of glass—I returned between eight and nine in the evening, and, I entered, one of my neighbours told me something—I went in, and</p>

               <p>found all these things gone—the drawers had been broken open with a screw-driver, which we found two days after under the drawers—my boy had got in through this broken square of glass, which had been <hi rend="italic">hacked</hi> out to put another square in—it had been papered over, and the paper tacked on—it was so small a place that it was difficult for him to get in—there was no breaking of glass—I have looked at the things which have been found and they are mine—everything that was worth 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my drawers was gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Arundel-street. On the 24th of Jan. I saw the prisoner O'Brien on the wall soon after his father had left—I asked what he wanted—he said he wanted to get in—I said, "You must not, your father has fastened the house, and you must not get in"—he said he would—he took the paper off the window, and got in—Walker was on the wall—I asked what he wanted—he did not say anything—I said if he did not go away, I must give him in charge—he then went away—I never saw him again till he was at the Thames-police, the next day—I went out, and came back about four o'clock—the prosecutor's back door was then open, and the drawers had been broken open.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master rigger, and live in Sophia-street, Poplar. I went to the prosecutor's house on the evening of the 24th of Jan.—I knocked at the door—Mrs. Ellis answered me, and told me something—O'Brien's brother was with me—I went into the house, and got a light—I saw the drawers were all broken open—I went out after the pri<lb></lb>soners to No. 4, West-street, Stratford-marsh—I told O'Brien's brother to go and ask if Bennett was there, which is the name Walker goes by—the boy I sent was detained, and I went to the door some time after, hot Walker was not there—I received information, and went to Field-lane, where I found O'Brien in bed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, A</hi> 255). On 25th Jan. I saw the prisoner in a marine store-shop, in Sloane-street, Chelsea—he was offering these three pieces of lead for sale—I asked where he got them—he first said he dug it out of the ground at Kensington, where he had been at work—he afterwards said he saw two men place it under some stones, and he went and took it from the stones—I took him into custody—he was searched at the station, in my presence, and this metal was found on him—I found that the lead corresponded in appearance with some belonging to Mr. Winn—I have brought a piece which corresponds with it—the prisoner said at the station that the metal came from the same place as the lead did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. John Winn, of Charlotte-street. The prisoner worked for him at the New Union, at Kensington—the policeman brought this lead to the premises, and I saw it compared with some pipe—it matched it—I had removed this metal on the day before the prisoner was apprehended, and left it in a room at the Union—it is the property of Mr. Winn, the prisoner had worked for some days in his service.</p>

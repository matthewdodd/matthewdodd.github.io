                  </hi>. I live at No. 12, Alfred-place, Bedford-square; the house is Mr. William Foster's. On the morning of 3rd Jan., about 5 o'clock, I was in bed, and was awoke by a noise—I got up and went to the folding doors, and listened, and thought I heard a noise—I unlocked the folding doors and opened them, and found the prisoner crouching against the door leading into the passage—I saw him by the light of the lamp out—side—I asked him what he was doing there—he said some boys out-side had asked him to get through—I said, "For the purpose of stealing?"—he said "Yes, "I then came on him rather suddenly and seized him by the wrists—I then said he had got himself into a <hi rend="italic">scrape</hi>—I opened the door, took him into the passage, and called out to Mr. Foster, the landlord, and held him while he dressed, and he did the same while I dressed, and then we called a policeman and gave him into custody—he had got in through the window—he had closed the window after him—there is an area railing—this is on the ground floor—there is a ledge outside the window—I should think he could hardly stride across the area.</p>

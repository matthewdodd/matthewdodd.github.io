               <p>Q. Had not you told him it would be better for him? - A. No, nor threatened him; it was a voluntary confession on his part; we asked him how he came by the verdigrease; he said it was given him by a soldier; I told him it was very hard he could not work for us, without stealing, as we paid them liberally; and he said he had not stole it, a soldier had given it him upon Golden-hart-wharf; he said the man's name that gave it him was Murphy; that Murphy and two soldiers came out with their aprons full of verdigrease; Murphy said he might as well take two as one; he said Murphy called him a green-horn because he would take but one: a crow was found upon the prisoner about two feet long, which he said was given him by one of the soldiers; and that one of them said he had got the keys now, and he could do what he liked; there are the impressions of the crow upon the door now; he had wrenched off the lock.</p>
               <p>JOHN WAINEWRIGHT sworn. - I am constable of Dowgate-ward: On the 3d of June, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoner at the bar, and two more soldiers; they had all something in their aprons; they were walking pretty quick; I suspected they had been robbing; the prisoner was the first man of the three; I laid hold of him, and asked him what he had got; he hesitated a little, and would not give me a direct answer; the other two passed me, and I called out stop thieves; they got clear away; I secured the prisoner, and saw it was verdigrease; we had a scuffle, and then he said it was given to him by a soldier; I then took him to the Compter; he made a little resistance, but was no way rude; when I got him to the Compter I perceived something under his coat, on the right hand side; I discovered it to be a crow, which I took from him; (produces it;) he said it was given to him by one of his comrades, to carry away; I then went to the Bullporters' warehouse, to enquire; I met with Mr. Pearson, I went with him to the warehouses, and we compared the wood of the door, and it corresponded with the point of the crow; I saw the verdigrease in the warehouse, and it seemed to be of the same sort, and the same quality.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I picked up that verdigrease and the crow with it, in Joiners'-hall-buildings; I went from there into Thames-street, up Collegehill, and there the constable stopped me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the evening of the 18th of December, I was in Broad-street, Bloomsbury, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner with this cheese under his arm—I asked where he got it—he said his father bought it, and gave it to him to take to Bell-yard, Gray's Inn-lane—I took him to the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, Peter Maskell, a cheese-monger, in Marylebone-street. This cheese is his property, to the best of my belief—I missed it last Tuesday—I had seen it safe at half-past seven o'clock in the evening—I was absent at the time it was taken—I came home about nine o'clock, and found it gone—we have no private mark on it, but it corresponds with the other cheeses in our shop, from the same dairy—we had eighty-two of the same dairy—other shops were supplied from the same dairy—I am quite sure this is from the same dairy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger and grocer, at No, 4, John-street, Edgware-road. I lost a cheese last Tuesday night—this is my cheese—I know it by a private mark on it, and I know the weight of it—the private mark is a particular mark in my iron taster—I had sold it and weighed it, and put it out to be carried away—my iron produces a particular mark, in drawing the taster.</p>

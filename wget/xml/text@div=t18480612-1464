                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 34.) On 8th June, about twelve o'clock, I was on duty in St. Paul's churchyard, as the charity children were going to St. Paul's, and saw the prisoner—he followed Mr. Gaunt from the eastern side of the churchyard to the western, then came close up to him, put his hand into his pocket, took out this handkerchief, and put it into his own pocket—I immediately seized him, and told Mr. Gaunt—I felt the prisoner down, and opened his coat, but did not find the handkerchief—Mr. Gaunt saw it on the ground, picked it up, and gave it to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was serving in the shop. - A. Myself and a young man of the name of Crease, we were in the shop. He is not here. The prisoner looked some prints, muslins, and other articles out, she did not pay for them, said she would call again for the parcel, we thought it better to send the parcel with her, I took the parcel home with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you where she lived. - A. No, I followed her as far as Newgate Street, I asked her how much farther she was going, she told me if I would wait there ten minutes she would return, I told her I would not leave her, I wished her to go back again, she consented, returned back a little way, she went in a court and sat on the ground and said she would go no further, I hired a Hackney Coach and as I was taking her up she dropped a piece of print.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the print drop. - A. Yes, as she arose it dropped from under her, I took it up, I then secured her. This is the print that dropped from her, it is a different sort to what she had bought, I had the goods that she bought.</p>

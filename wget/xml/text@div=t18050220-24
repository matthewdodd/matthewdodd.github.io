             sworn. - I am an officer, I had a warrant to apprehend the prisoners on the 15th of this month; I took the man when he was on guard, and the woman in Peter-street; when the man was examined, I pulled a glove from off his hand to see if his hand had been cut; I observed the skin was off his right-hand third-finger, it appeared to be very much lacerated, as if it had been rubbed or bruised, it did not seem to be a cut from glass, the skin hung over from one joint to the other, the skin had not been taken from the wound, and it appeared as if it had been done some time; he denied to me ever seeing the woman since he had left the lodgings at Mr. Burst's, he at last acknowledged to the Magistrate where she lived; when I searched the woman, she got up, and put her hand in her pocket first, and pulled out something which she endeavoured to secrete, which was this duplicate of the bed-gown; I found a key on the woman, and went to the room where they lived, and found this hat, (produces it;) it was marked on the top with white, as if it had rubbed against a white cieling or wall, the white mark was rather fresh on the hat then; I took this hat to Mr. Burst, and desired him to go the most natural way he could into the kitchen through the window, and when he got in, he said he could not get in without rubbing his head against it; upon his re-examination, I asked him if this was his hat; he said it was, but the white mark had been put on; the woman prisoner said she had picked up the bed-gown ten minutes before six o'clock in Snow's-rents, which is at the back part of this man's house; first of all she said she had it a good while; I asked her how long, and she found me inquisitive, she at last said that; I found in his room a piece of rag, it appeared as if it had come off some one's finger, it had a little blood on it, and a little blood I found on a little bag in the room.</p>

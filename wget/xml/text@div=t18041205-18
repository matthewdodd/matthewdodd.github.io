From information my wife gave me when I came down, I marked the money that was in the till; I had marked ten shillings in shillings and sixpences, and put some in each till; the till was not locked; she took first a shilling from one side out of the till, and on the other side she took a shilling and sevenpence halfpenny; I searched her, and found in her box four shillings and sixpence; they were all marked; I found four penny pieces and three halfpence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050020"></xptr>in her box; I did not find all that I had lost; all the money I found had my mark on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she ever permitted to take money in the shop for you? - A. She had no business to take money; she was told to ring the bell if any customers came in; after I had fetched the constable, I asked her how she came to take the money; she said it was the first that ever she took from me.</p>
               <p>(The money produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

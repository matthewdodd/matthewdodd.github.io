I made an apology, and asked her to have a glass of ale. One of them put this parcel into my hand, and Jesse seized hold of me. If the policeman had seen anything in my hand he would have tried to secure it. He did not attempt to search me till the boy came in. I think the man who offered the boy threepence gave him the parcel.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 3d of February I was called into a lodging house in Church-lane, St. Giles's; I shook the prisoner; the purse dropped down, it contained a one pound note, a dollar, and a shilling. When I came from searching the bed I went to search her again; she put down the watch. This is the watch and the purse.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at the watch - A. It is my watch, and this is my purse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He laid the purse in my lap; I ask him whether he did or did not.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That I cannot tell; I did not know whether I had the watch with me at the time.</p>

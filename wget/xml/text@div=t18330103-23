I received the prisoner into custody from the prosecutor between twelve and one o'clock; I got over the rails of a little garden, and found four sovereigns and two sixpences, about two yards from the prisoner - in taking her to the station-house, she said it did not signify between them, as she had had two children by him; one of our men said he had seen her and the prosecutor just before.</p>

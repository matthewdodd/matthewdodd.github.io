            . We both live in one and the same house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose a pair of pantaloons on the 19th of last January - A. We did, about six in the evening. I was at home. I lost them out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your shop fastened up before that time - A. It was. I had seen it fastened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine afterwards to see how it was broken - A. It was not broken, only the latch turned. The shop door is an outer door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you tried the door in the course of that afternoon to try whether it was fastened - A. I saw the door shut before I went in to tea. It was not bolted. The latch had caught, I am certain. An alarm was given. I pursued the man, and took him and the property. My lad informed me. I overtook the man in Charles-street, Covent Garden, about two hundred and fifty yards from my house. He had the pantaloons under his great coat, on his left side; they were concealed. When I overtook him he was walking. I perceived something bulky under his left arm. I laid hold of him. I asked him to let me see what he had got; I suspected it was my property; a pair of pantaloons. He said, what do you want. I pulled back the breast of his coat, and took the pantaloons out. I knew them to be mine. I took the prisoner directly to Bow-street office. The prisoner was delivered to the officer. I have had the pantaloons ever since. These are the pantaloons; they are my property, and William M'Master's.</p>
               <p>- . Q. Were you at Mr. M'Masters shop that night - A. I was; I had shut up the shop. I latched the door; I tried it, and the latch had caught. Nobody could come in without lifting up the latch.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that before any body came in - A. More than a quarter of an hour after I had shut up the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had shut up the shop did you leave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181302170015"></xptr>it, or not - A. I staid in the shop. I was at work in the shop behind a partition.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other person that came in during that interval - A. There was not. As I was sitting at work I heard the door open very softly; as I was getting off the board I heard some one move, and when I came to see who it was, there was no one in the shop, and the door was left open. I immediately alarmed Mr. M'Masters; he went out directly, and I pursued after. This was about six o'clock. I had not heard the clock go six; I had heard the clock go five. The postman generally goes by at half past five, and he had gone round, and I believe he was coming round again. I know the pantaloons. I had seen them in the shop that afternoon, about two hours before. When I came into Tavistock-street I took towards Charles-street. I saw this man. Mr. M'Masters came up to him. I told him I suspected the man. I saw Mr. M'Masters take the pantaloons from under his coat.</p>

I agreed to purchase fourteen oranges of him for a shilling. I took out of my pocket an eighteen-penny piece, some halfpence, and three sixpences. I gave him two sixpences to pay for the oranges, Upon my offering him the two sixpences, he refused one of the sixpences; he did not like it; if I would give him the eighteen-penny piece he would give me one of my sixpences and a shilling. I said, you want to give me some bad money. He said, he would not. He gave me a shilling and a sixpence, and I gave him the eighteen-penny piece. I looked at the shilling he gave me; I told him it was a bad one, directly, and I threatened to send him to the Compter for putting a bad shilling upon me. I called out to the waterman that attends the coaches, to know where I could get a constable. The prisoner, upon my calling out, run into Leadenhall-market as fast as he could. I ran after him. I believe I called out, stop thief; some person in the market stopped him, and I came up to him. He was never out of my sight. The constable came by, and I gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Draper that constable - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver the shilling that he gave you to the constable - A. I did, the next morning. I am sure the shilling that the prisoner gave to the constable. The prisoner was taken to the Compter, and at the Compter I agreed to purchase all the oranges he had for a shilling. I paid him for them with two sixpences. One of the sixpences was the sixpence that he had objected to, and then he made no objection to it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Christmas day, I was standing in Cornhill, selling oranges. This gentleman bought fourteen oranges of me for a shilling. He gave me two sixpences; one of them did not appear to me to be a good one. I refused it. He gave me an eighteen-penny piece. He said, give me a shilling. I took my shillings out of my pocket; I said, take one. He took one; he said, it was a bad one. I did not know it. I had just taken it. I said, I would change it for him. He said, I will not have it changed; he would give charge of me.</p>

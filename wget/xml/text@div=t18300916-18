On the 10th of July I went to bed between three and four o'clock- I had been washing, and saw the copper fixed in the kitchen between eleven and twelve o'clock that night, and left some dirty cloths in it: I was awoke by the door shutting, and heard the clock strike five - the door was fast before I went to bed, and every place safe; six other persons reside in the house - there are five lodgers, all of whom have a key of the outer door; when I went to the door one of the lodgers had not come in - I cannot say whether he came in afterwards: I dressed and went down at five o'clock, and found the door on the latch, as I had left it - I went into the kitchen at eight, missed the copper, and found all the dirty things about.</p>

            . I live in Husband-street, Golden-square, and have a house at No. 1, Cock-court. On the 10th of July, a few minutes before six o'clock in the morning, I went down there, and saw the prisoner with another young man, in the dust-hole in the kitchen - they had no business there, and must have gone there to hide; they do not live in that house - they had a basket and this copper; I asked if they lived in the house - they said not - I asked what they had got in the basket; the prisoner said a bundle for the person next door - I took the prisoner into the street, and gave him in charge with the copper; the other man went away - I was not able to keep both.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you mean to say you saw me in the dust-hole with the copper? A. Yes, it was down stairs by the water-butt that I spoke to you; I found you down in the kitchen - it is a little place of a yard by the waterbutt; I have a lodger named Hinton - you did not say the bundle was for him.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I received the prisoner in charge on the morning of the 10th, with the copper; I found two latch-keys on him, one of which I tried, and it opens the prosecutor's door - I asked how he came by the copper - he said that would be further stated when he came before the Magistrate.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I solemnly declare my innocence - I went to this house to call up Hinton, as we both work together; I had just got into the passage, and knocked against the partition as usual, to awake him, when this man came and said, "D-n you, you don't live here - what do you do here?" I said I had come to call Patrick; he said I had come to steal the water cock - he went down stairs, found the basket in the dust-hole, and brought it up, opened it on the pavement, and said, "This has been taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160022"></xptr>out of some kitchen;" I said I knew nothing about it - he went on with the basket, and seeing a Policeman, hailed him, then came back, and collared me; I might easily have run away - I solemnly declare I am innocent; I live in Milk-street - there are two doors in my passage, and these keys open them.</p>

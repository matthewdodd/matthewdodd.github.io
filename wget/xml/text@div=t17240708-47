The Prosecutor depos'd, That he and the Prisoner being Lodgers in the same House, and he being visited by some Friends, they making merry, the Prisoner coming down Stairs, said, Mr. May, you are very merry, and came in and threw him down on the Bed, and the Rings being large, she got them off. He call'd two Evidences, one to prove that he had the Rings at that Time on his Finger; and the other, that she went with them out of the Room. It appeard by the Evidence, That the Prosecutor had compounded the Matter with the Prisoner's Husband, having taken a Note of 16 s. for the Rings, which not being paid, he arrested the Prisoner's Husband, and that the Prisoner's Husband had indicted the Prosecutor in the Crown Office for compounding Felony. The Prisoner deny'd her having the Rings, and called Evidence to prove the Prosecutor was much in Drink. The Jury <rs id="t17240708-47-verdict242" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Is there a kind of stone step in the cell? A. No - the cell is not very dark; there is no window, but a grating in the door - they appeared strangers to each other.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BLACKMAN. I am inspector of the Police, and was on duty. All drunken persons are searched when brought to the cell; there was no instrument on the prisoner - there is a projection in the cell, where two iron bars are put to throw light in; it is a kind of cill, about three feet from the floor - it is stone; I found blood on that, as if the man's head had fallen against it, and the blood was traced from that stone, to where the deceased was sitting - I have no doubt but his head had fallen against that.</p>
               <p>JAMES DANDO. I am a tailor, and have known the deceased for the last twenty years. This accident was on a Monday; I saw the deceased at the hospital on the Monday after - he was in bed, and very ill; he was very low in spirits, but said nothing as to whether he expected to recover - he died about three weeks after.</p>

            . I am house-surgeon of St. George's-hospital. I saw the deceased between one and two o'clock on the morning of the 5th; he had received a severe lacerated wound on the head, immediately above the left brow; the bone was exposed to a considerable extent - I could discover no other injury; I attended him till he died, which was on the evening of the 30th - the wound in the head was entirely the cause of his death; I should think the most probable cause of the wound was falling on the stone cill described by the witness - the blow was a severe one, but I cannot form an opinion whether he himself might not have caused it, by stumbling against the cill, or by being pushed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you with him at any period when he considered himself in extreme danger, and conscious of approaching death? A. He repeatedly asked me if he was in danger; I continually told him he was in danger, from the time of his first coming in - he was a very well disposed man, and seemed to conduct himself very well, and to believe what I told him; his danger had been fully explained to him, not only by myself, but by Mr. Keith, the surgeon of the hospital, in my presence; I do not recollect that he communicated to me how the accident happened after he was aware of his danger - it was immediately after he came in.</p>
               <p>JAMES DANDO. I saw him on the Sunday after the accident. and again that day fortnight - he told me how it had happened at my first visit, but not afterwards.</p>

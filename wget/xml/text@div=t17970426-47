               <p>Q. Is there any door immediately from the one to the other? - A.No; it is about five feet across a yard; there is a wall goes round the yard. In the morning when I got up, I was informed that I had been robbed, and I immediately went over to Noah's house, he lived opposite to me; he was not at home, his wife sent him over to me when he came home; he deals in lead, and I had gone over to give him information if any should be offered for sale, to stop it; he told me he had no lead at present, but if any should come, he should know what to do with it, that was all that passed. I found one piece of lead, that I can identify, in a cart, the Saturday night following, about nine o'clock. (It is produced).</p>
               <p>Q.Are you sure that is a piece that you lost the night of the 13th, or morning of the 14th? - A. Yes; I am sure of it, it was a piece that was on the block not finished; the cart was going out of Great George-street, there were Noah and Jefcourt, with the cart, and somebody else that got away. They both said they did not know any thing about the property; they were stopped just as I came up to the cart; there was three hundred weight of lead in the cart, besides this; I did not see any body else with it; the other was sheet lead, which I believe to be mine, but I cannot pretend to swear to it. The lock of the shop-door had been forced open with a chissel, or something, it was a very great strain; I suppose they came over the wall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. This shop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179704260038"></xptr>was built after the dwelling-house was built? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. In order to go into it, you go out of one door from the dwelling-house, and through another door into the shop? - A. Yes; there is a little bit of an angle of about five feet between the two doors.</p>
               <p>Q. It was on Tuesday night that you lost your lead? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday following you found it in a cart? - A. Yes; a small part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see either of the prisoners with the cart? - A. Yes, I did; they were stopped just as I came up to the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see either of the prisoners driving, or accompanying the cart? - A. I did not.</p>

             sworn. - On Thursday, the 16th of February last, I was going along with my cart and horse to collect some old iron.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by collecting? - A. To buy old iron; I always go all along Westminster once a week, and stop at all the old iron shops; I stopped at Mr. Noah's shop, and asked if he had any old iron; he told me he had; I laid out with him about fifteen shillings and sixpence for iron; afterwards he told me he had something, that he could put a few pounds in my pocket; I asked him what it was; and he said, it could not be done before night, on account that it belonged to a person opposite the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you a very intimate friend of Noah's? - A. I used to buy old iron of him; he told me he could put a few pounds in my pocket; I asked him what it was; and he told me it was lead, and he would show my partner where the lead lay; he said, it could not be at his house because it belonged to the prosecutor; my partner went with the horse and cart to the foot of Westminster-bridge, and I went with him, and saw the lead; he asked me what I could afford to give for it, and asked me, if I would give ten shillings a hundred; I told him I would.</p>
               <p>Q. How much is it really worth? - A. We give fourteen shillings for it, and sell it, for fourteen shillings and sixpence, old lead, but this was new; I did not take it away that evening because I wanted to find out the prosecutor's name, and I told him I could not fetch it till Saturday night; I saw him on Saturday, and gave him information of it; I went to a public-house and sent for him, I would not go to him because of the prisoner living opposite the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him what had passed between you and Noah? - A. Yes; I then took my horse and cart, and fetched it away; I got the lead loaded in the cart; when the cart had been loaded with four or five pieces, Mr. Noah desired me to put the cart in Cartwright-street, and he would look out to see if there were any officers about; he knew them all, and three others were to go with the cart; the cart was put into Dartmouth-row, in a bye-place; Jefcourt, and two others, went with the cart, the two others got off; Jefcourt was to have gone home with Noah to my house, because he would not trust him to receive the money alone; Mr. Noah agreed with me for ten shillings a hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was your cart removed from the place where it was loaded before it was stopped? - A. I cannot say rightly; it might be fifty or sixty yards; the cart was stopped by

               <p>Q.Nor any where else? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Hilton.) Q. Did the last witness, at any time, apply to you? - A. Yes; on the Saturday, about two or three o'clock in the afternoon, he sent for me to the Princes-head, the corner of Queen-street, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any information of your lead? - A.He did, and an appointment was made in consequence of it; I directly went for two officers, he told me where they were to load the cart in Cartwright-street, he was to give us a signal when it was loaded; but before the signal was given, a young man came and told us the cart was loaded, and we went out and met the cart; Noah and Jefcourt, and two other persons, were present.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long have you been in partnership with Lee? - A. Nine months.</p>

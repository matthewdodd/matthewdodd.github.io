                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 13th of November I was on duty in the parish of St. Clement Danes, a few minutes before twelve o'clock at night, and observed the prisoner standing at the door of Edward Stammers, No. 100—it is a double house—No. 99 is adjoining to it—in consequence of what she said to me, I went into the house, and went up to the second floor—she opened the door, and I found the room full of smoke—I staid there about half an hour—I had opportunities during that time of looking at different parts of the room—I did not find any part of the house burnt—I found a chair and a chest of drawers, but no part of the house on fire.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fireman to the County Fire-office. I went to this house, No. 100, next morning at eleven o'clock—I went in and examined the room—I found a small portion of the flooring next to the hearth charred, just scorched, or burnt in a trifling way—I have no doubt it had been on fire—in a red beat, but not in a blaze—I could tell that by the wood being charred and burnt a little—that might possibly have been done previously, by ashes falling on the floor—I cannot say when it was done—it was no depth—if it was a quarter of an inch in the wood, it was as much as it was—I did not examine to see how deep it was.</p>

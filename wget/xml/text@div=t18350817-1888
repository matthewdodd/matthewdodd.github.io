                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Deptford.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the deceased—there were no external marks of violence; and if 500, 000 surgeons had seen the body, they would come to the conclusion, in the absence of external injury, that the deceased died from natural causes—I believe the death to be caused by a quantity of water collected in the left ventricle, which I pointed out, and which the other surgeons have forgotten to mention—that shows a natural tendency to apoplexy; and she was disposed to dropsy—the well of water in her head disposes me to consider death arose from natural causes—I am not confined to that symptom alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> A woman, apparently in health and standing on her legs, is knocked down and dies upon a person falling on her, would you attribute that to natural causes, or the blows? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I deny that she was in good health, on account of the well of water in her head—the blood-vessels, to a certain extent, over the ear were full of bood—this shows she was disposed to die of apoplexy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would not a blow and fall accelerate that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not such a blow as she received, viz. a slap of the face from a woman—many receive a blow, and are not killed by it—in my humble opinion, the blow had nothing to do with her death, it left no mark—I mean to say, a blow which did not leave a mark is not suficient to cause death—a blow would assist in causing death in a person of apoplectic habit, but I am not dis<lb></lb>posed to think it caused death; in the absence of external injury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Am I to understand you think she fell down in a fit of apoplexy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do; excitement produced by drink and passion, and that she was dead before she fell to the ground—that is my idea—there were other symptoms of apoplexy from natural causes—I do not admit that the blow had any thing to do with her death, for she was dead to the world before she reached the gound—I was, house-surgeon at Colchester hos<lb></lb>pital, when a boy was brought in with a fractured scull; a portion of the scull was knocked in, and he did not die instantly, though it was a tre<lb></lb>mendous blow from the sails of a wind-mill—my opinion is, that in all human probability this woman would have died on the spot if nobody had struck her.</p>

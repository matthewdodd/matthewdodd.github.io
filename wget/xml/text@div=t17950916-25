On the 18th of last month, Tuesday night, I was with the prisoner in her own room, between twelve and one o'clock; I met her in the street; I had seen her several times before. I am a German; I had spoke to her before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of her? - Yes. I met her in the street and asked her how it goes? and she says very well.</p>
               <p>Q. And so you went home with her? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to bed there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you drunk or sober? Had you been in any company before? - No, not to drink. I am a single man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you undress completely there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you awake in the morning? - Between four and five o'clock; it was hardly day light.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this girl go to bed to you at the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she there in the morning when you awoke? - No. I found my breeches under the pillow; I missed my money and my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put your watch? - In the sob.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find them at any time afterwards? - No, never watch not money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get up immediately? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you find her? - I did not find her the next day or the day after; I found her in the same street where I found her before. I asked her how do you do, and I asked her if she knew any thing about my watch, and if the knew any thing about it, if she would be so good to tell me or help me to the ticket; she said she knew nothing about it; she said she knew nothing either about the money or the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I met him first in the night, he asked me if I would go home along with him? I told him I would not, I had got a place of my own; he then asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160075"></xptr>me if he might go along with me to my place? I told him, yes; and I asked him to give me something to drink; and we went to a house where there were-seven girls, and we had a pot of beer, and we came out, and he said he would give me half a crown to sleep with me all night; I said that was rather too little, but he said he would make, amends another night, and I went with him, but he had no watch, for he did not know what it was o'clock, and he asked the watchman going along.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I did give the girl a pot of beer, and in the room. I gave her two shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had your watch then? - Yes, I had.</p>

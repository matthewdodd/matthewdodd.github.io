My father keeps the Bell at Ealing—on 19th November, I saw the prisoner in company with another man—the other man came in and called for half-a-pint of ale—the prisoner did not come in—the price of the ale was 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I served the man, and he gave me a shilling—I put it in the till by itself, and gave him change, and he went out of the house, and joined the prisoner who was about thirty yards off in the yard—they re<lb></lb>mained together, and went away together—when the man went out of the house, I looked at the shilling, bent it, and gave it to the ostler, he gave it to the policeman—when I first saw the prisoner and the other man, they were about thirty yards from our house.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 5th of December, at three o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoner Fox, with a ball-cock, and a water cock in his hand. He said his father had sent him to sell them, and he was to have sixpence of the money. I then took him on suspicion of stealing them; these are the things, (producing them;) and his father is a very honest man.</p>

            . The house is in Kingsland Road, from which these things were stolen, was an empty one at the time. I occupied the house on the 7th of October last and saw the things all safe when I quitted it. I found the back door open after this cobbery.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA ARMSTRONG. I took young Pond, in consequence of information I received. At the house of Fox's mother, was this cock, (producing it,) which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100055"></xptr>young Fox said he gave to his father.</p>
               <p>JOHN PRICE. I shall be fourteen on the 7th of February. I was going on an errand, at about half past two in the afternoon of the 5th of December, I met the prisoners near the Bull, in old Kingsland. Fox said he would send the things home by Pond, which he did, and he said he had some things to shew me, and he took me down into a brick field,and shewed me the cocks; and he went into a good many shops, and could not sell them. I did not see him any more, until after Mr. Haycock took him up. He said he had taken them from next door to the Shepherd, Robinson's Row, Kingsland.</p>

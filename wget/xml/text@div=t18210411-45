On the 19th of February, I went to bed about twelve o'clock, examained my door and saw it all fast. I was alarmed about twenty minutes before six o'clock in the morning, I got up immediately, it was near break of day. I found the bar was taken off the shutter, and two panes of glass broken out of the bar window frame, and cut away large enough to admit a man through. I missed the property stated in the indictment.</p>

            . I am watchman at Mr. Comb's brew-house. About twenty minutes before six o'clock, I was going to call a man who lodged at Taylor's, to come to work, and found the house in this state; the prisoner standing with one arm and his head in the window - I knew him before; he had a small candle in his hand a-light. I walked on about six or eight yards, then turned back - he looked at me. I said,</p>
               <p>"I think I see what you are after," he put his light out, and ran away. I have known him five years, and am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you never tell Furzeman, you saw a man half in and half out. but you could not be positive to his person - A. I said, I did not like to swear to any man, because it was dark. I said, I did not like to swear against him - I did not say I could not identify him. I said if he had not had the candle in his hand, I should not be able to swear to him. I could have taken him, but he having a light, I thought it was somebody belonging to the house.</p>

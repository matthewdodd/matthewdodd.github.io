                  </hi>. I am a sub-sorter of letters in the twopenny post-office. The male prisoner was an inspector of letter-carriers in the twopenny post department—he inspected the carriers of the principal office, which embraces the city, also the south and east part—he was, generally speaking, inspector of twopenny post carriers—letters are frequently mis<lb></lb>sorted from the inland to the twopenny post-office—that sometimes happens with letters franked by Members of Parliament—there are several Bath-streets in the twopenny post delivery—if a letter got into the twopenny post-office by mistake, it ought to be sent back to the inland office by putting it into a box which stands before us, and the stamper takes it out into the inland office—if we discovered it in sorting, it would be returned through the tunnel, but if it went further, it would be sent in a box; if we misread the direction for London, it would be sent out in the hands of the letter-carrier; and if he took it out, it would be his duty to return it the next time he came—it would come into the office again in time for the mail at night, to go to Leamington—on the evening of the 31st of October the prisoner was one of the inspectors on duty, until about a quarter to seven o'clock; from ten o'clock in the morning, and on the following day also—during that time he had constant access to the sorting office—if a letter had been brought back, having been wrongly sent, it would be delivered to him if it was after ten o'clock—the letter-carrier would bring it—some letters come in before ten o'clock—they are delivered to the senior inspectors, Mr. Burt and Mr. Till.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the inspectors in the twopenny post. I was on duty there on the 31st of October, from seven o'clock in the morning till eight o'clock at night—a letter put in on the 31st, and sent to the twopenny post that evening, would not come under my observation at all—the mistake would not be communicated to me that evening, if it was dis<lb></lb>covered—I have heard the prisoner direct the letter-carriers how to indorse their bank-notes, when there was any going to be paid into the Treasury through the charge-takers—there is a direction by the receiver-general about their being indorsed across the middle of the notes—it is those instruc<lb></lb>tions I have heard the prisoner give—if a letter is discovered by the sorter to be mis-sorted into the twopenny post-office, it would be sent to the in<lb></lb>land office—but if it came out being read London, and it got into the letter-carrier's hands, to be delivered, he would not bring it to the office till ten or eleven o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector. On the 5th of December I went to No. 24, Ann's-place, Hackney, with Lloyd and Davis—I saw the female prisoner there—I took this £5 note with me—I asked her if she had passed a £5 note at Mr. Dear's, she said "Yes"—I first asked her if she knew the person who was with me, Davis—she said she did—I asked how she came by the £5 note—She said she could not then recollect—I said, "You must certainly recollect who you got it from"—she said, "I do not, you must give me some time to recollect myself"—I put the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183612120031"></xptr>
               <p>same question repeatedly, and in about ten minutes she said, "I had it of my son"—(I had the note in my hand, but did not give it her to look at) I said, "What son?"—she said, "At the post-office"—I said, "When did he give it you?"—she said the day before—I asked if it was the day before she passed it at Mr. Dear's—she said, "Yes"—I then left her in charge of the constable, and proceeded to the General Post-office, where I saw the male prisoner—I asked him his name—he said, "West-brook"—I asked if he had a mother, and where she resided—he said he had, and she resided at No. 24, Ann's-place, Hackney-road, (which was where I had found her)—I asked if he had seen her lately—he said yes, he saw her yesterday—I then said, "Did you see her about the 10th or 11th of last month?"—he said Yes, he was in the habit of seeing her daily—I said, "Did you about that time give her a £5 note?"he said, "No"—I said "Are you certain you never gave her a £5 note?"—he said, the second time, he had not—at this time I told him I was an officer, and would advise him to be cautious, and not answer any ques<lb></lb>tions without he chose—I put no further questions to him—I heard him say, soon afterwards, (in less than two minutes,) that he had given his mother a £5 note—he was asked to account for it—he said he could not, but he had taken it from some one in the office—I do not think I showed him the note—he was made acquainted that the note had been stolen, and traced to his possession—he was told so by a gentleman in the office—the conversation was all within ten minutes—it was five or six minutes after he said he had not given his mother a £5 note, that he was told one had been stolen and traced to his possession—that was in a conversa<lb></lb>tion with a gentleman in the office—he acknowledge giving it to his mother before he was told one was stolen—there was some conversation passed between Mr. Smith and the prisoner—I heard Mr. Smith say, it was his bounden duty to state how the note came into his possession—to the best of my knowledge that was between his denial and his saying he had given it to his mother, but I cannot say whether Mr. Smith had not told him it was traced to him—I searched a drawer belonging to him, which he stated to be his, and found a pocket-book in it, containing a £5 note—there was an indorsement on it—"Linwood Westbrook, T P O"—I did not show him the note in question.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Superintending President of the twopenny post-office. When the policeman came to say he had got the mother in custody the prisoner was called into my room—the officer asked him his name—he said Westbrook—he asked if he had seen his mother lately—I believe he replied, "Yesterday"—he was then asked if he had seen her about the 10th of November—he replied that he had—he said he frequently saw her—that he passed through her street (in his way to his residence, I suppose)—he was then asked if he had given her a £5 note—he said he had not—the question was put to him a second time, and he made the same answer—I think no date was given him—the officer then explained to him that he was an officer, did cautioned him about what answer he should give—I then took up the question and said, "Do not answer any thing; you are placed in a perilous situation; do not answer any questions you think will be injurious to yourself, but you must be aware whether you gave your mother a £5 note or not"—he then said he did—I said, "Westbrook, the note has been stolen out of a letter, and cannot you tell who you took it from?"—he said if his name was not at the back of it he could not—I had not shown him the note at that time—it was on my table—I do not think it had been in his hand—it was</p>

               <p>either in my hand at the time or on the table—it was not in a situation where he could see his name or any name on it—I expressed my regret at seeing him in the painful situation he was—I have been in the post-office thirty-one years—it has been the regulation ever since I have been there for persons to put their name on every note they take—that regulation applies to all notes which come into their possession, whether officially or privately—if a person not an officer were to pay him a note it would be his duty to indorse it—Linwood is a clerk in the twopenny post department.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you been living in the house with him and his wife? A. I lived in the house, but did not know she was his wife; he was sleeping with her - he was a very false man; I never took any money of him but once - that was 4l.; I never slept with him but one night; I did not go back to that house after my marriage - I have not prosecuted him before; because he never became troublesome to me, but through his ill-using his wife I have done it; I am now living with a man, whom I lived with before I married the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you slept with the prisoner before you married him? A. No - I was cohabiting with the other man; what harm is that?</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What name did the prisoner's wife go by? A. I used to call her Mrs. Blazie, but he was so false and deceitful; I said to him "If you mean to be honest, tell me," and he said she was not his wife.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. But did not his wife answer to the name of Mrs. Blazie? A. I do not know that I called her so above once or twice; I did not ask her if she was his wife - he told me she was married to another man, and he brought the marriage lines into the passage; the man I live with is not married to another woman - I have had two children by him; he has not had any children by any other woman - his name is Joseph Vigor - I go by that name, and should have married him but for this case; I should have married him before I had the prisoner, but he used me ill and then I would not have him; he has used me better since - I told Vigor I had married the prisoner, but not on the same day.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to SARAH MILES. Q. Can you read and write? Q. Yes. I received 4l. of the prisoner in full of all demands, at his wife's wish - because she should live comfortably with him - this is my receipt.</p>

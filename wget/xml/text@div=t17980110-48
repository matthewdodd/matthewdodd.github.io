               <p>Court. Q. The vessel was not moved to the other side of the river - she did not go over mid-channel? - A. No, only shifted from one tier to another; I went to seek for him at a public-house, the Dark house, in Dark-house-lane; I drank once with him, and then he and I went on board together, and went to sleep very quietly, till eight o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You were to have staid on board by your master's directions as well as Davis? - A. No, we took it by turns; we had the liberty to go on shore to get a pint of beer, but not to stay long.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came on board, you looked and found every thing perfectly safe? - A. Yes; every thing locked down safe, fore and ast.</p>
               <p>Q. You found him at the house that you generally use when you go to refresh yourselves? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You expected to find him there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It was no uncommon thing, then, for him to go to that house to get some beer? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing singular in his going there? - A. No.</p>

             came in for them, and, I believe, had them, I did not give them to him with my own hand; but I am pretty sure that I saw him in the office, I am not quite certain, we were very busy.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do you open in the morning? - A.Sometimes at five, and sometimes at six; there is no regular hour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Is it customary for them to call for the keys when the loading is complete? - A. Yes; we inspect them, and they are ready for them.</p>
               <p>Q.Sometimes the master calls, and sometimes the man? - A. Yes; just as it happens.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore there was nothing more extraordinary in the man calling than the master? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. These keys, when you take them into your custody in the office, are sealed up in a paper till they go to the ship? - A. Yes, that is the intention of it.</p>
               <p>Q. And after the boy arrives at the ship, then the paper is delivered, and the seal broke by the commanding officer of the ship? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the regular course of business, that the commanding officer breaks the seal, and takes the keys, and the boy is not opened till then? - A. The hoy is not opened till then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Did you see the keys after you suppose Davis had them? - A. The next morning I saw the captain of the boy, and I told him, Davis had got his orders and his keys; and he told me he had them.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. How many seals do you put on? - A.One.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where is the India-House seal kept? - A. It is kept in a drawer in the office.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did the prisoner know where the seal was kept, and the manner in which this business was conducted? - A. I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. So that if he had broke the seal he might have put another on? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There are many rooms about the office? - A. No, only two; one office above stairs, and one below.</p>

             sworn. - I am a publican, in Jacob-street, Bermondsey; I know the prisoner very well, I have known him three or four years; he has used my house, sometimes once a week, sometimes once a fortnight, just as he was at home, he belonged to captain Pow's boy; I saw him on the 3d of October, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I was in bed and asleep when he came to my house; he said, I have got some things; I asked him what things; and he said, prize goods; I asked him what goods; and he said, plate; and asked me to let him leave them for two or three days, till he returned from Gravesend; I told him, he might leave them there and welcome; he pulled out spoons, forks, shoe-buckles, and breast-buckles; I told him to count them, that there might be no mistake when he came to take them away, and he put the number of each down in his pocket-book; I did not see what the numbers were, I was not out of bed; I asked him what he would have to drink; and he said, a shillingsworth of brandy and water; I desired my wife to put them away, and she put them away in a little box in the same room;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100065"></xptr>Davis sad to me, I want some money; says I, I have got none, money is very scarce; says he, I am going to Woolwich to morrow to bind my boy apprentice, and I have nothing but what I stand upright in, and I cannot go without money; he said, he was to have gone the next day with the boy, but he had got leave of his master to go to bind his boy, and he had got a man to go in his room with the boy; my wife came up with the brandy and water, and I desired her to look in the drawer and see what money she had got, and she and I, between us, made up ten pounds, and lent it him; he said, if I should want money, I might pledge them, but I did not pledge them; the last words he said, when he went away, were, if you can sell them for me do against I come back; I said, if I could I would; in about three days time, I called one Levi, a Jew, and fold him near eighty ounces of silver, it came to nineteen pounds nineteen shillings, at five shillings per ounce, the spoons and buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those spoons and buckles part of the the things you received from Davis? - A. Yes; two days after that, I think, the 7th of October, I fold as many goods to Fenham, a waterman, as came to 21l. at 5s. per ounce; he came again the next day, the 8th, and had the remainder of the spoons and forks, that brought me 32l. he took them hap-hazard, without weighing or any thing, just as they came; I then had left 2 pair of spoons, and 2 pair of buckles, which I gave to the Police-officer, when he came to me; in about ten days from the time Davis left the goods, he came to me in the afternoon, and asked me if I had done any thing with the goods; I told him, yes, I had sold part of them to Fenham, and part to another man, and if he would stop, I would give him the money; I went up stairs, and brought him 60l. and what he had had before, made 70l. I believe there were 761. and he gave me the rest, and asked me if I was satisfied; I told him I was, if he was, and he said, he was, for he did not expect so much money for them; he was to call again for the remainder of the things, which Riley, the constable, has now got.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I do not know, whether I dare ask you, if you are an honest man, that will be rather too hard for you, and therefore I will come to something else - what is your sign? - A. The Three-tuns.</p>
               <p>Q.Pretty near the water-side? - A. Yes, in the day-time; because there is a thoroughfare through it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with Fenham? - A.Two or three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the Police-officer that came to your house? - A.Riley and Elby.</p>

               <p>Q.Perhaps you never heard, that it is a common practice for the lumpers to bring sugar to the public-houses at the water-side? - A. They never brought any to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard of such a thing? - A. I may have heard of many things that I never knew any thing about.</p>
               <p>Q. But lumpers never come to your house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there never any lumpers came to your house? - A. Not with any property.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did you stay out of the way? - A. Seven or eight weeks, I believe.</p>

               <p>Q. And you, like an honest man, staid out of the way for seven or eight weeks? - A. I had a very good reason for it.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not doubt that at all, you are just by the water-side yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your friend, Fenham, keeps a boat, does not he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in a boat with him too? - A. Not these eighteen months.</p>
               <p>Q. So you staid out of the way seven or eight weeks about this very charge? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the 3d of October, that you saw the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Who found you out? - A. I sent to the officer, and resigned myself up.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you fixed it upon this man? - A. Yes</p>
               <p>Q. And let your friend, Fenham, out? - A. My friend, Fenham, was the first that gave evidence against me.</p>

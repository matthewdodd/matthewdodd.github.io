               <p>Q. Had you occasion to go on board again on the 3d of March? - A. I had; the vessel then was in the dock; I unlocked the door of the cabin, and I found the prisoner at the bar standing in one of the lockers, that holds bottles for wine and other things: I seized him, and told him to come up; I took him out of the place where he was in and came upon deck; I let the prisoner go, as I was certain he would be stopped; seeing some persons at the Dock head, I called to them to stop him, which they did; I saw him searched, and there were sugar, chocolate, and some castors found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there such things as sugar and chocolate in the cabin? - A. Yes, they had been left in the cabin adjoining to where I found him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the castors - were they the castors of the ship? - A. I have no doubt in the least, but that they were.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are constable of the West India Dock? - A. Yes: on the 3d of March, I took the prisoner into custody within the Dock gates; I heard some person call out, stop thief; I being inside of the gates saw the prisoner; he seemed to be in a hurry to get out; I said, what have you been doing of; his reply to me was, I am very sorry for what I have done; I took him into an office inside of the gates, and searched him; I found four pounds of sugar, one pound of chocolate, and four small castors. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Findley. I produce the stand, the castors belong to this stand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you find any sugar or chocolate missing from the locker of the cabin? - A. A double quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it such sugar and chocolate as that? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was it part of the ship's cargo? - A. No, ship stores; it belonged to the shipowners.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. At the time I might have committed this I was in a state of insanity, which respectable people will come and prove. I have been commander of a ship these twenty years. Had I been in my proper senses, had it laid in the street, I should not have stooped to pick it up. I have a wife and children. Here are people who will prove that I have laid violent hands upon myself. It is a thing that I despise more than any thing in the world. I hope you will have compassion on me.</p>

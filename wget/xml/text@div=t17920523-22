I said no; he seemed disconcerted, and said he thought I gave him as much trouble, and put him to as much expence, as I could; he then expressed much dissatisfaction, and said he had heard I was not a gentleman, and asked when he should call again; I appointed the following Saturday, at ten o'clock, at which time he came there was another person with him, and said he hoped every thing was clear and satisfactory to both parties; he produced a power of attorney from

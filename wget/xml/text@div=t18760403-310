This book of Payne's is not one sup<lb></lb>plied by the company to their servants; they do supply books—I did not know Payne before he came into the company's service; he came from Messrs. Bagley, Wylde, Co.—Perry had no right to sign these advice notes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am delivery clerk at the King's Cross goods de<lb></lb>partment—Swinscoe was in the same office—on the 14th March I saw this delivery-sheet, marked E, lying on my desk—Perry came and asked me to deliver it as early as I possibly could because the consignee was waiting for the goods.</p>

Cox, pro. Agard," on it.</p>
               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">THOROGOOD</hi>. I saw this van on the 14th, and took <hi rend="italic">charge</hi> of it—it contained the bottles afterwards shown to Weston.</p>

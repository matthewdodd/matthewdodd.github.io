             - A. Yes, we are cotton dyers living in Bunhill-row; Hutchinson was in our employ, he had been with us three years; first of all he went away and returned, and entered into a fresh agreement for another three years. This last time he had been in our employ a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in your employ on the 30th of August - A. Certainly. On the Wednesday morning I sent for Hewitt, and in the evening of the same day I had some conversation with Hutchinson, I told him it was very improper of him breaking his engagement with us by going to America; I told him I would stop him or punish him, I do not know which; he then said he would come to work the next morning, I believe; he did not come; I applied to a magistrate and he was brought before him.</p>

            . I am a stationer and rag merchant. On the evening of the 31st of August Hewitt and the defendant came into my warehouse and asked me to count up how many dollars for twenty-seven guineas; I did it for the purpose of paying the passage to America; he meaned to pay for this man's passage and his own; thirteen pound for Hutchinson, and fourteen pound for his own.</p>
               <p>Q. You are witness to that note - A. Yes; I told Hutchinson that Mr. Hughes was very unwilling for him to go, he would not let him; he said he shook hands with his master; he consented to his going, and wished him well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go on board with this man - A. No.</p>
               <p>Defendant. At the first of this you went with us - Did not you go down with me to the captain and leave a one pound note for the earnest - A. When Hewitt paid the money I went down to the docks, curiosity led me to walk about the docks; I did not go down with you.</p>
               <p>Q. The captain asked Hewitt if he was a mind to go, he said yes: you asked the captain about me - A. That is not true.</p>
               <p>Q. The captain said I take none but farmers, I did not twig the captain; you said yes, farmers; Hewit said he was a farmer, and I was going to help him - I was going to say I was a cotton manufacturer - A. I did go on board with the defendant, I cannot say the captain's name; I heard say the ship was going to New York.</p>

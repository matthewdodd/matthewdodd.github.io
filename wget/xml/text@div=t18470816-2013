On Sunday evening, the 1st of August, I saw the prisoner on the steam-boat pier, near the British Flag, at Battersea—a number of persons were waiting on the pier during part of the time—I watched the prisoner—a female came down on the pier—I saw him put his left hand into her pocket—I got by the side of him, and caught him hand as he pulled it out, with a handkerchief and purse in it—he dropped it, made a stroke at it with his foot, and tried to kick it overboard—Gibbs picked it up—the female came off the boat, claimed the purse and handker<lb></lb>chief, and said, "You want me for a future day; I shall not come"—there was a shilling, a sixpence, and two copper coins in the purse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of David Kearney, a police-constable, and live at Chesham Place, Woolwich—the prisoner was a lodger in my house—on 20th August I went to the funeral of his child—when we came back I said I would get tea, and we would all sit down together—he said no more, and slammed out of the room—his conduct was very violent, and he was very drunk indeed—I had placed a coat on a chair in the parlour, and in the pocket there was a purse containing 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went out, and someone threw a brick at the prisoner, which struck my little girl on the head—when I came back, I found the prisoner in my room, quarrelling with another man—the prisoner had a knife in his hand, and it struck my boy on the temple—I went out to get the wound dressed—when I returned to the room I searched the coat and missed the purse—I had seen it safe about a quarter of an hour before—I gave information to a constable—the prisoner was taken, and I charged him with stealing the purse—he said, "Search me"—he seemed to understand the nature of the charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. Did you see me drunk at the time we went to the funeral? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

I am the wife of William Wright, a gardener, at Chesham Place, Woolwich—I heard a disturbance, and went to the door—I saw the prisoner take the coat from the chair, and take something out of the pocket—I thought at the time it was a knife—he threw the coat down on the chair again—he upset all the things, and smashed the crockery on the floor, and then went out and closed the door—it was a rough coat—I saw the steel ends, and it appeared to me like a knife—the purse has steel about it.</p>

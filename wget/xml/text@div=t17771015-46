               <p>I am a shop-keeper at Canterbury: on Friday the 22d of August I met the prisoner with a man that lives at Canterbury, that I knew very well, he called me by my name, and asked me if I wanted to buy a strong cart-horse; I told him I did not; he said, his friend had one that he would be glad to sell on reasonable terms; I told him that the next day was the public market at Canterbury, and he might sell it there; he asked me then to recommend somebody to him to buy it; the prisoner said, he was under a necessity of selling his horse to save his houshold goods, and that he was going into Kent to join with a man in driving a diligence; I told him if I could be of any service to him in selling it at the public market I would; he said, his horse was seven or eight miles off, and he could not recollect the man's name where it was, but described him to me; he said, he wished to have it nearer the market, but could not get it, because there was an incumbrance of 10 s. upon it for keeping; and that if I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150051"></xptr> advance the 10 s. I should have the horse to sell and pay myself; upon this I went back with him to the Star, and wrote a note to the person where the horse was, who, I understood by the prisoner's description, was a Mr. Campher, that if he would let the prisoner and the other man have the horse, and call upon me, I would pay him the 10 s. he sent the note back, and said, he would not let him have it without I sent him the money; I sent a porter with the 10 s. and the horse was brought to the Star; I saw the horse there, and desired the publican to l et nobody have it till I came for it myself: on Saturday I saw one

I said, I did not know that there was any occasion for me to go, but I will go with you now; he said, then it was too late, that the horse was stole, and the man was off; that he had partly owned the stealing of the horse to him: I apprehended the prisoner in the town about a fortnight after.</p>

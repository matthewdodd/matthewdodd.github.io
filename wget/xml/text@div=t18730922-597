                  </hi>. I am a beer retailer, of 9, Dove Row—on 25th July I was at the Victory beer-house, Mr. Hilldrup's—Mr. Tidyman came in, and while he was talking to me the prisoner came up, he was walking with a horse and van, which was loaded with greens—Tidyman went and said something to him, and they came back together, and the prisoner called me all manner of names, and challenged me to fight him—he has been a great annoyance to me for the last four years—Mr. Hilldrup went away, and I went to another table—the prisoner, came there, and put his face close to mine, using very abusive language, and asking me to fight him—I told him if I fought him I should have to fight all his relations—he said "When I get up in the morning at 3 o'clock I shall have my b----eye sight, "putting his finger to his eyes, "and that is a b----sight more than you will have;" and he laid his hand over my glass, which was on my right side—he put his face close to mine again, and I said "If you do so</p>

               <p>again I will knock your head out of the way"—he put his face close again, and said "Now do it, you b----"—I got up and went to sit at another table, leaving my glass, and sat alongside of his father, but I did not know it was his father—he hoisted me off and said "I will not allow a big prig like you to sit alongside of me"—I went and complained to the landlord, and the prisoner followed me and challenged me again—the landlord said "If I were you I should get home; I cannot assist you, there are so many"—I said "I will"—I then took the seat I had moved from at first, and took up my glass of ale—I swallowed some of it, and thought they had been putting gin in it to make me intoxicated—I thought it tasted like gin and ale, but my head became affected, and I found a terrible burning at my throat—I threw the contents away, and poured out another glass, and gave it to a man named Valentine—I had to go through a crowd of people to get into the road, and when I got there the prisoner said "Come on, you b----!" and struck me and knocked me down in the road—here is the mark on my elbow where I fell—I said "Where is the man who knocked me down?"—someone said "He has gone into the shop"—the prisoner came running out of his shop, took off his coat, waistcoat, and apron, and said "I am the b----man, come on"—he began to spar, and raised his hand, as if he was going to strike me, and I felt something come on my face which took away my senses—I ran as far as from here to you, to a butcher's shop, and then fell insensible—I was carried home, and am still under the doctor's care.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been drinking, but very little—I never left home till 9 o'clock p. m.—I was a teetotaller up to that day—I had not taken the pledge, but I had said to myself "I will not drink liquor for so long a time"—I am not in the habit of giving way to drink, but when I do I am very dull—this was about 11 o'clock at night—I have not authorized my friends to settle this matter by a payment of money—I distinctly saw the prisoner's hand open—I could not see whether there was a bottle in it, because the stuff came in my face—a great, many people were about—I had not been trying to pick a quarrel with the prisouer—when we were at the door Tidy<lb></lb>man said to the prisoner "Go it, Joe, let him have it"—I recollect every<lb></lb>thing—I gave evidence before the Magistrate, and my deposition was read over to me—I said that there were one or two mistakes in it, and Mr. Lewis said "You had better leave that entirely to me"—I said that there was a mistake on the third page—I do not know whether the Magistrate's clerk declined to alter it, but he did not alter it—I poured out some ale for my friend; that was after my ale had been tampered with, but mine was in a glass, and the other was in a quart pot—I tried to get out of the prisoner's way—I went about six yards off—I came back with his brother to the place where the prisoner was, and sat down by his brother, who shoved me off—I did not tell the prisoner at what time I went to market, but I said "If I fight you now, I shall have to fight the whole lot, but I will meet you at the market and make you fight"—I know he goes to market early, but I don't know at what time—I was not quarrelsome, quite the reverse; I got out of his way many times—I told the Magistrate that when I have had a little too much I do feel a little quarrelsome—when this stuff came into my face I said "I am poisoned and blinded"—I know that what was thrown was scattered over two or three people—there were 100 or 150 people there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I told the Magistrate that Hibbert <hi rend="italic">sparred</hi> up a second time, and was knocked down insensible—he was knocked down by the prisoner's fist—I know Mr. Higgins, the chemist—I did not see him there—there were a rare lot of people there, and a great deal of excitement and noise—I did not hear the prisoner tell Hibbert not to come near him when he went under his own blind—I told the Magistrate "He went under his blind and told Hibbert if he came near he would give it to him, and Hibbert went there and Joseph knocked him down."</p>

I am the wife of Edward Hammond, of 21, Duncan Street—on the night of 25th July, about 11 o'clock, I was in the Victory public-house, and saw Hibbert drinking and the prisoner quarrelling with him—the prisoner put his hand to his eyes and said "I shall wake up with these open to-morrow, and that is more than you will do"—I saw Hibbert go under the prisoner's blind, and then the prisoner threw some stuff in his eyes—some of it came into my eyes, which smarted very much, and I felt the effects for about five minutes afterwards—I stood close to Hibbert.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I mean that my eyes smarted, not the flesh round them—I saw the whole of the quarrel—I told the Magistrate that I saw the liquid leave the prisoner's hand—I mean to swear that—it was his right hand—I could not see anything in his hand to hold the liquid, the act was too quick—his hand was half open and half shut—he was standing without his coat, I can't say about his waistcoat—the prisoner did not go uuder his blind and tell Hibbert that if he came there he would knock him away, he said that if he wanted him he would find him under his own blind—Hibbert was not <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi> when he was knocked down; he once raised his hands in a fighting attitude—that was before he was knocked down, but not afterwards, he put his hands over his eyes without any <hi rend="italic">sparring</hi> at all—all this occurred under the blind which goes out over the pavement—the whole quarrel did not occur in the beer-shop.</p>

I am a clicker, of 2, Croft Street—I was in the Victoria public-house, about 11 o'clock, and saw Hibbert sitting at a table and the prisoner stooping down with his hands on his knees, and his face within a few inches of Hibbert's face—Hibbert pushed him aside by the shoulder, and said "Take your face out of my face V—the prisoner said "Don't you handle me, I can stand anything but handling."—I was rather too far off to hear what was said next, but the prisoner said "When I get up to-morrow morning I shall have my eyes open, but you won't"—I am</p>

               <p>quite sure I heard those words, and he put his hand to his eyes when he said it—they both seemed out of temper—the prisoner then said "Iam going to stay on our own ground, under my own blind," and Hibbert got up and was going away, but he met a young man and asked him where Mr. Sparrowhawk was, and went to the blind and asked where the man was that wanted to right him, and the prisoner got up and knocked him down in the road—a young man asked Hibbert to go away, and he walked to the blind and said "Allow me to explain"—the prisoner said "Don't let him come near me, for I can settle him with a look"—the prisoner had been into his shop and taken his waistcoat off, and he was sitting on a chair without his waistcoat—it was a very hot night—he then got up and squared up to Hibbert, and said "Take that, you b----," and Hibbert fell—the prisoner said "There's a coward, he has fallen down before I hit him," but as the prisoner threw his arm over I saw some drops come from his hand—I have not the least doubt that I saw liquid come from his hand, because, from the position of the persons sitting behind him, they could not have thrown it over his shoulder, they were sitting too low.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The common talk was for some time that the injury had been caused by throwing vitriol, which I believed up to a certain part of the case—Dr. Chambers, who designated the agent as ammonia, was not called till the last examination, and when I heard that I explained it—there is not the slightest ground for suggesting that I have been bribed or induced to give this evidence—I went to give evidence as to the impossibility of the prisoner injuring Hibbert with vitriol, because I saw him with a pipe in his right hand—no evidence was discussed with Mr. Beard, junior, in ray hearing, I only saw him for a second—when the Alderman came into Mr. Beard's office, he said that he would see ns at the Police Court, and when we got there he said it was no good giving evidence, the case would be sent for trial—I have not seen Mr. Beard to tell him the evidence that I hive given to-day, and until the prisoner was committed, I had no oppor<lb></lb>tunity of giving evidence about the ammonia.</p>

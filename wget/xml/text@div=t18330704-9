               <p>The letter was put in, and the latter part of it was read, as follows: - "The money I have of yours I shall send or leave at the road, as I do not know the bearer, and I never could do my duty after the unkindness I received this morning."</p>
               <p>Witness. I had found some wine removed, and I told the prisoner the day before, that I should not keep him - on that morning, he asked me if I would give him a character, I said, I could not give him one that would be of use to him; he ought to have returned to me in the course of the day, but he did not - I understand he absented himself from home - he was taken in a week afterwards.</p>

             (police-constable, S 215). I received information, and took the prisoner at No. 28, Little George-street - I found him and his wife at home; I told him I was authorised by his employer to take him into custody; he said, "Very well, I will go with you" - his wife did not say anything.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have only to throw myself on the mercy of the Court; I had a place to go to when my master refused me a character; when I sent the letter I intended to return the money, but I got a drop too much and lost it.</p>

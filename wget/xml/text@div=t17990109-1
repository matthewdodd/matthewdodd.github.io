             sworn. - I am an apprentice to Mr. Shotter: On Friday evening last I went with the officer to the prisoner's lodgings, and found those things that are here.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the ticking? - A.Between the sacking and the bed, made up in a kind of mattrass, stuffed with new hair, and some small bits of ticking besides; this ticking that is stuffed, I can swear to be my master's property.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a mattrass when your master lost it? - A. No, we had used it as a wrapper to keep the goods from the wet.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it to be your master's property? - A.Because I knew the pattern of the tick; I have opened the ticking, and in the inside of it there are some marks of dirt, which I remember very well.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that ticking in the state in which you used it? - A. About three shillings; I have another piece of carpeting here which matches exactly with that which was found at the prisoner's lodgings, that is worth about two shillings; I remember the pattern of this chintz border very well, it is worth about one shilling, we bought it at a linen-draper's in Cheapside.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. That piece of border was publickly sold in the linen-draper's shop? - A. Not by anction.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not publicly sold in the shop? - A. I do not know how public it was.</p>
               <p>Q. If I had a bit of carpet of the same size and pattern, you would have suspected me? - A. If it had been that identical piece, I should have suspected you.</p>
               <p>Q. And the mattrass was concealed under that bed, where mattrasses ought to be? - A. No, not where it ought to be, it ought to be upon my master's premises.</p>

             sworn. - I work at Mr. Shotter's: Last Wednesday morning, I went to work about ten minutes before nine, and Mrs. Moore was there before me; she came from the further end of the shop where the ticking was found afterwards; I asked her if she had been at work, and she said, no, she was poorly; she then went towards the fire, and then into a corner where the horse-hair was kept, and I followed her there, and saw her stoop towards the place where I afterwards saw the roll of ticking lay; she seemed as if she had something more than common under her petticoats, for she kept pulling it up all the morning; before twelve o'clock she went away without her cloak.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The roll of ticking that you saw in the shop, is still there, is it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.It is not charged in the indictment? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shotter. I can speak to the ticking, I mean the mattrass, and to the carpeting; it is a Russia<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090004"></xptr>ticking, and a very uncommon thing, we have used it as a wrapper; and the carpeting I know by the pattern, and by the quantity that was missing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. That mattrass belongs to my mother, who lives with me; there is that piece of carpet, and another small piece, I bought; and there was another small piece that was given me, with a work-bag, by this woman, Mrs Green.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character. <rs id="t17990109-1-verdict5" type="verdictDescription">

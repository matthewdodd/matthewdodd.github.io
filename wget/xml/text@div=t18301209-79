               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE Q. Did you find any thing else? A. Yes, some bread - he was to ask me every day for a loaf to take home, and I gave it him; he always took it out of the house - he never purchased any thing of me; I know the bread was mine, because I had seen it in a copper, concealed, but I am not charging him with that- he acknowledged the flour was mine, both on the 23rd and 24th; he said he had taken a little flour for his family; I had not said it would be better or worse for him - I never allowed him to take flour or bread, and to account for it to my wife.</p>

               <p>MR. RIVETT. I am a musician belonging to the guards. On the evening of the 19th of September, the boy came running up to me and asked me to stop the prisoner he had taken his hat out of the house, I asked the prisoner why he did not give the boy his hat, he would not; he said he was going to Portman-street, as he was going along I asked him twice to open the handkerchief to satisfy the boy and me, when he came a little further he said he only took it out of a joke, he told us to go in the public house and order a pot of beer, I said no, then you will walk off. I took him into the public house the watch-house keeper was sent for, when he came in he said, oh, Mr. Johnson you will not leave off your old tricks; he told me he was the greatest rogue that lay under the sun.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I came by there were a parcel of boys playing. I kicked the hat with my foot, I picked it up, the boy walked after and said master give me my hat. I said it is not your hat, when I met with that soldier he told me to give the boy the hat, I told him I did it out of a joke; I went back and returned the <rs id="t18090920-170-viclabel999" type="occupation">boy</rs>

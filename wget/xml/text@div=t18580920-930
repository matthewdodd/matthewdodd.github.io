                  </hi>. I am a cow-keeper in Robert-street, Brixton—the prisoner was in my service about six months—I gave him a week's notice to leave me—I think that was about a month before the fire occurred—there was no dispute between us afterwards with reference to his leaving, no more than he did not come in the morning after I had given him a week's notice, until I had been to him the third time, then he came—there was no dispute about it—on the same night that I gave him notice, he said he had got a place at Mr. Morgan's, and was going to it on Monday—I said to him, "You can't leave me in less than a week"—he said, "Oh, yes! we had no written agreement"—I said, "That does not matter, you are a weekly servant"—he said, "I must go"—then he left me, and I went over to Mr. Morgan; I saw him, and had some conversation with him—I did not see the prisoner afterwards—I don't think I saw the prisoner at all after I saw Mr. Morgan—he left the service about a month before the fire—I found my cows turned loose the day after he had left me, on the Sunday; I found that done six times—they must have been turned loose by some person—I sustained very little injury by that, two or three of the cows got a little bit gored by the horns—they were let loose in the shed—I found that some boards had been taken out—I found that out about three weeks I suppose before the fire, in the same week that the prisoner left—the effect of that was, that a hand could be put in and unbolt the door—I found among the grains, dirt, human dung—I found that twice—at last I was forced to get one of my men to sleep in the shed, and then I noticed nothing further—On the afternoon of 21st July, I was in the stable—my brother-in-law</p>

               <p>Evans, and another man, were there—we left the stable somewhere about ten minutes after 2—all three of us left together—we had been in the stable about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—when we left the stable it was quite safe—there was no wet grass about there, it had been all used up the day before—there were seven cows in the shed when we left it that afternoon—there were two doors, a locked door and a bolted door; they were both fastened when we came away—we left the stable about ten minutes past 2—I went over to my house to give the milk to my men, and then I went on serving my customers—my house is in Robert-street; out of Robert-street runs a short turning which has no thoroughfare; my shed is at the end of it—coming from the shed and going down the court I should have to turn to the left to get into Robert-street, to my house—after I had left the shed, and before I went to deliver my milk, I saw the prisoner—he passed me, I was on the opposite side to my house, serving my customers—he was going towards my shed; he was in Robert-street—I did not see him turn up the court towards my shed, I was going the other way—it was somewhere about forty yards from the turning that I saw him; he was going in the direction of the turning where my shed was—it was about a quarter past 2—I think it was about twenty minutes or a quarter to 3, before the alarm of fire was given to me—it would be about twenty-five minutes before the fire broke out that I saw the prisoner—there is a cottage in that place, opposite my shed, and that is all there is; that is the only dwelling that is in the place—it is an inhabited cottage—it was about twenty minutes to 3 that I heard the alarm of fire—I was then serving at a house called the Jenny Lind, about forty yards off, in Robert-street—I went at once to the shed—it was in that state we could not enter—there were three policemen by the side of me—the fire was most all over the shed—I did not observe where the fire had begun, I was so excited I could not recognize that—my cows were there; they were all burnt; one broke loose, but I was obliged to have it killed directly—I should say it was somewhere about half an hour, or less, before the shed was entirely down.</p>

LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you gave this boy notice to quit, had you discharged some other persons not very long before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I had discharged two men within twelve or eighteen months previously; the last one was just before I engaged with the prisoner, and he was with me about six months—I have not discharged anybody since I engaged him—on the day of the fire, I saw the prisoner in Robert-street, forty yards from the turning—supposing he had not gone down the turning, it was possible for him to go in another direction—there was a road leading in another direction into the main road, and another turning likewise—I know it was not earlier than half-past 2 when I saw the prisoner, by the time I I left my shed—I had not seen a clock or watch when I was at the shed, but I have a regular time—I have means of ascertaining the time—I was rather late that morning; and I was having my dinner and I looked at the clock, and it was about two or three minutes after 2, and away I ran into the shed—it was two or three minutes after 2 by my clock, when I last saw the clock—it was about twenty minutes or a quarter to 3 when I heard the alarm of fire—I can't say to two or three minutes—it was about a quarter to 3 by the clock at the Jenny Lind, when I was in there—there was straw in the shed, about a truss; that was in the loft—there was the litter of the cows, and the litter of the horse—the prisoner had left a month or three weeks before the fire took place—I had seen him before he came into my employment, but I did not know him personally—when he was in my em<lb></lb>ploy,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185809200071"></xptr>
               <p>I do not think he ever complained to me that he had found the cows loose, or that there was any disturbance within the shed such as what I have described as in the grain—the boards were not down before this, nor were they loose during the time the prisoner was in my service—I am quite sure of that—I never had a board down before—I have boards very near the top of the shed, for ventilation, but that is at the further end of the shed—the boards there are within the reach of a person standing on a short ladder.</p>

                  </hi>. I am brother-in-law to Mr. Fowler—I was helping him on Wednesday, 21st July—I had been in the stable about 25 minutes before I left it with him—there were three of us; we all left together—there were no signs of fire whatever about the stable when we left it—the straw was turned up under the manger where the horse stood—we were looking for the eggs in the manger and under the manger—that enables me to say there was no symptom of fire, if there were I consider I must have seen it, being there twenty-five minutes—there was nothing there to cause fire—we never kept a lucifer in the place—after I came out I went over to the house with the milk—that is my brother-in-law's house in Robert-street—I did not see the prisoner at all until I had left the house—I met him about twenty yards from the house, after I had taken part of the milk to go round to serve the customers—it must have been about a quarter past 2—my brother-in-law was not with me, he was serving some of the other customers—the prisoner was making his way past my brother-in-law's house, towards the end of the turning that leads to the shed—I did not see where he went—I can't say whether he turned up there or went straight on along Robert-street—when I heard the alarm of fire I went there to it—I was in the Brixton-road at the time—my brother-in-law got there first—I could not observe what part had burnt first—when I got there part of the roof was falling, and I saw the place was all in a flame.</p>

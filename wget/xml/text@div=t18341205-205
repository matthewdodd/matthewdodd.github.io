                  </hi>. I am a coach-maker, and live in Great Queen-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields. About half-past three o'clock in the afternoon on the 28th of November, I was at the corner of Gray's-inn-lane, looking at a picture shop—I felt something at my pocket—I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my handkerchief—I have since seen it in the hands of policeman E 104—when I turned round, I saw the prisoner near me—he was close to me by my side, when I felt something at my pocket—when I looked round, he walked away—I followed, and kept close be<lb></lb>hind him—I saw a policeman, and on his coming up, the prisoner ran off—I told him to stop the prisoner—he pursued him, and I saw him in cus<lb></lb>tody in Southampton-buildings in about two minutes—the policeman produced the handkerchief.</p>

About half-past three o'clock on the 28th of November, I was in Holborn, and in consequence of in<lb></lb>formation from the prosecutor, I ran after the prisoner, who was running at the time—he turned up Southampton-buildings, and flung the handker<lb></lb>chief away from him into the passage of a baker's shop—I saw that—a stranger picked it up and brought it to me, after I had secured the prisoner—I had lost sight of it—I saw the colour of it as he threw it down—I was</p>

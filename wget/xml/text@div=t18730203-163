I am on duty in Oxford Street on 15th January, about 11. 15 at night—I saw Joyce outside the Oxford and Cambridge public-house, New Oxford Street, and the corner of Bury Place—I saw Bayes come out of the public-house—he joined Joyce, and they went to the corner of Bloomsbury Market—they stood talking for about a minute, and Bayes left Joyce and went into the Bull and Mouth public-house, in Hart Street—I went in at another door—he called for half-a-pint of stout and mild—he put down a florin—the barman (Disher) served him—I made a sign to him, and he put it on one side—Bayes then staggered as if he were drunk—he drank his beer, walked out, and I saw him run across the road, and he joined Joyce at the corner where he had left her—I saw him place his hands as if he passed something towards her hand—they walked through Bloomsbury Market into Oxford Street and Holborn, turned down Southampton Row to the Turk's Head public-house—they stood for about a minute or so outside, and then Bayes went Inside, leaving Joyce outside—I went in by another (door—I heard fives call for a glass of ale—the landlady served him—he laid down a florin she picked it up—I spoke to her but she did not take any notice—she give him the change from the till—she then came to me—I said, "I believe the piece of coin you just received is a bad one"—she went to the till, took a coin out, and said, "Give me my change back; I just gave you 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, give it me back"—she said to me, "Yes, officer, this is a bad one"—I went and caught hold of him—when she said, "Give me back my change," he put his hand in his pocket and laid it down—he did not say a word—I said, <hi rend="italic">"Fred</hi>, I shall take you in custody for passing counterfeit florins"—he said, "Oh! I dare say you know a lot about it"—the landlady passed the florin to me—I searched him, and found a half-crown and a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—I pro<lb></lb>duce the florin—two gentlemen detained him, and I went to Joyce, who was about 40 yards away—I said, "I shall take you into custody for being concerned with <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi>, just gone in there, whom you left about two minutes ago, for passing a bad florin"—she said, "I have not passed any bad money"—I said, "If you have got any about you give it to me," and she gave me five sixpences, three shillings, which she had in her hand, and 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, all good—I said, "You have something in your mouth, take it out and give it to me"—she put her hand to her mouth and took out If. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. new money, but good—I told her she would have to come to the public-house with me; she did so—I charged her with being concerned with the man—she was searched at the station—1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found on her; she had given up all her money except that—I have seen the two prisoners together many times—on going to the station Bayes said, "You are very clever, you have only got one case against me"—I said, "I believe I can make out three."</p>

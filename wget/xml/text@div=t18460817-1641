                  </hi>. On the 14th of July, between four and five o'clock, I was at the King's Arms public-house, and saw the prisoner with another female—they called for a pint of ale, and afterwards for a second pint—the prisoner then commenced a quarrel with some females—the prosecutor was standing there—the prisoner's sister struck him—he said, "I will not strike you"—the prisoner then struck the prosecutor a blow—she had a key in her hand—whether it was with that or her fist I do not know, but immediately his eye came out—I believe his name was Edward M'Mullin—a policeman was sent for, who took the prisoner—she was drunk, but knew what she was about.</p>

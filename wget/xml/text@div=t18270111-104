I keep the Royal-oak - I saw Madden there about half-past seven o'clock, but did not notice his being asleep - I was in the cellar, my wife called me, and he missed his watch; I pursued the prisoner and Riley (who had just left my house) across the fields - I called to the watchman, but I got up to them first; just before I overtook them, I saw the prisoner put his hand into his pocket - I did not see him pull any thing out; but I brought them both back - they were searched, but nothing found on them - I then took the lantern, and found this watch as near the spot where I took them as possible.</p>

            . I am servant to Gurteen. Madden, the prisoner, and two others, were in the tap-room - I saw the prisoner and Riley come to the bar and say to mistress, "What measures have you got?" she said, "I do not understand you;" Riley and him then went out of the house. Madden complained of losing his watch - my master went out and brought them back - I went and held the lantern, and saw master find this watch in the fields.</p>

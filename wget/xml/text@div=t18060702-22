On the 16th of June the prisoner and her husband, her nephew and his wife, came to my shop all together; the prisoner's husband asked me for a pair of boots, and while I was attending him with the boots, the prisoner moved from the side she first stood and went to the other side where this gown hung; a short interval of time after this she went into the passage, I noticed her staying in the passage; then she went out of the street door; I saw no more of her, her husband bought the boots and paid me for them, and went away; immediately they were gone I missed the gown; after they were gone a pug dog returned into the shop, I had observed that dog in the shop when the man was trying the boots on, I looked at the collar of the dog, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020014"></xptr>found out where the nephew and neice lived.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your property. - A. Yes, I went to this woman's house, I accused her of taking the gown, she after denying it a long time. she opened her drawers and produced the gown; I took possession of the gown and gave her in charge of an officer; I produce the gown, it is mine, there is my private mark on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had drank more than did me good, I did not know that I had the gown, as I sat down I must have taken it up in my petticoats; I told Mr. Kelly as soon as I found it I meant to bring it to him.</p>

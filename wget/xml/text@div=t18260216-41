            . I am clerk to Mr. Reuben Fletcher, a proctor, of Doctors' Commons. Rigaud applied to me on the 21st of September last, to obtain letters of administration to the effects of S. G. Bailward; he brought written instructions, which I produce; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160034"></xptr>>said he came from Mr. Collins, and wanted a commission to be sent, if possible, that day, for the purpose of administering the oath to a party in the country. When I began to prepare the papers I found I had not sufficient particulars, and wrote some queries on the paper which I have produced, and sent them to Mr. Collins' office, and received them, with the answers, on the following morning. In the course of that day Rigaud called, and desired the commission might be sent to him at the Sussex hotel, Bouverie-street. I sent it on the 22d, with the bond and affidavit.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. You have been proctor for Mr. Collins on many occasions? A. Mr. Fletcher has transacted business for him before.</p>

            . I am a proctor. I was absent when these instructions were given. On the 3d of October I received the commission bond and affidavit, swearing the effects under 450l., enclosed in a letter, dated the 2d of October, from the defendant Collins; I had letters of administration extracted in consequence of these documents, and sent them on the 4th or 5th of October, to Mr. Collins, at Captain Rigaud's, post-office, Worthing, enclosed in this letter, (looking at it). On the 27th of October I received instructions from Collins to enter a caveat against any other letters of administration being granted to the effects of Bailward. On the 3d of November I received verbal instructions at my office, from Collins, to take out another commission, to reswear the administratrix under the sum of 18,000l. - and on the 8th of November I delivered that commission to Collins.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you before that received instructions from Rigaud to increase the amount? A. None; it is not unusual to enter a caveat. The great increase of the amount from 450l. to 18,000l., naturally excited my suspicions - and I saw the Bank solicitor between the 3d and 8th of November; I was not desired not to caution Collins about it - but considering our communication was confidential, I did not think myself at liberty to inform Collins; I have done business for him on one other occasion; I live opposite to him - he is a solicitor - I considered him respectable; it is not unusual for strangers to apply for administration, but we generally subject them to inquiry; there is no occasion for an attorney to be engaged.</p>

Mr. Collins called frequently to know whether this claim was in a state of being admitted; I told him from time to time that it was not satisfactory, and further evidence would be required; (looking at four letters), I believe he brought these after I told him that; they were annexed to the first papers - I gave them all to the Bank solicitor, and finally referred him to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Can you tell me at what time you saw Collins? A. The latter end of October - nothing more particular passed; I have no recollection of his saying the parties could all be produced if it was required.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Barwise. I have known Meek since 1820, and frequently had transactions with her - I always knew her by that name; I have seen her write, and had letters from her, upon which I have acted. (The witness here examined an administration bond, signed E. Garner - a petition, some documents, and several letters, signed Garner - the signatures to which he deposed to be in Meek's writing - also the body of the letters.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. How long is it since you saw her write? A. Not since September 1823; here are two E's., the characters of which are different from each other - if I saw the E alone, I might express a doubt about it, but I believe the character of hand-writing to be the same.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Elms, of Great Heene, near Westbury. Rigaud took the house ready furnished, on the 19th of August; Issit, Rigaud, and Baker (who was called Mrs. Rigaud) came first, with a servant boy - Meek came on the Thursday after - they lived very expensive at first - Issit and Meek used to sit with the family; Issit was usually called Mr. I - I thought it was Hie till to-day; I have heard the trades-people in the town use the name of Routledge. Mr. Collins, the defendant, came down on the 29th of September, and staid a week or rather more - all the defendants were in the house that week - they lived in one family; Meek (who passed by the name of Gardner) went to Broadwater with Issit - it is nearly two miles off - the Rev. Mr. Wood lived there: I acted as servant at the house all the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. They walked out together the same as any one else? A. Certainly. The only time I heard the name of Issit was when a Mr. Evans, of Little Hampton, called to see them twice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was not Meek always called Miss G.? A. Always G. or Gardner; they frequently spoke to each other by their initials. I believe Issit passed as Mr. Routledge at Worthing. Mr. Collins came on Michaelmas day - he appeared in health.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not many respectable people visit there? A. Only Mr. Evans, a surgeon. Rigaud had a sister at Little Hampton - she was at Worthing once for the benefit of her health, and Miss Evans, the surgeon's daughter, visited there; the elergyman of Little Hampton dined there once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q. While Mr. Collins was there was Meek called by any other name than Garner? A. No; it was always pronounced with a d; I have seen that on her directions; my master dined there once or twice, seven or eight weeks after they had been there.</p>

            . I am in partnership with my father - we are solicitors to the Bank of England. I received from Mr. Hutchinson the petition, two affidavits, and a letter, dated the 31st of October, signed Collins, enclosing one signed Eliza Garner, and an extract from one signed Green. Mr. Collins called on me on the 3d of November, saying he had been referred to me from the Chief Accountant's office, upon the claim of Miss Garner, as administratrix of Bailward; I told him the Bank required further evidence of the beneficial interest of Miss Garner, and for that purpose required a pedigree of Bailward, vouched by certificates. I shewed him a paper, stating the certificates they required; he said he had seen that at the Bank; and that, from the length of time it was impossible to procure these documents, as it must have been a hundred years since the 'marriage of Bailward's father, or nearly so; he then shewed me a letter signed James Green, stating, that the Bank might as well require the marriage certificates of Adam and Eve. I said it was an impertinent letter, and did not receive it; I told Collins he had better give the best evidence he could. Next day, the 4th, he called on me with a letter signed James Green, which I produce (read).</p>

               <p>This letter was proved to be in Rigaud's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. FRESHFIELD. Collins told me he wanted this letter, as it contained an order for money; I said I would take it over to the Bank and he should have it next morning - but he has never applied for it. On the 5th of November Rigaud called, and said he called from Mr. Collins for an answer to his application; I told him I suppesed he wanted that letter, and offered it to him; he said he did not want that; he was going to Brighton, and should see Miss Garner, and was anxious to take her some good news. I then asked if he knew the lady himself; he said he did - that he had lodged with a Mr. and Mrs. Collins three or four years ago, and that Miss Garner, at that time, lived with a Mrs. Brent, Mrs. Collins' sister - that Mrs. Brent frequently brought Miss Garner over to Collins' house, where he saw her, and he always understood she was entitled to some property from her uncle, when she became of age. I told him one difficulty was we had seen no ostensible person except the solicitor, and, if he knew the lady, personally, he had better put what he had to say<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160036"></xptr>>in writing, and I would communicate it to the Bank; he proposed to make an affidavit - I said a letter would answer all the purpose, and he said he would write from Brighton. I intimated that probably a bond of indemnity might be required; he said he was her bondsman for the administration; I then said, as the Bank were indemnified I did not think a bond would carry it further. I received a letter from him, by post, from Brighton, on Tuesday morning, the 8th of November, and on the 9th Rigaud and Collins called together - I told Rigaud I had received his letter - he did not deny writing it (read, see note A.) On the 9th I saw Collins and Rigaud, and knowing then that instructions had been given for a commission, in order to increase the amount, I told them we had reason to believe there was other property in the same situation, and if so, it was very uncandid to ask the Bank to transfer this without going to the Court of Chancery, on account of the smallness of the sum, when there was considerable property behind; Rigaud immediately exclaimed that he knew of nothing more. I then turned to Collins, and asked if he knew of more? he said he did not, but he supposed we had good information on the subject. I said it was not surmise on our part, and it would be necessary to have it distinctly stated whether there was more property or not, and until that was done we could proceed no further. On the 11th, Rigaud came alone, and produced a letter to me from Collins, enclosing another signed Eliza Garner - (read, note A.) Rigaud stated, that the poor</p>

               <p>DEAR SIR, - In consequence of the conversation that passed between us at your office on Saturday, on my arrival here I called upon Miss Garner, and I cannot recollect any thing more than what I informed you at our interview. I knew Mrs. Robina Brent, about four years ago; she was in the habit of visiting at the house I then boarded at, in the New Kent-road; Miss Garner was also an occasional visitor, and, in the course of conversation, I was ofter informed that she was intitled to some money in the Bank of England, when she was of age to claim it, and that the same was derived from an uncle who died at sea - his name I did not know until lately, when she applied to me to be her bondsman. From what I have ascertained, and what I believe to be the fact, she is the party entitled to the money left by her uncle; indeed so fully convinced am I of her right to the cash in your hands, that I am willing to enter into the security you required, if that will serve her. I will wait on you in the course of Tuesday, as I purpose being in London on that day. I am, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>(signed) F. J. RIGAUD.</p>
               <p>P. S. You will bear in mind that I am only on the half-pay of his Majesty's service.</p>

               <p>SIR:- I have called twice this morning, and waited a considerable time, but have not been fortunate enough to see you. A press of business obliges me to trouble Mr. R. to make the inquiry as to the result of this application. I enclose you a Letter of Miss G.'s, whether it will be of any service or not I do not know. I remain, Sir,</p>

               <p>Nov. 11, 1825.</p>
               <p>MY DEAR, SIR, - I thank you for your Letter received by girl had been racking her brain to find out what other property there could be - he said he supposed there was some 50l. or 100l. more, and it was very hard to keep her out of this property because she could not find that out - he had used nearly the same expressions on the 9th. On Saturday, the 12th, he called again, alone, and said he saw we never should get through this business unless he gave a bond of indemnity, and, to save all further trouble, it might be expressed in the bond, that if there was more property, they should go to Chancery. I asked him to sit down, and write instructions for the bond, which he declined, saying he should remember it very well, and he left. On Monday, the 4th, he brought a letter from Collins, enclosing the draft of a bond of indemnity (read, note C.) I went down to Worthing on the 15th, by the mail, and found Meek living at a house at Great Heene - Eliza Baker, another female, two female servants, and a boy, were also in the house. Meek was taken into custody, and after that some papers were brought to me, half burnt. I insisted on seeing the desk from which they were taken - Baker shewed it me - it is now in court- the initials, F. J. R., are on the brass plate - I found this letter there, which I produce (read, note D.)</p>
               <p>this day's post, though I feel much disappointed; instead of receiving the money, as from our interview on Saturday evening I was led to expect I should, I find there are more queries still to answer, but which I can do in a few words, namely that I am not aware of there being more money in the Bank of England, placed there by my late uncle, than what I have laid claim to, and I trust the gentlemen of that establishment will put me in possession of my just rights - you know my situation is very different to what it was during my uncle's life time. Do pray see the gentlemen, and use all your influence with them, for the little I now have will soon be expended, and after that how am I to return to the Continent. I shall be most anxious till I have your reply to this. Give my kind love to my friend Mrs. B., and believe me yours truly. (Signed) E. GARNER.</p>
               <p>Brighton, Nov. 9, 1825.</p>
               <p>Since I wrote I open the letter to say that I have received a letter from Mrs. B., in which she has given me a particular commission, therefore I shall send a parcel immediately to your solicitor.</p>
               <p>(C.) Re-Bailward.</p>
               <p>SIR, - I send you the bond hastily prepared from the vague instructions I have received through Mr. R. I presume, however, it will answer the purpose; you will make what alteration you think proper. I am going out of my usual mode in signing a bond for my clients - but if this is insisted on, rather than Miss G. should be put to the expense and delay of applying to Chancery for so small a sum, I will do it. I think you should be content with Miss G's. bond. Perhaps you will be able to look at the draught while Mr. R. waits, as every day is of importance after the delay which has taken place.</p>
               <p>12th of November, 1825. JOHN COLLINS.</p>
               <p>(D.) Heene, Friday.</p>
               <p>DEAR R.: - I hasten to answer your letter of yesterday's date and to acknowledge the documents, but I shall not proceed in them until I see you, as under present circumstances the introduction of my name would be imprudent, and, in fact, I have not the means of carrying the expenses,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160037"></xptr>>Prisoner RIGAUD. Q. Pray what charge had you against me when you took my desk? A. A charge of being concerned in taking out false letters of administration. Bishop, the officer, had a warrant against you - there was a warrant by a Sussex Magistrate. I had no search warrant; I took the desk upon my own responsibility: you always represented yourself to me as an half-pay officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you know Mr. Collins when he called on you? A. I knew he was an attorney. There was about eight years interest due on</p>
               <p>which will necessarily accrue in the completion; therefore I think it the most advisable to wait your arrival, and I trust we shall see you on Monday afternoon. The recent affairs, which the Papers have themed with, must cause great agitation in a certain quarter, and caution must follow, as a matter of course; the late "Decision" carries fully the appearance you hint at. I am fearful some screw is loose in Oxford-street. You acted very judiciously in the matter, and, of course, you will not repeat your visit there. I am hurt to hear your half-pay is under stoppage, and that you are hard up. I cannot state positively the time of S. G. B's death, or where he was buried, but from what I have been able to glean, St. Martin's, about 1809 or 1810. I was aware that no will or administration had been granted, and I told you so. I am glad to hear Margaret's affairs are proceeding in. Mrs. R. is going to Hampton this afternoon, by invitation, and will return on Monday, and she will take charge of any letter for E. B. You had better call on Watts, and make some excuse, which surely your fertile brain is capable of, for I think him a host with us. When - last was at Brighton I saw a fellow I did not wish, so you can take a trip over with Betsey, and do the needful there, as she is willing to go into it. I like the letter D being out. Mrs. R. desires me to say, with her love, that as your stay will be so short in London she shall not forward the things you wanted, but fully expects to see you at home on Monday. How will you manage at the Sussex unless you are able to raise the wind - if it will not be inconvenient to you send down those clothes of mine, or bring them with you; that tailor surely would not stand tick. Now, in case your friend Collins comes down, would it not be better for him and you to see the affair Betsey has to do, completed at Brighton, as every caution must be observed throughout our multifarious transactions. Have you been able to get the Richmond's completed. I am glad our sable friend is to be soon related to a fair dame of yours, name Collins; our larder is well supplied, and I wish I could say as much for my purse and our wine cellar - they are to let, unfurnished - however, the hare will come very acceptable, and shall wait your arrival to wash it down with a glass of port. I hope your friend Collins will breech you before you leave London, as we shall be queered - for 5s. is all our stock, and black Monday will soon arrive - however, d - n all gloom, Expecting to hear on Sunday, I am yours, faithfully.</p>
               <p>You have neglected to name our friend Mr. Collins was to inquire about, at Whitchall - "the seven years." No letters from our correspondent in reply to those you took to London.</p>
               <p>Call at the post-office in Dorking, and ask for letters for A. B. C., and also call at the post-office at Mickleham, and inquire for Captain Kent.</p>
               <p>To Captain Rigaud, Sussex-hotel, Bouverie-street, Fleet-street, London. this sum. The Bank would not transfer that sum alone, having more. Mr. Fletcher came to me about the 5th of November - I saw Mr. Collins once after that - I did not caution him about it. I think Rigaud proposed that Collins should enter into the bond - I did not press him for the bond - I will not swear that I did not propose Collins signing the bond - it was our business, as solicitors, to draw the bond, but considering it useless myself, I had no wish to have it. On the 3d of November I asked Collins if he knew any thing of the parties; he said they were introduced to him by a friend; he did not name Rigaud since this charge; he has said he only knew them by being introduced by Rigaud; I saw him on the 3d or 4th of November; I did not then know Rigaud; I saw Collins again on the 9th - no such communication took place then. I went to Worthing on the 15th, and obtained a warrant against Collins that day - there were two warrants - I filled up one, and the clerk of the office the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Charging Collins with conspiracy, and gave it to the officer to bring him to the office on that charge? A. Yes: Mr. Hall, the Magistrate, certainly never told me the warrant was given on an understanding that it was not to be executed; if it was said it was in my absence. I know Collins was discharged - I told him at the office I had a charge of felony against the others, and did not wish to enter into the conspiracy - he said he was very unwilling to have his name mixed up with them, and whatever information he could give, without violating his professional duty, he would; he called on me twice afterwards - I told him it must be distinctly understood I could make no promise beyond this, that any thing he said to me should be confidential, and should never be given in evidence against him - he did not ask for that promise - I know he requested an interview with the Governor of the Bank. When this bill was found he wrote to me to know what bail should he put in.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Burton, a gunpowder manufacturer. I have had transactions with Issit, seen him write, and had his acceptances - I have had forty or fifty letters from him - the letter to Mr. Freshfield, signed Rigaud, is in a disguised hand, but I think it is Issit's writing - it is extremely like it - I believe both letters to be his writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you believe the direction of this one to be his? A. The hand is disguised if it is; I saw him write last in 1823.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Window, an army agent, and have frequently seen Rigaud write; (looking at two letters, signed James Green) I believe both these to be Rigaud's writing, and the signature to be his. (One of these letters is that set out in page 171 The following documents were here read).</p>
               <p>The instructions for the affidavit, and the petition of Eliza Garner, of Great Heene,niece and administratrix to samuel Groome Bailward, to the Governor and Company of the Bank of England - stating that she had lately become of age praying for the transfer of the property to her; to this was annexed an affidavit, purporting to be sworn by Robina Brent, widow of Captain William Brent, of the United States' army - deposing, that in 1809, Samuel Groome Bailward called at her house in Church-street, Philadelphia, where she kept a school, and placed Eliza-Garner under her care, and contracted to pay for the same for two years and a half - and on his leaving Philidelphia for Quebec, he paid her one year in advance - that she had not seen him since, but was informed by a letter from Mr. James Green, that Mr. Bailward died on his passage to England in 1814 - that Eliza Garner continued to reside with her till within the last two months - when, from her ill-health, she had gone to the sea-side - also an affidavit purporting to be sworn by James Green, of Camden-terrace, Camden-town, deposing, that in 1814, he embarked with Samuel Groome Bailward for England, and that Mr. Bailward died on his passage - also an affidavit, made by Elizaa Garner prior to the administration being grandted, describing her as residing at No. 45, Portman-place, New-road.</p>

            . I am a clergyman, and live at Broadwater, near Worthing. on the 30th of September last I received a note, and appointed to be at home at ten o'clock next morning; I do not know the date - this bond was then executed by a person calling herself Eliza Garner - there was a man with her; I have attested her signature, and as such, I conceive I administered the oath to her - I do not remember it, but have no doubt of it. The commission directs me to administer the oath; I do not think that I did adminster it; I have certainly attested the oath, but cannot declare that I gave her the oath - and yet it is not likely that I should attest it without I swore her - a solicitor generally comes with these matters. I do think I administered the oath, but cannot be positive; there is a fee of 10s. or 10s. 6d., for administering the oath - I received that fee, which I should not do without swearing the person. On the 12th of November a servant boy brought me a note, signed Eliza Garner - I cannot find that note; I sent a verbal answer by him to Miss Garner, that I should be at home at the time she wished, which was half-past five o'clock - at which time I had the Rev. Mr. Davison in my room, also a clerk of Mr. Freshfield's. Eliza Garner, as she called herself, came; I believe it was Meek, although she is now much altered; I asked her what she came for - she produced a bond and an authority to swear her, and attest what she brought - I looked at it and handed it to Mr. Davison, saying, "My eyes are not very good, I wish you to see what this contains" - he read it over, and said the signatures are put to it, which ought not to be there; she said she knew nothing about it, that she was directed to come for me to attest her signature - I did not remember her, but I said, "I think you were here some time before on business of this nature?' she said she was; I returned her papers, refusing to attest them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Your receiving the fee makes you think you swore the party? A. I do not conceive I should receive it without swearing ber, as it is for administering the oath, not for signing my name; it took place in my dining-room, at ten o'clock in the morning. I remember having the fee perfectly well, as I applied it to a found I was raising to improve my chancel; the man paid it to me, I am certain; I do not think I have administered an oath since - it is a very rare thing with me. When she came on the second occasion she had a bonnet and veil on - she kept her veil down all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she kiss the book? A. She was not sworn that time.</p>

            . I am a clergyman, and live at Worthing. I was at Mr. Wood's house on Saturday, the 12th of November, between five and six o'clock, when a person, calling herself Miss Garner came - she was alone, but said a person was waiting for her at the gate; Mr. and Mrs. Wood, Miss King, Mr. Jeffrey, and I were in the room; she produced a document from the Prerogative Court; Mr. Wood desired me to read it over - he said, "I think, when you were here before, there was some person with you" - she said there was; I said there were two names signed to the bond, and as those persons were not present Mr. Wood could not attest it; he asked her how that happened - she said she was unacquainted with the matter - the paper had been sent to her from London. I believe the prisoner Meek to be the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you ever<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160039"></xptr>seen her before? A. No; she wore a large leghorn bonnet - she had a veil; I think it was a black one; her countenance was quite clear to me, I am certain of that. To the best of my belief she drew her veil aside.</p>
               <p>THE REV. MR. WOOD re-examined. I believe her veil was down all the time. When she came in the fire was stirred, and candles snuffed; I was anxious to discover her countenance, as I had heard something irregular was going on.</p>
               <p>Mr. DAVISON. When she entered the room, to the best of my recollection, her veil was down. I sat opposite her - Mr. Wood was at her side; she did not put her veil up, but drew it on one side; her face was partly exposed to me, but not to Mr. Wood; the veil was between him and her. We were desirous of seeing her countenance, and the fire was stirred, and candles placed, so that we should have a full view of her; we had agreed, before she came, to ask if she had been there before; we had a good deal of conversation with Mr. Jeffrey.</p>

Freshfields, and was at Mr. Wood's on the 12th of November; I had been sent down to make inquiry - Meek was announced at Mr. Wood's, by the name of Garner, and I believe Mr. Wood asked her if her name was Garner - I understood her to say "Yes, I was here in September with Captain Rigaud."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who suggested the question? A. I had suggested it previously; I talked the affair over with Mr. Davison, but not with Mr. Wood.

On the Saturday before Meek was apprehended I went to Mr. Wood's with a note; Mrs. Rigaud, or Miss Gardner, gave it to me; I took it to Mr. Wood - he said he should be at home; I gave that answer to Mr. Issit, and between six and seven o'clock in the evening Issit and Miss Gardner went out, towards Mr. Wood's. I was present when Miss Gardner was apprehended, and took a desk produced out of the parlour, by Mrs. Rigaud's (Baker's) direction - she opened it, and gave me some papers, telling me to burn or bury them; I put two on the fire - my fellow-servant took them off.</p>

               <p>RIGAUD'S Defence. Gentlemen of the Jury, I have been four times at the bar, prosecuted by the Bank of England, under prosecutions arising out of the same circumstances - I can only positively deny that ever I wrote a letter in any other name than my own, and every witness that has appeared in the box has witnessed that I never went by any other name; thus giving every clue to find me. - Mr. Freshfield knows that I told him when I suggested a bond, (which he urged me to sign), that it was ridiculous for him to desire me, who was but a half-pay officer, to sign a bond for 500l., and he said, "You will find out that Lord Palmerston will stop your half-pay if you don't." I know nothing about the transaction. I trust, if I do not call witnesses to charactor, you will consider that I have been months in prison, and I have not 1s.; I have exhausted every 1d. I have in the world; if I have not called persons it is for want-of means, and that is the only reason. I have stood here four times - and this I hope will be the very last.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, I was sent for; I went into the shop, and the prisoner was there; they charged him with stealing a watch, I searched him, and I found this chain on him in his breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Court to Fitzgerald. Is that yours? - I know the mark on the paper.</p>
               <p>Court to Thomlinson. Is that the chain you shewed him? - I believe it is one of them by the writing; this is not the chain that was put with the watch.</p>

               <p>I did not offer to take the watch to defraud the gentleman of it; I went out to make water, and I wanted to ease myself; I have been in America this eight years; I was going to receive eight guineas and a half that night; they took my pocket-book, and all my prize-money and wages; I intended to have returned the watch when I came back; I have no witnesses. I was wounded in the head with three buck shot in America with my Lord Cornwallis, in five different places; I came home last November; at the full of the moon I am distracted in my head.</p>
               <p>Court to Fitzgerald. What is the value of that watch and chain? - I should not chuse to sell it under three guineas though I valued it only at 30 s.</p>
               <p>Mr. Akerman. My Lord, ever since the prisoner has been in gaol he has had all the appearance of insanity.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you will acquit him, to be sure, Gentlemen.</p>

On the 15th of January I went into a public-house with these articles all in a bag; I had just bought them - the prisoner stood by the fire; I put the bag down by my side - I waited there for Cullen - then went out to look for him, and saw him in the street; I put the bag at the door; and while I was talking to Cullen, the prisoner came out, took hold of it, and said "I'll give you a lift;" I said, "I can lift them myself;" Cullen went in; I just turned my head, and missed the prisoner and bag; I found the prisoner two hours after in another public-house, between two women - I asked what he had done with my bag; he said if I would go with him he would give it me - he had only put it down; we went with him to several places - but have not got any of the property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not the landlord turn you out of the house, bag and all? A. No; I was as sober as I am now. The street-keeper was sent for.</p>

Hughes said he had been robbed - I saw the prisoner standing by the fire - he came to the door; I saw Hughes with this bag; I went in, and the prisoner ran off with the bag; we found him in a public-house; he said it was all humbug, and took us to a chandler's shop, and several places, and wanted to leave us - the street-keeper took him - Hughes was sober. - (Both these witnesses were evidently much inebriated when giving their evidence.)</p>

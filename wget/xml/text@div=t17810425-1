My house was broke open in the night of the 30th or 31st of March; I heard nothing of it till I was called up at a little after eight o'clock; I then came down stairs: I found the upper sash of the kitchen window was forced down; and it was so fast that it could not be got up again without sending for a carpenter; the window had an inside shutter, to which there was a slight wooden bar; a pane of glass was broke in the window, which enabled the person to undo the bar. I lost the plate mentioned in the indictment from the sideboard in the back-parlour; I found this odd stocking (producing it) in the drawer of my dressing-room, which is the place where my stockings are always kept; I understand the fellow stocking to this was found in the prisoner's lodging-room.</p>

               <p>At what time did you go to bed the night before? - At half after ten o'clock; I shut and barred up that kitchen window before I went up stairs; I left a man and woman servant in the kitchen when I went to bed.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I have here three pair of silk and one pair of cotton stockings, and an odd silk stocking (producing them); I found them, on Sunday the 1st of April, in a room up two pair of stairs forward at No. 5, in Coventry-court in the Haymarket; they were all in a cupboard, except the odd stocking, which lay on the floor; I asked the prisoner who they belonged to: he said they were his property, and he begged I would leave them behind.</p>
               <p>What was your business at this place? - There was an information came to the office against the prisoner and some others: I knocked at the door at about eight o'clock in the morning, and was let in; I went up to the two pair of stairs, I knocked at the door; a girl in her shift and under petticoat opened the door to me; I went into that room, and from thence into the back-room; there I found the prisoner a-bed: when the prisoner begged me to leave them behind, I told him I should take the stockings away, and if they were not owned he should have them back again: he was asked before the justice, where he got these things? he said he bought them of a Jew in Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>Are there different lodgers in this house? - There was only a woman with a child in the garret. I searched the rest of the house, but did not find any thing.</p>
               <p>Was there any other person in the room besides the prisoner? - Only the girl that opened the door to me.</p>
               <p>Who lodged in the room in which the stockings were found? - There was no bed in the fore-room; the bed was in the back-room.</p>
               <p>Did you find the room forward open or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250004"></xptr> locked? - It was locked. The woman that was with him opened the fore-door, and then I went into the back-room, where the bed was; I made the prisoner get up, and come into the fore-room to dress himself. The back-room opens only into the fore-room; there is not, to my knowledge, any door from the back-room to the staircase.</p>
               <p>Mr. Woodgate. This odd stocking I saw at the justice's, and it matches exactly with the stocking I have in my pocket; they are both marked with the initial of my name, W.</p>
               <p>Do you know whose work the mark is? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon you to swear to the stocking? - Yes, and the other stockings too; they have been tumbling about my drawer these seven years; the other stockings are likewise marked, W; I am perfectly satisfied they are mine.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find your plate? - No; I never found any thing but these stockings.</p>

               <p>I live at No. 5, Coventry-court. Mr. Jealous came to my house on the Sunday morning: my servant came down into the kitchen where I lay, and waked me; she told me some men were making a noise at the two pair of stairs door: I ran up stairs.</p>
               <p>Whose apartment was that? - The apartment of a woman called

               <p>Jones, the prisoner, was found in the room on the Sunday morning? - Yes, so I find; but I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Then you do not know that the prisoner was in the house before that Sunday? - I never saw him before. Hunter said she had an husband, or some acquaintance, who was a silversmith or something, I don't know what she called him; but I never saw the prisoner till he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Did you know that any man was in that room? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You know nothing about these stockings? - I saw them when they were taken out of the place, I never saw them before.</p>

               <p>Jealous. He said before the justice, he bought the stockings of a Jew; Mr. Woodgate heard him.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Woodgate. Did you hear that? - I did.</p>
               <p>To Jealous. When did he say he bought them? - On the Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have been to sea. I was an attorney's clerk. I was going down the Haymarket; this woman asked me to go home with her; I went home with her, and slept with her; in the morning Jealous came up, put a pistol to my head, and took me out of bed: I said I was ready to go with him. He searched the room, and brought these stockings out of the cupboard; I said, do not take any thing there, for they may be my stockings.</p>

I received information, from a neighbour, that the prisoner was in the habit of laying out a great deal of money, in halfpence, at his shop for goods. We paid her in no halfpence. She was ordered to scour the top of the counter, which she did every day; and this she did with her left hand, and dropped her right hand into the till. My son saw her doing it. He came and accused her. She seemed to hesitate. I followed him into the shop, and told her, if she had done it, to deliver up the halfpence immediately. She took one handful out and laid it on the counter. She then took another handful out. I took the halfpence and put them into a measure, and sent for an officer. I asked her, if she had taken any more halfpence? she said she had, and spent them. The officer searched her box, and found a great many things which had been purchased with my halfpence. Seven shillings of halfpence, and one penny, she took out of her pocket herself.</p>

            . I was sitting in the parlour in a situation that I could see the prisoner. I saw, that while she was scouring our counter with her left hand, she put her hand twice into the till, drew it out and put it into her pocket; then I heard the jingle of halfpence, as if two handfuls had fallen into her pocket. She shut the till. I went into the shop, and told her, she had taken halfpence. She seemed agitated. I called my father; he came, and the prisoner took the halfpence out of her pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. May it please your Lordship, I have but little to say in my defence. I, therefore, beg to throw myself on the mercy of the court. I feel bitter sorrow and repentance for the disgrace I have brought on myself, and can say, I was never suspected of being guilty of the like. I lived seven years in my last place. I humbly beg to assure your Lordship, that if I should experience the lenity of the court, I shall labour to regain my character, and never offend more.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

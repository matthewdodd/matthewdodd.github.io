               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. How long have you known this girl? A. She first came to us between seven and eight years ago, and was then with us a short time - she was first employed as a needle-woman, and then for a month as nursery-maid; she had not been a servant more than a fortnight; I cannot say when these articles were taken, but I should think while she was in the nursery - she was at work before at 6d. a day, but I should think these things were not taken then, as she had not access to the room - I saw a lady, named

            . This is my muff and tippet; I believe I gave nine guineas for the two - I never gave them to the prisoner; this frock is my own work - I never gave that to the prisoner; I was never in the Portugal hotel, and never heard it named till the prisoner named it - I had an infant about three years and a half old at Christmas last.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hire the prisoner? A. Yes, at her own solicitation, as a needle-woman, at 6d. a day; I then engaged her as nursery-maid, at the same wages my former nursery maid had - I did not give her any clothes then, but when she was first recommended to me, seven or eight years ago, I gave her some of the child's clothes - I had not given her any thing the last time, nor did she ask for any - there was nothing given her by me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You gave her some child's clothes seven years ago? A. Yes, and some for herself, but this frock was not then made - I made this either two or four years ago, and I had given nothing to the prisoner in the interval.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. On the Tuesday, before she was taken, did she not come to your house? A. She never came to my house to my knowledge - I never saw her with a muff and tippet similar to this; I know them by them hooks and eyes, which I sewed on, and by a little piece which had been torn out, and I mended.</p>

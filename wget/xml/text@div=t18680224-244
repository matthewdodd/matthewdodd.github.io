                  </hi>. I am warehouseman and manager to Mrs. Burt, of 10, Aldermanbury; she is in the stuff and fancy dress trade—on the 31st January last, the prisoner came into the warehouse, in the usual way that he had done many times before, and said, "I have called for a sheet of goods for Mr. Johnson"—I gave it to him; it contained fancy mohair dresses, about 1280 yards, to the amount of about 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him the goods, because we had been in the habit of doing it for years in that way to carriers—Johnson is our carman, and has been for years—he sends his man round to inquire if we have got goods, and in the afternoon he sends for them and we deliver them, with an invoice and a note for the customer to sign—I never saw these goods again.</p>

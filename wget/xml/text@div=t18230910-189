I saw this property on the night of the 9th of July; Bray had been in the habit of coming to our house daily to receive goods, and by that means became acquainted with the house - I heard he had been sleeping in the church-yard for six weeks; I had intended to send him to India. On coming down stairs on the morning of the 10th of July to breakfast, I missed the property - I found somebody had got down the grating and through the wash-house window, and taken them from the kitchen - I found the kitchen poker had been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100083"></xptr>used to break open a pannel. I missed the articles stated in the indictment. In the evening the constable brought Bray to me; he denied the charge. I know nothing of Austin.</p>

            . I live in East-street, Manchester-square; Austin came to me at eight o'clock one morning, and brought 1 3/4 lbs. of rags, which I gave him 7 d. for; I did not particularly notice them, as I was feeding a young child - but when I opened them, they appeared linen torn up. I knew his parents, who lived fourteen years in the neighbourhood. Mrs. Maxwell claimed them.</p>

He then asked me to give him a piece of bread for them, which I did. I kept them in my pocket till I heard of his being taken up; I then went to Mrs. Maxwell, and gave them to her.</p>

            . I am a constable; I apprehended Bray; Austin was brought to the office by his brother. I took Bray in Conway-court, close by Mary-le-bone Office; I told him it was for stealing things of Mrs. Maxwell; he made no answer. I found a pair of stockings on his feet, which Mrs. Maxwell claimed. I examined the premises; the persons had got down the grating into the area and into the wash-house, by breaking a square of glass, and sliding the window back; the poker was bent, and part of the pannel broken out of the door, so that he could get into the kitchen. Bray directed me next morning to Thompson's, where I found the rag. I found a table-cloth, two napkins, and a tea-spoon, at Austin's mother's.</p>
               <p>MRS. MAXWELL. The property is mine. The rags are a table-cloth which we had used the day before; it was too good to tear up.</p>

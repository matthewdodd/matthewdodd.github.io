                  </hi>. I am landlord of the King's Head public-house, Crown-Street, Oxford-street—on 8th September, about 8 in the evening, the prisoner came for a pint of ale, and gave half a crown in payment—I gave her change and put the half-crown in the till; there was no other there—directly after drinking the ale she went out—about five or ten minutes after<lb></lb>wards I went to the till, took out the half-crown, and thinking it looked bad, tried it in the detector; it bent directly—I put it aside on the top of the spirit cask; I afterwards gave it to the policeman—on the Tuesday follow<lb></lb>ing, the 16th, the prisoner came again, about 2 o'clock in the morning; the house was closed then, but she begged me to let her have some gin and I did—I knew her again when she came in—what she had came to 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; she gave me a five-shilling piece; I tried it in the detector, but could not bend it readily, and thought it was good—I gave her 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change; directly after she was gone I tried it again and found it was bad—I sent for a con<lb></lb>stable and gave it to him; as I was telling him about it outside the front-door, the prisoner came in sight—I went up to her and said, "You recollect coming for some gin five or ten minutes back?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "And you recollect giving me a five-shilling piece; is this the one?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "Are you aware that it is a bad one?"—she said, "No, I knew nothing at all about that"—I said, "Well, it is a bad one, and if you like to give me the difference I will say no more about it"—she said, no, she would be d—d if she would do that, and I gave her into custody.</p>

I have lately been discharged as a seaman from one of her Majesty's ships—I met the prisoner on the Tuesday morning, a little after 2 o'clock—she asked me to have something to drink, I went with her, and when we came in sight of the King's Head we saw the landlord and the policeman—she made a sort of stop, and said, "Oh, that is where I passed the bad crown"—she then walked on, and the landlord stopped her.</p>

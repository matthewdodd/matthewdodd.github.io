                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Michael Barnard—he lives at No. 24, Old Bailey. On the 24th of June, about three o'clock, I was in St. Paul's Churchyard, with my niece and daughter—I stopped to look into a shop window—I had a purse in my pocket, containing two sovereigns, one half-sovereign, nineteen shillings, a fourpenny piece, and a half-crown—I was pointing to an article, and felt the weight of the purse go—I took my dress, found the purse was gone, turned, and saw the two prisoners together, twenty or thirty yards from me, passing the Chapter-house—one's hand was in the hand of the other—that induced me to run after them—I ran, and before I overtook them they set off running, the moment they were satisfied that there was something in the purse—they ran together, and turned into a court which leads into Paternoster-row—they then divided—this is my purse—it has more money in it now than I lost.</p>

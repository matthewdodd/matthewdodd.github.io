                  </hi>. I live at Battersea, and am a shoemaker—the prisoner worked for me, and had been lodging with me a week—he slept in the opposite room to us, up-stairs—between three and four o'clock in the morning of 7th Jan. I heard a noise in the kitchen, opened the door, and called "Roberts!"—he said, "Yes, Sir"—I asked what time it was—he said, "Past six"—I thought he was going to light the fire, as he had done before—I went to bed again—I still heard a noise—I got up, and said, "Roberts, are you off?"—he said, "Yes," and ran off with a bag in his hand—I got on a few things, and went after him—I gave notice to the constable—I afterwards saw the constable in possession of these boots and other articles, and claimed them as mine—some were missed from the front-kitchen and some from the back—these are articles which I used in my trade—they were lost from the place where I and the prisoner worked.</p>

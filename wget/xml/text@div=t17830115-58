               <p>I am a patrol belonging to St. Martin's; I had charge of the prisoner only; we went out, six or more; he sent for his sister, and as we were conveying him to the watch-house; the watchman said, here is money dropping, and I caught hold of his sister's hand, which was clinched fast; she flipped her hand, and got it to her bosom; I shook her, and there was money dropped; I cannot say what it was, I believe there might be six guineas; we took him and her into the house; when we took her back, the landlady went to search her, and she took her bosom and shook it, and out dropped seven more guineas.</p>
               <p>Are you sure these seven guineas dropped from her? - They were picked up in the tap room; I cannot say whether they dropped from her bosom; I believe they came from her.</p>
               <p>The people were all there? - Yes, there were four women, and they were all searched.</p>
               <p>Court to Langley. Did you search the prisoner thoroughly? - Yes, and even his hair.</p>
               <p>Then where could he hide this money? I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was this before the sister was sent for? Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the sister and he in private after she came? - No.</p>
               <p>Had she been there that night before? - No.</p>
               <p>You did not see the seven guineas drop from the sister's bosom? - No.</p>
               <p>MARCOM M'GIBBINS.</p>
               <p>I am one of the patrol; I took the prisoner out of the house; I saw him drop no money, but I heard some drop: there was plenty of people; I cannot tell who the money dropped from; I reckon it dropped between him and his sister: but there was a multitude besides.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. If you think there is any occasion gentlemen, I will put the prisoner on his defence; but I do not think there is.</p>

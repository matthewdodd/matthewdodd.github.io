            . I am ten years old; my father lives in Bishopsgate-street; he sent me to Redcross-street, with some bonnets; as I returned, the prisoner came up to me, and said, How fast you walk, I saw you go into Mrs. Frost's (where I had left the bonnets). She said she had a beautiful doll for me at home, and she must have the handkerchief off my neck to put it in. She took me up some courts into a dark passage, then took the handkerchief off my neck, and ran away; I pursued, but lost sight of her. I had been walking with her nearly half an hour. Next night I saw her at the corner of Chapel-street, Grubb-street. I pointed her out to my father and mother, who were with me. I am sure she is the woman.</p>

            . I live in Sandy's-street, Bishopsgate. I sent my daughter to Redcross-street about eight o'clock in the evening; she returned at half-past nine, o'clock crying very much, and said a girl had taken her handkerchief. Next night she pointed the prisoner out to me in Grubb-street. I told her, if she did not deliver the handkerchief, I would have her taken into custody. She denied it. I got an officer, and we found her at home.</p>

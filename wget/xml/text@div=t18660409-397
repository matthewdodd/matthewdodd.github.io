               <p>Rowland (Policeman.) I was watching Mr. Nash's premises—he is a charcoal dealer, of 119, Newgate-street—Spring and Ashley were employed there—I saw Ashley bring out two bags of charcoal at a few minutes past 8—the shutters were up, but the door was open—he took them into Davis's, a charcoal-dealer and stove-manufacturer, next door—I stopped him, and from what he said to me, I went into the shop and saw Davis, in the first-floor back room—I said, "Did Mr. Nash's man bring anything in here?"—he said, "No"—I said, "I am pretty sure he did; I saw him bring two full sacks of something, and I must have them"—he hesitated some minutes, and then said, "There is one of them," pointing behind the door of the room—I asked him where the other was—he said, I hope you are not going to make a job of this"—I said, "I must have the other sack"—he pointed into the passage, and said, "There it is"—I went and spoke to Spring, and then returned to Davis's place, and told him I should take him in custody—he said, "I should like to know what you are going to say about this matter?"—I said, "The truth"—I took him to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186604090096"></xptr>
               <p>the station—he beckoned me to him, and said that he wished to speak to me—I went to him—he applied his head to my ear, and said, "Do the best you can for me, and I will give you a half-sovereign"—the bag I found at Davis's contained about a bushel and a-half of charcoal, value about seven shillings—he said he had given the full value for it; he had ordered some, but had got none—I afterwards searched the place, and found four other sacks full of charcoal, one with Mr. Nash's name on it—I was present when Childs searched the premises—he found two empty sacks with Mr. Nash's name on them—some of them were stored away under a flue in the same room—some were concealed, and some were not—some laid under a form.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you say before the Magistrate, "I found in Davis'a place four other bags of charcoal?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was not asked how many of them were concealed—I found twelve sacks in Davis's place under the flue, and four empty sacks, which were not concealed, under a bench—I had found them before I was examined before the Magistrate—I did not say they were concealed—I believe Davis deals in charcoal—I was not in uniform, but he knew I was a detective—after we got to the station, he asked me to go and get bail for him—that was after he put his head to my ear—he asked me to ask the inspector whether he could have bail—I did so—he did not offer me anything for it—he said, "Do the best you can, and I will give you a half-sovereign"—I believe what he meant was that I was to forsake my duty—I told the inspector that he told me he would give me a half-sovereign—I have been in the force about fifteen years—I told the inspector that I saw Ashley bring in two full sacks—I do not remember warning Davis—he said, "I hope you are not going to make a job of it," without my saying a word.</p>
               <p>——<hi rend="smallCaps">HOWELL</hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Nash, of 119, Newgate-street—Spring and Ashley have been in their employ, one twelve and the other fifteen years—he had had no business transactions with Davis—these two bags of charcoal belong to him—we always have a large stock on the premises, to which Spring and Ashley had access—they were not permitted to purchase charcoal, and had no right to remove it from the premises—I had not given them instructions for two bags to be taken to Davis—I left the premises as near eight o'clock as possible—we generally close about eight—the shutters were up—the business is really over when the counting-house is closed—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of Mr. Nash's bags; each bag is worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and contains 30lbs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you the management of the entire establish<lb></lb>ment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I come in the morning between nine and ten; the estab<lb></lb>lishment opens at eight—we had perfect confidence in Spring and Ashley—some of our old sacks get out into the country—we seal all our sacks—5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is the retail price—the wholesale price is a trifle less—I do not know whether there are any seals on the top of this bag—the seal is across the lacing.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose that keeps the charcoal tight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Spring and Ashley had no authority to sell charcoal; they had orders to deliver—if they supplied an order to any one after I left they would make a return to me next morning—Davis was not on my books at all.</p>

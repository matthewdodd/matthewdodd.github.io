            . I had an occasion to step out, so desired him to take care of my things, which were the goods mention'd in the indictment, tied up in a handkerchief. I was out about a dozen minutes, and when I returned Mr. Owen was not there. I met the prisoner coming out as I went in at the door. I call'd to the landlady to know where my friend was, who said he was gone into the kitchen. He came to me. I ask'd him where my handkerchief was. He said the man that had been there must have it. The landlady said he had just flung down 3 d. for his liquor and went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the tap-room before you went out?</p>
               <p>Ballit. There was nobody in the tap room but my friend, I, and the prisoner. I advertised the goods, and Mr. Wilmot, in St. Bride's Alley, sent for me, and told me he had heard of my goods, and knew the man that had been at his house to pawn them, but he did not take them in; so I went and took him up, and carried him before my Lord-mayor, where he confessed the taking of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words he made use of?</p>
               <p>Ballit. He said he was at the house, and seeing them lie there, and knowing they were not the landlord's property, he thought he might take them as well as any body else.</p>

He came to my shop one Saturday morning and said he had found something, but he did not know what it was. I looked at them and found they were a parcel of spectacles. I went and fetch'd another man that was a branch of the trade, who look'd at them, and advised us to let them alone till the Monday following, to see whether they would be advertised. On the Monday the prisoner said they are not advertised, and as I want some money, we will pawn them till we can hear farther about them. I went with the young man to Mr. Wilmot, but he did not chuse to take them in; then we went to another pawnbroker and pawn'd some of them in the prisoner's name for 12 s.

Mr. Wigget said, my friend has had the luck to find these things, and produced them; you are a judge of them, be so good as to tell us what they are worth. I advised them not to part with them, but stay and see if they were advertised. On the Monday they told me they were not advertised, and ask'd me to go along with them to pawn them. We all three went, but at the pawnbroker's door the prisoner made an excuse to go away about some business, and said he'd come to us at Mr. Wigget's house.

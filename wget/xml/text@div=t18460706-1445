On the 18th of Jane the prisoner came to the house, about two or three o'clock—when this occurred his wife was up stairs fastening my dress—she remained in the room a very few minutes—she went into the back parlour, and then into the front kitchen—when she had been there a few minutes I beard a screaming; I did not hear any words—I went down immediately—I was very much frightened and agitated—I saw blood running from, the bottom of my sister's clothes—she ran up into the second-floor room, and came down again—I did not tee a knife, I was so agitated—I said to the prisoner, "You have killed Lucy"—he did not make any answer—when she came down again she fainted—there was a very great deal of blood—the knives we had used for dinner were all in the back kitchen, on the table—I believe there was a carving-knife among them—when I next saw the prisoner he was coming from one kitchen into the other—I said nothing more than I said before, that I thought he had killed Lucy—he said nothing—I do not remember his taking a chair—I was very much agitated, and ran up and down stairs to her assistance—I do not remember hearing him say anything to me—there was blood all up the stain—my sister ran up stairs, came down again, and fainted.</p>

               <p>I was called in to see the prosecutrix—I found her lying on the ground, in a very alarming state—she had received very severe injuries, which had caused very great haemorrage—the injury was in the vagina and in the perinaeum—it had been caused by a stab from some sharp instrument—the perinaeum was cut through, and the wall of the vagina—I imagine it entered from the peri-naeum under the vagina—it was a very dangerous wound, about three inches deep—the immediate danger was from the loss of blood, and there was danger to be feared from inflammation—this knife would very likely have caused the injury—she was in great danger for some days—I consider her out of imme-diate danger now, but she is still in a very exhausted state.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any candles at any time - A. I did, a large quantity, on Sunday evening, the 27th of March, or early on Monday, the 28th. I lost them from my warehouse in <placeName id="t18140525-2-crimeloc10">Catherine Wheel yard</placeName>

               <p>Q. When did you last see them - A. My lad saw them on the Sunday morning; he went to feed the dog which I kept there as a guard to the warehouse. I missed them about a quarter after seven on Monday morning; I then found three locks broken, and my dog was in a state of stupefaction; he could hardly stand upon his legs. I gave notice at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of Eveleigh, or his wife - A. I do not. A man that keeps a horse and cart in the yard where my warehouse is, gave me information, his name is Westey; he came and told me my doors were open. I missed my property on Monday morning, the 28th of February. I saw my candles again on the 7th of April. The prisoner's husband keeps a chandler's shop.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with a search warrant, and searched the prisoner's premises, on Thursday, the 7th of April, in company with Mr. Clark, and my son, who is an officer, and another person. I went to a house in Long-alley, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch; I found the woman prisoner in the shop, with a child or two. I told her, I had a search warrant, and asked her who lived there; she said she and her husband. I pulled out a drawer; Mr. Clark saw some candles he knew. I begged of her if she had any more to shew them to them to Mr. Clark and me. I knew her husband by name and person. Me and my son searched the parlour; we found in a drawer in the cupboard a great number of house-breaking implements; this is one of the crows, a dark lanthorn, and a pistol, loaded with ball. We have used every endeavour to find the man; he has absconded. I have every reason to believe she is the man's lawful wife. I knew the man well, and so does my son. My son knows no more than me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at the candles - A. I have not the least doubt of their being my candles; I knew them by the cotton, and the bottoms in particular.</p>

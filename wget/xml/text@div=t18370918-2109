                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living at Hanwell. I lost a coat and a pair of braces off Daniel M'Kenzie's work at Hanwell—I was at work on the railroad on the 11th of this month, and saw them safe about half-past ten o'clock, and missed them about eleven—these are mine.</p>

About half-past twelve o'clock on this day I met the prisoners, and Price had a bundle under his arm—I asked him what he had got there, and he said it was not his, it belonged to Pearce—Pearce did not hear that, he was about a dozen yards off, and when we got to Pearce, Price said, "This policeman has stopped me and asked what I have got in the bundle," and then Pearce said, that was no odds to me, that was his business—I said I should take them both—on the way, Pearce said he had bought it of a man on the Staines road, gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I searched the prisoners in the station-house, and found on Price the braces, which he said were his own.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Price</hi>. I was going to work, and Pearce gave me this coat to hold while he laced up his boots—he told me to hold it and he would give me the braces—he asked me to pawn it and I said if I did I should be as bad as him that took it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Pearce</hi>. He was coming over a hedge and brought this bundle, and I said, "What is this?"—he said, "It is a coat"—I took it off the pales—I never carried it at all—when he got from the pales where he threw the coat over to me, he put his hand in the pockets and found a pair of braces—he said, "These will just fit my father.

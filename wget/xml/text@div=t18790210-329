                  </hi>. I am an army accoutrement maker, of 67, Willow Walk, Bermondsey—at the end of 1877 I had a large contract with the Government for making military valises—I employed the prisoner as an outdoor hand to make them up, for which purpose he would receive some valise backs and some strips of leather called gussets—these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine, they are part of 25 which were found at Baerd's; they are part of what we gave out to the prisoner to make up—they are stamped with my name before they are given out—I can positively identify 40 out of these 60 gussets found at Dear's—they had been given out to the prisoner during 1877 and the commencement of 1878—I received a communication last year from a man named Baerd, in consequence of which I Went on 17th December to the prisoner's place, 8, Romney Street, Westminster—I said "Potten, I always understood you to be an honest man, but I find you have been disposing of a great quantity of my property"—he said "It is a lie," or something to that effect, "I have not disposed of a pennyworth of your property"—I asked him if he knew a man named Baerd—he said "The only transaction I have had with Baerd was about the selling of a pony"—he also said that Baerd had recommended men to him who he believed had robbed him—Inspector Fox, who was with me, asked him if he had any objection to being confronted with Baerd—he said "No, none whatever"—Fox then went with Kimber over to Southwark Police-court—I afterwards went to Mr. Dear's, the furniture dealer, of Knightsbridge—I had a con<lb></lb>versation with him and obtained from him this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I cannot say whether the endorsement "George Potten" is the prisoner's writing—I then went back to Southwark Police-court and asked the prisoner if he had any conversation with A. and W. Dear, of Knightsbridge—he said "No, none whatever"—I asked him if he had a cheque of A. and W. Dear in his possession—he said "No"—I then showed him the endorsement on this cheque, and after a little hesitation he said "I believe Baerd gave me that cheque in payment of some money borrowed."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The cheque was for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 4th February, 1878—he said that he received the cheque from Baerd in payment of some money</p>

               <p>Baerd owed him—I am in a very extensive way of business—there are two other firms who contract with the Government, Ross and Co. and Bryan Brothers, of Westminster—I never heard of Paul and Co. or Bramston and Co. having orders, nor do I think Jones and Co.—Peter Tait and Co. are out of existence; their place is closed—I don't know Middle-more, of Birmingham, who contracted for these things—they have to be of the regulation pattern—the stamping is done at my premises—several boys are employed—everything is not stamped before it goes out, but it is before it is delivered to the Government—Ross and others have their stamp as well—a large order had been given by Government in 1877, and I had to make between 20,000 and 30,000 of them—Ross and Co. and Bryan Bros. I believe also made them—the prisoner has worked for my firm ever since I can remember—the whole of the work was given out to him cut for sewing, and he employs men to sew them—we handed him 200 or 300—Mr. Mayor and Mr. Lovelock gave them to him—there is a book in which a record is kept of the quantities—several articles are handed to him to combine into valises, and there would be so many booked out to him—there would be the number he would have to return—he had not in his employ over a hundred persons to work for me—I am aware that he works largely for Ross and Co., and for Bryan Bros., and has done so for many years—there are not eight or ten other persons who work for me, only about four—they would take stuff out, and I employ about 100 persons indoors, sometimes more—there are only five or six boys to stamp and tie up—the various things are cut out at the warehouse, and would be lying about—I have casually looked through the articles found, they do not all bear my stamp—I speak to the gussets by the way the leather is dressed, and by the particular kind of leather, which I do not think any other manufacturer uses, and also by the rolling—I pledge my oath that they are mine—I have not been going round and making inquiries with reference to these gussets—Ross's and Bryan's use different leather entirely to what I do—there is a difference in the way they use the hides—they are split before they are dressed, and ours are not split at all—there is also a difference in the sewing; there is lock-stitch sewing and machine sewing, mine are always sewn with a lock stitch—Baerd called on me on 11th December, and left his card, but I did not see him—I had never seen him—he called again on Friday, and then I saw him, and went down to his portmanteau shop in Buckingham Street, Pimlico; from there we went first to Willis and Stone's, and from there to Mr. Dear's at Knightsbridge—he is a large portmanteau maker—when I spoke to Potten on the 17th he said "I have not sold anything of yours; I have lost too much already"—he would receive 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for making up each of these valises—one man would take a little over two hours to make one—I do not know whether they are paid by the hour or by the piece—I believe they are paid so much for putting the strips on in the different parts or paid for piecemeal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I find on the strips "G. and W. Almond"—Ross and Co. and Bryan and Bros, certainly do not use my stamp—these articles would never under any circumstances be sold from my premises in the City. John Baerd. I am a trunk-maker, of 7, Elizabeth Street, Eyton Square—I have known the prisoner about two years—I was at his workshop in Romney Street at Christmas, 1877, when he showed me a gusset like this before me, and said, "Can you do anything with this?"—I said, "How</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187902100086"></xptr>
               <p>much apiece?"—he said, "6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said, "They are too expensive for me, they cut in waste"—I said, "I fancy at better shops they could use them, and I could sell them for you; give me a sample," and he gave me three—he said, "They are wrong cut, and they are from Government"—I took the three to Mr. Adamson, a trunk-maker in Piccadilly, and left one of them there—I then went to Mr. Dear, a trunk-maker in Knightsbridge, and leftone there, and I left one at Mr. Willis's, a trunk-maker in Sloane Street—I had a con<lb></lb>versation with Mr. Dear, in consequence of which I went with Hudson, who works for me, to the prisoner's premises in January this yea?—I said to the prisoner, "Have you those things ready for me?"—he said, "Yes"—we had a barrow with us, which we left outside—Potten said, "There are 120 gussets and a bag full of basil pieces"—I wanted to carry them on the barrow, and Potten said, "I will take them out for you," and he carried them out and put them on the barrow, two linen sacks full—I said, "Mr. Dear says he would like to see the bulk of them"—Potten said the price was to be 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb for the basil pieces, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each for the gussets—I did not tell him how many gussets Mr. Dear wanted—I went to Mr. Dear's with a portion of the property on the truck, and left 60 gussets with him, and the basil pieces and 60 gussets at Mr. Willis's—I had a conversation with Mr. Dear as to the price, but he did not make me an offer—I did not settle the bargain with him—Potten afterwards came to my house and said, "Mr. Baerd, I want a little money"—I said, "I have been to Dear's, and he won't give me more than 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each for them gussets; you had better come and see Mr. Dear yourself"—I said, "He will not mind giving 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for the other leather, only he wants to pick out the best pieces"—I went with the prisoner to Mr. Dear's at 8.30 that night, but the shop was shut—we saw the foreman, to whom I said, "Here is the man that belongs to the leather; you tell him what the governor offers me for it"—he said, "4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said to the prisoner, "Now, Potton, you see you can believe me; I could not get more than 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he said, "More fool you"—I said, "You can have the goods back or take the money; you please yourself," and then he said, "You had better take it"—this conversation took place at the Sun public-house, to which Dear's foreman came—on the Monday morning I went to Mr. Dear's by myself, and he gave me a cheque for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the 60 gussets at 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took the cheque to Potten's house, but did not see him—I gave it to Mrs. Potten—I took the other pieces of leather from Dear's to Willis's—Potten brought me the checque back two days afterwards, and said, "You must endorse it"—I did so, and gave it back to him—there was no other name. on the back—I do not know Potten's writing—Willis paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in May, as I found he had sold 30 gussets at id., which makes 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he also had the basil pieces, that made 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not go near Potten for a fortnight, and then he said, "Have you any money with you?"—I said, "What do you call money?"—he said, "I am very short to-night"—I said, "I can give you a half-sovereign. By the bye, Mr. Willis has paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; you can have it to-morrow morning. Aren't you going to liquor up?"—he said, "No, you have got all the money"—I said, "You had better send for a shilling's-worth, I will pay for it," and he paid for a shil<lb></lb>ling's-worth of liquor—we drank it, and he said, "My mother is coming home to-morrow. The old lady said, 'Good-bye,' and I said, 'God bless you.' I must give her half-a-crown"—I gave it to him, and next morning he came to my place and I paid him—Mrs. Potten came to my house next</p>

               <p>morning, and I gave her 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Willis only bought 30 gussets—I took the other 30 home and sold 12 to a man named Morris for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I kept, and the rest I used up myself—the prisoner brought me 25 valise backs in June and said, "Are they any use to you?."—I said, "No, they are no use"—he said, "You could make satchels of them"—I said, "They are more like soldiers' affairs"—he said, "When I am slack in winter, I will come and make them up for you"—my workman called my attention to the name on one of them, in December last, and I went and saw Mr. Almond, who came to my place and identified them—my name is Beard, but I am called "Baerd"—that was through a painter's error.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The painter made the name Baerd outside my shop, and I took the name—that was not because I had a little fire there—I had two fires at my place, and had compensation from the insurance office, but not at the premises at which I now am—one fire was in Waterloo Road, and the other in Theobalds Road—one of my workmen named Brown called my attention to something in December, and I attended with him at' Mr. Chip<lb></lb>perfield's, who took down Brown's statement of what he could prove—Brown left my employ last Saturday fortnight—he was in my employ then, but I have discharged him since—he was with me nearly 9 months—he was not with me in February or March, 1878, nor in May—I think he was in June—he was not present in June when Potten brought the 25 valise backs—I do not know whether Brown is here—if I had sold the bulk, I dare say Potten would have given me a little discount—I sold them for him on the chance of his giving me something—Hudson was in my employ—he left last April, I think—Brown was his successor—on the day that I gave evi<lb></lb>dence before the Magistrate against the prisoner/1 went to his house between five and six o'clock—I had charged him with this felony—I found his wife at home—I had been with Hudson before that, and left him in a public-house in Bermondsey—I had been to two public-houses with him—I did not return to Potten's house that evening, nor did I see him—I did not rejoin Hudson—I went home—I had left him in the public-house, promising to return to him—I do not know that he went to Potten's house that even<lb></lb>ing—I did not express regret to Mrs. Potten for the evidence I gave at the police-court—I did not say, "I am sorry for the evidence I gave to-day; will you forgive me?" nor anything like that—I asked her to tell Potten to come round and see me, as I thought he would come with me to Mr. Almond's next morning—I did not think that, Mr. Almond having given evidence, it would be allowed to drop—he said that he could not compound a felony, but I might do what I liked—I cannot explain myself exactly, but I did it with a good intention—I was going to take Potten round to see Mr. Almond—at the time I made my statement to Mr. Chipperfield he had taken down my evidence—I was at Potten's ten or fifteen minutes with Mrs. Potten all the time—Hudson could not have gone there within two or three minutes of my leaving him, for when I got home he was at my place—he was not at the police-court that day—I did not go to Potten's house on 17th December, the day of the first hearing—it was after the second hearing—Hudson had not been to me at the police-court—it was the day before the hearing that I went with Hudson to the public-house—I had not then been before the Magistrate—I met him at 10 a.m., and he was in my company all that day—I took him to Mr. Almond's first, and then to Mr. Chipperfield's office—when I got home I found him at my</p>

O. U.—I am positive that this cheque was not handed over to the prisoner's niece in part payment of that sum—her name is Burton, I think—she is married—she came and fetched it from my place, and there was no one present—neither Mrs. Perry nor Mrs. Phillips was pre<lb></lb>sent—I made a statement to Mr. Chipperfield before he examined me in the police-court—I did not say before the Magistrate a single word in reference to the payment of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Willis or Mrs. Potten coming to me and my giving her 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said something about the prisoner telling me he would come in the winter, when work was slack, and work up the 25 valises, but I did not say as an inducement to buy them—I do not know one of the men in Mr. Almond's employ, or one who is employed outside—I did not know that Potten worked at Mr. Almond's—I know McGill—he never told me that he was employed there—he works for a trunk-maker—I do not know where he lives or works—he has no place of business—he is one of the outsiders.</p>

I assist Mayne in giving out materials—they are always entered in a book which Mayne kept—the stuff would pass through my hands to the prisoner, and if he did not have the things complete the entry would be made on a slate and then in the book—supposing I gave him 100 out, they would be booked, and I should make an entry on the slate of the deficiency.</p>

I work at Mr. Dear's, at Knightsbridge—I know Baerd—I recollect his coming there one night at 8 o'clock; he was in the shop—we came out with the foreman and went to the Sun public-house, where I saw the prisoner, but I cannot tell whether he went in with us—I had a conversation with Baerd in front of the bar—the prisoner was in the group, near enough to hear what passed; he was, I think, next to me—we were chaffing Baerd, who said that he was not going to get anything out of it; he said "There is the man," and then said to my foreman, "What does your governor say?"—my foreman said "The governor will not give more than 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, because they are not worth more to him"—he did not point to anybody, he only indicated with his head—Baerd stood some drink, and the prisoner stood some afterwards.</p>

I am the wife of Joseph Perry, an ostler, of 139, Regent Street, Lambeth Walk—I work for Mr. Potten—about the beginning of March last year I was sitting at work and heard Mr. Baerd come in—I turned round and saw him—he said "Good evening, Mr. Potten, this is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. off what I owe you, and the other 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I will give you as soon as possible"—I did not see what was given—Mr. Phillips was there.</p>

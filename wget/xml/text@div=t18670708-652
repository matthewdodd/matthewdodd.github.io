                  </hi> I am a silversmith in the Walworth Road—on Sunday morning, 9th June, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner came to my house—he told me he had some plate that he wanted to dispose of, and asked if I could buy it—I said I thought I could if it was all right—he said, "Very well"—I asked how much he had got—he said he thought there was fifty or sixty ounces of it—I said I thought I could buy that quantity if he brought it to me—he asked if he should bring it that after<lb></lb>noon—I said, "No; I do not do business on Sunday, but you can see me on Monday at any time"—he came on Monday about nine or half-past, and brought a large gravy spoon, four table-spoons, four dessert-spoons, and half a dozen silver teaspoons—he said he had a cruet stand and several other things, and if I would give him the money for those he would fetch the others—he gave as a reason for selling the things that he wanted the money—I had given information to the police before he came on the Monday—I weighed some of the things, tied them up, and handed them to him—he called me a fool—he said I was injuring myself by not buying them, and losing 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I thought it was better to lose 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than run the risk of losing my character—he said it was all nonsense, I need not be frightened—I said it was not nonsense, I did not like the appearance of the things—he said he could disfigure them if he wished, and at the same time he bent the large spoon double to break it—I said, "Do not do that, you will spoil it"—he said, "Oh, it ones not matter, shove them into the melt pot"—he said, "You need not fear; no one knows anything at all about them, for they came from the other side of the water"—he said that no one knew him, nor where he lived, for he did not allow any one to know where he lived, he generally did his business at public-houses and such places—this is the handkerchief he brought the things in—he wrapped the large spoon up in this hand<lb></lb>kerchief, and put it in his coat pocket—while I was talking to him Robinson the policeman came in—my assistant had gone for him—the prisoner attempted to get out of the shop—the constable asked him to stay a few minutes—he became very much excited, and wanted to know what for—he asked me if he could get out the back way—I told him I had no back door—he drew from his pocket some of the spoons as he waited with his back to the counter, and wanted to give them to my wife, who stood behind the counter—she of course would not receive them, and the policeman turned round and said, "How many have you of these? "—I found this gravy spoon wrapped up in the handkerchief behind a clock in my place when the policeman took him away—he threw half a dozen teaspoons into the street from his pocket while the policeman was there.</p>

"—he said, "Let me pass, will you? "—I said, "I want to know what you are offering for sale"—he said he should not tell me—I asked Mr. Hill what it was; he did not tell me for some time, and the prisoner rushed past me into the street—I forced him back into the shop with a deal of trouble and sent for assistance—I saw him place some spoons on the counter and heard them jingle—I then asked him what he had in his possession—he said, "Nothing, you can search me"—I proceeded to do so, I found he had some spoons in his pocket behind—he immediately forced his hand into his pocket and pulled out half a dozen tea-spoons, and threw them over my head into the road—another constable arrived and we took him to the station with the spoons—this gravy spoon and handkerchief were brought to the station by Mr. Hills—the prisoner was very violent before we took him away.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 83, Gower Street—in August I advertised a hat manufactory for sale in Charles Street, Middlesex Hospital, and several persons called upon me, and among them the prisoner Rowley—he looked at the goods very particularly, and said that he had come up from Manchester to work up his business, but that the tools would be of no use to him, but he had a friend who would buy them—I refused to divide them—he said that he represented a Manchester house, and gave me to understand that he was a manufacturer in a large way in town—he came again next day and introduced Barnes as his friend, who looked over the goods very particularly—Rowley asked him whether he would like to go into the steam rooms again—he said, "No, I have seen it all, I know it all," and said he would let me know on Monday the highest figure he would give for it, that he had a place in Clerkenwell where he usually received his letters, but they had had a place at the West End, but were about to give up their retail business—he spoke of Mr. Heath, of Oxford Street, and said that they had several retail shops, but he did not care about that—I enclosed a list of the articles on the Saturday, and on Monday Barnes came and made me the offer of 175<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he wrote it and left it in an envelope—I agreed ultimately to accept that—the money was to be paid on the Friday and the goods to be cleared on the Saturday—but he said that his broker had disappointed him in selling some Metropolitan shares, and urged me to accept a draft on his banker at seven days, and I agreed to take it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this is the receipt I gave</p>

               <p>him—this bill is all I got for the 175<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Barnes came next day and fetched the goods away—I presented the bill at the bank on the Monday week following, but there were no effects, and they did not recognise the signature, and advised me to go to a solicitor—I found Barnes at the shop in Clerkenwell, he said that the bill was not due till next day—I said that I always had the money when I presented a bill—he said that the bank were offended with him because he withdrew his money at the time of the panic, but he was sorry I should have the trouble, and he would pay me the extra cab fare, and be with me next morning at eleven or half-past eleven—I did not get the cab fare—I went to the bank again, but could, get no money, and never got any—I went again to Clerkenwell, and found the shop closed and everything moved during the night—I could not find Barnes there—I have seen some of my goods in the hands of the police, but there is a deficiency of 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

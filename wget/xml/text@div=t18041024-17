             sworn. - Q. What are you? - A. I live at Ashford, near Belfont.</p>
               <p>Q.What are you? - A. A higler.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you see the prisoner at the bar? - A.About three o'clock, on Tuesday, the 11th of September, at the Duke's Head, at Belfont.</p>
               <p>Q.Had he any thing with him at the time? - A. Only a horse.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a horse? - A. A bay gelding.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the prisoner at the bar; are you sure he is the man that had that bay gelding with him? - A. Yes, he offered it to me for sale.</p>
               <p>Q.What price did he ask for it? - A. Eighteen guineas.</p>
               <p>Q.Did the horse appear to you to have come any distance? - A. Yes, he appeared very much fatigued.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he seem hot? - A. He had got cold, he was very sweaty, but it had cried on; I told him eighteen guineas was more than I could afford to give; he immediately told me I should have it for fourteen.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you bid him a less price than eighteen guineas? - A.No; it was a very useful serviceable house; I asked him if it was his own; he said his father kept two breeding mares, and had bred this from one of them on the common.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say it was his father's? - A. No, he said it was his own property.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you then buy him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he say where his father lived? - A. Yes, he said he came near Hindon, but I cannot mention the place's name; I told him it appeared to me that he had stole the horse, and then he jumped up upon the horse, and was for making off; I caught hold of him, and he said I had no business with the horse nor him either; I seized him upon the horse, and gave charge of him to some other people, while I went over the way to the Magistrate's; I came back, and found the horse upon the same spot; the people had got the prisoner off.</p>

               <p>Q. What was done with the horse? - A. The horse was taken into the stable, and the prisoner into the parlour, at the Duke's Head; I brought the horse up to Bow-street, and the prisoner was brought up by the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at Bow-street, when young Harding saw the horse? - A. No; the horse was put into the stable, and delivered to Mr. Harding, and he took him home with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the person here who received the horse from you? - A. No; I saw the same horse last Sunday at Belfont; Mr. Harding rode him up, and sent for me.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Harding.) Was the horse that Hankin saw you with on Sunday last, the same horse that you had missed out of the field? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was your father's horse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hankin.) Are you sure the horse you saw on Sunday last, was the same horse the prisoner offered you for sale? - A. I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Harding.) Where did you get the horse from? - A. From a stable near Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the horse? - A. I should suppose it was worth twenty guineas, or more.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from Berwick St. Leonard to Belfont? - A. Eighty-four miles.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hankin.) Was he worth more than fourteen guineas? - A. I should not have liked to have given more than that, knowing nothing of him; I should have thought him worth that money.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Wood? - had you ever seen her before? - Yes, at the public house, the sign of the Gey Hound, where she had the property on her; she had it about her, when she came into the public house, and she dropped it from her side; we asked her how she came by that property? she said she bought it; this was the 8th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it after you came into the public house? - Yes, she came in and called for something to drink, and the landlord refused her.</p>
               <p>Q. In what public house was it? - The sign of the Grey Hound, in Old-street-road, facing the lying-in Hospital, about twelve o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she drop it wilfully or accidently? - I believe she dropped it accidentally.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did the landlord refuse her liquor? - He thought she was rather in liquor. I see it fall from her; the officer has got the gown now.</p>

               <p>I produce a gown and a shift, the shift was delivered to me by the landlord of the house, she is not here; this man saw the shift drop, and he picked it up.</p>
               <p>Cole. I saw the shift and gown both drop from her; the publican said, that he did not think she came honestly by them, and she should be detained; and he went for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that is the gown she dropped? - Yes, I can; and I can swear that is the shift, it has got a frill.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it unusual for a shift to have a frill? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. You must not swear positively to property without being able to tell why. Are there not many shifts of the same appearance? - There may be; I believe it is the same. I don't know any thing about the gown, as to particular marks.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they solded up in any thing? - No, they were not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at them at the time they fell? - Yes, and the landlord besides.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had opened them, who did you deliver them to? - The landlord had them belonging to the public house, he is not here.</p>
               <p>Ray. When I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner, she had a pair of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170172"></xptr>milk pails, and the gown was in one of the milk pails, and I took it out of one of the milk pails, and I asked the prisoner then who the bed gown belonged to? she told me it was her own property; she did not say how she came by it.</p>

            To Cole. How came that gown in the pail? - I don't know, they were both slung in the bar while I went for the officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That man was not in the house when the things dropped.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This gown and shift are both mine; the bed gown I wear myself, and as for the shift, it was my husband's grand mother's, and I know it by the frill, which is not commonly wore now; the bed gown I had seen it on the Monday before, in my chest, on the top of my clothes; I don't know when I had seen the shift; the chest was not locked. I had but lately come into the house, and the lock was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to the Grey Hound do you live? - About two or three turnings; being but lately come into it, I don't know the street's name.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you stay at home in the day time, or do you go out to work? - I was out with the milk with her; she worked for me, and this same day she left me, and came home before me; it was yesterday was a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the morning did you go out? - I think it was about seven o'clock, we went out both together.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you return home? - As near as I can tell, it was almost ten; she came home before me, she was at home when I came home.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did she go out? - She staid about an hour after I came home; I cannot say particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any more of her? - I heard no more till the constable came and acquainted me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was a carrier to this Mrs. Spencer, and we went out together that morning, and she lent me some things to put on; and coming down, we sell out, and she said, she would fasten me in Newgate, if I did not give her the things off. It rained very hard that morning, and we had two or three glasses of gin on the walk; then when we came home we had three half quarterns, and she told me never to mind the wet, I will give you two or three things to put on; and when I came to take up my pails to go out again, I looked and found things in my pail; and I said, God bless me, I did not know that they were in my pails; and I thought she put them in the pail for me to shift myself with.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you ever lend her these things? - I lent her a black gown that morning, to go to Islington in, but I never lent her these things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I found the things in the pails. I have not got any friend in the world, but what you gentlemen please to do with me. I have got two small children to work for.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Maidstone, and am a general dealer. On 19th Aug., between two and three o'clock in the morning, I was in a booth, erected in a meadow, near Maidstone; there was a fair there, Ford was there sitting on the counter of the bar intoxicated—the prisoner was there—there was a pot standing at the bar, and one of them offered me to bet, and after I had drank, the prisoner said, "If I had known you were going to drink out of that pot, you should not have drank out of it"—he called me an Irishman—I turned round to Golding and asked him if I was ever called an I rish<lb></lb>man—the prisoner struck me twice on the lips—the deceased said it was a shame to strike an old man, old enough to be his father—he said, "What have you got to do with it?" and struck him twice, somewhere about the face, I cannot say exactly where, and as he fell back on the counter, the prisoner lifted up his legs, and threw him over into the bar—the counter he fell from was between two and three feet high, and between three and four feet wide—as he fell back his legs came up, and he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him over—the prisoner was not drunk—I cannot say but what he had bad something to drink, because I saw him drink, but he was no way the worse for liquor—I did not remain to see Ford picked up—the prisoner went away, and I followed him—soon after he went across the fields, and I went up the high road—I was present at the Inquest, and saw the body there.</p>

On the morning of 19th Aug., I was near a booth where the prisoner was—I saw the de<lb></lb>ceased there—I had not known him before that night—when I first saw him he was sitting on my cart, having some oysters—I afterwards saw him sitting on the counter—I saw some one touch the bottom of his legs and give him a bit of a push, and he felt back over the counter—I helped to pick him up, and carry him out—he was lying a little leaning on his right side—Charles Waller helped to pick him up, we both took hold of bis arms and carried him, he could not walk—we placed him on some straw inside the booth—he complained and said he had lost the use of bis right side—we left him in Mr. Hickman's care—I saw him lying on the straw once afterwards—I did not see him again till I saw his body at the Inquest—I saw the prisoner about a yard and a half, or two yards from deceased at the time he fell over—he was in front of the bar.</p>

I was a carman in the employ of Poole and Bryan—on the evening of 18th August I received directions from Poole, in consequence of which we loaded a lot of trunks with boots of different kinds, the work that was taken in that day, and a lot of solving leather—Woodford and I did it, and Poole helped us—we packed from six to seven trunks—we also packed some roan leather, some laces, and some leather, in bags—the roan leather is red leather which is used to make boots with—it was in whole skins, rolled up—Poole then gave us orders to take them to Mr. Pea roe's warehouse—we loaded and started with the goods between 10 and 11 o'clock at night—Woodford was with me—on the road, Ventris came to us, and told us something—after that, I went as fast as I could get my horse to go at a walking pace—I took the goods to Mr. Poole's house, and put them the stable there—Woodford assisted me—we left them there that night—on the following day, Sunday, the 19th, Woodford and I went to Chapman's house at Kingsthorpe—we returned from Kingsthorpe to Northampton on the Monday-morning, a little after 2 o'clock—we went to Poole's house, and found the side gate left undone for us, and the back door also—we went in, and found Billingham there—he told us that he was going to take the goods in the stable, into his care—he told me that all he wanted me to do was to drive, as he could not drive himself—we loaded the goods in the stable into the van—those were the goods I had left there on the Saturday night, the 18th—Woodford and Billingham assisted me—Billingham then told us he wanted to go to Hartwell—we took the goods there—that is six or seven miles from Northampton, the way he directed me to drive—Bil<lb></lb>lingham went with me, not Woodford—we went to the house of Jeffs, the carrier, at Hartwell, and saw him there—we unloaded the van into Jeffs' cart, took out the trunks, and put them into his cart—Jeffs, Billingham, and I did that—we then started for Northampton—I started first with my van, and Bil<lb></lb>lingham with me, and the carrier started afterwards—I saw Jeffs' cart start from Hartwell—I next saw the cart at Northampton, standing in the Red Lion-yard—I cannot say whether the goods were then in it—I saw them in it when I started from Hartwell—I saw some of those goods afterwards—I accompanied Mr. Shepcutt, the messenger, to Billingham's house, when some goods were seized there—I saw about six boxes in the bedroom at his house—I think this was about 29th October—they were similar boxes to those which had been removed from Poole's warehouse on the night of the 18th, and which were afterwards taken to Hartwell—I also saw some Wellington tops, some spring side tops, and some soleing leather found at Billingham's house—that was all buried among a lot of flock in a garret belonging to his house, and we found a piece of leather, marked "P. and Co.," which was handed to the messenger—Mr. Shepcutt shewed me some red skins that day, similar to the skins which we had packed on the night of 18th August, and which went to Poole's house.</p>

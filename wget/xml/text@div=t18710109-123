I am a jeweller, of 77, Regent's Park Road, St. Pancras—on the night of 22nd December, I shut up my shop safely, and went to rest—I was disturbed about 2.50, by glass breaking, which appeared to be my window—I got up, called my lodger, went to the door, and saw a black patch on the side of my shutter—I pressed it, and it went in—it was a piece of black paper, under which I found a circular hole in the shutter, larger than a man's hand—this is the shutter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the window was smashed in, and I missed twelve gold chains, twelve silver watches, and a silver fish slice and fork—the fork is here—I sprang a rattle, and a policeman brought the prisoner and a man named Davis.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman S</hi> 94). On Saturday morning, 24th De<lb></lb>cember, I was on duty in Regent's Park Road, standing by some unfi<lb></lb>nished houses almost opposite the prosecutor's shop—I saw two men about the middle of the road, right opposite the shop, and about thirty yards from me—they crossed over to the shop, and I heard a noise like the unlocking of a door—I thought it was lodgers coming home; like a key being fitted into a door, and there was whispering—in two or three minutes they crossed over to my side of the way, and stood at a chemist's shop door, nearly opposite Mr. Davey's—in about five minutes they crossed the road again to Mr. Davey's shop—I then heard a noise like cutting or grind<lb></lb>ing, and a very loud crash like glass breaking—after about half a minute or a minute, I saw the same two men cross the road again, and stand in the chemist's shop door about two minutes, and then turn down Sharpies-hall Street—I went along on tip-toe as quietly as I could to the corner of the street—I suppose they saw me, for they commenced walking very fast—the prisoner is one of the men, and the other was Davis, who has been discharged by the Grand Jury—I have no doubt about the prisoner—I had a good view of him, but I am not quite sure of the other—I pulled out my rattle, and said "Stop them"—they turned to the left into Berkley Road, and then into Regent's Park Road again, then to the right by Northumber<lb></lb>land Terrace, where I lost sight of them—I ran as fast as I could, got to the corner of Northumberland Terrace, and saw them fifty or sixty yards off, standing still almost—I halloaed again, and sprang my rattle—they turned round, and came running back towards me—I ran and met them, collared them with each hand, and said "I want you"—one of them said "What for?"—I said "Come here, and you will see"—Davis said "I must go back, or I shall get the sack"—the prisoner said "I have been to the coffee-stall for half an hour"—I took them back to the shop, and saw that the shutter was cut, and the glass broken—Mr. Davey, who was out<lb></lb>side the shop, charged them, and I took them to the station, where the</p>

               <p>prisoner said that he picked up a girl at London Bridge, took a cab to the "Adelaide" Tavern, and had something to drink, and they separated; he did not know her or where she lived—I found in his outside coat-pocket this small knife-blade, this small iron wedge, a pocket knife, and this pointed screw—there is an extra cut in the shutter where the wood is not pulled out, and the knife exactly fits it—I have heard since that Davis is a watchman for the North London Railway—his watch-box is fifty or sixty yards from where I took him in custody—after the charge was taken the prisoner said that he had no home; he had been employed as a cattle escort on board the ship <hi rend="italic">Tourist</hi>, and came from Lisbon in her about three weeks ago, and had been walking about ever since—I found this fork in the area of an unfinished house, which the prisoner ran past—I saw a gimlet picked up where they had run—I believe the prisoner to be the man who was at the shop window—he has just the appearance of his coat and hat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There are more than ten unfinished houses in a row, opposite Davey's shop—that is where I was watching at first—it was about thirty-five yards from where I was standing to Davey's shop—the road is about twenty yards wide—Sharpleshall Street runs in a circle, and comes back into the road—I only lost sight of the men once—I said before the Magistrate "I saw the two prisoners standing in the centre of the road"—I could see enough of the other man to say that it was Davis—I had never seen the prisoner before—it was starlight, but not moonlight—when I ran on tiptoe I was about twenty yards off them, on one side of them—the prisoner was nearest to me then—the "Adelaide" is in the Chalk Farm Road, not a quarter of a mile from Davey's house—I have not seen a coffee-stall in the neighbourhood for years past—this fork case (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was afterwards given to me as picked up.</p>

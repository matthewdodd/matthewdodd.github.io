On the 29th of January, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I went into the parlour, and she was laying on the sofa-bedstead, and said she had a pain in her chest; I said, I thought she was in labour, she denied it; I sent for her aunt, who came, she went to get a room for her, and sent her cousin to fetch her to the room - we got a coach for her. Her cousin went behind her to put on her things, and heard the child cry, she was delivered of it between the time her aunt came, and our getting the coach; nobody was with her at the time.

             the doctor were fetched, I saw the child; it kept bleeding from the shoulders, there appeared scratches on the shoulder, it bled at the mouth and nose continually. I found some clothes for it - it was a very fine boy, its nails were grown, we tried to feed it, but could get nothing whatever down it. I told the nurse it would not live from the first, that was my opinion; it died at two o'clock next morning. She never had it in bed with her, or touched it after the nurse came, which was about half an hour after it was born.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's aunt - she had called on me on the Saturday before. I had spoken to her about her condition, and told her she had better go home to her father's; she said her father had a large family, and had trouble enough, and she wished to get another situation. I was sent for, and went to her; she complained of a pain in her chest - I went to get her a lodging, and sent my daughter for her, she did not come, and I went back, and saw marks on the child's neck after it was washed. I thought she had done it in her agony in labour, and said nothing to her about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Sussex Place, Leadenhall Street The prisoner lives on the same landing, in the same house with me, and his wife lives there with him—on 4th Oct, about 9 o'clock, I was not in bed, but I had laid my head down on the bed—I was awoke up by hearing a noise between the prisoner and his wife—I came out, and the prisoner said, "B Sullivan "—I asked him what he meant by that—he gave me a filthy answer, and I was about to go back into my room—as I turned to go, he took one or two steps, and said, "Take that," stabbing me with a knife between my shoulders—I cried out, and my wife came—I lay senseless through the bleeding—I saw the knife in his hand—my wife came to look at the wound with a light, and she returned back to the prisoner and asked him why he did so—he made use of the same foul word as before, and she got a stick and hit him with it on the head—she then screamed, and I got to her assistance, and then I got these three wounds on my forehead—I do not indeed know how they were inflicted—I did not see anything in the prisoner's hand at that time—I was taken to the hospital, and remained there three or four days—I got well in about a fortnight.</p>

               <p>on that Sunday night—I left my husband in bed when I went down stairs—about a quarter before 10 o'clock I heard a cry of "Murder!"—I went up stairs, and said, "What is it?"—I saw my husband with his back stabbed, and the blood trickling down—I saw the wound was on his back—he had nothing on him but his shirt—the prisoner was in his own room—I went into his room, and asked him why he stabbed my husband—he had his hand up to his head, inside his own door—he made use of some bad expression, and came out on the landing—I took up this stick and beat him on the head with it—it is part of a chair—I brought it out and used it on Mr. Casey—he caught me by the shoulder, and beat me on my head with a little poker—I screamed, "Murder!" and my husband came and got me, and Mr. Casey struck him on the head, I do not know what with.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 641). I heard the noise, and went to the second floor front room, where I saw Sullivan bleeding from three or four wounds—I took the prisoner, and asked him why he did it—he said that he was coming up stairs, and Sullivan struck him on the head with the leg of a chair; that he had a knife in his hand using, and he struck Sullivan in his own defence—in going to the station he gave me the knife.</p>

I was called in to examine the wounded man—he had four punctured wounds, three on the forehead and one in the back—this knife would have inflicted the wound on the back—it was about an inch deep—the wounds were not dangerous in themselves—I saw him again about the 12th, and he then had erysipelas from the wounds in the forehead—had that been carried on to any extent I cannot say what might have occurred.</p>

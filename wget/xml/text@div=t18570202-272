                  </hi>. I am apprenticed to a stationer, in Newgate-street. On Saturday, 10th Jan., I saw the prisoner in the shop, about half past 2 o'clock—he came for a quire of note paper—it came to 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I served him, he offered me in payment a half crown—I gave him two shillings, which were good—I am quite certain of that, I looked at them at the time—after I had given him them, he said he would not have the note paper, he could get it for 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he wanted the half crown back—he took the two shillings up in his hand, and put them towards me—I did not give him back the half crown—when I saw that he put back the two shillings, as soon as he put them down I saw immediately that one shilling was bad—it was not one of the two shillings that I had given him—I told him it was a bad one, and it was not one that I had given him, he had changed it—I turned round to try it, and in the mean time he went out of the shop—I ran after him—I saw him run, and go down Warwick-lane—he went down to a turning on the right hand side, called Oxford Arms passage—I did not follow him—I told a policeman—there is no thoroughfare, and he came out of the passage—I saw him coming back again towards me—I tried to stop him, but did not succeed—the policeman stopped him—I saw his hat fall off, and out of his hat I saw a small parcel roll out for three or four yards—it was in a piece of red handkerchief—I took it up, and gave it to the officer—I was present when he opened it in our shop in Newgate-street, and in it there were five bad shillings—I did not mark them, I marked the one that the prisoner had given to me, and gave it to the policeman—he had all the six shillings.</p>

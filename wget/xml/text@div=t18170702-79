The Lord Melville came into the river on the 14th of May, she had twentyfour casks of whiskey on board. On the 15th I put the prisoner and Bois on board, in charge of her; on the 17th I went to the vessel again, the prisoner was not there, he had broken his arm on the same day that he went on board. I gauged four casks, the ullage of three of them was four inches and a quarter dry, and the other three and a quarter, which is an unusual ullage-the casks were new. I discovered a spoil in the top of the bilge, which had been cut off even with the cask, the cask was perfectly dry on the top. I rummaged the ship, and found twelve gallons and a half of whiskey in the lockers, in two kettles, a teapot, and some stone bottles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Bois has also been suspended.</p>
               <p>JOHN NICHOLSON. I was on board the Lord Melville; the prisoner came on board on the 15th of May; I cleared away for stocking the casks-the prisoner then asked me, Tully, and Backers, to go into the hold with him. When we got there he handed me down four quart bottles, and told me to fill them - He found a crane - I filled them, and returned them up the galley to Tully, he handed them to Backers. When I was drawing off, he said the crane was not big enough by half an inch, and asked if I or any of the ship's company had a funnel, to put water into the cask; I told him I had not. The crew were all on deck. He took the crane out of my hand, and 
               <persName id="t18170702-79-person666">drew</persName>
             the liquor off himself, saying, that I was no hand at it. I filled all the bottles, and drew out two tin pots full, one of which contains about three pints, and the other two quarts; he handed them to me. I handed them up the galley - We filled other vessels, when we had done, he said, "such casks as I have not taken into stock, you may take what you want out of them, for the crane cannot hurt these casks; but when you have done, be sure and spoil them up, and cut it off snug, and I shall bore in the same holes, so that our betters may ******." We were there about ten minutes after that, and then went up. Moore is an apprentice on board. About two o'clock I saw Bois speak to the prisoner. They went up with one bottle, and the prisoner fell down, broke his arm, and went on shore.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I never saw the prisoner before. This was all done in two hours. Tully and Backers saw what passed. I am now in confinement. On the 17th the officer came on board, and found the whiskey.</p>
               <p>BRISBANE MOORE. I am an apprentice on board the vessel. I saw the prisoner go into the hold with Nicholson, Tully, and Backers, between eleven and twelve o'clock. I was in the kitchen at dinner-time, and saw a tin-pot standing on the table with whiskey in it-it would hold about a quart. While I was there, some whiskey was handed up from the hole in a tin-pot-the prisoner and Nicholson were in the hold at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was first asked about them two days after it had happened. I drank once of it.</p>

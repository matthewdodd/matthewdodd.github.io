                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant R</hi> 15.) On Sunday morning, the 25th of April, I was on duty near the Greenwich Union-workhouse— about three o'clock, I observed the prisoner in the ground of the workhouse, walking along by the wall, right along by the gaslight—he had three bun<lb></lb>dles, one in each hand, and one under his arm—I asked where he was going—he said to the stable—I asked if he belonged to the workhouse—he said, "Yes"—I said I did not believe it, and got over after him—to</p>

               <p>threw the bundles down, ran, and got away—I took possession of the bun<lb></lb>dles—they contained the greater portion of the property stated in the in<lb></lb>dictment—there was a barrow outside the ground, containing 30lbs. of beef, a broom, and other things—I afterwards took the prisoner into cus<lb></lb>tody, about nine o'clock the same morning, in an empty room in Griffin-street, about a mile from the workhouse—I told him what I took him for—he did not speak—I took his shoes off, returned to the place accompanied by the master of the workhouse, and compared them with the marks on the ground—they appeared to correspond, and also with marks about where the barrow stood—the impressions were left sufficient to tell, as there had been rain in the fore-part of the night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am master of the workhouse. I produce an office copy of the order of the Poor Law Commissioners forming the Greenwich Union—I am appointed by the guardians. On the morning in question, I was disturbed by Lovell—I got up and saw these articles which I can positively swear to—the greatest part of them are branded with the mark of the Union—they are the property of the guardians—the prisoner was formerly a pauper in the workhouse, and was employed in the kitchen as a cook, for about eight months—he left on the 26th of March—he had no business on the premises after that—his employment as cook would give him an opportunity of knowing where every thing was kept—the inner door is not kept locked—it is left open for the convenience of the men who have to work early in the morning—if a person got over the wall, he could get into the kitchen, but no further, as all the other part is locked up—I saw the prisoner's shoes compared with the marks, and they appeared to corre<lb></lb>spend exactly.</p>

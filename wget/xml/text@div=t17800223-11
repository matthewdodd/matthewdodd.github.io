On the 15th of January, I missed the things mentioned in the indictment. Every one of the things mentioned in the indictment were my pro- property; they were all previous to that time in my house. The prisoner was my <rs id="t17800223-11-deflabel63" type="occupation">housemaid</rs>

I made an enquiry after her; I got a search warrant from a justice of the peace of search her father's house, where I apprehended I should find her. The prisoner was found at her father's house in Buckles-Court, St. Martin's-Lane, and several of the things I had lost were found in her possession; they were delivered up to the constable; she there confessed taking all the things which are mentioned in the indictment. She said some of them were at a lodging she had taken in Swallow-street, the others were pawned. She directed us to the pawn-broker's, and also to her lodgings. The bed, blanket, bolster, tea-kettle, candlestick, and a coarse sheet were found at her lodging in Swallow-street, and some things were in the possession of the pawn-broker.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Whether she did not offer me these things in lieu of money? I was hired a servant to her. She had four girls that saw company. The woman kept the house. She wanted me to go into company. I would not. She sent a gentleman down stairs after me; I would not comply<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230023"></xptr>with him; he went out in a passion; she came down stairs and abused me, and said I hindered her of a guinea to her house; after that, she sent me up to the bed room, a gentleman came up, and she locked me in; she kept me there all night, the gentleman was to give me five guineas; he said he left it in her hands. She said she was distressed, and was going to live in a house at Brompton. She kept a very disorderly house in King's-Place.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prosecutrix. Had you the sum of five guineas deposited with you for that girl? - There never were such words mentioned, if it was the last moment I had to live, nor ever such speeches came out of my mouth; it is all a falsity; she has raised this, in order that it should be against me, on account of the things she carried off. I never heard a word of this before.</p>
               <p>Did you promise her any money? - No; I had fourteen shillings of her's, which she had received as vails, she put into my hands, and I told her I would buy her a gown with it.</p>
               <p>Then you did not offer her these things voluntarily in lieu of money she was to have? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The things she accuses me of stealing from her, with a bed-gown she gave me to do my work in of a morning, I left it dirty in the pail. I gave her warning several times, and she would not pay me what she owed me. I went away between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning. She gave me a shift and other things; she claimed a right to every thing she gave me, which was a bed-gown and shift and other things, which I gave up to her.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you give her this bed-gown? - Never.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you lock this girl up in company with any gentleman? - I never mentioned any such thing.</p>
               <p>Court. But did you ever do the fact? - Never upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She has drawn many a girl in the cord and debauched them.</p>
               <p>Court. Has the girl ever warned you to quit your service? - No; I warned her before, and she always cried to stay. She would not work; she frequently got in liquor, drank beer and gin much.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask the constables; they know she keeps a bad house; there are people come every night and break her windows, and her house is tore to pieces.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. That does not concern you; that is nothing to you.</p>

On the 14th of January a counterpane, sheet, and napkin were pledged with me by the prisoner. Half a guinea was lent upon the sopha cover, a guinea upon the others.

I found the prisoner upon the top of a bed; this was between twelve and one o'clock in the morning; she was covered over in the bed in her father's house. She got out; she said she would go with us. She delivered up to us the duplicates of the several things that have been pledged at the pawn-brokers, and she said she would show us where the other things were in the lodgings she had taken, and she delivered over the other things at her father's house; she went with us to her lodgings; there the other things were found; the prisoner said she would give them up to her mistress, provided she would not prosecute her.</p>

We took her before the justice; there, upon examination, the prisoner said there was no person concerned in the business but herself, but she said something about the girls persuading her to take them away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My mistress sent me to pawn those things; she would not have duplicates in her pocket for fear she should pull them out of her pocket. She pawned those things to pay her landlady.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The feather-bed is an old bed which I laid upon in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner the only servant you had in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She used all the girls of the town so ill, that they left her. How I came to know she was a married woman was, when she wanted me to go into company; I said I was a married woman, she said so was she a married woman, but for all that she would go with a gentleman sooner than want money.</p>

               <p>Court. What are you? - I live upon my means; my husband maintains me in a genteel manner. I went to ask the prosecutrix two or three questions about her. I went to ask her what the affair was; she told me of the things that were taken, and she told me that she came to her for a service; and she told me she was something I do not like to mention, unless I must do it; she said she kept girls, and she thought the prisoner at the bar in a little time might become one of her girls, or her women; I do not know what she called them; I cannot tell what it is. She said she meant to go out the week following to buy her a pretty linen gown, and send her into her business. I supposed so by her meaning.</p>

               <p>Court. When was this? - After this affair happened.</p>
               <p>Court. The prisoner was then in custody? - Yes. But this is what she told me was her intention, and that she might have made very well of it, if she had not gone away.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this all? - There was a great deal more said, for I talked an hour or two with her, but I cannot remember any more at present.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with the prosecutrix about her situation, whether she was a married woman or no? - I do not recollect; the prisoner is a married woman, because I was present at the prisoner's marriage.</p>
               <p>What is become of her husband now? - Her husband was out of town at the time; he left her distressed, so she went there to live in his absence.</p>
               <p>What is her general character? - Very good; she has lived with me.</p>
               <p>You have not had any knowledge of the prosecutrix, have you? - I never saw her till I went to speak to her; she herself discounted her life to me, for I did not know what she was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Park Lane Company (Limited)—it was established in 1865—it is their business to receive horses on their premises, and sell them by private contract and by auction—we charge the customers the expenses of the keep, the auction fee, and advertisement—I have been in the Company's service five years—in August, 1868, the prisoner came into the service at a salary of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-week as clerk, accountant, and cashier—his salary was after increased, and, in May, 1871, there was an agreement in writing—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is signed by me on behalf of the Company and by the defendant—(<hi rend="italic">By this agreement the prisoner was to be clerk and accountant at a salary of </hi>3<hi rend="italic">. a-week</hi>)—the prisoner continued in the Company's service up to July last year—in June he had a three months' notice to leave—before the notice expired he was directed not to attend at the Company's premises—when a horse is sent in there is an entry made in what we call the voucher-book—this is it—I know the prisoner's writing—this entry dated 21st August is his writing—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "No. 5054 (that is the number of the voucher), 21st August, 1871,—Gentlemen, I hereby authorise you to sell for me by auction or privately, subject to conditions of sale exhibited on your premises, the following pro<lb></lb>perty: chestnut gelding for fifty guineas—G. Lee for S.R Stubbs, 21, Wigmore Street, Cavendish Square"—The figures 125 on this entry are I believe the office boy's—they refer to the yard-book—the entry in the yard-book on 21st August, at page 125, is the writing of John Holloway—on that entry there are the figures 86 in the prisoner's writing; that refers to the sales-book—that shows that the yard<lb></lb>book has been posted up into the sales-book—the entry in the sales-book is the prisoner's writing—"21st August, 1871. Stubbs, chestnut gelding"—that shows the date when the horse came in—it was the prisoner's duty to have entered in that book the date when the horse went out; that would be from the yard-book—he has omitted to do that—from the sales-book it was his duty to post up the transaction in the ledger—it is not posted up in the ledger—when he received money, it was his duty to give a receipt—this receipt of 31st August is in his handwriting—"31st August, 1871-Mr. J.

B. Garling, Esq., and L. N. Bonner, Esq.; they are not directors now—there were no usual Board days—I summoned them by a circular, not on my own mere motion, but on the approval of one or more directors who happened to be present—they called incidentally, and I asked them to come—if there was anything which the directors who called thought a Board was required for, I then summoned them, and I sometimes did it of my own accord—Hollo way is here—it is not true that the Board meet when I think it necessary to summon them—I have not sworn that—I heard after the prisoner left us that he started a rival establishment—I did not say at the Police Court that but for that I never would have prosecuted him.</p>

On Tuesday night, the 19th of January, about half-past ten o'clock, I was at the corner of Gardiner's-lane, York-street, Westminster, where I live - I was going home. I went into the Blue Anchor public-house, about eight o'clock, and had a pint of beer; the two prisoners and another came in, and sat by my side - while they sat by me, I thought once or twice that they were trying to pick my pocket - they could not do it; as soon as my wife called for me I went home with her - the two prisoners and the other followed me. Armfield was on one side, and Frost was behind with M'Bride, who is not in custody. Armfield got hold of my arm, and said he wanted to see me home; my wife told him to let me alone; I had been drinking, but was perfectly sensible.

Just as we got to the gateway, and turned the corner, the three men surrounded him; he said he was robbed - it did not last a minute; they immediately went up York-street as fast as they could go. We returned to the public-house, and told them he was robbed, then went to a public-house at the corner of Queen-square, where the officers are, and gave information.

            . I am an officer. On the 20th of January Frost was given into my charge, by a man named Green. In consequence of what he said, I went to the Crown, in Pye-street, where I expected to find Armfield and M'Bride together. Before I had got within fifty yards of the house, an acquaintance of Armfield's saw me, and ran immediately into the house, so that when I got there I could find neither. I went several times to Armfield's lodgings, but could not find him - he was afterwards taken to Bow-street, and given into my charge.</p>

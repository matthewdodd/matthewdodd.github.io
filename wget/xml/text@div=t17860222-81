On Thursday the 16th of February, I went out to work about twenty minutes after seven, I locked the door, and put the key under it, as I usually do, I left my wife behind me, I came back on information from my wife, that she had been robbed of some things by Tramp; when I came back I found some things thrown about, and several things missing; I can speak to the breeches.</p>

               <p>I was in bed, and this lad came into the room, and pulled down all my candlesticks and flat irons; it had just struck seven; most of the things I saw the day before, and when I got up, several things in the room in which I slept were tumbled about; I know the prisoner, I have seen him many times, his father and mother live in our street; there was a little horse, and he moved that, and that waked me; half the window curtains were drawn, there were no shutters; I had the things to wash; the prisoner did not live with his mother, he was a boy that lived abroad; he ran away the minute I turned round; I looked at him, and said, oh, you tramping dog! do you come to rob me? The apron and things were laid ready; I am very sure he is the person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What time was it in the morning? - Seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have a witness, if he is here, to prove that I was in bed at seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Taylor. I went and called my husband directly, and said to him, come home directly, for young Tramp has robbed me of my things.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know the nature of an oath? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>What is it? - To speak the truth between man and man.</p>
               <p>What will be the consequence, if you do not speak the truth? - It is a very bad thing to take a false oath.</p>
               <p>Do you know what becomes of bad people? - They come into bad places, and bad company.</p>
               <p>No, but after they die, do you know where they go? - I hope to go to Heaven.</p>
               <p>If you tell the truth, you will; but if you do not tell the truth, where shall you go? - If I do not tell the truth, I look upon it I shall go to hell. I am a shoemaker, I keep a kitchen in Monmouth-street, No. 10, sent nine pounds a year; I work for myself, I have no father or mother; I mend shoes, and hang them up at the door, I have lived there about three months.</p>
               <p>Who else lives in the house? - I do not know the landlady's name, she sells gowns<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220126"></xptr> and things; I pay my money every Monday.</p>
               <p>Have you no receipt for it? - No.</p>
               <p>Who does the rest of the house belong to? - The gentlewoman lives up stairs, I do not know her name, I have not lived there long.</p>
               <p>Why, you have lived there three months? - No, I never trouble myself about the names of the people, I mind my work.</p>
               <p>Who lives in the next house? - I do not know, I never lived in the street before.</p>
               <p>What kind of shop is it next door? - A shoemaker's shop next door, one Mr. Foster keeps it; this lad was in bed along with me that morning.</p>
               <p>What morning are you talking of? - That morning when they said he got these things.</p>
               <p>Where were the things taken away? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Who brought you here? - I came along with the boy's mother.</p>
               <p>When did she first speak to you? - The day that the lad was first taken up.</p>
               <p>How long was it before he was taken up? - I do not know the day of the month.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was it? - Thursday, I think, but I cannot say rightly, to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Did this boy constantly sleep with you? - Yes, Sir; he has slept with me about three weeks; the prisoner lives with me, and minds my place when I am out, and runs of errands, and I learn him what I can of my business.</p>
               <p>What time do you get up in a morning? - I get up at seven, and this morning he was up after me, he was not up till past eight o'clock; generally speaking, I get up first, I always d o, I open the door, and hang out my shoes; he never slept from me for three weeks together.</p>
               <p>How long is this ago that he was with you? - Five weeks.</p>
               <p>How long has he left you? - A fortnight to-day; but I cannot tell the day with certainty, I cannot read or write.</p>
               <p>Was he never absent one night? - No; he slept with me the night before he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes I am sure of it; during this three weeks he never was out before seven in the morning; I have no clock, but I can hear the town clock go, St. Giles's church; he never was out before me in a morning, and I have pounds worth of goods in my place; I never lost any thing.</p>
               <p>Court to Taylor. When was it that this boy was taken up? - This day fortnight.</p>
               <p>Was he taken the same day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Boy. Will you swear that you heard the clock strike seven? - No, Sir, I will not swear that I heard the clock strike, but I will swear that he did not go out that morning till between eight and nine, he went for some bread and cheese to the chandler's shop.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Taylor. Did you hear the clock strike seven? - I did not hear it; but when I was waked, and pulled my curtain back, it was between seven and eight.</p>

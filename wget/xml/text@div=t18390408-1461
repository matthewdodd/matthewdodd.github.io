On the 11th of March, I marked three shillings, and gave them to Mr. Young, a draper close by, to bring to my shop at half past seven o'clock the next morning, and in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after Mr. Young was gone, I went to the till, and there was only one of the marked shillings in it—this is one of the shillings—(<hi rend="italic">examining one.</hi>)</p>

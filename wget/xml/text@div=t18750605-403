I am a plaisterer—on Saturday night, 17th April, at 9.40, I met the prisoner and his wife at my street door as I was coming out with my wife and mother—we all went into a public-house to drink my-wife and mother then went home, and I went to the prisoner's, house by invita<lb></lb>tion to have a game at cards with him—he—is a, plumber—we got to his house about 9.55—he said he had no drink in the house but he would go and fetch some—he took away a bottle to get some gin and was absent between five and eight minutes—while he was gone I sat down and lit my pipe and was sitting by the fire-place smoking when he came back and struck me on the side of my head—his wife was there—he said nothing when he struck me, but after wards he said that I had been taking liberties with his wife while he was out—he did not say a word to his wife—I was suffering from rheumatism at the time, and he knocked me out of my chair—I said that he must be mad to accuse me of such a thing—I got up, got my hat and stick and went away, I met him at the, street door and told-him I would have it out with him on Monday morning—he replied "Good night, John"—I slipped down coming downstairs and lost my hat, and as I was picking it up I said that—he was not sober, nor was his wife—theirs is a large room, a sitting-room and bed-room in one—I had-also been drinking—his wife heard him accuse me and told him he was a fool I lit my pipe by the candle and did not use a fusee.</p>

I am the wife of Henry Woodrough, a carriage painter, of 24, Paradise Street, Marylebone—we occupy the parlours on the ground floor front, and the prisoner occupied the first floor front—they had lived there fire weeks, on Saturday night, 17th April, we came in about 12.30, and while we were sitting at supper there was a quarrel overhead more than usual—I could hear high words, my husband was very tired and went to bed, but I still sat up feeling very warm, and hearing an extra screaming I ran upstairs to the second flight of stairs adjoining their room, and heard Mrs. Cole say "Oh, don't! oh, don't! Put it down! put it down! Oh, you wretch; oh, you wretch," and then she ran round by me and fell down kicking her heels on the floor"—I then went down and roused my husband; but hearing nothing further I returned to my room—I then rushed upstairs again and heard Mrs. Cole say "Give me the key; give me the key!"—she was beating her hands on the door, and her screams were most dreadful—my husband opened the window, called a policeman and let him in—I had never seen the prisoner before that night.</p>

About 1.30 on this morning I was in Paradise Street and heard cries of "Police "I went to No. 24 and saw the deceased looking out at the window—she said "He has set fire to me"—I said "Open the door"—I remained there ten minutes, and then Mr. Woodrough opened the parlour window and asked me if I wanted to come in—I said "Yes," and he opened the street door—the deceased was scream<lb></lb>ing while I was waiting for admission, as if, in distress—I went up to the prisoner's room, the first floor-front; it was not locked—I turned the handle and saw the deceased sitting on the side of the bed quite naked, and the prisoner sitting in a chair by the side of the fire, smoking—the deceased showed me her side which was-very badly burnt, and I sent another con<lb></lb>stable for a doctor—I asked her how it was done—she said-" He struck a match and set light to me"—the prisoner said "It was a fusee, I threw it at her"—I covered her up with a quilt and a doctor came and-ordered her re<lb></lb>moval to a hospital—I found burning clothing on the floor of the room—I extinguished the fire—the clothing was 4 or 5 feet from her, between-" her and the deceased—she had evidently been drinking and-smelt of it, and she was very much burnt; she appeared to be in very great pain, but the pri<lb></lb>soner never made any attempt while I was there to assist her in her distress—when the doctor came she said" What are you going to do with him?"—I said "We are going to lock him up-"—she said. "Don't do it we were larking"—the prisoner was the worse of the two as to drink—I took him to the station and came back and searched the room—I found a box of matches, not fusees, on the mantle shelf and this brass candlestick under the grate, broken as it is now—there was a quantity of candle fat on it and likewise on the stove; there was a fire in the grate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner rendered her no assistance at all—he did not-carry her down the stairs and through the passage to the cab—I mean to say that if that has been sworn to by Mary Amn.

               <p>comfortable manner—his wife was on the bed, about 7 yards from him; she said that he had set fire to her by throwing a match at her—afterwards he said that it was not a match; it was a fusee—water had been thrown on her before I arrived, and the constable was taking the burning things off her, and he took off part of the cover of the bed and threw it over her, and then the other articles of clothing were rolled together to put them out—none of the bed linen was burnt—the deceased had very few clothes on, and what she had was burning—she had on a chemise; I am not certain whether she had a bed gown—I found that her left side was very much burnt indeed, and the doctor ordered her removal to the hospital—she was crying very much and speaking in a very excited manner—I said to the prisoner "You will be charged with setting fire to your wife and causing her grievous bodily harm"—he said "Oh, she is not burnt much; just look here where I have been burnt," showing an old scar on his arm—she said "Oh, don't take him away, he could not help it"—he walked downstairs very well; he had been drinking, but was far from being drunk—he went to the station, and after the charge was read over he said "Well, if I did do it was not intentional"—his hands were perfectly clean; there was no sign of his having attempted to extinguish the fire.</p>

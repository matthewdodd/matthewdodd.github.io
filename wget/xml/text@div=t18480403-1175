                  </hi> I am superintendent of the locomotive department of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway Company. They have sheds at New Cross—I missed a great quantity of tools from there—on 27th March I went with Holton to the prisoner's shop in Mason-street, about half a mile from New Cross station; he was not there—I looked about and recognised these pair of smiths' tongs—there has been a mark on them, but it is defaced—they belong to the Company—while I held them the prisoner came in—I asked him where the other five pairs of tongs were—he said, "They are all there that I know anything about"—we searched and found five paris similar to what we missed, with the marks defaced—the prisoner produced an iron bucket, containing some swedges, two chisels and a punch, and said, "There they are; they all came together"—this wedge has "L. &amp; B. R and Co." on it—I asked him how he came by them—he said, at first, he did not know, and afterwards, that a man who did jobs left them from time to time—he produced two pairs of stocks, a screw plate, a wrench, and a tap—the Com<lb></lb>pany had similar articles—here has been a star on this swedge; it is defaced—it is the mark of one of our porters.</p>

                  </hi> I am a smith, and have worked for the prisoner six or ten months. I left on Saturday week—he said he could not afford to give to so much wages as I had been having—last January a man came with six pairs of tongs, and some tools, in a kettle—there were some swedges and a punch—I did not hear what passed—he left them there—about three weeks afterwards the prisoner tole me the Railway Company were looking after some tools, and said, "You must hide those things belonging to the Com<lb></lb>pany, for I don't want them found at my house"—his son took them into the back yard, by his orders, and buried them for three or four days, till the search was over—two or three days afterwards the prisoner and his son brought six pairs of tongs into the shop, and told me to knock the marks out of them—I knocked the marks out of five—he said they would do, and one pair was made into something else—two pairs had a star, and one pair "M." on them, and another pair a claw—this sledge-hammer was brought last September—there is no mark on it—the Company sent for me last Sunday week, and then sent for the prisoner.</p>

Q.</hi> When did you first give information? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A person came to me on Sunday morning, after I had left prisoner—I did not go to any of the railway officers—I saw the Company's mark on the swedge several times—I was not angry with the prisoner for not giving me more wages—I was a little annoyed—I did not say, "I will do for you for this, Master Etherington"—no angry words passed between us—I was not in liquor when discharged—it is an open shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the person that took it - A. No. I called stop thief, and in about five minutes a black man was brought by the watchman into Albemarle-street; the black man was the prisoner. The watchman brought the prisoner and my bag; he shewed me the bag; I believe it to be mine. I told him it was mine. He said the prisoner was the person that dropped it. By the contents in it, it must be mine; there was a pair of spectacles, a pocket-book, a silver thimble, a small pin-cushion, and one eighteen-penny bank token; those things were in the bag at the time I lost it. The watchman took him to the watchhouse, and there I identified the property. I went to the watchhouse by compulsion; I did not wish to prosecute any body.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a general rule of yours, is it - A. That of humanity is, and I hope it always will be. On Monday morning I went before the magistrate.</p>

            . I am a green grocer. I was passing along Albemarle-street, at the end next to Piccadilly; on Saturday night the watch was going past nine; I heard the cry of stop thief at the other end of the street; I saw two or three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270010"></xptr>running in the middle of the street towards me; I made a stop at the corner of Stafford-street, to see who was coming; I saw the prisoner about twelve or fourteen yards before some more people; I stood there until he came almost opposite of me, thinking he was going into Piccadilly; instead of passing me he turned short and went into Stafford-street; he then had one hand under the lappel of his coat. I suspected him to be the person after whom the cry was raised. I ran after him, and overtook him before he got into Bond-street; I catched him by the collar; he said I took the wrong man. I told him he must stop until the watchman came up; at the same time a person who is here said he had dropped something. I looked and saw something on the ground about a yard from us, and just at that time the watchman came up; I saw the bag picked up and given to the watchman. The prisoner was taken to the lady, and the bag. Then we went to the watch-house. The watchman took the prisoner and the bag to the watchhouse. At the watchhouse, Mrs. Trivett owned the property. The bag was left there with the constable of the night. I saw the prisoner was a black man. He was never out of my sight from the time I saw him until I apprehended him.</p>

            . I am a servant; I live in Albemarle-street. I was coming along Stafford-street, going towards Albemarle-street; I heard the cry of stop thief; at the corner of Albemarle-street the prisoner passed me; he ran very quick; he came up from Grafton-street, towards Piccadilly, along Albemarle-street; he turned the corner of Stafford-street towards Bond-street, when a person came from the opposite side and seized him by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is that person - A. Mr. France. I went to his assistance, and we gave him into the hands of the watchman. I perceived a bag drop from his hand, from underneath the prisoner's coat; just at that time he was given into the hands of the watchman. A person that stood by took the bag up, and gave it to the watchman, and said to the prisoner, you have dropped something. The prisoner made no answer. I did not go to the watchhouse with the prisoner. I went afterwards and gave my address to the constable of the night. The constable of the watchhouse came to me on Monday morning, and told her to attend at Marlborough-street office. When the prisoner turned the corner of Stafford-street I observed him to be a man of colour.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty that night at nine o'clock; soon after I was on duty I heard the cry of stop thief; I was on the side of Albemarle-street, near Dover-street. I took towards Grafton-street; I saw the prisoner running on the opposite side to me; he was running very fast towards Piccadilly. I sprang my rattle, and called out stop thief; he gained ground of me. When I came to the corner of Stafford-street I observed the prisoner stopped by Mr. France. I am confident he is the man, although I was not swift enough to take him. He was never out of my sight. I went up, and took hold of him, and told him he was my prisoner. Some person called out, watchman, he has dropped something. I did not see him drop any thing at that time. A person gave into my hands a small white bag. I took the man and the bag to the person that gave the alarm. I met Mrs. Trivett, she owned the bag. I took the prisoner to the watchhouse, and the bag I gave to

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Old Burlington-street; at the bottom of Albemarle-street I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw some person running from two ladies. I did not know who they were. I ran after them, and going along I saw some man at the top of Albemarle-street, coming from Piccadilly. I saw a man running before me; he went into Stafford-street; he was about twenty or five-and-twenty yards before me. When I got about a little way in Stafford-street he came across the road and caught hold of my shoulder. I asked him what he caught hold of me for; he said he did not know; he had his wife with him; he said he had heard the cry of stop thief; he thought I was the person; I said I was not. I knew myself innocent; I made no resistance. I knew nothing of the bag; it was dropped some yards off me.</p>

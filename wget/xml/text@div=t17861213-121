               <p>What passed besides? - He told me that my son ordered him to come and tell me that he was ill used at school at Paris; I said, I could not think any such thing, for he had been three years and a half at school and made no complaints; and I fetched a letter where my son tells me, he is a favourite of his master's, and wishes to have his brother with him; an while I went to fetch the letter, he made shift to take a table spoon; he told me he had come from Paris with only seven shillings and sixpence in his pocket, and he had begged his passage over, and he was in necessity for fifteen pence to pay his lodging; I gave him eighteen pence; and after he was gone about five minutes I missed my table spoon.</p>
               <p>Who let him in? - Another son of mine, about ten years old; my son was never out of the room.</p>
               <p>Upon missing these things what did you do? - I sent my son to tell the maid she had not brought the spoon up, and she told me she had, when she brought the tea things up, she brought three tea spoons up and only took two down; and my son said, the lad was off his chair, and went to the table; then I said, it must be gone that way; so I endeavoured to find the lad in order to clear the maid.</p>
               <p>Then you did not see this table spoon in the room, nor the tea spoon? - No; I traced him out; and took him to Bow-street;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130151"></xptr> and there were two prostitutes said the prisoner was the person; and one of them confessed she sold the spoon for six shillings to a Jew; that the prisoner received the money, and gave it to her; the other woman that bought the tea spoon was bound over to prosecute, but that woman is not to be found; the examination is down here.</p>
               <p>Was you present when this lad was examined? - Yes, I was in the office, and saw him sign it.</p>
               <p>Was that the signature he made? - I was not at the desk; I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the young man say any thing to you when he was taken up? - No, he confessed it to the man that took him to Newgate; I do not know whether he is here or not.</p>

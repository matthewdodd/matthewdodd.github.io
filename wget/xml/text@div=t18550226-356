On 16th Feb., the prisoner was in my service; she had been there nine weeks, and the 10th week she was a servant—on that day, Thursday, she asked me to let her go out—she went out and came home drunk—on Friday she said that she was very ill—I sent some money to her to go to a doctor to have some advice, and she sent it back, saying, that she was not entitled to it—she went away that day, and did not return—I missed the articles stated that afternoon, but cannot say when they were safe, because my wife was ill in bed—I had seen one of those tablecloths on the table the week before.</p>

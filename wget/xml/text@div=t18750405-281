                  </hi>. I am the proprietor of the Opera Hotel, in Bow Street—in August last the prisoner called upon me about publishing a book called the "History of Leicester Square," and asked me if I would have an advertisement in it—I had never seen him before, but he said he was a very great friend of my brother's, had known him for years and it would be a great service to him—I agreed to have the advertisement and I think once or twice he came after that, and the books were published—one night the prisoner came and said "I have run short of money, I want to get to Wandsworth, to my wife and family"—that was about a month after he first introduced himself to me—I. lent him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when he first came a person came with him whom he said was publishing the book—I did not know his name at that time—about the 1st September, or the last day of August, the prisoner brought a cheque for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him who was the drawer of the cheque, and he said "Murray Harding, the gentleman who was with me publishing the book"—I asked him if the cheque was a good one—I said "Do you know it is right"—he said "He has got plenty of money there, he banks at Hoare's, and he has got plenty of money in the bank"—I said "Very well, if you will endorse the cheque I will cash it for you"—he said "You may as well take the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out that I owe you"—I handed him three sovereigns—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the cheque. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "1st September, 1874, Messrs. Hoares, bankers. Pay William Mason, Esq., or bearer, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., Murray Harding." Endorsed "William Mason, W. Hogg.")—I paid that into my bankers, and it was returned to me marked "no account"—no other person who called himself Murray Harding came to my place, except the person who came with Mason, when the book was publishing—he may have come two or three times, perhaps with Mason—I saw the Mr. Murray Harding, who was called at Bow Street—he was not the man who came about the book.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on a warrant on 2nd February, at 20, Sidmouth Street, Gray's Inn Road—the prosecutor was with me, and he said the prisoner was the man who uttered the cheque at his hotel—I told the prisoner I had a warrant for his apprehension, which he read—he said "I am very much surprised at this," and entered into a long conversation with Mr. Hogg with respect to the payment, which it is impossible for me to remember—Mr. Hogg said he should allow the law to take its course—I took the prisoner to Bow Street station in a cab—he said "I am perfectly innocent of uttering the cheque knowing there was no account at the bank; I-know little or nothing of Harding; he was introduced to me by a friend of mine named Ventham; I cashed the cheque and paid it to Ventham at Davies' public-house"—that is a public-house at the corner of Sidmouth Street, called the Mechanic's Larder—I was present at the first hearing at Bow Street—Ventham was called as a witness by the prisoner—he did not attend at the adjourned hearing, and a summons was issued for his attendance.</p>

             sworn. - I am assistant to Mr. Jeremy; the prisoner was our porter, he was taken to Bow-street on the evening of the 7th of November; on the morning of the 8th, I was desired to go up stairs with the prisoner, and another person, he opened his box, and there I found the goods named in the indictment, which are now in Court, they have been in our back shop ever since; I wrote my name upon the end of each of them that I might be able to swear to them again, (looks at them); all these articles were taken out of his box, I missed them, they exactly correspond with the number of yards in the indictment, I know we had the same patterns in the shop; all the printed callicos I can swear to, they have Mr. Jeremy's private mark upon them; and the handkerchiefs have Mr. Jeremy's private mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Are you a relation of Mr. Jeremy's? - A. Yes; a nephew.</p>
               <p>Q. Your's is a very considerable shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And a shop for fashionable articles? - A. If the ladies that come to the shop think them so, we are very well contented.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon do you put your private mark upon your articles, when they come into the shop? - A. The day they come in, if we have time, unless they are goods that Mr. Jeremy has printed himself, and they have his name upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, the private mark is delivered to your customers with the goods? - A.Sometimes we cut the private mark off.</p>
               <p>Q.And the same patterns you have delivered out to customers before now? - A. I dare say we have.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not cut off your private mark? - A. Not always, it is not a rule with us.</p>
               <p>Q. There were more of the same patterns in the shop? - A. There might be another part of the piece.</p>
               <p>Q. A part of the same piece you might have sold before? - A. It is not impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you have not sold some of the same pattern of the pieces you have produced? - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I take it you might have sold it? - A. It is impossible in our line of business to know all these things.</p>
               <p>Q. It is impossible for you to know exactly, till you count up at the end of the day, how much you have sold of each piece, you having a very large business? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell at the end of the next day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How often do you take stock? - A. Once a year.</p>
               <p>Q.Is there any thing in any of these patterns, that you can tell me you had sold no part of the pieces to which they belong? - A. Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a very uncommon pattern, is it not? - A. Not so uncommon but there may be more in London.</p>
               <p>Q. There is nothing particular in the pattern, is there? - A. No; it has two sag ends to it, therefore we have never sold it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived with Mr. Jeremy? - A. I came to him in June last.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of that time, have you seen but one piece of that pattern? - A. Yes; more than that, two or three, perhaps.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Perhaps it might be a week or two? - A. It might.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you last take stock? - A. In July, 1790.</p>
               <p>Q.So long ago as July, 1796? - A. I have within theses three months taken stock, I think it was the seventh of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you generally sell goods with the sag end to them? - A. Yes.</p>

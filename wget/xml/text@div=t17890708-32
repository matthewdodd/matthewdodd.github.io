               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury,</p>
               <p>As I was coming from my work, to go home to breakfast I was overtaken by two young men, whom I knew; as they were going my way, we agreed to go together. but when we came to Mr. Holcomb's house, the young men said they must call for some things; one of them took a key out of his pocket and opened the door, they went in, and desired me to follow them, saying they should not stay a minute; so I went in with them, not thinking any harm, they went up stairs, and I followed them, but soon after we were up stairs, the two young men ran away and several people came up and took me into custody, saying I was going to rob the house. My Lord and Gentlemen, I gave information who the two men were, that took me into the house; I live with my father and mother, and always work hard for my living, and ever bore the character of an honest lad. As that is the truth, and I am totally innocent of the affair, I hope your Lordship and the Gentlemen of the Jury will take<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178907080033"></xptr>it into proper consideration, and not suffer me to come to any further trouble.</p>

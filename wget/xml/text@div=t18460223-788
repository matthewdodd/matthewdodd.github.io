                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker and joiner, and live at No. 13, Crosier-street, Lambeth. The prisoner is married to my sister—they live it No. 3, Halford-terrace, Walworth—I lodged in their house from Jan. to Feb.—on Sunday, the 25th of Jan., in the morning, as I was lying in bed I heard them quarrelling below—it was about half-past seven o'clock, or day-break—I judge that was the time—we had no clock or watch in the house—my mother came into my bed-room—I heard them quarrelling and a severe struggling between Mr. and Mrs. Munton—when the struggling was all over, I heard a voice at the foot of the stairs—I sent my mother down, and told her to call me if I was wanted—my mother went down, and about two minutes afterwards she called me—I went down and saw the prisoner stark naked and covered with blood—I asked him what was the matter—he made no answer—Isaw my sister, and I asked her who did it—she was lying on the ground with her throat cut in the centre, and she feebly pointed to him—I went to the street door and found it double locked and the key taken away—I on that asked the prisoner for the key—"I do not know" was his reply—"You have concealed the key" I said to him—"I do not know" was his reply again—I asked him to lend me a hand to take down the board in front of the parlour window that he was in the habit of cutting out his cloth upon—the white roller blind was down and marks of blood on it—I pulled it off the roller altogether and threw it into the corner of the room—we took the wire blind down, he raised the sash and I got out of the window and called the policeman—Dr. Otway was sent for—he came and attended her for the wound—there was blood on the panels of the folding doors as if squirted upon, and marks of fingers, and likewise round the room, on the looking-glass and on some tea and sugar that laid on the mantel-piece—they have latterly lived on quarrelling terms, anything but happiness—I have heard him use threatening language to her—I heard him go out on the Thursday nigbt pre<lb></lb>vious and return home about one o'clock on Friday morning—when he came home I heard a quarrelling and a knock as if somebody was knocked down, and I went and demanded admittance at the parlour door—it was locked—I heard him knock her down—I went to the street door to call "Police," when my sister came out and put her hand before my mouth—I asked her if he had struck her—I asked her that twice, and she answered "No no, never mind, never mind"—I then went up stairs into my own bed-room, and then I came down and listened to them, and he wanted her to take a false</p>

On Sunday evening, the 25th of Jan., I was fetched to the prisoner's house—I tried to get in at the front door—I could not—it was locked—I was obliged to get in at the window—I found the prisoner's wife lying bleeding, with her throat cut, on her back, in the parlour, near the parlour fire-place—the prisoner was holding her hands, apparently to keep her still—he had his shirt on, and a very great deal of blood upon it—she had her night-gown on and stockings, but no night-cap—the prisoner cried out to me what was he to do—Mr. Sharland, the milkman, was there and the brother—I said, "Send for the doctor immediately," and we sent for one—at the time the man was gone for the doctor the prisoner asked his wife who did it—she gave no answer, but looked very hard—I asked her who did it, and she looked very hard but gave no answer—she looked at both of us—we were both before her—I found this razor at the right side of the woman, and the left side of the man, about as far from her as she could reach with her right arm, and about where he was kneeling with his left knee—it was not quite close—there was blood on the handle, as it is now, and partly closed—Mr. Otway came to the door—he tried to come in—I asked the pri<lb></lb>soner for the key—he said he did not know where it was he was sure—Mr. Otway got in at the window afterwards—after she was removed to the bed I asked the prisoner where the key was, and he went to his coat pocket and took it out—when I asked him before, he said he did not know where it was, for he was out having a glass or two on the Saturday night—after that the prisoner asked her who did it, and I asked her who did it, and she laid still and looked very hard—she then rose herself up in the bed and shook hands with him, and kissed him, and pointed and showed him where some money was, which he found under the bed—I saw him take it from there—some pen, ink, and paper were given to her a few minutes after—the prisoner was there at that time—she then wrote these words on this paper—(producing it)—I took the prisoner into custody—she held up her fist at me, as though she dared me to touch him, and then I put my hand out and shook hands with him.</p>

About twenty minutes or a quarter past seven o'clock I heard in the adjoining house a man and woman quarrelling and fighting in the pas<lb></lb>sage—I distinctly heard two voices, male and female, but the parties are strangers to me—I know it came from No. 3—I heard a great deal of most foul and abusive language—I heard the man distinctly say, "D—n you, you will halloo murder again, will you," and I heard the woman immediately afterwards give a kind of shriek—they appeared to me then to retire into the front parlour—they appeared to be in the passage before—I went up stairs, and looked out at the first-floor window, and heard somebody call for assist<lb></lb>ance, for the doctor, and police, and call murder, but I did not go in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at No. 11, Canter<lb></lb>bury-row. On Sunday, the 25th of Jan., I was called to No. 3, Halford<lb></lb>terrace, and saw a woman lying in the front parlour—the prisoner was by her side, with his left hand on her throat, and his right hand in one of her hands—he desired me to come in, and said, "You see what this has come to, Mr. Otway"—(I had been called in two days before on account of a quarrel which had taken place in the family, and I then gave them some advice, and left them)—I had the woman removed on to the bed, and examined her throat—it was a short, clean wound, about an inch and a half long, half sepa<lb></lb>rating the windpipe—blood was issuing from it, and also passing down the throat—it was such a wound as would be likely to be caused by such an instrument as this (a razor)—she did not appear quite sensible when I first saw her—I dressed the wound after some time—the prisoner was very much agitated during the whole time when the expressions were made use of by her friends—the wife made signs to me, intended to lead me to the opinion that she did it herself, and she several times shook hands with her husband, and caressed him—after she recovered a little, she spoke to me, but she could only speak in a whisper—I said if she had anything to say, she had better write it down, as she ought not to speak, but she said, "I did it myself"—she repeated it in a low tone—a paper was given to her, and she wrote on it—this is it—she at first wrote—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>) "I did it myself through distress of mind; pray, my dear Fred., take care of our dear Arthur, for your poor Ann's sake; will you be father and mother for ever; do not charge my mother and brother with anything, they are innocent"—she signed that in the presence of the po<lb></lb>liceman and myself, at our request—I said to her, "Your mother and brother are not charged with anything; you have heard what your mother hat said, have you anything to say about your husband?"—she in great excitement wished to write again—I had the brother and mother, with the policeman, present, and she wrote these words, "Nor my husband," in their presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is your opinion as to the mode in which the wound was in<lb></lb>flicted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I consider a razor must have been taken, and the head thrown back so as to protrude the throat, and the razor just pushed there—I think if a man had taken the razor, he would take a sweep as if cutting his own throat, but a female would handle a razor in a very different manner.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You think it was given by herself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do—I think if it had been done by another person, it would have been rather a larger wound—if it had been deeper, it would have cut through the large blood-vessels—this had just cut the windpipe—it was not such a sweeping wound as would have been done by a man—if there had been any resistance or struggling, I think there would have been more wounds, or it would have been an irregular wound—it would be very likely to be a clean cut—I form my notion that it was done by herself, from the small extent of the wound, and the cleanness of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If there had been considerable struggling previous to and at the time the wound was inflicted, it was not at all likely to have pre<lb></lb>sented these appearances? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Decidedly not—if it was inflicted by a man intending to cut her throat, it would have been a larger and stronger wound—ifthe head had been down, it would have cut through the carotid artery—the head being thrown up, would throw the windpipe forward, and that was cut through—there was no danger to her, except from the excitement the friends got her into—the mother was very greatly excited, and I told her if she was quiet I should be obliged to have her removed—she was saying he was a villain, and he did it—I had been called in on the previous Thursday, in consequence of a quarrel between the mother and brother and her—the prisoner himself sent for me then—I had never seen him before—he was not a patient of mine—he exhibited on that occasion affection and interest about his wife—she was then very excited, rushing out of bed, throwing herself on her knees to her mother, and begging her to leave the house—she exhibited no want of affection towards her husband—I believe the mother said they had been so often quarrelling, and the brother also, and he said he would not leave the house, being determined to protect her, but the whole time she was begging them to leave—it is decidedly my belief, having examined the wound, that it was inflicted by her own hands.</p>

                  </hi>.

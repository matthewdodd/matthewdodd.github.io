               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Jones is not the person you saw at the door? A. That I cannot say - I never said he was not the person; Mrs. Buxton passed me as I stood at my door - the man at that time stood at the door; he drew back into the house before I saw him - I could see him head, but not his body for the wall.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 22nd of April, from a quarter to half-past eleven o'clock, I was at the back of the Tyssen Arms, Dalston, and I observed the three prisoners at the bar running towards me - I am certain of them; when they saw me, they stopped running, and walked very slowly by me - I looked after them; Jones was then in the rear of the other two - he had a stick in one hand, which he knocked against the pales, and said to the other two, "She is caming;" I had not got many yards further before I met Wright, and from what he said I went after them; I saw them pass Smith's nursery, - I did not see any thing thrown away, but I had information; looked over the pales, and saw a bag; Wright jumped over, and took it up; he took it to the station - I never saw it opened; I followed the prisoners to Hackney, and then lost all trace of them; I then gave information to the Police who were on duty there, and they were taken the same day - as I returned back to the house which was robbed, I found a piece of a key sticking out of the door; I have kept it ever since - as I could not get it out, I sent for a blacksmith, who took it out, and I have it here; I saw it compared with the piece of a key which Wright found, and in my opinion it is part of that key - I have some tea which Cockrell gave me.</p>

            . I live in Morning-lane, about a mile from Malkin's. On this Sunday I was walking across Pigwell-field, and saw the three prisoners running; they are the men - I never saw them before; they were about half a mile from Malkin's house - I lost sight of them for about half a mile, but before that I saw the middle one wiping his face with a handkerchief, and one of them take something out of a piece of white paper, and put into his pocket; I cannot say which of them it was - I saw them again at Homerton, walking in Mr. Bristow's field; I saw Jones, the Policeman, and gave him information - he and Robson ran after them, and they were all three apprehended; I am sure they are the three men I had seen before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you been in custody yourself? A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Jones' Defence. I was going to the washerwoman for my linen, and no doubt went by Malkin's house; a boy came up to me there, and said there had been a robbery committed down there; I went back, saw nothing, and went on - then a girl came up to me, and said, "There they go down there;" I immediately followed as far as Marsh-gate, where I was taken - they were quite out of sight then; the brooch belongs to me, I have had it a long time.</p>
               <p>Robinson's Defence. The Policeman says he took the key out of my cuff - I had it in my pocket, and threw it out at the station from my pocket; he caught hold of my hand, and said, "You are going to put it up your cuff;" I declare I never was in the house.</p>
               <p>Godfrey's Defence (written.) - I went to Ball's-pond to see a person, of the name of Mrs. Maisham, who was very ill, and is since dead; and likewise to call on a relation of hers, for whom I had fixed a stove the week before, and who told me they had a copper and another stove to fix; and my object of calling was to ascertain when they would have it done; as I was entering the gate of their house, I heard the cry of Stop them! I turned round, and saw some persons running; I run after them, and had overtaken them as the Police came up, and took me into custody - in regard to the money found on me, 2l. of it was given to me by my deceased friend; the rest of it I received from my father for work done for him, and the rest from other people for whom I had worked. I have a father and mother who have brought up a large family, who never brought any disgrace on them; and sorry am I to think, by my running after the mob, I have inadvertently brought this trouble on myself. I am truly innocent of the charge, but should it please God that I get through this trouble, I will strictly guard my actions.</p>
               <p>Four witnesses gave both Jones and Godfrey a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer and bookseller at 170, High-street, Whitechapel—the female prisoner came into my service on 28th Aug. On Sunday morning, 2d Sept., I went to Church with my wife, leaving the pri<lb></lb>soner in the house—I returned a few minutes after one o'clock, and was not able to get in—I afterwards got in at the window—I could not find the pri<lb></lb>soner—I found my bedroom in a very disturbed state, and missed five or six brushes, some ruby studs, a gold chain, a pencil-case, a tea-spoon, and a great variety of other property—this gold pencil-case, gold chain, silver ring, two shawls, and all these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced by Kelly</hi>) formed a portion of what I missed—I communicated with the police, and on 6th Sept. accompanied the policeman to the New Cut, where we found both prisoners, and they were taken into custody—the female had then a dress of my wife's and a shawl on, part of the missing property, and the man some trowsers of mine.</p>

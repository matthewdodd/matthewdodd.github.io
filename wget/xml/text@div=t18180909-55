On the 9th of May the prisoner came to my shop; I only saw him once, but am certain he is the man. He bought goods to the amount of 3s. 8d. or 4s. and paid me a 1l. bank note, for which I gave him change, and asked his name and address, he said Haynes, 24, Helmet-row (looking at a 1l. note), this is that which he gave me, it has that address upon it, in my hand-writing. I wrote it in his presence. I had only opened this shop on that day, but had been in business seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you made inquiry if such a person lived there - A. Yes; the note was returned about a week after I took it. I then went there and found only eighteen houses in the row; I inquired for Haynes, but could find no such person.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Bath-street, City-road, I have lived there six years. About the beginning of May the prisoner bought a pair of shoes at my shop, which came to 7s. or 7s. 6d.; he ordered a pair of dancing pumps; I measured him; they were to be done in about a week, and sent to 25, Seward-street, which is a short distance from my house. He paid for the shoes with a 1l. note, I asked his name, he said Pask, which I put on the note, and put my initials to it, I did not write his address on it. I sent out for change, while he was there, and gave him the difference, and wrote his address on the measure. This is the note (looking at it).</p>
               <p>Q. There is 25, Seward-street, on the note - A. I do not know who put it there; it might have been put there before or after. I am quite sure it is the note he paid me.</p>
               <p>Q. When the pumps were finished, what did you do with them - A. I sent William Porter, my errand-boy, with them. The note was returned about a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell the magistrate that you did not write the name on the note - A. No; I might have said I did not write the address.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Edwards. I remember the prisoner coming to my master's for a pair of shoes. he was served with them, and ordered a pair of pumps. My master put his name on the note and on the measure. The pumps were made in about a week. I took them to Seward-street, but could find no such number as 25. There are above twenty-five houses, but no No. 25. I inquired for Pask, at almost every house. but could find no such person. The prisoner never called for the pumps; he paid a 1l. note for the shoes.</p>

               <p>THOMAS VANN. I am constable of St. Luke's, On Monday the 29th of June I apprehended the prisoner, and took him to a public-house. Before I searched him, I asked what money he had about him, he said he had only 18d. and a few browns, meaning halfpence. I searched, and found 18d. and a few halfpence on him, and in his fob I found a bank note. I inquired where he got it, he said he should not tell me, but he would satisfy the magistrate. I had said nothing to him about the magistrate. I had told him I thought it was a bad one, as we went along in the coach, he said he found it in the City-road, a week ago, with 2s.; I put my name on it in his presence (looking at one), this is it. I believe I gave him the number.</p>

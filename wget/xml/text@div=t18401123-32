Jolly was brought to the station-house, in Black-horse-court, Fleet-street, on another charge—he tried to get away—I went to assist, and at the door I saw Jolly put his hand behind him, and Calladine attempt to take something from him, and this purse was dropped, which I took up—it has a piece of paper in it, and a half-franc piece.</p>

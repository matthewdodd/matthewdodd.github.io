                  </hi>. I am a process server of 5, Peter Street, Horsley<lb></lb>down—on Friday night, 20th April, about ten minutes past 10, I was in High-street, Borough, passing the corner of a narrow court, and the prisoner seized me by the collar with one hand, and in front with the other, tripped my heels up, and laid me on my back—there was another man with him who put his hands into my trousers pocket, but there was nothing there—he then put his hand into my waistcoat pocket and took out three penny pieces and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am positive the prisoner is the man—the other man sprang away to the left towards London Bridge—I should know him again—I was struggling with the prisoner, when a policeman came down the court—the prisoner <hi rend="italic">bobbed</hi> from me to the right towards the Mint and into High-street, and the policeman after him, who caught him and brought him back, and I gave him in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say he laid you on your back, did he do it violently? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he tripped my heels up—I was perfectly sober—I did not at first say that it was half-past nine o'clock—if I said so at the Police-court in my confusion it was not so, and I think you will find in my evidence that I said ten minutes past 10, but I was really unnerved and knocked about—the constable was coming down the court from High-street—I heard the prisoner give his address up that court—there was violence used, he hit my head on the pavement and knocked me about—I said nothing about that before, I was not asked—I charged him with robbery next morning, and with assault—I had come from Tooley-street—I had been at Mr. Fescons, the Britannia public-house, for half or three quarters of in hour writing a letter.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman M</hi> 286.) On 20th April I was coming down a little court from High-street, Borough, and heard Blowfield say. "It is no use knocking me down and robbing me, for I have nothing to rob"—I found him on the ground, and saw the prisoner leave him—I went after him, met him, and asked him to come back with me—he did so, and Blowfield gave him in charge, but he escaped from me, and was stopped by another constable—I searched him and found a knife and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7½<hi rend="italic">d</hi>

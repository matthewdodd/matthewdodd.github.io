            . I am the patrol. On Thursday night, the 7th of May, about half past nine, I was going on to patrol, I heard a shop in my beat had lost two hats.</p>
               <p>Q. What, Mr. Smith's shop - A. No, another in St. George's parish, and in going round my beat I met the prisoner with some hats under his arm; I asked him what he had got; he did not tell me; I said, you have got hats; I told him there had been some hats stolen that night, I must take him to the shop, and see if them were the hats that they had lost; he said he would go with me, he had them of one Mr. Franks. In walking along with me he tried to make his escape, I ran after him, and stopped him, and took him and the hats that he had with him to Mr. Sheppard, who had lost two hats; Mr. Sheppard said they were neither of them his.</p>
               <p>Q. How many hats were there - A. Seven. Then I took him to the watchhouse, and gave charge of him, and left the hats at the watchhouse till the morning in the charge of Mr. Jackson, the beadle. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

            . I was the beadle of the night. On Thursday last Ordley brought the prisoner into the watchhouse about ten minutes before ten; he brought seven hats with him, I kept the prisoner in custody till the next morning; I took the prisoner and the hats before the magistrate; Mr. Smith came forward the next day and claimed the hats. The prisoner said that a boy went into the shop, took the hats, and gave them him to carry. The hats have been in my possession ever since.</p>

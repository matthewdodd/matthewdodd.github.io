                  </hi>. I am Inspector of the R division of police. I am on duty in Woolwich Dockyard—on 6th October last I went with Inspector Townsend to certain premises in the Belvidere-road, Lambeth—there is a wharf there, and a shed at the wharf—I went into the shed, and found a quantity of rope of different sizes—on seeing it, and being used to the Go<lb></lb>vernment rope, I believed part of it to be Government rope—we removed two or three hundredweight of rope from the top, but that was not Govern<lb></lb>ment rope—it was all in the shed—the Government rope was under the other—we did not remove the top rope then—after leaving that, I went to a barge lying at the Old Gunshot Wharf, taking in manure—I saw the barge<lb></lb>man, Gearing—I searched the barge in company with Townsend—upon going to the edge of the wharf I saw on the bounds of the barge a quantity of rope—I went on board, looked at it, and found it was Government rope; there was about 23 3/4 fathoms of it—we went back to the wharf with the man in charge of the barge, and I then went to the defendant's house, but did not see him there—I saw him in the course of that evening—I said, "I have come to see you respecting this rope affair;" he said, "Very well, I can very satisfactorily account for it"—I said, "I am very glad"—I have known him many years—he said, "I bought the rope from a person of the name of Clapham, who keeps the Rainham ferry-house, in Essex"—I said, "Your bargeman is locked up for having a quantity in his possession; but the Magistrate has taken a very lenient view of it, and allowed him to go on bail till 12 o'clock on Saturday, when I hope you will appear, as he stated to the Magistrate that it was supplied by you to him"—he said, "I will; I bought it of Clapham"—when I spoke to him about it, I mentioned that it was Government rope.</p>

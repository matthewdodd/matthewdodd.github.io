               <p>Q. Who is that woman? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the solemn oath you have taken, did you take that handkerchief out of your bosom, and put it into the man's pocket? - A. No; I will be upon my solemn oath I took it out of the man's pocket; the officer has the property.</p>

               <p>Did you follow up that accusation, by taking him up before any justice of the Peace? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that charge was it before you made this charge, and got the present warrant? - A. That was on Monday, the 11th, and on the 14th I took him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from the 11th to the 14th you did not make any complaint before any Justice? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make this complaint till after he had, by his attorney, served you with a writ for defamation? - A. I did not mean to hurt him, because I could not swear to the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you served with a writ, at the suit of the defendant, for defamation? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any charge, before any Justice, till after that writ was served? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. At the time you took it out of the pocket, how was Smith engaged? - A. Smith was there searching his pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you desired him to search the prisoner's person, while you searched the room? - A. No, I had not.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200030"></xptr>Court. Q. Smith was the person to search? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to search; what business had your hands in his coat pocket? - A. I never had any thing of the kind before, and I did not know that I should not.</p>
               <p>EDWARD SMITH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I searched the prisoner's boxes; I found in one of the boxes this piece of cotton, (produces it); and this piece of list, (produces it); the prisoner came in while I was there, with the keys, and unlocked them himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the prisoner did not hang back at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not shew any unwillingness? - A. Not the least; but said, you villain, I have none of your property, you may search.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find the handkerchief? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you order the other witness to search his pockets? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did you observe him when he put his hands in his pocket? - A. After I had searched the room, he requested me to search the prisoner, which I did; while I was searching the prisoner, the prosecutor came with a coat which was hanging behind the door, he came with it upon his arm, and I heard him exclaim, you d - d villain, you have robbed me of my handkerchief; I immediately looked round, and saw the prosecutor's hand coming out of the pocket, with a bit of blue paper, and this handkerchief in it, folded up, I presume in so small a compass as this, (produces it); he desired I would take charge of him; I told him I had got charge of him, and I took him before the Magistrate; there was a woman standing in the room at the same time, her name is Ann Smith.</p>
               <p>Court. As she was present, I shall call her as one of the witnesses for the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did not Ann Smith charge the prosecutor with putting the handkerchief into the coat pocket of the prisoner? - A. yes; I heard her say, I saw you take that from your besom, and put it into the coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been ill, I understand? - A. Yes, I have for the last three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any inducement held out to you, by the prosecutor, to appear here, and he would do any thing for you? - A. He desired me to attend here, and if I was not well, he would send me into the country; when the prosecutor said, there is a silk handkerchief, the prisoner said, then you villain, you must have put it there, for the coat has been hanging there for a month.</p>
               <p>Court. Nothing is so improbable as that a man should steal that which is the only thing that could convince him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. It is very important to the prisoner that his whole case should be heard.</p>
               <p>Jury. We wish to have the woman examined.</p>
               <p>ANN SMITH sworn, - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the officer coming to search his apartments? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prosecutor there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what you observed? - A. I went up when the prisoner went up; he took the keys out of his pocket and unlocked his boxes; the officer listed the lids of the boxes up; the officer then bid Mr. Jacob look and stand by him, and he came immediately and put his hands into the boxes and would search himself; there was nothing in that box; the next box he listed up the lid, and the officer said, do give me leave to excuse my duty myself; Mr. Jacob would not give the officer leave to execute his duty, but would do it for him, and be pulled out a bit of list, and a bit of fag end of cotton, and swore that was his property; there were two boxes in the room that belonged to the gentlewoman of the house, which had been left for rent; Mrs. Minton gave the officer leave to break them open, and told him he might search all her house without a search-warrant; the officer forced the boxes open, upon which Mr. Jacob took a pair of pantaloons from the back of the door, and searched them; then he took a great coat and searched it, and hung it up again; immediately the officer came and took hold of Price to search his pockets, which he had on his back; then Mr. Jacob took down this coat again, and put his hand to his bosom and took out something in a blue paper; he cried out, d-n your eyes you bl - y thief, here is my property, my handkerchief, before he opened the paper to see what was in it; upon that I called out immediately, you are putting that into the man's pocket you wicked man; upon which the officer turned round and all of them.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Smith). Did you hear the woman? - A. I heard her say something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Court. I think we have gone too far already.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I wish to state, in the hearing of the Court, that I have persons of the greatest respectability in the trade, who would have told you that these are perquisites.</p>
               <p>The Court, the Counsel on both sides, and the Jury, expressed their abhorrence of the prosecution, and stated that they were perfectly satisfied of the prisoner's innocence. <rs id="t18010520-45-verdict243" type="verdictDescription">

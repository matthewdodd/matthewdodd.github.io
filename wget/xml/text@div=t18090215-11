               <p>Q. Did the prisoner live with you - A. He did, about four months; he served in the shop, and he has been in the habit of receiving money in the shop, and payments for my corn as he delivered it to the customers.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of his having embezzled the amount of your seven pence halfpenny - A. I learned the statement from my wife and servant; I was in the country at the time.</p>

            . Q. Are you the wife of the last witness - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what you know of this man having concealed money of your husband's - A. On Wednesday the 1st of February my husband went out of town; on the Thursday I asked the servant if Richard had been much engaged; she said yes. I went into the shop, he gave me less money than I expected.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been serving in the shop that day - A. Yes. In the evening of Thursday I gave her a slate, and told her to take down every thing he sold in the ensuing morning, with the money that he received. The money he took for the articles sold the girl told me was one shilling and seven pence. The shop opens between seven and eight, and about nine o'clock when I came down, the girl gave me the account. I asked the prisoner what money he had received; he said the money was under the desk; I took it, it was eleven pence halfpenny; I asked him if that was all; he said yes; he was not taken up till Mr. Austin detected him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Is your servant a scholar - A. She can write and cast accounts in a common way.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you do not know whether that account is right or not, you depended upon her - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The slate is not here - A. No, it was copied on paper and rubbed out of the slate.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought so - and the gentleman who was present copied it - A. The girl copied it from the slate into paper.</p>
               <p>Q. That paper is to be produced here today - A. Yes; I copied one, and she copied another.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was copied first you cannot say - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Were there more than two copies made from the slate - A. One by a gentleman in the family; there were three copies. Mr. Austin has the copy that the girl made.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Have you the copy you made yourself - A. No.</p>

            . I was servant to Mr. Austin at this time. On Friday morning I made an entry on a slate of what money the prisoner took, and what goods he sold; I had the slate up stairs in the kitchen; when I heard the customers come in, I went in the shop and staid till they went away; then I went up stairs and put down the article sold and the price on the slate; I took a copy on paper from the slate, and rubbed the articles out of the slate.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you shewn the slate to your mistress before you rubbed out the sum - A. Yes; my mistress took the first account; a gentleman took it from my mistress's, and I took it from the gentleman's.</p>

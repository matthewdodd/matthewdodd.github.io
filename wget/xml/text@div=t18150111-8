            . I live at Whetstone. On Saturday, the 2nd of December, I overtook the prisoner at Barnet, he was walking and leading the horse, a little bay horse with black legs. I said, my friend it is very dark, why do not you ride the horse; he said, he was going to Windsor for some horses. I said how came it you have not a saddle; as we were going along, he said, he had the horse to sell, if I can get money to satisfy my master and some for myself. I asked him what he wanted for it; he said twenty-five guineas for it. I said, will you take twenty pounds for it; he said, no. We came into the County of Middlesex; he said, he would take twenty-five pounds. I saw the patrole; I told him what I suspected. He agreed to take twenty pounds if I would treat him with a bottle of wine. I took him into custody. I have since given up the horse to Mr. Pentalow. As I was taking the prisoner to the cage, he confessed that he had stolen it; he was taken to the Justice and committed.</p>

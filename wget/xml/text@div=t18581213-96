               <p>Hampstead-road—a little after 6 o'clock in the evening of 15th November, I was in Russell-square, and was accosted by the female prisoner and a boy—they both stopped me, and asked me the way to Tottenham-court-road—I directed them, they were a long time before they could understand me—during that time the woman and the boy were close to me—I had before this a purse in my pocket containing 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had felt it in my pocket the moment before they accosted me—they were some minutes close to me—I had my purse in a pocket attached to my dress under the top flounce—it was easily <hi rend="italic">come-at-able</hi>; I generally carry it in my hand, but being early in the evening I was not afraid—the instant they left me, before they had got above a yard, I felt for my purse and found it was gone—at the same time a gentleman came up and asked me if I missed anything—I said I missed my purse—I cannot say whether the female heard what passed—the gentleman and I went after her and overtook her—the boy ran through a turning facing us, and ran away—just after the boy ran away, a man came up and asked what was the matter—I believe the male prisoner to be that man—he asked what was the matter—I told him that I had been robbed, and would he fetch a policeman?—he said, "I think we had better walk on, we shall see one presently," and we walked on—the gentleman, and I, and the prisoners—the prisoners walked very close to each other—I said something to the gentleman, and he said to the male prisoner, "Don't go so close to that woman;" the man directly turned round and took hold of the gentleman's collar, and punched him in the face on each side severely, and got him down on the ground—I turned round to see what they were about—the gentleman said, "Never mind, you keep your eye upon the woman—she began to run—I followed her leaving the man and the gentleman—as I was running after her, some one behind me knocked me down—I could not see whether it was a man or a woman, but I believe it to have been a man—I fell down—I got up again and still ran after the woman, crying out "Stop thief!"—after she had run some distance, a gentleman stopped her—we stood a few minutes together—the prisoner said, "We had better walk on, we shall see a policeman presently"—I said, "No, I have had one run, I wish you to remain here until a policeman comes"—I am sure she is the woman—I never lost sight of her.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Henry-street, Pentonville. On Monday evening, 15th November, about 6 o'clock, I was passing through Russell square on my way to Tottenham-court-road—I was running across the road being in a great hurry—I heard the prosecutrix say to the female prisoner, either that they were going in quite the right direction or coming in the wrong direction—this excited my suspicion, and I stopped—I saw the female prisoner screening a young lad who was in the act of fumbling at the prosecutrix's dress—I cannot say whether he was abstracting the purse from her pocket, but it looked very much like it; at that moment the female and the lad left—I directly asked the proeecutrix if she had lost anything—she felt, and said yes—I turned round—the female prisoner was not more than three or four yards from us at that time—the lad ran on round the square—I held the female—she said, it was not her—I said I knew it was her, and I should detain her—at that moment the male prisoner came up and asked, "What is the matter?"—the proeecutrix told him that she had lost her purse—he advised her to walk towards King-street to a police-station which he said was there, and he would find a policeman—I told him there was no station there, but there was one in George-street—he said, the best way was to walk through Keppel-street—I said, "Very well then, have it your own way and walk on"—I and the prosecutrix walked behind—the prisoners walked towards Montague-street, and when they got to the corner they were very close together—I stepped between them—the male prisoner turned round and asked what I meant, and tried to knock me down—I caught bold of him and he put his foot behind me, threw roe down, and fell upon me—there was another man in company with them, standing close by at the time, and when I was on the ground he came and held me down, saying at the same time, "Don't hurt the man while he is down"—the male prisoner got up and they both ran away—I ran after them up Montague-street—I am positive that the male prisoner is the man that threw me down—the lamps were lighted—it was immediately under a lamp that he turned round and asked me what I meant, and I had a full view of him, and also when I caught hold of him—I am quite positive he is the man—I got up, got my hat, and followed him, and as I was running I found that the other party who had had hold of me while the prisoner got away, had knocked down the prosecutrix—I saw him do it—I overtook the female prisoner as she was running, detained her, and gave her in charge.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 158.) On the 31st of August I was on duty in the Old Kent-road—at half-past ten o'clock I saw a wagon with three horses draw up to the Half-way-house, with the name of Robert Weatherly, of Stone, in Kent, on it—Bennett was driving it—I saw him, with the assistance of Nash, the head ostler, take the horses out, and take them to the stable—I saw a truss of hay on the wagon, and after Bennett had remained some time in the stable, I saw him come and take a sack from the wagon, which appeared to contain corn—he took it into the stable, waited a short time, then came to the wagon again, took off the truss of hay, and took that into the stable—he remained in that stable, which was the front stable, for some time, and when he went in he ap<lb></lb>peared to turn to the right—when he came out he went into the public-house</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183909160180"></xptr>
               <p>—I then went into the stable, and saw about nine horses there, eat<lb></lb>ing chaff and corn—I saw a truss of hay in the manger on the right hand—there were no horses within five yards of the hay—I examined the man<lb></lb>ger, and found they were eating chaff and corn—while Bennett was in the public-house I saw Wigley come from a back stable, and remove the truss of hay from the front stable to the back stable—he appeared to take it from the right hand, the same direction in which I had seen Bennett go, and he appeared to take it into the back stable—Wigley then came to the shed in the front stable, and began to clean knives—some time after Bennett came from the public-house, and went into the front stable—he brought the horses out, and Wigley assisted him in putting them to the wagon—Bennett then drove away—after he was gone I said to Wigley, "What hay did the wagoner leave here?"—he seemed confused, and said, "None at all"—I said, "I saw you take a truss of hay out of this stable" he said, If you say that, you tell a great lie"—I said, "Show me the back-stable"—he said, "You can go, the door is open"—I said, "I would rather you go too"—he went with me into the back-stable—I saw a truss of hay, which appeared to me to be the one I had seen before—there was no other there—it was inside the door of the back-stable on the left—I said, "What hay is this?"—he said he did not know—I said, "How came it here?"—he said, "I don't know, without it came from Mr. Smith, over the way"—I said, "I shall take it"—he said, "If you do you will get in a hobble when Nash comes home"—I then went to Mr. Smith's over the way, and after I had seen him I sent my brother officer after Bennett.</p>

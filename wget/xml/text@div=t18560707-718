               <p>standing at the corner of Mason's-place and saw the prisoner and the deceased in the street—the prisoner pulled off his jacket, threw it down against the wall of one of the houses and said to the deceased, "Now come on"—they began to square up at one another in a dodging position; they closed in on each other and seemed to have hold of each other's arms—the prisoner then placed his head against the deceased's stomach and gave him a throw and over he went and pitched on bis head, and he seemed to roll on one shoulder and then on his back—he fell on the stones—I ran up to the prisoner and clapped my hands together and said, "You villain, you have killed the man"—he made use of a bad word, and said he hoped he had killed him—I then returned to the poor man, some one was helping him up, I assisted in raising his head and he said, "My good friends, lay my legs straight for I am dying, I am dying, the Lord have mercy on my soul—I went and fetched a basin of water, and when I returned he was being removed—he appeared to have been drinking—the prisoner might have been drinking, but he appeared to me to be sober, he appeared more sober than the other man—the policeman was there when I returned with a candle, they wanted a candle to see where he was hart—the prisoner still stood there—I heard some one say he was given into custody, he did not offer to run away, he walked quietly along and helped the deceased into Mr. Beck's, the doctor's.</p>

On the night in question, from in<lb></lb>formation I went to Mr. Beck's, a surgeon in the Westminster-road—I saw the prisoner and the deceased there, and a person named Buahby—the pri<lb></lb>soner said that he had had a few words with the deceased about drinking a pot of beer at Mr. Langton's wharf, in the Belvidere-road, that the deceased called him a <hi rend="italic">rat</hi>, and he said, "If you call me that again, I will slap your face," that they came outside the public house in Mason-street intending to have a fight, they had two rounds and the deceased fell on his head—the doctor aaid it was only a slight wound, and the man was taken to his own house—the prisoner had been drinking, but was not drunk—he was not taken into custody at that time, not till the Coroner's inquest was held.</p>

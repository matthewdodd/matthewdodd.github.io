On the 27th of December, at a quarter past eleven o'clock in the morning, I missed this deal, which I had seen safe a quarter of an hour before, tied to a ladder at a house, to prevent people going up. The two ends were bound with iron, and it had two holes in it. Rohan has worked for me. I found it with one end cut off, and the other three parts off.</p>

            . I was looking out of window, and saw Rohan up the ladder before the house. He had worked for my husband, and I thought he might have been sent for it. He untied the rope, and brought the board down, and as he did not come towards our house, I went out and followed him to Blue Anchor-yard, and saw him push it down Macrae's cellar, which is about one hundred yards off; he staid down there about two minutes, then came out and went into Macrae's shop. I looked down the cellar, and saw Macrae sewing the end off; I said,</p>
               <p>"Don't saw that board, it is my husband's." He said he did not care for me or my husband. I sent an officer down, and he threw the board up, with one end sawn off, and the other nearly off. Rohan was so much in liquor, that, although I was close to him, he did not know me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know one Buckley - A. That is my maiden name. I have a brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Somebody of your name has been prosecuted, and Macrae's relation appeared against him - A. My brother has been unfortunate, and Macrae's wife has insulted me about it. I have heard of one Watson being hung - he was not concerned with my brother; I do not wish to hurt her husband - I did not wish to bring Rohan to justice, but Macrae insisted on going before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner ROHAN. Q. What character have I borne - A. He was an honest upright man - my husband offered to take 2 s. 6 d. for the board, but the officer said it would be compounding felony; and when we got near the Office, Macrae was willing to pay the money.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was fetched to Macrae's, and found him standing in the yard - the board laid outside his house, with the piece which was sawn off. Dartnell said,</p>
               <p>"Now, Macrae, if you will give me 2 s. 6 d. for the board, I don't want to have a piece of work about it - if you would satisfy the officers;" he said he would give 2 s. 6 d., but would not satisfy the officers. I would not let them settle it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was willing to go - A. Yes; he said he bought the board of Rohan. I asked what he gave for it; he said that was no matter, they could not value it at more than 11 d. Macrae told the Magistrate that gave 6 d. for it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the prisoners sign this paper (handing it) - A. Yes, (read.)</p>
               <p>"The prisoner Macrae says he bought the board of Rohan, for 6 d., and he told him it was his own property. Rohan says he borrowed the board of E. Dartnell."</p>

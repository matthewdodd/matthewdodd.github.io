On the 23d of March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner with two others came into to my house, apparently as if they had just met on the spot, they called for a glass of liquor a piece; the prisoner presented me a one pound Billericay note to pay for three glasses of liquor that came to about nine-pence. This is the note, I marked it at the back; it is a one pound Billericay note. I told him I could not give him change of a one pound note; then one of them said, you may as well have your liquor here as any where else; they had a bottle of brandy and a pint of gin; I told them I had about ten shillings of change; Carpenter presented me the same one pound note; I said, I do no not like the note; I objected to it because it was a country note; Carpenter then said, you must give me change for a five pound note; I saw it was a Southampton note; I had suspicion it was a forged note; I thought I had better give change for the one pound note.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did not you think it would be better not to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180005"></xptr>give change for either of them if it was a forgery - A. Yes, but I saw the place in town, I thought the one pound note might be a good one, he said, they were all as good as the Bank, he took them all in Smithfield that morning; he had a pocket-book full. He said he had a friend in the lock-up-house. I was not to take for the bottle he would return it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you give him change for the note - A. Yes, I gave Carpenter the change, somewhere about ten shillings. When they went away, Carpenter said, if any body should enquire for Harding, to say they should he here and spend the evening; then they went away; they did not come in the evening; and then I suspected it was a bad note; this was on Friday. On Monday morning I presented the note to No. 31, Addle-street where it specified on the note to be payable; the landlord of the house informed me, there had been a party there that came to swindle people.</p>

            . Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. No. I live at present in Size-lane. I had a house in Addle-street, I left that house 1809, I had it in 1808, the number was 31; a man of the name of Butler took an accompting-house of me, he called himself an agent, that was in 1808, I never saw Mr. Butler there after it was taken, his clerks as he called them were there from four to five months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what business they were carrying on there - A. I understood they had to do with the Billericay bank; they left my house towards the latter end of February 1809; they came in the morning with a cart and horse to remove the desks and the fitting up of the accompting-house; I prevented that and stopped the desk. I saw Mr. Butler afterwards; he sent his broker to value the articles; and I gave him the difference.</p>

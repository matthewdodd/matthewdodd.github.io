            . My husband left me at home. After he went out, I took down two watches, and put them on the counter. Carroll came in, and wanted a watch repaired. I said, I could say nothing about it; he put it into his pocket again, and went out, and in about ten minutes, I missed Poole's watch, I never saw the prisoner.</p>

On the 17th of November, about half past five o'clock in the evening, I was out, and as I returned, I saw the prisoner sitting in a cart. I found Carroll in the shop, talking to my sister; he said he wanted to see a gold seal, she told me to fetch my brother, which I did, and in coming back, I met them both in the cart together.</p>

            . My sister fetched me: when I got to the shop, nobody was there - I missed a gold chain, she mentioned about the cart - I pursued and overtook it at Phillimore Place, Kensington. Carroll and the prisoner were in it, I got assistance. Cox jumped out and was secured; I took Carroll, and a watch was found on each; the one found on the prisoner was claimed by Poole - he told the constable to take care of his watch, and said, he knew nothing of Carroll, and denied having been in the cart with him; but said, he was walking on the path, and two men took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Hoxton, and am fifteen years old I am errand-boy in the employment of George Smith, a box-maker—on Saturday night, 4th March, about a quarter-past 7, I was going along Bunbill-row with my sister—I was carrying a brown paper parcel, containing three account-books—just as I got opposite a court a man pushed against my sister—she asked him who he was pushing of, and he came and caught hold of my parcel, clung to it, dragged me up the court, choked me round the neck, and struggled with me till the parcel came undone—the choking hurt me—he got one book, and I managed to get the other two—I got up and pursued him, but he was gone—I gave information to the police and a description—I saw the prisoner at the station on Monday with two or three others, and picked him out as the man—I did not hesitate—I have no doubt of him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How old is your sister? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Fourteen—the place where the prisoner came up was very dull, and the place he dragged me to was pitch dark—I only saw his features where it was very dusk for a second, and after it became darker I could not see him at all—I had never seen him before.</p>

I am a sister of the last witness—I was with him in Bunhill-row on Saturday evening—the prisoner came and leant up against my back—I asked him who he was pushing, and he caught hold of my brother's parcel and seized him by the throat—when he began to halloo I ran into the middle of the road screaming, and got two men—I know it was the prisoner—I saw him coming out of a public-house in the court when I was with the policeman looking for him—there was a gas-light in the baker's shop.</p>

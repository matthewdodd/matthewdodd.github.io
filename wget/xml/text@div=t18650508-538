                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker, at 29, Coventry-street; I lived at 27, Coventry-street in December, 1863—I came down one morning early, and found the shop-door open, and the look cut away; it was soaped so as to make no noise—I missed twenty-seven odd boots, six dozen half-fronts, and upwards of thirty pairs of boots, eighteen pairs of which I have recovered from the pawnbrokers—the value of what I missed was between 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we have no stock-book, and I cannot tell exactly how many I lost—I saw them safe the evening previous, between 8 and 9 o'clock—I came in at 11 o'clock and found the shop-door safe—a man named Calla<lb></lb>ghan worked for me in 1862, but I cannot swear to the prisoner—some boots were afterwards given up to me in this Court.</p>

On 3rd December, 1863, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Newton-street, Holborn, and saw the prisoner with two men, named Hill and Thompson, who have been tried here for the burglary at Mr. Stokes' (<hi rend="italic">See Vol.</hi> 59, <hi rend="italic">page</hi> 212)—I was present when they were convicted—the prisoner was carrying some boots under his arm, and so was Hill—they went into 14, Newton-street, which is a lodging-house—I waited for assistance, and then entered the house, and found that they had left the property there and escaped at the back—I afterwards received information and arrested the prisoner at Liverpool last Tuesday—the property left behind was given up to Mr. Stokes.</p>

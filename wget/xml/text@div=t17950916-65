When I came to town on the morning of the 19th, my young man told me that they catched her at the till.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me what you know of your own knowledge? - I see this pin cloth in her box, on the 19th, when we accused her with it. The box was open that morning, but always locked before. There was no other servant not no other person had a box in that room. I acquainted her, and agreed to discharge her; I insisted on searching her before she went away, Thursday the 19th, and, besides the pin cloth of ours, there was a piece of muslin and a piece of lace; I insisted on searching her also before she left my house, as well as her box, that I might see if she had a sixpence that was missed the over night; she was very loath to be searched; I went out for a constable, and just as He was coming up stairs, (she see him) she pulled several things out of her pocket, and among the rest were my silver knee buckles. The things were taken before the Lord Mayor; the buckles and pin cloth have been in my custody ever since. My name is on the pin cloth in full length; I know the buckles by the pattern, I have had them six or eight years, they are quite plain, and there are two or three scratches on them; I did not miss them at the time; the last time I used them I put them in the beauset and dining room, where I should have gone for them when I wanted them.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found them did you find they were wanting? - Yes, they were wanting.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. On the morning of the 19th you say, when you went to search the prisoner's box the box was open, and in the box you found one pin cloth? - I see my wife take it out of the box with a number of other things.</p>
               <p>Q. You have other servants in the house? - Yes, some young men.</p>
               <p>Q. And children? - Yes, I have eight children, but they were all at Islington. While she was with me she behaved exceedingly well, excepting finding these things on her, which I was very sorry to do.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you believe these articles to be your property? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in your service on that day? - A. Yes he was, and had been at work in the morning; when I come back, I found him in the manufactory up stairs, in the powder-room, and gave charge of him to Mr. Harper; I told him, I gave him in charge because of the soap that I had found in his apartment; in his way to Worship-street, he said, the soap that I found in his apartments was given him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am an officer belonging to Worship-street; I went with Mr. Jones to search the prisoner's apartments, last Friday, (produces the property;) I found it upon a shelf in the cupboard; I then went to the manufactory, and took charge of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ROLLS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Recollect, that you are sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth- you were the apprentice of Mr. Jones, were you not? - A. Yes, the prisoner worked for Mr. Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of his having taken any soap, hair powder, or starch? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are now in the care of a person from the house of correction? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been taken into Newgate to see either this prisoner, or any other prisoner, against whom you are intended to give evidence, since you have been in custody? - A. No, I have not seen either of them, or spoke to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Jones). Q. Look at that soap? - A. This yellow soap is of my manufacture; I can only speak of it by the quality; one boiling of soap differs very much from another; I have made but four boilings since last March, and if I was to see any of either of the boilings, I could pick them out separately; this cake of violet-soap was manufactured in my house, and never was sold, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Will you swear it was never sold? - A. I cannot say, we sell so many things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you never sell any of that soap to the prisoner at the bar? - A. No; here is a wash-ball which is unfinished, and is of my manufacture, that never was sold, I can swear it was made in my house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Last Monday was a week, Thomas Rolls brought eight cakes of soap, and wanted me to take it away, and I said I would not have it, for I did not know what to do with it.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Rolls). Q. You hear what the prisoner says? - A. It is all false; I brought out four cakes that he and his brother asked me for, and his brother took it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the wash-ball; did you take that and deliver either to the prisoner or his brother? - A. No, I did not; I took these two cakes of yellow soap from the cutting-room, and delivered them to his brother; the prisoner was in the cutting-room at the time I took them out; he told me his brother was over in the vat-room; he saw me take it out.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not tell you not to take them out? - A. No, you did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I desired Rolls not to take the soap out; he said his mistress had been terrifying him, and said he was as bad as the man; he said his master was better, and had offered him a guinea, if he could defect any of the men.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Rolls). Is that true? - A. No, it is all false. <rs id="t18001203-48-verdict261" type="verdictDescription">

            . I am a constable, and took the woman at the bar into custody, who was charged with taking a sheet and quilt one of her lodging. She said she would go along with me to the place where they were pawn'd; so I went with her to Mr. Brown's, a pawnbroker, on Snow-Hill, where she called for them, and he delivered them to me. I brought the things to produce here, and have. been waiting all, this day, at the Bishop's-Head, since eleven o'clock, for the trial being call'd on, and while I came over here, to see when the other trial would be ended, they were stole away from the alehouse, and a good silk handkerchief of mine, that they were in. The prosecutrix swore them to be her property before the justice, and the pawnbroker said the prisoner was the person that brought them to him, but he is not here.</p>

               <p>Greenwich—I produce a pair of trowsers—which were pawned by the prisoner on the 9th of March, in the name of John Coppey—I made the remark to him, as the trowsers were of large dimension, that they did not fit him—he said they did not, they had been sent by his relations, and had belonged to an uncle of his who died, who was a machinist at Drury-lane Theatre, and he entered into the particulars of the death of his uncle—I have no doubt of his being the person who pawned them.</p>

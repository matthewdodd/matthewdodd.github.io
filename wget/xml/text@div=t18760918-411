                  </hi>. I live at 34, High Street, Chelsea, and am a widow—I have known the prisoner twenty-eight years, and knew his wife, her name was Marion Wilde—I recollect when she was married to the prisoner, because Mary Griffiths, who went as a witness, stood godmother to my child—they were living together as man and wife' within seven years of 1872, because when Sir Charles Dilke put up for Chelsea the prisoner was employed in canvassing for him, that was in 1867 or 1868—I saw his wife last week.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow and live at 6, Lambeth Place, Brompton Road—I went through the ceremony of marriage with the prisoner on 19th August, 1872, at St. Jude's, Chelsea—he represented himself as a widower, he was in my house for a long time as a single man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> You did odd jobs for me—I did not say "If you don't carry me to church some one else shall"—you would have lived with me without marriage, but I would not; but if you would take me to church I was willing—you told me you could not because you had no clothes and no money, but you did not say you were a married man—I bought you a coat to go to the wedding, and have bought you other clothes since—your sister begged me not to take proceedings against you, because you had had a bad wife, when I heard of this I did not press you to leave my house, but you became a lodger only—you behaved well to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was seldom at home, only three months in a year, but whenever I did go home I found everything pawned, and at last we separated, my wife having split my head open with a jug; she had two months and I had one month; when we came out of prison we never came together again. I tried to keep out of the second marriage, but I was over<lb></lb>come. I have been a respectable servant all my life.</p>

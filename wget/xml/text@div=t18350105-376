                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Sweet, a private in the 9th regiment of Foot. I keep a second-hand clothes shop in Playhouse-yard. On the 21st of December, about twenty minutes past nine o'clock, the prisoner and another woman came in—the prisoner asked for a woman's apron—I showed one to them—as the prisoner came in, I saw her take up something, and put it under her shawl and apron—I judged it was my saucepan—they went out without buying the apron—I came round, and missed the saucepan—I went after them—I caught the prisoner, and took this saucepan from her in a pet—the policeman came and took her.</p>

               <p>I lived with the prisoner, she came in on the Queen's birth day about eleven, she went out again, and she brought in two pigs in her apron, and she pulled a paper box from under the bed, and put the two pigs in; and I got up and pulled the box from under the bed, and there were the pigs, and I followed her out, and she went towards the prosecutor's pig-sty, she lives about ten yards from the pig-sty; I saw her drop a pig, when she returned she picked it up again; she took and beat me, and swore damnation, that if I did tell, she would kill me stone dead, and I was forced to down on my knees to pray of her, else she would have killed me.</p>
               <p>What was she? - She used to go to work at gentlemen's houses, I was hired to live with her at a shilling a week, we never had any quarrel before she took the pigs.</p>
               <p>How long was it after, before you told of her? - A week; I was affraid, she got me down in the middle of the house, and beat me with a candlestick, and I was forced to down on my knees and pray her, else she would have killed me; her next door neighbour lost some fowls, and she said I could give an account of them, and the gentlewoman came to me, and I said, I supposed they were gone as Mr. Rayner's pigs were gone; so then Mr. Rayner came to me, that was the cause of our quarrel.</p>
               <p>You did not see her get over the pales? - No.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts did she go to the pales? - She went through her own gate, and strait to the pales.</p>
               <p>Court to Rayner. What sort of a yard is your's? - Fenced in all round, paling seven feet high, and a door that was locked; this woman lives about seven or eight yards from me, I did not hear of it for a week or ten days after; I saw Harris every day, she never said anything to me till then, then she told me, says she, Mr. Rayner, I believe I can tell you who had your pigs, she came to me to the public house.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you think she could get over your pales? - I should think not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg leave to send for my friends.</p>
               <p>Court. Here is no evidence but of this servant, who seems to swear against her from spleen and resentment, and who said nothing for ten days.</p>

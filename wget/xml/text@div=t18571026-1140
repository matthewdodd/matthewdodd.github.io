                  </hi>. I recollect the prisoner being called before a committee appointed to consider what remuneration he should have for his collecting the tolls—the committee was appointed soon after 24th June, and they adjourned from time to time—I think the discovery of these defal<lb></lb>cations was made at our first meeting in July—we went through the accounts and made inquiries—the result was communicated to the prisoner at the first meeting, which I believe was in July; he was called in, and the subject was mentioned of defalcations, or a discrepancy in his book—his reply was, "All the money that I have received I have paid in"—I was not at that time fully aware of these matters that are inquired about now; not of my own knowledge—we proceeded to make inquiries—the prisoner was in attend<lb></lb>ance at the meeting of the committee—I believe he was outside the door—he attended the meetings of the committee and sub-committees—he was eventually given into custody.</p>

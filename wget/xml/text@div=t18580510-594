                  </hi>. I am a corn dealer, of No. 144, Southwark Bridge Road. On 6th April, between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came, and one of my shopmen drew my attention to a bad shilling in her presence—Iasked her whether she had any good money about her, she said "No"—Isaid "I have reason to suppose you have come to the shop on many occa<lb></lb>sions offering bad money, and, as we have had so much bad money offered, I shall feel it my duty to give you in charge"—she tried to leave the shop, but I prevented her—she begged me to let her go, and she would never do any thing of the kind again—I gave her in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The shilling was quite straight when it came out of the other gentleman's hands, and when I gave it to him back it was bent in two. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> The shopman bent it before handing it to me, but it never went out of my sight—I think I marked it—I gave it into the officer's hand—there were several customers there, and it is quite possible I might have passed it over to them, but it never went out of my sight, and I am sure this is the same—I marked it directly the shopman gave it to me—it was bent then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Hinchcliff—the prisoner came for 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of egg powder and gave me a shilling—I bent it very slightly, and said, "This is a bad shilling," she said, "I did not know it"—I laid it on the counter and gave it to my master, this is it, it is still bent—my master did not show it to anybody till he gave it to the policeman—the prisoner had it in her hand before my master had it—I dropped it and she picked it up.</p>

                  </hi> am an officer of Customs—on 17th July I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Danube</hi>, which was lying in St. Katherine's Dock—I saw several persons on board, but I did not know either of them by name—I saw the prisoner and the captain and two or three others talking on the quarter deck—all that I understood was that they were asking the captain for their wages—I drew that conclusion from the answer he made—the men wanted to go to the north, and he said they could live in London as cheap as they could in Sunderland—the captain was an Englishman—the rest of the crew appeared to be foreigners—this conversation might be going on three or four minutes—some minute or two afterwards as I was examining some goods I saw the captain go down into the cabin, and almost instantly I saw the prisoner go down in a very great hurry, and a minute afterwards he came up on deck with a long carving knife in his hand—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he held it in this position when he came up the companion—the man John Smith was on the starboard side, close to the companion—the prisoner made a jump and a plunge towards him—I should say the point of the knife was not above two or three feet from the man—I caught the pri<lb></lb>soner with my foot, and tripped him up—he fell, and the knife was in my hand; but whether I took it from him or whether some person handed it</p>

               <p>to me I do not know, it was so sudden—I fancy I took it from him, but I may not have done so—in falling ho fell towards me—no blow was struck by him with the knife.</p>

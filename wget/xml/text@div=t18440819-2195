                  </hi>. I am a laceman, and live in High-street, Borough. In consequence of some circumstances I made an arrangement with Mrs. Bell, on the evening of the 26th of July—I marked 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the following morning, at ten o'clock, Mrs. Bell was to spend the whole or part of it—she came, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184408190222"></xptr>
               <p>spent 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—shortly after I met Mrs. Bell I returned to my house, and sent the prisoner out for an errand—I threw a shilling on the counter from my pocket, but I drew the till out and shut it again, as if I took the shilling from the till—he went out, and staid two or three minutes—I then examined the till, and missed one shilling, but I thought he might have spent it, and I did not take him then—the till owed him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for some coppers that he had put is in the morning, and in an hour and a half my wife passed half-a-crown into his hand, and he gave her two shillings, which she immediately passed into my hand, and one of them was the marked shilling which was missing from the drawer—he did not take them from the drawer, but from his waistcoat pocket—my wife was not aware of the marks on the money—I was fearful to give the prisoner into custody—I consulted the officers, and I directed them to come at six o'clock in the evening, and take him—they found another marked shil<lb></lb>ling on him which was not missing at the time the other was.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had he been in your employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About six or seven weeks—I had been applied to by a gentle<lb></lb>man to get him a shopman—the prisoner would not do for a shop that was returning 40, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; a year, but he might do for me, who was not doing one-tenth of the business—I wrote to my friend that he was of no use at all, and then took him myself two days afterwards—I let him go, and then took him again—I had a fire at my house from four to six weeks ago—it was per<lb></lb>haps ten days or a fortnight before the prisoner was taken up—I employed him to assist me in making out a list of the articles that were destroyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From that time up to the time when you gave him into custody, had you continually employed a watch to see if you could find him tripping in any way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> An errand boy in my service had received orders to keep his eye on the goods both before and after the fire—the errand boy is not here—I took him to Union Hall, and Mr. Traill requested he might not be sworn—I had employed my wife to watch the prisoner—it was about half-past ten in the morning when I first discovered that my money was short, and I gave him in charge at six in the evening—the policemen were to attend at six o'clock—I went to the police immediately after the first shilling was received from the prisoner, which was missed from the till, the one my wife received from him on giving him half-a-crown—that was at twelve o'clock in the day, and I went to the police between twelve and one, desiring them to wait for further infor<lb></lb>mation—I never charged my wife with stealing anything from me, and never said so—she has left me in consequence of my conduct—I never brought her and her children home naked in their night clothes in the middle of the night—I believe them to be dressed—I did not examine their clothes—I waited a suf<lb></lb>ficient time for them to be dressed—I had not been to the drawer myself, and taken out a shilling before I charged the prisoner with any offence to the police—I did not go to the drawer, and take out a shilling, and give it to the prisoner to buy stay-laces, and I never said so in the hearing of Mr. or Mrs. Bell—I gave him a shilling, but I took it out of my right hand pocket-—I went to the till, and drew it out, and put it back again—I threw a shilling on the counter to lead him to suppose that I had been to the till for it—it is our custom to pass money on the counter—when Mrs. Bell left the shop in the morning there was a customer who demanded the price of a collar in the shop—that collar was missing from the window, and there was not a shilling for it—I did not ask Miss Millen to give me a note to engage that the prisoner should not bring an action against me.</p>

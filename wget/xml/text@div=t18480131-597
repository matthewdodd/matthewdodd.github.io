                  </hi>, Jun. I am the son of last witness, and life with him. I was in the tap-room about twelve o'clock—Burrows told me something about half-past twelve, and I went out and saw King—he went round to the back of the house with me—we saw nobody—I returned to the house, and after some time the two Smiths came to the club-room door, and tried to go in, but were not allowed—I afterwards saw Samuel Smith and Toms sitting in the tap-room singing—the other two had left—they returned, and there was a disturbance between all the prisoners and several of the club, and the house was cleared—when I got up stairs I found the first-floor win<lb></lb>dow, which looked out on the back part of the house, had been broken—it is about seven feet from the ground—I missed a writing-desk, containing a gold brooch, a ring, and other things, and a small box, containing some brushes, handkerchiefs, and two bottles, one containing gin, and the other some kind of spirits, I do not know what—I found a pocket-knife on the</p>

               <p>table in my room—I looked round the house, and found these six spoons immediately under the broken window—I went with a constable, between seven and eight o'clock next morning, and searched Smith's cottage—in going up stairs I found part of a broken bottle of exactly the same sort as mine—I found the other parts of it under and alongside the bed—it had a very faint smell, I could not tell of what—I found three of my handkerchiefs in the garden, on the premises, about thirty yards from the house.</p>

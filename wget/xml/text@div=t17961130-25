               <p>Q. He had been drinking in the house, had he? - A. Yes; he came about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss him out of the tap-room? - A. I did not miss him, my wife missed him about five or six minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. You found him in your bed-chamber; had the bed-chamber-door been locked? - A. Double locked; I immediately secured him, and found an iron crow upon him, with which he had broke open the chamber-door and the drawer, there are the marks of the crow on the door and the drawer; I missed two half-guineas out of this drawer at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him? - A. Not for the money, only for the iron crow; the watchman found one half-guinea upon him, the other was not found.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you seen this money in the drawer? - A. On the Monday before was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300035"></xptr>lettling day; we put money into the drawer at various times, we frequently put money in every day; on Wednesday night my wife put some in, and on that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your wife here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you put in the night before? - A. Two guineas; there were besides, three half-guineas, I believe; there had been one guinea taken out afterwards by my wife, before I found the prisoner there.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say when you found him in the bed-room? - A. He said he had made a mistake and got into the wrong room, that he thought it had been the club-room, he pretended to be in liquor; I said he was not so little acquainted with this room as to make that mistake. While I had hold of him, he wanted to persuade me that I had made a mistake, that he was not the person I laid hold of.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the iron crow upon him; what did he say to that? - A. I asked no further account of him, but took him directly to the watch-house; there was half-a-guinea, and about half-a-guinea's-worth of silver left in the drawer when I found it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you miss out of the drawer in all? - A. The sum total, as far as I can recollect, was about four or five pounds.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You first told me you had not seen the half-guineas from the Monday till the Thursday; that Monday was the settling day? - A. I had seen them over and over, but frequently giving change I could not say exactly what it was, but two half-guineas there positively were when I saw it in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Your wife took out some money on Thursday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She is not here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know what money she took out? - A. She informed me what money she took out.</p>
               <p>Q. The half-guinea found on the prisoner your wife said, she believed, was not your half-guinea? - A. I said so myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You won't swear to any money? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a club at your house? - A. A shoe-club.</p>
               <p>Q. What is a shoe-club? - A. A club for people that want shoes cheap, to pay sixpence a week, and spend twopence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner apply to you respecting this club? - A. He asked me if there was a club, and said he wished to be a member of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he to pay to be a member? - A. Two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he offer a half-guinea to pay the two shillings, and your wife could not give him change, and returned it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was another sort of a club held in your house? - A. Yes; a raffling-club.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there an application to him from you or your wife, to become a member to raffle for a watch? - A. He put down 2s. or 1s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the raffle thrown that night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people might be present? - A. About twenty-five.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any sailors? - A. No; except those concerned in the robbery; the window was opened by the prisoner, and there were people on the outside; there was a child in bed in the room, locked in.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the room when the raffle was thrown? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the room where the raffle was thrown? - A. Not when the raffle was thrown, he was before and after.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a candle on the stair-case? - A. Yes; it was put out.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found him, he told you he had mistaken the room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found none of your property upon him? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. The half-guinea you found upon him, you will not swear to? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner go into the tap-room after that? - A. No; I left him at the bottom of the stairs, in the care of the tapster, while I went up stairs, to see what was the matter; when I came down, I found him in the same posture.</p>

             sworn. - I am a carpenter and joiner: I was in the house at the same time; I was coming out of the club-room, following the landlord up one-pair of stairs, I saw the bed-room door open, we stopped on the stairs to see who was in the room; the prosecutor called Smith, as he generally called his wife; the prisoner seemed shocked at it, and stopped in the room a bit; and then he came to the door, and pretended to be very much in liquor; he was as sober as I am now; I saw him very near the bed, the door was on the jar, when we came out of the club-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether it had been forced open? - A. Yes, I did; I went in afterwards; the prosecutor questioned the prisoner how he came in the room; he said, he made a mistake, and went into that room instead of the club-room; the clubroom was on the same floor; when we brought him down stairs; I told the landlord I thought he had a crow in his pocket; the landlord felt the outside of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300036"></xptr>his pocket, and felt it; in about four or five minutes after, we got a light, and went up stairs, and tried the crow to the jam of the door and the drawer; the prosecutor and his wife were with me; before the Justice, he said he fell over the crow into the room, and took it up, and put it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you live at this house? - A. I lodge there.</p>
               <p>Q. How many other persons lodge there? - A. Three or four besides me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you belong to the raffle club? - A. I did, as it happened.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not the fortunate person? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the room? - A. Several times, but not at the time of the raffle.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were in the room? - A. Twenty-four or twenty-five.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a light on the stair-case? - A. Yes; but I suppose he had conveyed it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not a man in the dark, get into the one room instead of the other? - A. - I cannot suppose that; besides one door was locked, and the other unlocked.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you searched him, he produced the crow himself? - A. No; he denied it; he said he had no such thing about him; I told the landlord he must have such a thing, that he broke the door open with; the landlord insisted upon feeling in his pocket, the prisoner refused it; the landlord felt the outside of his pocket, and felt the iron crow; then he took it out, and gave it to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. There was a half-guinea found upon him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mrs. Smith say, she believed that half-guinea was his own? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any persons in the street at that time? - A. No; there were several people in his company in the house; when this happened, they were all gone.</p>

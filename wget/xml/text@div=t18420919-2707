                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 87.) I was on duty on Monday evening, the 22nd of August, about half-past six o'clock, at Bishop's-road, opposite the terminus of the Great Western Railway—there was a mob of upwards of 500 persons there—there had been a great number of persons</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184209190131"></xptr>
               <p>about there for an hour and a half, or more—at the time I have mentioned, the people were hooting, hallooing, throwing stones, and pelting the police—I was called by my inspector, Mr. Black, to endeavour to disperse a mob in a hollow, and in doing so, I came in contact with the prisoner—I did nothing to him—I went up to the mob and requested them to goon—a party got behind me, and gave me a <hi rend="italic">shove</hi>—I fell on the ground, and the prisoner with me—I did not observe him till I was on the ground—he fell first, and I over him—when we were on the ground, the prisoner opened this knife (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>) in his left hand, and made a <hi rend="italic">hook</hi> at me—a kind of <hi rend="italic">sweep,</hi> at the bottom of my stomach—he said, "Now you b—, you or I for it"—I saw the knife, and instantly rolled myself away from him—the knife might be within eight or ten inches of me when I rolled away—I cannot say whether it had been in his pocket or in his left hand, but I saw him open it very distinctly, and he cut his finger in opening it—the knife had been sharpened then, and it is to be seen now—the other policeman came up, if he had not I think something might have happened to me, as there were so many persons there, and no other constable was nigh me—Dunkly struck the prisoner on the hand with his staff, and took the knife out of his hand—he was taken to the station.</p>

I was in attendance at Bishop's-road on the 22nd of August—I took the prisoner, and took this knife from him—he was on the ground, and Jones was by the side of him—I had seen him with the knife in his left hand, and I saw him make an attempt to stab Jones, and heard him say, "Now either you or I for it, you b—r"—I struck him on the back of his hand with my staff before I took the knife from him—that was when he was making the thrust—I did not strike any where but on the hand—he was conveyed directly to the station—I did not notice that any thing was the matter with either of his hands—he said he was only fighting for his rights.</p>

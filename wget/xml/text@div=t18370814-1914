                  </hi>. I am a blacksmith—I belong to the National Forgers' Iron Association. On Tuesday three weeks I came here on board the <hi rend="italic">Ocean</hi> packet, with three others—we came on shore, went to Spiers's house, and had some beer, and staid all night—his house is at Ratcliffe, I understand—the next morning we came away—the other three men went on board—I had to go to Bow, to a friend of mine who worked there, and Spiers proposed to see me part of the way—we went along, and then M'Carthy met us, and we had some beer at two or three houses, I think; and Spiers proposed going across a field, as a short way to Bow—we went through the field, and in a kind of ridge cut across the field he proposed sitting down—I there fell asleep, and, while asleep, Spiers took the watch—I had this guard attached to my watch—on his unhanging it I awoke—I said, "You take this watch; I consider it as safe with you as with me;" and then I went to sleep again, and slept a couple of hours, or the like, and expected he would carry this watch to the men on board the packet, as I did not know where Spiers lived—I went to the man that was on board the packet the night previous, and said, "Did he come?"—he said he did not—he said, "I will be able to come on shore on Friday, and we will all go to his house"—I went to him on the Friday evening—he denied having taken it—I asked him where M'Carthy was—he said he did not know—I said, if he did not give me my watch I would have him arrested, and I did.</p>

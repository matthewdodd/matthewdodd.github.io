                  </hi>. I was a farmer, at Stratford—I now live at 129, Bishopsgate-street. When I was in the farming business, Spackman was my foreman, and lived in a cottage adjoining the stables and barn, on my farm—I did not know Barker then—he keeps a horse and cart, and a little greengrocer's-shop, at Stratford—I had repeatedly spoken to Spackman about missing things—on 30th Aug. they began to reap some wheat—I reckoned, as nearly as possible, that there would be very nearly forty quarters in that threshing—this wheat was different from any other in the neighbourhood—Spackman had the charge of the barn altogether, before and after the thresh<lb></lb>ing; it is quite impossible that it could have been interfered with without his knowledge, his cottage was close to the barn, and no one could come to it without his seeing them—he brought the keys in every night, and came to my window between four and five o'clock every morning, and I gave them out to him—he rendered me an account of twenty-eight quarters and five bushels—I have been a farmer ever since I was fourteen years old—I am able to calculate what quantity should be produced—the nature of the crop and the hours employed in threshing would be very fair data for the amount—on the morning of 20th Sept. I went up to Barker—I said, "Is your name Barker?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "What did you do with the wheat that you carted from my house?"—he said, "I do not know you; I have not carted any wheat"—I said, "You carted two quarters and a half, on the 5th and on the 6th"—he said, "You know all about it; I carted, altogether, seven and a half and six bushels; I was employed by Spackman to do it"—I said, "Who?"—he said, "Spackman, Green, and Oliver"—they were men</p>

            . Between Twelve and One o'Clock Saturday Morning, I li't of the Prisoner three Miles beyond Barnet, and he desired me to help him bring a Dozen of Geese to London, telling me he would give me a Shilling. So we took the Geese upon our Shoulders, and when we came to London, a Constable stopped us on Suspicion of stealing them, - so we were taken up. The Constable was called, but did not appear.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have very good Friends, - if they were but here. These Geese were the Witness's, and he hired me for a Drink or two of Beer, to help him to carry them. He told me he was carrying them to a Sister of his at London, but God knows whether he has e'er a Sister there or no, for he would have sold them upon the Road if he could. <rs id="t17390607-44-verdict207" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, of Houndsditch, and work with my father. On Saturday last, about a quarter to 12 o'clock, I was on Cornhill and saw the prisoner and another woman standing by a lamp-post, about four doors from Gracechurch-street, with a young man, about twenty-four or twenty-five years old; she asked me the way to the Monument; they were disputing which was the way, and I directed them—the prisoner stepped a little more towards me, and said, "You will show me, won't you, old son?"—she put her hand in the right pocket of my trowsers, and took it out again—I immediately put my hand in, and missed about 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of silver—I had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth when I was at the Royal Exchange, and I missed half of it—I took hold of her by the wrist, and said, "This will not</p>

               <p>do for me, you have robbed me—after a few minutes' contention she said, "Is this yours?" and held out her hand, and offered me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, "You have more of my money; I shall give you in charge—an officer came up, and I gave her in charge—on the way to the station, she offered me 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said she would give me the rest if I would go with her over the water—the policeman fetched the man to the station; he was discharged.</p>

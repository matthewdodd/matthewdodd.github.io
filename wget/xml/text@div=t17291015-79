             depos'd, That as she was going from her own House to see her Child, about 20 Doors off, about 7 o-Clock at Night, the Prisoner and another came and jostled her, and had almost thrown her down; that thereupon she said, Fellow could you not go along without shoving me? that thereupon the Prisoner turnining back and damning her for a Bitch, hit her a slap on the Face; and she saying, Why do you strike me so? he struck her several times; that being come up to a Barrow-Woman and her Daughter, they said, Why do you abuse the Woman so? she is an honest Woman, and a Neighbour; upon which he fell a beating them; upon that the Woman's Husband coming, they all fell to fighting; and she feeling a Pocket-Book under her Feet, felt for her Money, which was in her Pocket-Apron, and that was all gone too: She added, that the Prisoner, while he was striking her, took hold of her Apron. The Prisoner denied the taking of the Money, and call'd a great many to his Reputation, so that it appear'd rather a drunken Frolick than a Felony, tho' the Womans Money was lost. Upon a full Hearing of the Matter, the Jury <rs id="t17291015-79-verdict387" type="verdictDescription">

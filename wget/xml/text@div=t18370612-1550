                  </hi>. I am the wife of George William Hoyle—I am a milliner and dressmaker, and live in Regent-street, in the house of William Bartelot. On Tuesday, the 9th of May, about three o'clock in the afternoon I was sitting in the front drawing-room with Miss Marsh—I saw the prisoner coming up stairs, and sent Miss Marsh to speak to her in the back room I overheard her use the word "apprentice"—Miss Marsh came to me—the prisoner put her head into the room I was in, and said, "If you are engaged Mrs. Bee, I will call some other day" (my maiden name was Bee)—I went into the back room to her, and she said she had come about an apprentice—I asked her who recommended her—she replied the lady would know; she had only come to inquire about the terms—she was so flurried she scarcely gave herself time to speak—she inquired about my terms for three years and before I had time to reply she said, "Sixty guineas, I suppose?"—I said no, my terms were forty—she said they would no doubt suit the lady, and would I call on her—I hesitated, and she said should the lady call on me—I said, that would be better, and she appointed for her to call next day, between twelve and one o'clock—she then left—about half an hour after I went into the back room to get my purse, which I had left in a bag about ten minutes before she came in, and missed it—it contained a £3 Colchester note, eight sovereigns, one half-sovereign, and about 2 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is silver—it was a brown silk purse—nobody but the prisoner, myself, and Miss Marsh had been in the room from the time I placed the bag there till I missed the purse—all the doors were open—the rooms communicate by folding doors, and one folding-door was open—this is my purse, I am certain—I know the ring, which I put on it about three months ago.</p>

                  </hi>. I was sitting with Mrs. Hoyle when the prisoner came up stairs—I am confident she is the person—she went into the back room and asked me if Mrs. Hoyle was in want of an apprentice—I said Mrs. Hoyle was engaged, but I would go to her if she would take a chair—I gave her one, and she sat down near the fire-place—the table was very near the fire place—I went to Mrs. Hoyle, who was engaged a short time, the prisoner looked in between the two doors, and said, "If you are engaged, I will call next day"—the folding door was only partly open—after she was gone, Mrs. Hoyle complained of losing her purse—nobody went into the room but Mrs. Hoyle and myself, from the time the prisoner left till it was missed—I have seen Mrs. Hoyle with a purse, and believe this to be the same—the bag was put on the table when we came from dinner—the prisoner did not call next day, nor did any one about an ap<lb></lb>prentice.</p>

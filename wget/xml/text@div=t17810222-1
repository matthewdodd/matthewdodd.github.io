             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 24th of January, between ten and eleven at night, as I was coming towards London, near the Red Lion, four men met me.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any more than those four? - Yes; there were six; but I cannot speak to more of their persons than four; they met me, they got round me and hustled me and put my hat over my face; I endeavoured to turn my head on one side to see what they were going to do to me, upon which Milbourne d - d me and struck me on the small of my back with a cutlass. They afterwards asked me if I had a watch.</p>
               <p>Which of them asked that? - I cannot tell; I said I had not; one of them came on one side of me, another came on the other, and thrust their hands into my pockets I cannot say which of them did that; they took out one shilling and two sixpences, and seven pence in halfpence and a key; they d - d my eyes and gave me the key back again. They took a linen pocket handkerchief, a pair of mitts, and a tobacco box. Milbourne pricked my back twice with the cutlass, not to wound me, but he drew blood; he did it violently; he d - d my eyes and said if I did not stand still he would run me through. My coat and jacket were hanging loose; he stood over me with the hanger while the others went off.</p>
               <p>How long did they stay with you? - I cannot justly say; it was a considerable time before they left me; it might be ten minutes or something less.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen any of the men before? - Two of them I had seen in the field before, but not to know them.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen Milbourne before? - No.</p>
               <p>When did you see him afterwards? - The next day at Sir John Fielding's office.</p>
               <p>Was it a light or dark night? - It was a dark night.</p>
               <p>What coloured clothes had Milbourne on? - A dark coloured great-coat, I cannot be positive to any other part of his dress.</p>
               <p>With the hat pulled over your eyes in a dark night could you observe a man's face so as to know him? - I saw them before they put the hat over my eyes; two of them passed me before the others came up.</p>
               <p>What opportunity had you of observing Milbourne before the hat was drawn over your face? - By his coming up close to the post I saw him by the light of the lamp; it was not above two yards from the lamp; I saw them very plain as they came to me.</p>
               <p>Without the lamp it would not have been light enough to have known them? - Without the lamp I should not have known them it being a dark night.</p>
               <p>How long had you an opportunity of observing them before they put the hat over your eyes? - Two or three minutes; I observed them all before they put the hat over my eyes; they hustled me up to the window-shutter before they put the hat over my eyes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath had you an opportunity by the light you then had to know Milbourne's face, so as to swear positively to him again? - I had.</p>
               <p>Do you know him now to be the same man? - I do know him to be the same man.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt of it? - No; I have no doubt of his being the man, else I should not have come here.</p>
               <p>Did you know any of the other five men who were concerned in the business? - I know these two (pointing out Powell and Russell) I do not know their names.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you know these two men whose names you find to be Russell and Powell? - Yes; I saw them in the fields about three weeks before.</p>
               <p>What led you to observe them three weeks before? - They had robbed a person that evening; I went out that evening with another person to see if I could find them.</p>
               <p>When did you first observe them when the six men first came up? - They were the men that first came up and passed me.</p>
               <p>When they passed you that night did you know them to be the two men you had seen in the field before? - I cannot say I took that particular notice.</p>
               <p>What did they do in this business? - They came up to the post and met the others that were coming.</p>
               <p>Did they do any thing? - They were along with them when they hustled me together.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220004"></xptr>Did you see these two men do any thing, or hear them say any thing? - Only Powell saying this is Tom.</p>
               <p>You did not see them do any thing, or hear them say any thing relating to the robbery? - When they spoke they spoke alltogether.</p>
               <p>Did you see these two men come back before the hat was pulled over your face? - Yes; one of them laid hold of my coat before the others came up.</p>
               <p>Are you sure one of those laid hold of your coat? - Yes; and walked with me up to the post.</p>
               <p>How far was that? - Not two yards.</p>
               <p>Are you positive they laid hold of your coat? - I am almost sure.</p>
               <p>Are you positive or not? - I had rather decline it.</p>
               <p>When did you see these men afterwards? - The next day; I saw them all at Sir

               <p>The first night you was not positive to them? - Yes; I was as positive the first night as on the Monday; the first night was on Thursday; they were brought up on the Monday after.</p>

               <p>I was at the apprehending of the prisoners. found this cutlass (producing it) on Milbourne.</p>
               <p>To Thompson. You cannot I suppose take upon yourself to swear to the cutlass Milbourne had? - No.</p>
               <p>Carpmeal. I found this pocket pistol ( producing it) upon Collett. It is loaded.</p>
               <p>Was you present at the first examination on the Thursday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Thompson then take upon him to know my of the prisoners? - He pointed out Powell immediately as the first man that came up to him and stopped him.</p>
               <p>Did he that evening declare his knowledge of any of the other prisoners? - I do not remember that he did on the Thursday evening; he did but just see them I believe that evening.</p>
               <p>What was the reason he did not swear to them that evening? - He said he believed them all to be the people; he spoke to Milbourne as the second man that came up to him, and particularly pointed him out as having the cutlass; he said two came up first and then two more, and took him over to the lamp.</p>
               <p>He said he believed them all to be the men? - Yes; that was by candle light.</p>
               <p>Respecting these two he declared the positive knowledge, or only that he believed they were the men? - He spoke positive to those two, and believed the others to be the men.</p>
               <p>He said he believed all of them that were there were the men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was Townsend there that night? - They were all there.</p>
               <p>Then he included him in his belief? - He said all of them.</p>
               <p>Did he speak positive to Powell and Milbourne? - Yes; more positive to Powell than to Milbourne.</p>
               <p>When he came up to the examination again on Monday what account did he give? - They were all put up to the bar together; there was another put up that he did not swear to. The justice desired him to touch those he knew; he touched Powell first; then he touched Milbourne, he said he was the man who had the cutlass; that he believed Russell was one; he said Powell and Townsend were the two first who came up, and Milbourne and Russell were the two next.</p>
               <p>What did he say respecting Collett? - He did not speak positively as to him; he believed him to be one of them.</p>
               <p>Did he speak positively to any but Powell and Milbourne? - Not so positive to any of the rest as to them.</p>
               <p>Milbourne. I beg your lordship will ask what Thompson said about the hat.</p>
               <p>Court. What did Thompson say about the hat on Monday or Thursday? - He said the first two came up to him and said this is Tom we will have him; that the other two came up and Milbourne struck him on the back with a cutlass, and then after that they pulled his hat over his eyes.</p>
               <p>RUSSELL's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have nothing to say in my defence; only to ask him whether he found any thing upon me.</p>
               <p>POWELL's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was at the Queen's Head, the corner of St. John's-Lane, I staid there till ten o'clock, and had such an hoarseness upon me that I could not make any body hear me; I left that place at half after ten o'clock and went home to bed directly. I never robbed a man in my life, I have witnesses to prove where I was.</p>
               <p>What are their names? - I don't know, they are quite strangers to me; the subpoenas were only got this morning, I know them by sight being in the house two or three times; I directed the subpoenas for the people that were in that house in company with me; my brother said he would go to the Queen's Head and ask all their names.</p>

               <p>Did any person ask you the names of the persons who were in the house? - Townsend's father about five or six days ago; he asked me the names and I gave him the names down.</p>
               <p>What day was it Townsend and Powell were in your house? - I cannot say whether it was the 24th of January or not, it was upon the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Do you know when the prisoners were taken up? - No; I heard it was on the Thursday; I heard, about three days after they had been at my house, that they were taken up.</p>
               <p>Was it on the Wednesday before you heard they were taken up that they were at your house? - I believe it was; I cannot be sure to the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was Wednesday? - I believe it was on Wednesday; I put it down when I heard they were taken up, but I have not the memorandum here.</p>
               <p>How came you not to bring it? - I looked for it a few days ago but could not find it.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon your memory to say what day of the week it was they were at your house? - I really believe it was on a Wenesday; I cannot be sure of it.</p>

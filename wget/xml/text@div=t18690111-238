                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman P</hi> 119). On 8th December, about 12 o'clock, I was on duty in the Breakspeare Read, Lewisham—I heard a noise in the garden of 1, St. James' Villas, where Mr. Allan lives—I stood at the corner of the wall, at the back, and heard steps coming near me—I saw two men climb up the wall, and drop into the Breakspeare Road, they ran away directly to Upper Lewisham Road—I saw an officer's cape shining, and called to him to stop them—the prisoner was taken by Stubbings, but the other man escaped—I had not lost sight of the prisoner—I told him I saw him come over the wall with another man—he said that he just come along the road—he was taken to the station, and I found on him a candle, some matches, a knife, a tobacco box, and a purse.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

On 8th December, at midnight, I was on duty in Lewisham Road, and heard persons running—I saw the prisoner and another man come out of Breakspeare Road into Lewisham Road, pursued by Gurr, who was calling, "Stop thief!"—I went towards them, and they separated—I stopped the prisoner—the other man jumped over a low wall, and got into a shrubbery, pursued by Gurr, who failed to apprehend him—the prisoner said that he had just come from London, from the Victoria Theatre—we were followed by another man, who threw stones at us, two of which struck me on the hand and shoulder—he called to the prisoner to make his escape—Gurr pursued him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, St. John's Road, Lewisham Road, in the parish of St. Paul, Deptford—on Wednesday morning, about 3 o'clock, I was called up by the police—I examined the back drawing-room window, which leads into the garden, and found one window partly raised—a knife had been introduced under the catch—this knife, brought by the sergeant, corresponds with a mark on the wood and the paint.</p>

I examined the back garden of this house between 2 and 3 o'clock on this morning, and took the prisoner's boots with me—they had a half tip—I found on the flower-beds marks made with a boot with a half tip—I made an impression by the side of them with the prisoner's boots, and it corresponded in length and breadth, and in the half tip—I traced the marks to the stone steps, leading to the back door—the prisoner gave me an address; I found the street, but no one answering the name and description.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

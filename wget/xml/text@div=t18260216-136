            . I was waiter at the public-house. I saw the prosecutor come in about an hour and a half before he lost his watch - he was net very drunk then; he had two friends with him, and he drank with them. I saw him and Donovan sparring; I took him by the arm to lead him out of the room; Donovan took him round the body to help him out, and the dumb man pushed him behind - we came to a dark passage which leads into the tap-room, and three or four rushed upon us, and knocked the prosecutor and me down - we were on the ground about half a minute; I arose, and asked Durtnall where his watch was, which I had seen as we came up the room, about a minute before. I did not charge anybody with taking the watch then, but on the Friday, (two days afterwards), I heard Donovan say the watch was pawned - this was in the tap-room.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Broad-street, Ratcliff. I have a watch, pawned by Jennings, on Saturday evening, the 11th of February; I asked him what he wanted - he held up his two hands twice, meaning 20s.; I answered, by signs, 14s. - I then wrote on a ticket,"Whose is it?" he pointed to his breast, meaning that it was his own. I then wrote, "What is your name?" he produced a ticket from one of his pockets, and pointed to the name on the ticket, "James Jennings," and gave his direction.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police constable. I went with the prosecutor on Monday last to the West India Dock - I saw Jennings in the hold. I wrote on a piece of paper, "Do you know this man?" he shook his head, and intimated by signs that he did not. I then showed him an old duplicate, and made signs to know if he had got any like that in his pocket - he showed me that I might feel; I searched him, and found this one for a watch, pawned for 14s., at Nicholas and Latter's - I then took him into custody, and afterwards went to the Green Man public-house, and found Donovan; I asked him if he knew the prosecutor - he said he might, and he thought he did; as we were going along I said, "I am certain you do, for you was at the Commercial tap on Wednesday last, with Dummy, and there the prosecutor lost his watch" - he said he knew nothing of the robbery.</p>
               <p>DONOVAN'S Defence. I was in the tap-room half an hour or three quarters of an hour afterwards - I saw the prosecutor pull out some silver, and give to the landlord - he afterwards said he had lost his things; I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160068"></xptr>>this man sitting on the coal box; I went to work, and had not seen him till the officer came and took me.</p>

             near twenty times, and as I was calling him, the prisoner got up the cellar-window; he got out the same way he got in; he had wrenched the bar before, very near an inch and a quarter up with an iron thing.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen your cellar - do you know what state it was in? - A. I saw it every day and every evening of my life; I saw it an hour and a half before that, and it was all safe, and perfectly right.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you looked for that purpose? - A. I look every night of my life, I never miss; after he had made his escape through the window, I turned into the kitchen; there is an entry into the street; I went into the street, and desired somebody to run and fetch the peace-officer directly, there being a number of people about the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look and see if there was any thing left there? - A. Yes; there was a kind of an old lantern, a bag, and a chisel.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they there when you were in your cellar before? - A. No, no such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing out of your cellar? - A. I cannot say, there were such a number of things; the moment I got up, I sent for a peace-officer, and the moment the peace-officer came, I desired some of them to go and search his house.</p>

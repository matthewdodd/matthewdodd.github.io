On Saturday night, the 25th of September, about ten o'clock, or half-past, the prisoner came and asked if I could let him have a bed; I told him Yes - he paid me a shilling before he went to bed, and slept in the second floor front room; on Sunday morning, about twenty minutes before eleven o'clock, the servant went up to make the beds, and in consequence of what she said I went up, looked through the key-hole of the door, and saw my bed furniture folded up - it was the curtains; they laid on the bed, folded up in a parcel - I asked for admittance, and the prisoner said he would open the door directly, but he did not, and I forced it open with my feet; it was not the furniture of the bed he had slept in, but some which had been packed up in a cupboard in his room, and belonged to my own bed - when I got the door open I seized him by the arm; I found my things all thrown about the room - I asked him what he was doing; he said he was looking for a sheet of paper - he had some of the bed furniture in his hand at the time - I detained him, and sent for an officer; there was a portmanteau in the same cupboard, and some books in it, part of them were bound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Have you many lodgers? A. Three or four single men I have regular lodgers? I only keep one room for occasional lodgers - I may not have been into this room for three or four days before, but I went up with the prisoner to bed that night, and the things were not laying about then; I went into the room - it is small: the bed faces the door, and the cupboard is on the other side of the bed - I only showed him into the room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You are quite sure there was nothing lying about? A. Nothing.</p>

            . I am servant at the prosecutor's house. I was in and out of the room the prisoner slept in a dozen times on the Saturday; I put the portmanteau and bed furniture into the closet - they had been there two months before; the bed furniture was packed up in a clothes basket, and fastened down with a piece of coarse cloth - I locked the cupboard, and had the key; it was locked when the prisoner went to bed - when the alarm was given I went up; there was a strange key in the cupboard door - we only had one key to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the bed-room kept locked during the day? A. Yes - the other lodgers had no access to it; I had not been to the cupboard that week, nor seen the things for a month.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. But during that month had you the key of that closet in your possession? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a headborough of St. Luke's. I was sent for by Mr. Burrell, and found the prisoner in the second floor front room - he had his trousers on, but neither his coat nor waistcoat; Mrs. Burrell gave me the property - I packed it up, and by that time he had dressed himself; I searched him, and found on him thirty keys, and what is called a Jemmy; I also found a duplicate of a pledge for 1s. the night before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you find the keys? A. In his great coat pocket - he owned the coat, it was on a chair; I asked if it was his - he said it was, and pot it on; I then searched the pocket - there is one picklock-key in one bundle, and one half skeleton in the other, and here is one key which opened the lock.</p>

These books are mine - here is a Prayer-book with my own hand-writing in it; here is a Testament, a Bible, and two or three Prayer-books; the value of all the property together is 8l. 8s. - only part of the bed furniture is here; it is cotton: I have had it six years - it cost 26l., and has not been used constantly.</p>

               <p>MR. LEE. Q. Were there other articles besides those<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280009"></xptr>produced removed out of the cupboard? A. Yes; the prisoner had no bundle when he went to bed.</p>

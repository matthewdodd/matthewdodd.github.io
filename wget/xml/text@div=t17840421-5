               <p>Whereabouts did you meet her? - At Charing-cross, she took me to this Nash's house, in Johnson's-court, Charing-cross, and we had several basons of brandy and water.</p>
               <p>Did you go into a room by yourselves? - Yes, and we were afterwards shewn to a different room, a bed room.</p>
               <p>How long were you in the first room before you were shewn to the bed room? - I believe about two hours, drinking brandy and water.</p>
               <p>Were you and she alone all that time? - Yes, except the waiter.</p>
               <p>What quantity might you drink! - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Had you several bowls? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you sober when you first met with the woman? - Yes, as sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>But I suppose, by the time you had drank this brandy and water, you had got tolerably drunk? - I was stupid, muddled, and sleepy.</p>
               <p>Did you go to bed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the prisoner with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the door locked or not? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Where was your money when you went to bed? - In my breeches pocket, and my box in my coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Was your money loose, or in a purse? - My money was in a purse.</p>
               <p>Was it all in one purse or more? - All in one purse.</p>
               <p>Which side pocket? - My right side pocket.</p>
               <p>Where did you put your breeches when you undressed? - I did not pull my breeches off.</p>
               <p>Were you undressed all but your breeches? - I threw off my coat and waistcoat, and shoes.</p>
               <p>You fell asleep then? - Yes, the prisoner was with me, and when I awaked at two o'clock, she was gone and my money.</p>
               <p>It was dark when you awaked, I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you found yourself alone? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How soon did you miss your money and your box? - I could not see to reckon it till daylight; then I came down and told the landlord.</p>
               <p>What had you left? - Five guineas and some silver, I had twenty guineas in the whole.</p>
               <p>Was your purse left? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time did you get up in the morning? - About seven.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was two when you first awaked? - I heard the clock go; I fell asleep again; I knew that my money was gone, but I could not tell how much till day-light.</p>
               <p>Did you examine your pocket when you first awaked? - Yes, my purse was out of my pocket, and I could not find it, but when it was daylight I found it on the pillow, and my watch along with it.</p>
               <p>How came you to have so large a sum of money about you? - I was lately come from Gibraltar; I lost fifteen guineas and my snuff box.</p>
               <p>Have you any other reason for suspecting this woman then her having been with you? - No, she owned to Justice Hyde, that she had three guineas and a half that was my money, that she took out of my waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Did you hear her own that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That could not be true? - No, I had no money in my waistcoat pocket, except halfpence.</p>
               <p>Had you taken out your purse while you was in her company? - Yes, I believe I did, for to pay for my bed.</p>
               <p>Had you paid your reckoning? - No, not till the next day.</p>
               <p>What did you pay for your bed and not your reckoning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Do not you recollect giving the waiter the purse to take the money, it was four shillings you paid for your bed, Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270009"></xptr> Mackay, and you did pay your reckoning all but three shillings and sixpence.</p>

               <p>How long did they stay in that room? - I believe it might be about two hours; I did not see the gentleman that night, till the next morning.</p>
               <p>How much had they to drink? - Six or seven bowls of brandy and water.</p>
               <p>What became of them afterwards? - The prisoner went away.</p>
               <p>Is that a bed room that they were in? - No, the prisoner went away, the prosecutor slept all night in the house.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner leave him while he was in that room? - I did not see him that night.</p>
               <p>Then how do you know what time she went away? - I saw her go between twelve and one, about one.</p>
               <p>Was she with him in the bed room? - I do not know; in the morning the man came down stairs, and told me he had twenty guineas in his pocket, and out of that fifteen were gone, and he judged the prisoner had robbed him.</p>
               <p>Did he take any steps to recover the money again? - He went after the prisoner on the Saturday, but could not hear of her, he took her some days afterwards, I do not know the day.</p>
               <p>Did you take no steps yourself, for the honour of your house, to get this man his money again? - I went with this man over the water, where we were informed the prisoner lodged, but she was gone away.</p>
               <p>Is the waiter here? - No, Sir, I have not seen him for a day or two after this affair happened, he went away.</p>
               <p>So the waiter, who is most likely to know something of the matter, is gone? - Yes, he is.</p>
               <p>How long has this woman used your house? - About two years, and always a very honest body.</p>
               <p>I think that you gentlemen that keep these kind of houses, should be answerable for the honestly of the women that come into them; I wonder you did not pay this money? - We never encourage any such thing, it will happen so sometimes.</p>
               <p>Have you any other custom for your tavern but the custom these poor women bring you? - Yes, to be sure.</p>
               <p>What licence have you? - A wine licence.</p>

               <p>Yesterday was eight days this prosecutor came to me, and told me he was robbed by this woman, and I told him to go to Justice Hyde, and I went with the prosecutor over Westminster-bridge, and we went to a public house; we enquired for the prisoner of a girl who was going with a pint of beer, and she alarmed the prisoner, and she left her own room, and then she went and barricaded herself up in a garret; I went up in the garret, and a woman took the broom to strike me, and said there was no such person as the prisoner there; I went to the next room, and the door was bolted, and a person behind; we got a peace officer, and then the woman went up and broke the door open herself, and the prisoner was there behind a parcel of tables and chairs, and things of that kind; I brought her to Justice Hyde, and he committed her, and the next Saturday she was brought again; she then confessed to Justice Hyde, that she took out of the prosecutor's waistcoat pocket, three guineas and a half.</p>

               <p>I went with the prosecutor to Mr. Nash's house, we had several bowls of liquor, but into the bed room I did not go; the prosecutor gave the waiter the purse to take care of; I said I did not like to stay with him all night, as he had given the waiter his purse; as I came down stairs, I saw Mr. Nash and the waiter together, since that the waiter has had money; I left a handkerkerchief<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270010"></xptr> of mine with Mr. Nash in the bar, I went and asked for my handkerchief, it was not there, and the gentleman had it in his pocket; Mr. Nash said he must take it out of his bar. I never told Mr. Hyde any such thing, and he would not say it if he was here; I had no more than two half crown pieces; a person was to have come to my character, one Mr. Ravenscroft, who lives over the way, but I did know of my trial coming on.</p>

               <p>I am a carpenter and bedstead maker at Hatton-wall; the prisoner brought two pieces of mahogany to me on the 12th of December; I thought it had been later in the month; when I was before the Lord Mayor, it was about seven o'clock in the evening; they were three inches square, and seven feet and a half long; the prisoner was the man; he brought a part the night before, which we bought of him; they were smaller a great deal, and his bringing another part made us suspect him; I asked the prisoner how he came by those pillars; at first he said, honestly; I insisted on knowing more particularly; he then said, I hope you will not hurt me; I said, not if you come honestly by them; if not you shall certainly take the consequence; he then said, that a man he worked for, of the name of Chamberlain, in Ratcliffe-highway, No. 34, owed him some money for wages, and had given them to him; I told him I knew the person that lived there, and it could not be there; then he said, it must be 36; I wrote it down, and he said, that was right; he said, he should bring this person the next morning to prove what he said; he never afterwards came to me; I never saw him after till he was taken up; he had worked before at a yard opposite me; I found he worked for Mr. Seddon much about that time; I called at Mr. Seddon's, but the prisoner was not present; the mahogany was marked by Mr. Covington; I saw W. C. upon it before the Lord Mayor; I did not see him mark it.</p>
               <p>At the time this mahogany was sent to Mr. Seddon's had you more pieces of the length of seven feet and a half in your yard? - Yes, a great many pieces of the same length but not of the same width; this was Spanish wood, which is clearer in the grain; there was a figure of 4, a figure of 3, a figure of 2, and a figure of 1; I did not buy them; I do not know of my own knowledge that they were bought; only seeing them stand in the passage; he afterwards described to me where he had them from.</p>

               <p>I am a bedstead maker; I was partner with the last witness at the time these things were brought to our house; the prisoner brought a pair of pillars about seven on Tuesday evening; he brought two pair; the second pair were marked three and a half; I did not take particular notice of any four; they had been marked with a broad R, it was all in chalk: they were Spanish wood: he offered them for sale with a piece of board, that he brought with them, which he offered for twelve shillings and sixpence; the board was worth about four shillings, as near as we can calculate; I did not buy them; he left them in the passage: they were afterwards carried into the yard: we had no other Spanish wood in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100052"></xptr>the yard; the size of them was three and a half by four; we kept them in the yard, till some of Mr. Seddons people came, and fetched them; some days after they were carried before the Lord Mayor.</p>

               <p>I am a sawyer; I know Mr. Seddon's figures very well; I can swear positively almost that these figures are Mr. Seddon's writing; I first saw this piece at Hatton-wall, at Archibald's house, in the yard; I do not recollect the day; it was a fortnight or three weeks ago; it is Spanish wood, I saw no other Spanish wood in the yard; I know this by the figures; I had not sawed it; there was no other mark upon it, but a common cross.</p>
               <p>Could that cross be mistaken for a four? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>What may be the value of that? - Twelve or thirteen shillings; I saw it again before my Lord Mayor; I have kept it ever since; the marks are upon it now; there is a figure of four upon it.</p>

               <p>I had not missed any mahogany; I should not have known of it, if my people had not informed me; I have a great deal of this Spanish wood, and a great deal of this length; I suppose I have an hundred pair now; when I asked the prisoner where he got them; he told me he met a man in Moorfields one night with them, and the man asked him if he was a sawyer, and asked him to sell them for him, and he would give him two shillings and sixpence; and he said the man that gave them to him, had them from a man in Ratcliffe highway, who could not pay him his wagers, and so he gave them instead of money; I do not know when I lost them; they are my property by the figures.</p>
               <p>Is the 4 yours? - No, that is not mine; the 3 and 1/2 is; I swear to the writing, but not to the wood; we never sell the piece with the marks on, nor never send them out to be manufactured, we have manufactured for many years in our own house.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I can say but a vast little for myself, if I can give you satisfaction; a month last Monday, I was coming across Moorfields, with a saw on my shoulders, and a man with a pair of bed-posts on his shoulders, asked me to sell them, and offered me half a crown; the man went with me, and put them down in the passage; Mr. Covington came and looked at him; says he, what will you have for them; says he, eight shillings; says he, I can buy better than these for eight shillings; he gave six shillings, and three shillings and sixpence in part; I told him I should have another pair, not of the same sort of wood, and a piece of slab; he bid me bring them, which I did; the man met me the following night with the other pair; he disputed I had more than three shillings and sixpence; I brought him in before Mr. Covington's face, and asked him in the passage, and he said he gave me half a crown and one shilling, and in a few minutes after, Mr. Covington brought in the remainder of the money; and the next night they stopped me; I told them, I had them from a man that brought them from Ratcliffe highway; he asked me his name; I did not tell him any name particularly; at the same time my wife lay in, and he said he would detain me all night, which I did not like.</p>
               <p>Court to Seddon. Did this man ever work for you at any time? - He came the pay day, a day or two before I took him up; I am informed he worked for me two or three days in the place of a man that was sick.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eight witnesses who all gave him a very good character.</p>

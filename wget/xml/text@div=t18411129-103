I am assistant to William Fryer, who lives at Smith<lb></lb>field-bars—at half-past ten o'clock on the 27th of November, the prisoner came into the shop and took nine cigars out of the case before my face—I took them from her—these cigars are Mr. Will I am Fryer's, and this to<lb></lb>bacco is his too.</p>

At half-past eleven o'clock on Saturday I found the prisoner in the shop—I found she had been twice in the factory, and been turned out—I watched her the third time—she went in and took a handful of tobacco, she was placing it under her shawl, and was coming out with it—I stopped her with it—I know nothing about the cigars.</p>

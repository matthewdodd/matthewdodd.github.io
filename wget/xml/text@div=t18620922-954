                  </hi>. I live at 3, Park-village, East, and am printer and sub-editor of the <hi rend="italic">Weekly Times</hi> newspaper—I was so in June last—I produce the manuscript of a paragraph handed to me for insertion; it is signed by Mr. Gray, with his address; he brought it to me himself and said, "You will find this is a very extraordinary case, and I believe it to be true; I have made myself acquainted with the facts"—I said, "I will look to it"—and he left—I do not know whether he said that it would make a sensation, but he said that it was a very extraordinary affair—I was afterwards directed to give up the name—I have known Mr. Gray some years as a reporter at the Greenwich Police-court, and at inquests—I have frequently inserted copy from Mr. Gray before—if this had been brought to me by a stranger I very likely should not have inserted it, but I have uniformly inserted reports when he brought them—I should say that his statement influenced me in accepting the copy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor, and am a horse dealer in a very extensive way of business both in Yorkshire and abroad—my wife died in February—the first I heard of the inquest was through reading the article in the <hi rend="italic">Weekly Times,</hi> brought to me by my landlord on the Saturday night of its publication—the order for the exhumation of the body was con<lb></lb>tained</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186209220016"></xptr>
               <p>in that article, and the inquest was about a fortnight afterwards—there were two adjournments before the Coroner—I had an attendant who was with my wife during the whole of her illness, four years, and four doctors, two of whom made a post-mortem examination, and it was ascer<lb></lb>tained and proved before the Coroner that no poison had been administered—I have seen several copies of this paper in London, and have seen this copied into innumerable Yorkshire papers, the effect of which was, that I was continually pointed at, and crowds surrounded my house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was your mother-in-law examined before the Coroner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and her evidence was that I had poisoned my wife. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">objected to this evidence, and contended that the Coroner's de<lb></lb>position ought to be put in.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that as the witness had already stated something which took place at the Inquest, he had a right to ask for the rest; and further, that as it was only the Coroner's duty to take deposi<lb></lb>tions where a prisoner was committed, which was not the case here, there could be no better evidence than the oral evidence of the witness.</hi> (See 7 Geo. IV. c. 64.) <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Such misconduct as is implied by this article? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that I murdered my wife, in fact.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you find out afterwards that before this article was published she had applied to the police? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, she had—I do not know that she had applied to no less than three Coroners—I know that, ultimately, she got an order for the exhumation of the body from Mr. Humphreys, the Coroner, in consequence of which the inquest was held—I think the order was acted on at the Kensal-green Cemetery, in about a fortnight—I did not take care to have some person attending on my behalf, but there was a doctor attend<lb></lb>ing—I do not know who he was, or who performed the analysis—I had no one to look after my interests when the stomach was being analyzed—I received from the article in the newspaper the first intimation of that order, and went down to Mr. Humphrey's office and found out that it was true, though I could not succeed in finding him—I then took measures to get evidence and procure counsel—all the witnesses were summoned on the inquest, and examined, to throw a light on the subject—I received no summons to attend the inquest, nor any notice from the Coroner to attend, but if I had not seen it in the newspaper I suppose my solicitor would have taken me there—my mother-in-law was sworn before the Coroner—I was present when it was suggested that my wife had stated that she had been poisoned by me, and I had medical men to prove that this is not an un<lb></lb>common delusion with women suffering from puerperal fever as she was—there was a scene of considerable violence at my house in consequence of my mother-in-law's conduct—my wife died on the Saturday, and was buried on the following Wednesday; we buried her a day sooner to prevent any confusion from Mrs. Little's interference; I dreaded a scene from that violent woman, and I did it to prevent scandal—I had everything ready, and the undertaker said that it would be advisable—Mrs. Little was very persistent in this matter, and went to Sir Richard Mayne, among other persons.</p>

               <p>the police? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The detectives made inquiries, and among others of Miss Little, who said that there was no truth in her mother's accusation—she made application to other solicitors, who would not have anything to do with her case—I was informed that she went to Mr. Bedford, the Coroner, who refused to have any inquiries made by the beadle of the parish—she not to Mr. Brent, the Coroner, and he also refused—all this was going on during March, April, and May—I never objected to an inquest in the first instance—all this was before this paper was published—Mrs. Little is most awfully violent; she used to take a carving-knife about with her—Mr. Gray, or any stranger, would be satisfied from her conversation that she is a very violent woman—I do not know whether the burial was on Thursday, the 20th; it was fixed for one day, and we had it the day before—the first I hard about the other Mrs. Phillips was when it was suggested in this paper—I did not hear it at the inquest, nor did I ever hear it from Mrs. Little—it was not suggested by my wife—my wife was not jealous in the slightest de<lb></lb>gree—Mrs. Phillips is here; she is a highly respectable lady—Mr. Gray made no inquiries of me; I never saw him.</p>

I heard a coach coming behind me, and a horn blow; I was then directly opposite <placeName id="t18260914-15-crimeloc80">Barnet-church</placeName>

                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18260914-15-defend162 t18260914-15-deflabel81"></join> was pulling up, as it was too near me - he was not pulling up; I had no time to get further away; the fore-wheels or the cross-perch immediately struck my chaise, and turned the horse's head nearer to the right side; the hind wheel of the mail drove us completely over; my wife was thrown between the two wheels of the mail; I came down by the hind wheel, and caught hold of the wheel, as the coach was then stopping; seeing my wife's head had become a stop to the wheel, I thought she was killed, and had no power to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140009"></xptr>raise her. I turned round to the coachman, and said, "You villain, you have been the cause of this;" he said, "Me, it was no fault of mine - my guard blew the horn," and I think he said he called to me, and I should have got out of the way. I went round to the other side, between the coach and the church-yard, as he said there was not sufficient room; I said, "Here is almost room for another coach;" he made little or no reply; I should think there were six or seven feet of room from the off side of the mail to the wall; I have since ascertained the distance was seven feet. My wife was taken away by somebody - I did not see her for a quarter of an hour. I asked the coachman to come down and give me his address, which he did on my second or third application. The accident happened on a flat high road; there is no hill. I was driving at the rate of seven or eight miles an hour - it was quite light. My wife was in good health before - she remained at Barnet eleven days, and was then brought home, and died at Bethnal-green. Mr. Jeffs attended her. On the following morning, between three and four o'clock, I went into the road to survey in what situation I had been, and found my wife's ear-ring broken in the dust, and conclude that was the very spot where the wheel came in contact with my wife's head - I measured the road with my feet; the ear-ring was nine footsteps and a half from the foot-path, on my side. I did not measure the distance to the other side.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Do you know the width of the road? A. Twenty-three feet; there is a post to keep the carriages from going against the church-wall, but the wall turns off round just there, so that it does not occupy any space. My mother-in-law sat, as it were, between us. I heard the horn blow - I merely looked aside, and saw the leaders - they had not at that moment passed me; I saw their heads approach as I looked round; my eye was on the leaders, but at the same time on my own horse; they became like three horses abreast, as I just looked sideways. The wheel did not go over my wife's head. I had just started from the Wellington, public-house, and was going rather faster than usual - I was perfectly sober. I had not started above a minute - my pony was pretty fresh. Mr. Morris attended my wife at Barnet.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she not removed contrary to his orders? A. He seemed unwilling for her to go, and said he considered it as dangerous for her to go as at first, but she always said, "I shall die, and let me die at home" - she was moved in a glass-coach.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Is there any post on the side of the road to diminish the space left for the mail? A. I believe there is a post against the wall, but it could not make more than a foot difference.</p>

            . I am a farmer. I had been to market on this evening; a gig passed me, and then the mail passed - I heard the horn blow, and saw the mail strike the gig - I cannot say what part of the mail struck it; I was ten or twelve yards behind them. I saw the deceased almost under the coach wheel; the coachman had stopped then - I had not seen him endeavour to stop before he struck the gig; it appeared to me that the gig was in danger. There was plenty of room for the mail to have gone more to the right; I stopped the chaise-horse; I saw somebody with his shoulder to the wheel of the mail, as if pushing it back; the mail went at about the regular rate, about ten miles an hour, I suppose. I think there was no want of care on the coachman's part - he was on his right side. The prisoner was the coachman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were you when the gig and mail passed? A. Nearly opposite the King's Head public-house, walking in the road. I was as near the middle of the road as possible after they passed. The mail stopped directly the accident happened. I was behind, and saw the mail and the gig.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Shoreditch. I saw Mrs. Farbridge the morning after the accident; there were three fractures on her lower jaw, and a dreadful contusion, extending the whole length of the neck - her collar-bone was fractured, and the shoulderbone much bruised, and injured; she had great difficulty of breathing, and altogether it was a horrible case; I was convinced she could not live - she was sensible, but could not speak. I recommended her being brought to town, which was done in nine or ten days - I then attended her daily - she mended for a day or two, but died on the 5th of July. I believe the actual cause of her death was inflammation of the lungs, produced by the external injury.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had inflammation taken place when she was moved? A. I believe it commenced when the injury was given, and gradually increased till she died; I only saw her once at Barnet - I advised her coming home, that she should have a physician. I thought the case was dangerous from the first; her removal would not increase the inflammation in the state she was in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming very steadily round Barnet - it is a very dangerous place. I saw the chaise; the guard blew the horn, and I hallooed out; I was pulling up my horses at the time; the wheel got entangled with my wheel; her head was under my wheel: I was as careful as a man could be. I have driven the mail twenty-two years, and never had an accident.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to HENRY FARBRIDGE. Q. When you turned aside a little, and saw the leaders, can you say you did not pull the right-hand rein a little? A. I pulled to the near side when I was opposite the clock, but pulled neither right or left afterwards; I am certain I did not pull them when I turned. I have been used to drive for about twenty-three years.</p>

            . I am post-master at Barnet. I saw Mr. Farbridge drive by my house, with two other persons in his gig; I thought by the manner of holding his reins he was not accustomed to drive, and was fearful an accident might occur, as I heard the mail go by - I did not see the accident.</p>

               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Where did you see him? A. Passing my door; he might get perhaps fifteen yards before the mail got to my door. The ground slopes rather towards London; the road is about eight yards wide where the accident happened; three carriages might pass with careful driving.</p>

            . - I was guard to the Liverpool mail on this night. At Barnet we saw a gig before us - I blew the horn full one hundred and fifty yards off, and continued to blow till we got up to it, and the prisoner hallooed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140010"></xptr>as well; the horses and the fore-wheel cleared the gig, but instead of the prosecutor drawing his rein to pull out, he stopped for an instant, and came back on the carriage - the horse jibbed back as it were, and so the mischief happened; the step of the mail struck the gig - our splinter-bar projects as near the extremity of the wheel as possible - the bars of the leaders project as near the same length as possible, and, if they pass without touching, we consider that the coach itself will pass. The prisoner pulled up immediately - he must have had his horses very tight in hand - the wheel did not go over the deceased.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Did you ever drive? A. I have in case of emergency - but seldom; the lower step of the coach turns up - I cannot say whether it was turned up - the chaise might have turned it down - it came exactly against it, and bent it - we were on our proper side; I do not believe there was more than three feet of room on our right side, but there was room to pass if the horse had not knocked against the carriage; the backing of the gig caused the accident. As soon as the coachman got somebody to mind the horses he went in and gave his address. We were not going at more than seven miles and a half an hour - our time from South Mims to town is an hour and forty-five minutes - it is fifteen miles and a half - we were coming up. The prisoner has surrendered here to-day.</p>

            . I live at Barnet. I was standing at my door, about ten yards from where the accident happened; I had a perfect view of what passed - I saw Mr. Farbridge, his wife, and mother, coming down in a gig, on the off side, by the church wall - the horn blew some time before the mail got up - Jervis, who was at my house, called to him three or four times to come on his own side, and the coachman hallooed some time before he got up. Mr. Farbridge drew directly across the road - the mail was on its own side - the right rein was pulled by Mr. Farbridge or his mother, and that occasioned the accident; I saw it plainly - the coachman stopped instantly. The deceased was brought to my house, and remained there eleven days. Mr. Morris saw her three or four times a day - she got much better, and was in a fair way of doing well.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. What are you? A. My husband keeps an ironmonger's shop there - the prisoner was quite a stranger to me - he called six or seven days after the accident, to know how she was. I heard Jervis call to Mr. Farbridge to come on his own side - the mail was then about twenty yards from him - he had time to get out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the coachman time to stop? A. I do not know - I should not think he had occasion to stop. I swear that Farbridge was on his wrong side - my house is directly opposite the church-yard corner.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. When the gig was called to it crossed over to its proper side? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mrs. BETTY. I live next door to Mrs. King. I was at my ground floor window, which is rather high - I could only see straight before me - I heard a horn blow, and a hallooing, that made me go to the window, as it was a particular noise; I saw a gig coming with particularly large wheels - the Liverpool mail came on its own side of the road, as near as it could be with propriety to the iron railing of the church-yard; the horses and the fore-wheel passed the gig, then the chaise, instead of going straight on (for then the coach would have cleared it) instantly flew back towards the coach doors, and immediately upset.</p>
               <p>Q. As far as you can judge, what occasioned the accident? A. Great neglect in driving, on Mr. Farbridge's part - but I am not used to drive - if he had gone straight on he would have cleared the coach.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Are you acquainted with Wells? A. I never spoke to him: Farbridge was on his right side when I saw him.</p>

            . I keep the King's Head public-house, at Barnet, on the opposite side to the church. I stood in the foot-path, in front of my door, about thirty yards from where this occurred, and could see what happened perfectly well. I first saw the gig on the same side as my house - I saw the mail coming from the post-office - the gig passed my door, and the horn blew - instead of the gig keeping on that side it darted towards the other side - the coachman hallooed very loud when he got nearer to it - the horses and front of the coach passed, but the man in the gig pulled the rein, which pulled the horse from the coach and turned the back of the gig into the lock of the coach. This, in my opinion, caused the accident - I am not acquainted with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. You think it was occasioned by the driver of the gig bringing the hind wheel into the lock of the coach? A. Yes; if it had kept on properly it would have been within a foot of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not at least seven feet of space where the mail might have gone to the right side and not been near the gig? A. No, there might be about six inches from the mail to the post, but I did not measure it - there is a drain which it must have gone on if it had gone nearer.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Where was the drain? A. Near the coach - there is a post to keep coaches from running on the drain, which is between two and three feet from the wall.</p>

            . I keep the Mitre public-house, at Barnet. I was about forty yards off when this accident happened, but cannot state the particulars. I went up before the coachman got off the box, and saw where the mail had pulled up - I measured the distance of the hind wheel to the post - there was only the length of my foot between the wheel and the post; it had not moved for I saw the blood lay under the step; I measured the road yesterday - it is twenty-two feet six inches from the post to the near side of the road - the fore wheel of the coach stood against the post - the hind wheel would have come nearer to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Could not three carriages go abreast in that space? A. Yes - the gig was in the middle of the road - there must have been a space of about two yards and a half on his near side.</p>

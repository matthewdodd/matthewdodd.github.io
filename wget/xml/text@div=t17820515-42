               <p>I met the prisoner on Sunday morning, the 28th of April, by the Brown Bear, in Bow-street, Covent-Garden, about five o'clock in the morning; he was attempting to go into the house, but the landlord pushed him out. He said to me, I know of another public-house; if you will go with me, you shall be well entertained, and have what liquor you chuse to drink. I went with him to a public-house, I cannot recollect where, but, to the best of my knowledge, it was the <placeName id="t17820515-42-crimeloc202">Feathers, Great Wild-street</placeName>

During the time we staid, he put his hand into my pocket, and took out three half crowns: I was almost asleep when he put his hand first into my pocket, but that awaked me; I missed my money, and called to him just as he was going out. I perceived his hand in my pocket; I am sure it was he, because there was nobody else in the tap-room. I called to him, that I wanted to speak to him, but he shut the door: I went and opened the door as nimbly as I could; by that time he was crossing the street. I called out that he had got my money; upon that he ran, I pursued him. It was then near seven o'clock. I followed him through several turnings for about five minutes, crying Stop thief. He was stopped by

I went and called a constable; the constable asked me what he had robbed me of; I said three half crowns; he asked me if I could swear to it; I said I could, and I described them. The constable searched him, and found three half-crowns in his coat poc ket, that answered the description I gave of them: there is one very remarkable, it is marked G H on the woman side; there is another, a bad one; the third I had no particular marks on; but I am sure the other two are mine.</p>

               <p>I was drinking with him all night; we were at a house in Long-acre; he came with me from thence to Red-lion street, Holborn, before he charged me with any thing; he would drink at almost every house that he could find open; he said the next morning, if I would give him a guinea, he would make it up. I said I was but a poor man, I believed I could raise half a guinea; he said we must go before the justice to have a proper discharge. When we came there, he swore point blank that I took the money out of his pocket.</p>

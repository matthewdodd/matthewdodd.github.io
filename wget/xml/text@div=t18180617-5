            . On the 29th of May I was coming from Epsom in a return chaise, a little after two o'clock in the morning, and was sat down between Whitehall-place and Privy-gardens. I crossed the street towards the <placeName id="t18180617-5-crimeloc23">Treasury-passage</placeName>

I called stop thief! and followed him into Privy-gardens to Lord Carlisle's house, round the Duke of Buccleugh's, he then turned down Parliament-street-the private watchman pursued - He was taken about three minutes after by White, the watchman. It was very light. I am sure he is the man. I lost sight of him.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Parliament-street. I had just called two o'clock in the morning, and saw the private watchman run up Charles-street, he called me - He crossed over to the prisoner, and said, "you are my prisoner;" he immediately ran away. I gave the alarm, and caught him in the back-yard in Downing-street - he was never out of my sight. He was taken to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am constable of the night. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house in the Almonry, about two o'clock. I searched him, and found the watch in his right-hand coat-pocket. I had asked him if he had got the watch? he said, No.</p>

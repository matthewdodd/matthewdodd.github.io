             and myself, I did not suppose she took it to keep, but would return it; I expected her return the next day, as she had been accustomed to visit me daily in the Fleet; finding she did not return on the third day, I directed a letter to her, where I supposed she was, in Albermarle-street, to which I received no answer; I then became very alarmed for the safety of my purse and the effects deposited in it; from that time to this I could hear nothing of her till she was arrested (which I think was in July last) in an action of trover, joined in with this Dorant, to which bail was given; I did not hear any more of her until there was a public rumour of an action against her for an assault, that I think was in the latter end of November, 1805; that matter was bailed, I could not discover where she was, Mr. Sewell was my solicitor, he was a prisoner, he had a day rule.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had a day rule did you apply any where. - A. I did at Guildhall, and obtained a warrant, which warrant was backed by Mr. Kinnard, she then could not be found, I was removed to Bath; after I arrived at Bath, and was fully committed to take my trial, a writ was issued for the twenty thousand pound, but the affidavit was made in the month of November before; I swore to a debt of twenty thousand pound, in deeds, mortgages, bonds, and bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you recovered any of your things; has your action ever been tried. - A. Not yet, I have proceeded in it as far as I could; this writ was sent down to Bath by my solicitor, as well as this warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was determined to have her both ways; was she with you at Bath. - A. She was with Dorant at Bath.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this diamond ring found or your purse found. - A. I never could find any part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you mentioned it to Mr. Eyles the warden of the Fleet. A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Nixon; I suppose you mentioned it to him, what misfortune you had. - A. I do not know that I ever mentioned it to Mr. Nixon; I mentioned it to Mr. Sewell and several fellow prisoners, but I did not mention it to the warden, because I was told he would order me to apply to a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Certainly he would. - A. I did make the application to Mr. Nixon, he told me he could not get the alderman down.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got the rules of the Fleet why did not you prefer your bill here, you did not ask leave of the warden to come here and prefer the bill of indictment. - A. No, I thought if I mentioned it to him he would have advised me to have a habeas corpus.</p>
               <p>Court. He would not, he might have brought you in the rules, it would have been no escape.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Cummins.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you come to England. - A. In the year 1802 or 1803, I came from the West Indies, I arrived from St. Christopher's, before that I was in St. Lucie, Antigua, St. Bartholomew, and St. Martin's.</p>
               <p>Q. And at all these places you followed the business of a gentleman. - A. I hope so.</p>

               <p>Q. He was dead perhaps before you were old enough to know him. - A. I was told so.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I am to understand you, you never lived as clerk with any body in the West Indies; and never was in any business. - A. No business but what was connected with my own; during part of last war I was an officer in the British army, in the eighty seventh regment.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any property in this kingdom. - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. No acquired property in this kingdom. - A. None, I have my remittances from the West Indies; in the year 1803 and 1804, I resided principally in Lancashire and Liverpool, in 1805 I came into London.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any one permission to draw upon any merchant in London. - A. I had permission to draw upon Mr. Hope in the month of February or March 1805; I drew several bills upon him for three or four hundred pound, they were drawn upon Mr. Hope's house, Amsterdam, payable in London.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send them to Amsterdam - A. No, they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020044"></xptr>were to be paid in Harley-street.</p>

               <p>Court. What value might you put upon them. - A. That is uncertain, I cannot say, because the value fluctuates according to the current price.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you introduce her there as your wife. - A. I believe I did; I kept no company at the hotel, I was only there for my own convenience, I never saw the master of the hotel.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you like to see the servants better, did not you both live there and pass as man and wife. - A. We did.</p>

            , he was with me but a few weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he quitted your room on the 14th of June. - A. I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Till the 11th of June that young woman came backwards and forwards. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell your chum Cummings that she was your wife, what name did you call her. - A. Mrs. Rouvelet.</p>
               <p>Q. On June the 11th 1805, you were in a room on the top gallery in the Fleet prison; I think you have described you went to your purse, took out half a guinea, carried it to the man at the door, then you put your purse in your great coat pocket again. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the great coat that you have got on. - A. It is not; I did not say a great coat, a loose coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a purse was this. - A. It was a purse of two compartments, one side was the forty guineas and a half, and the other side the diamond ring.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you often wear a diamond ring. - A. I never wore it in the Fleet.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have not had any correspondence with Mr. Hope since the consignment of the sugar failed. - A. I have not had any correspondence with him since the failure of the consignment of the sugar was known.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed the purse about twenty minutes after that young woman went out. - A. I did,</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Cummings was with you till the 14th or 15th of June. - A. I think on the Friday following he went out.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this the purse and diamond ring was lost. - A. I cannot say what day in the week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention it to Mr. Cummings. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a separation between you. - A. She did abscond, I never saw her afterwards till she was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020045"></xptr>arrested.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say to Mr. Cummings, that you would not hesitate to do any thing to be revenged on her, meaning the unfortunate young woman at the bar, and lamented that you could not make a charge of felony against her. -</p>
               <p>Court. Upon your oath did you or did you not. - A. I cannot charge my memory with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say any thing like it. - A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your purse or the contents again. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cummins. I ask you upon your oath whether Mr. Cummings did not on the 12th of June find your purse and money, and that under your bed. A. He did not; I recollect some days previous to that he did.</p>
               <p>Court. The question is whether after the 11th of June a person of the name of Cummings did not find a purse with the contents under your bed. - A. I do not recollect it; I was going to say that some day after I got up out of bed, Mr. Cummings making up the bed, took out the purse and gave it to me; I think that was before the 11th.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cummins. Did you not then say, Cummings this is what I have deliberated. - A. I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 14th or 15th of June Cummings, your chum, left the prison. - A. I think it was the latter end of the same week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him that order (a paper handed to the witness). - A. I gave him a letter, I believe, to Mrs. Rouvellet.</p>
               <p>Q. With an order for two or three guineas. - A. Very probably I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him any authority. - A. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. This is your hand writing (shewing him a paper). A. I recollect something of the kind.</p>
               <p>I will just read a part of it to you. - I hereby empower and authorize Mr.

I am a box-maker, and live at 96, Offord Road, Islington—on Sunday night, 16th August about a quarter to 12 o'clock, I was in Upper Street, Islington—near the corner of Theberton Street the prisoner came upon mo all at once, took my chain, and ran away—I ran after him and caught him, and he gave me back my chain, because I gave him a knock or two with my. umbrella—he was going away gently, I followed him with a witness, saw a policeman, and gave him in charge—I was perfectly sober.</p>

Islington—I was in Upper Street about 12 o'clock on this night—heard a scuffle and cries, and saw the prosecutor following the prisoner; they got about the middle of Theberton Street and stopped together, I could not see what took place there, it was dark, and I was about 50 yards away—the prisoner then walked away to the top of Theberton Street, crossed the Liverpool Road into Trinity Street—the prosecutor spoke to a constable, who followed the Prisoner and took him—I had not lost sight of him—I am quite certain he is the man.</p>

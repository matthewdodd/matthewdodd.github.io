He did - he attempted to strike my husband afterwards, but did not strike him - that was about twenty minutes after I found the shop open - they do not work very late - they do not work by candle light, but he was on the premises, because he associated very much with Knowles - his master's shop was locked up long before that.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you find the property? A. Outside the shop - the poker was about two feet from the prisoner - he said he would stop there all night - I said he should not - I quarrelled with him, and sent for a policeman, because he was going to strike me.</p>

She was positive the Prisoner was the Person, and had on a Lac'd Hat and white Cloak, that she saw him plainly by the Light of two Lamps (one on each side the Door) and knew him, he having liv'd some time in the same street. The Prisoner deny'd the Fact, and pleaded in his Defence, that about fourteen Months ago he lent the Prisoner I l. I s. 6 d. for which he had a Note under her Hand (and produced a Note in Court) and that he arrested her a Month ago for the Money, which was the Occasion of this Prosecution. He called one Mrs Boom to prove it, who swore that the Prosecutor told her the Prisoner had arrested her, but that there was a Hoopt Petticoat stole, and she would swear it against him; she further deposed that the Prosecutor was a Woman of the Town, and that the House she lived in had been reputed a Bawdy-House above half a year. He likewise called one Mr. Domes to discredit the Prosecutor, who did not; but gave him a very ill Character, and said that they had some trouble to rout him out of the Neighbourhood, being afraid of being robb'd by him every Night. The Prosecutor denyed the Note, or that she ever gave him one, or ever had any dealings with him. She also called one Mrs. Meal to her Reputation, who said she was a very Civil industnious Woman and made Perriwig-Calls for her Livelyhood, which she sold to the Barbers and Perriwig-makers, and that she lived in a private House of good Repute. The Justice deposed that he owned he affaulted her and said that he would make Satisfaction, and then swear against her and so be even with her. That he was a bold audacious Fellow, held up his Fist against him, called him Sirrah, and Swore he would be revenged of him. The Constable likewise deposed that he enquir'd af her in the Neighbourhood, and found a good Character of her; and that the Prisoner would have agreed it up both before and after they went before the Justice.

I then said to the prisoner, give me the man's watch, I believe you have got it; she denied it; on searching her, I found the watch under her right arm, which I then took into my own possession; I then said to the prosecutor, have you lost any thing else; he said, I have lost two seven-shilling pieces and some silver, but to what amount I cannot say; I found them in the prisoner's possession, I produce the property. (The property identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) Had you been with the woman at all? - A. Yes, I had been with the woman under the hay-stack.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your watch might have dropped out of your pocket? - A. No, it could not have dropped out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the 28th of July, I met the prosecutor on the common about nine o'clock in the evening; he asked me where I was going; I told him, home; he asked me to have something to drink; I told him I would have something to eat; he asked me if I would take him somewhere to sleep, he said he was so drunk he could not go home; he then said to me, stop a bit, have you got my watch; no, says I, I did not know that you had got a watch; I beg your pardon, says he. I did not think that you would have taken it. He then asked me again to take him any where to lye down till the morning, he did not care where it was to be safe; I took him where there was some new hay, and then he gave me two bundles, and I covered them all over with the hay; he fell fast asleep, and I fell asleep likewise. After I had been asleep, I felt the hay move; there was a sailor there that had dragged the bundles from under my head; I then jumped up, and found the bundles on the ground; the sailor picked them up, and the bag with the seven-shilling pieces, and ran round the factory; I told him the things belonged to the young man that was asleep; I was standing close to the gate when that man came and took me with the property.</p>

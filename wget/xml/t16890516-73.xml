            </rs>. The Evidence was plain that the Coat was seen upon Kirby's back, and the money was found (some part of it) by Gardner's direction; the House was broke open, and the Key taken out of Mr. James's Pocket, as his Breeches lay by the Beds-side. The Prisoner Gardner confest that he Robbed Mr. Jones's House, and went a Back way to let Kirby in, which Evidence was corroboraed by Mrs. Jones, how that Gardner directed her to one Coppingers on Tower hill, where under some Bricks was a Bag of money, and 4 Silver Spoons, which were found accordingly. It did not appear that they broke open the House, the Doors being open, all which he the said Gardner confest upon the Tryal, and had nothing to say for himself. Kirby had not so strong Evidence against him, only he was let into the House by Gardner, as Gardner confest, but that was lookt upon as no Evidence against him in Law. So after a distinct Hearing, they were both found <rs id="t16890516-73-verdict325" type="verdictDescription">

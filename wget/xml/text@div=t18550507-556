                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I lodge in Wellelose-square. On Saturday morning, 5th May, I was taken by a constable to the house of Mary Ward—I saw my trunk there—the last time I had seen it was in a small cart, being conveyed from the ship to the lodging house, on the Thursday evening before—I saw it put into the cart, but did not follow it—the trunk contained two pairs of boots, two pairs of flannel drawers, some woollen socks, three shirts, and other wearing apparel—I saw the shirts again on Saturday morning, at Mrs. Ward's—I met the prisoner in the street on Saturday morning, and asked him if he had seen my box, and he said, "No."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Ward, and keep a lodging house for seamen. On Thursday night, May 3rd, the prisoner and three other men with a cart of luggage, came to my house just before 9 o'clock—the prisoner hired a lodging for himself and three more men—the luggage was taken into the kitchen; it was a bed, three chests, and two bags—one chest belonged to one of the other men, and there was one which the prisoner said was his—he was going to break it open that evening, and I asked him why he was going to do so; he said, "Because I want a clean shirt"—I lent him a hammer and a poker to break it open, but his shipmate said, "Harry, do not break it open now, let us go and get the key"—the carter said that if they did not pay him, he would get them into trouble—he said, "It is not your own chest, I will get you into trouble; if you <hi rend="italic">do</hi> me, I will <hi rend="italic">do</hi> you"—shortly after I told him not to break it open, they both went out of the house, the prisoner saying that he was gone for the key—he did not come back till next morning between 9 and 10 o'clock, when he asked me for a hammer, and went and got the poker, and broke it open—he gave me three shirts to wash, which I gave to the constable—he took a pair of boots out and said, "You shall have some more things to wash another day," and he took some more things out, and put them in again in my presence—my husband reported it at the police office; a constable came, and I showed the chest to him, and gave him the shirts—I did not see the prosecutor till the Friday morning; he then saw the chest, and owned the shirts.</p>

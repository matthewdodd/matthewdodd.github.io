               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. When was this - A. About a quarter past seven o'clock in the morning; the fight had not began; they were making the ring. I was outside the ring - the prisoner went opposite to me, and remained there till the officer came. I lost sight of him when the officer came, but not half a minute. I did not state that some man who got away had taken my watch, and that he staid three quarters of an hour on the ground. There was some confusion while they were beating out the ring.</p>

               <p>PRINCE BURT. I am fourteen years of age. I was at the fight, and saw the prosecutor and the prisoner beating<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280038"></xptr>out the ring. I saw the prisoner push the prosecutor by the shoulder, and take his watch - I saw it in his hand; he crossed the ring. I did not stop any longer, but went home with my father. I do not think there were any other persons there like the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw a mob going into the field: I went in, and was there a quarter of an hour; they said the officers were coming, and the people dispersed. The witness came and said I was the person who took his watch.</p>

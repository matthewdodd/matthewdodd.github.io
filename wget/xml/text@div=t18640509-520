I am a greengrocer of Leytonstone, Essex—on Tuesday, 12th April, at 8 in the morning, I was in Rood-lane, City, with my horse and cart, containing potatoes and greens, and all sorts of vegetables—I had occasion to go to Billingsgate-market—I saw the prisoner in Rood-lane, and he said, "I will look after your horse and cart"—I left him in charge of it—I was absent about ten minutes; when I came back the horse, cart, and man were gone—I gave information to the police; and I saw my horse and cart the next day in the green-yard at Clapham; it was empty then—the value of the property in the cart was between 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi> and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the horse and cart 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the lowest.</p>

               <p>about twenty minutes before 10, I passed him in a cart, coming along the Strand—I was riding on the roof of an omnibus coming to the Old Bailey sessions—he was going towards Westminster—he smiled and nodded as he passed—I afterwards saw the prosecutor's cart at the Mansion-house, and I believe it was the same the prisoner was riding in.</p>

On the 16th of August, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner and another young man brought in a barometer to pledge, it was in the prisoner's hand - he asked two guineas on it, I offered him 15 s., he refused and said he should like 30 s., I would not advance that, and he went away.</p>

Lloyd was shabbily dressed. The prisoner immediately took it, he and Lloyd went on to Newby's, and came out without pawning it. The prisoner took it to the opposite shop. Lloyd and I waited outside, he then went to a third shop in Stanhope-street, the prisoner went in alone, Lloyd and I waited at the corner of the street, the prisoner came out, and gave Lloyd 15 s. and the duplicate, deducting some halfpence. Lloyd parted with us at the end of the street, he then took a boat, went up the river, and returned to the office.</p>

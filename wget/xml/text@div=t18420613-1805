                  </hi>. I am a bookseller and stationer, and live it Hampton, in Middlesex. On the evening of the 16th of May, about half-past six o'clock, I was called by Mr. Woolridge a neighbour, and in conse<lb></lb>quence of what he said, I ran after the prisoners—I overtook and brought them back—I had missed a pack of cards from the glass case in my front window—I searched Brown, and found the pack of cards, and six bunches of beads, which had been in my shop before—I know these cards—I had only five packs in the case, and I had only four packs then remaining—I found the place vacant—I know these beads by their various colours, I had fifteen bunches in my shop before, and I had then only nine remain<lb></lb>ing—I sent for the officer and gave the prisoners into custody—I only know that Holloway was with Brown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Brown.</hi> He said there were five or six of the cards short, and now he says there is a pack.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Holloway.</hi> He said at first there was a whole pack, and when he came before the Magistrate, he said five or six were lost out of them, and to wife said the same. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not say there were any missing—they were just as they are now, tied up inside Brown's shirt—he had got forty or fifty yards from my house.</p>

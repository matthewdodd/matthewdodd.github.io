               <p>Q. In consequence of any directions of Mr. Oakley, did you follow his caravan. - A. Last Monday night I followed it from Bond street to Piccadilly; Richards and another man got in the cart; Dukes was driving the cart; they went from there to Lisle street, and then to Holborn, to a public house door.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the evening was that. - A. I believe about seven o'clock; one of them said. d - n it, it is too light; they went from there, and went down the hill to another public house; I saw the carter go up in the cart and take a mat out, and after that they took another mat out; after they had some thing to drink Richards walked off with the mats; Richards went on towards Hatton Garden, and the cart went on to Fleet market; I stopped Richards; he had two mats under his arm; I told him he had some goods that did not belong to him, they belonged to Mr. Oakley; he said he was very innocent, he was sorry they were stolen property.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see the cart go from the door. - A. Yes. Richards was not with the cart then.</p>

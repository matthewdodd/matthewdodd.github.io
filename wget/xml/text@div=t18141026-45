            , JUNIOR. - Q. How old are you? - A. Fourteen.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the son of the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your father and your mother lived together, did they? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the day on which your mother died? - Yes, it was last Michaelmas-day; it was between six and seven o'clock in the evening. My father came down stairs, and asked my mother to account for the money. I do not know what money; she said she would not give any account. Then she went to the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your father sober at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your mother sober? - A. No; she was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Before she run away to the window, had your father said any thing else to her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she run to the window for - A. I don't know. My father cried, and then went and shut down the window; that was before she jumped out. She did not attempt to get out then? she threw up the window, and stood by it; my father went and shut it down. A few minutes afterwards, a Gentleman came, Mr. Allcroft; then my father went out out of the room with Mr. Holcroft; my mother staid in the room. My father came back when Mr. Allcroft was gone. My mother told him to take pen and ink and she would render an account. Then she gave account of all the money but twelve shillings; then she hesitated a little, and went and threw it up. She went to jump out; my father went to lay hold of her; she fell hackwards out of the window into the street; she cut her head by falling backwards into the street. She bled; she got up and knocked at the door. My sister opened the door, and let nor in. I went to meet her; then she had her hand to her head, and said, O! my head! The tea-pot laid on the side-board; she threw it at my father. I don't know whether it hit him or not; but the water went over him. He shook it off; he was going to strike her, but he did not. I pulled him by his coat; he then tore his hair, and cryed, and said, what a woman is this? My God, children, what shall I do with her? He went to lift her up, he could not; she was reeling on the floor. When she threw the tea-pot at him, she then tumbled down by the sideboard, and hurt her eye. When she fell down on the floor; she kept rolling about, and tearing her clothes off. When My father tried to lift her up, she would not let him, and continued rolling about. She tore her pockets off; I picked them up. I examined the pockets for money; I found a one pound note and some silver. I gave it to my father. My mother was crying; then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260032"></xptr>my mother did not speak any more. She was lying all along dead on the ground; my father went and fetched the doctors. He came and said my mother was dead, and went away. I did not see my father commit any one act of violence upon my mother.</p>

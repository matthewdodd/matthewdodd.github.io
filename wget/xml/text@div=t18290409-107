               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How much bread did he bring back? A. I am not certain; I looked, but I have forgotten what it was; I saw the housekeeper enter the bread from the slate, and he told her there were two and thirteen - I have not got the slate or the book here; my housekeeper has made mistakes in entering the loaves, but I saw this entered myself.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Did you know, when he returned, what deficiency there was? A. Yes: what he brought back, and what he booked to the customers, only made two and thirteen, and it should have been two and seventeen.</p>

I took the prisoner on the 17th of March, going by the King's-mews; I asked him what could induce a young man like him to rob his master, having such good wages; he said he found he had four 2 lbs. loaves over what he had accounted for, and he thought he might as well sell them, and apply the money to his own use.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he know you? A. Yes; he served my house with bread - he did not deny it in his master's shop, in my presence.</p>

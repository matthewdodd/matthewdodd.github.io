               <p>ANN HUGHES. I live at 15, Redcross-street. I made a purchase of a stove, on the 21st of October; I bought it at Mr. Deakin's warehouse, in Aldersgate-street; it was the prisoner who served me; I paid him a one-pound note and eight shillings, and he gave me a receipt for that amount.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Adolphus. I did not want a stove.</p>

               <p>Q. Therefore you did not buy a stove, because you never had any property in that stove - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you returned that stove to Mr. Deakin - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.But you are to do so, for it was Mr. Deakin's own money - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am master of the workhouse where the prisoner was supported, in the parish of St. Margaret's, Westminster; I have a dwelling-house there, and dwell there as the master; nine o'clock is the latest hour for locking up the paupers, and the prisoner was locked in the ward No. 15, the ward he was making his escape over; the prisoner was locked up in the evening in his ward; I was informed by the pantry-man there was a robbery committed, and I went to the spot, and Giles, and the witness were in the garden, the garden gate was locked; when I came up, he was in custody in the garden, there was no communication with the house; I saw the property taken from him, which was a ball of woollen yarn; I did not examine from what part of the premises it had been taken till next morning, then I examined the door, and I found all fastened as before, except the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find how the warehouse, where the yarn had been deposited, had been entered? - A. Not till the next morning; it had been entered by pulling down a board that fastened up a window, through which he put his arms, that was the way the entry was effected, there could be no other way; it was taken out of what we call the spinning-shop; I was in the garden at half past eight o'clock, and every thing was very safe then; there was no ladder in the garden then, and no window open whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. After a person had entered the workhouse, could he have opened the windows in the way you speak of? - A. Yes, they slide backwards and forwards; there was the mark of a person's feet in the garden, and he could get into that house by pulling down a board, and he could undraw the window; all was secure when I left it, because I walked backwards and forwards there; the value of the yarn is eighteen pence; they were arguing about the weight of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he said any thing about it, had you made him any promises or threats? - A. No; they were arguing about it; I said I believed it was three pounds; and he said it was three pounds and a quarter, or three pounds and an ounce; he was in the habit of balling those yarns.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When he came from the wards, what did he do? - A. He must come into the back yard, where they are all locked up, and pull down a board, and go through the window into the shop; he was caught upon the top of the house, and was then making his escape: he took a small ladder out of the work-shop to get upon the tiles, he then could get into the street; he could have made his escape by going over that room very easily; the roof was next to the street.</p>
               <p>Q. What interest have you in the house? - A. I am master of it, I have a salary for taking care of it, the parish pays the rent; I do not occupy the whole house myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has the profits of the manufacture? - A. The parish.(

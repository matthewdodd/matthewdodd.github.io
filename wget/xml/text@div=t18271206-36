            . I am the prisoner's wife. I have been married to him eleven weeks to-day; we lodged at my father's house. On the 10th of November he left home about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning, and told me to come over to the Greyhound at Enfield, to meet him, at half-past six in the evening; we had then been married seven weeks, all but two days - I went to the Greyhound exactly at six o'clock; it is about one mile and a quarter from our house; he was not there - I went again a little after seven o'clock, and found him there - I opened the door of the room where he was sitting, and beckoned to him to come out - I waited outside about three quarters of an hour; he then came to me, and asked if I would come in - I said No, and he asked if I wanted to go home - I said Yes, as soon as I could: he said he was not going yet; he went in again - I staid at the door; he came out again in about five minutes, and brought me 5s. - I asked if that was all he had got, as I had had but 3s. 6d. the week before; he said it was - I went to a shop, and got some things which I wanted, then went back to the room, and waited till he was ready, and about three minutes after ten o'clock he got up to go away - after he came out I asked him again if he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060027"></xptr>had no more money for me; he said No, he had but 1 1/2d. - I said I thought he was very much to blame for spending his money at a public-house, when he knew it was wanted at home; he abused me, and said he had no more for me, and after that he gave me 1s.; we were going through Enfield town at that time; he kept abusing me along the town, and after we came to Mr. Fox's, the corn-chandlers, he gave me another 1s. - I went into the corn-chandler's, bought a quartern loaf, and a peck of coals - I gave him the coals to carry home; he had a round basket, with a handle across it, and his hoe through the handle; it was empty; we went on; he rested just before he came to the fields, and wanted me to go over the fields - I said I should not go that way; there is a path across the fields, up a bye-lane - I refused to go that way, and went along the highway; he stopped against the lane leading to the fields; he followed me along the road, about twenty yards behind me; he overtook me directly afterwards, and when we had got about one mile along the road, he kept calling me very abusive names - I said very little to him - I made him very few answers - I was afraid of him, for he swore at me a great deal - I did not use any threats to him; he was not drunk; he had one pot of beer; he did not appear drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to know what he was about? A. Yes; he had been in the public-house, from six till ten o'clock - I was outside - I do not know how long he had been drinking; he was saying, at the Greyhound, that he would go and see a young man, called Jockey James, who was in Chelmsford gaol, and while he was swearing at me on the road, he said, he should soon be where Jockey James was - I did not know James - I only knew there was such a person; after saying that, he abused me again, and said, when he got me home, he would kick me out of doors like a dog - I told him it was at his peril to do that, for there was nothing there belonging to him, and if he did not like me, to leave me, for he had used me ill ever since he had married me; he kept calling me every thing that was bad, and just as we got over the bridge, at Forty-hill, I said, "You good for nothing fellow, you ought to be ashamed to call me such names;" he stopped, and set down the bag of coals off one shoulder, and the basket off the other; I thought he was going to rest, as he had done before, but he drew the hoe deliberately from the handle of the basket, and knocked me down on the bridge; he hit me with the hoe - I do not know whether it was with the back or front of it, but it was with the iron part; he hit me on the head with it; it knocked me down, and took away my senses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he cut your head, or make any wound? A. He cut my head - I had a bonnet on, not the one I have now; he did not say anything - I do not know how long I remained insensible - I am not sensible of his giving me any other blow; when I came a little to myself, I did not know what was the matter with me - I could not believe he had done such a thing - I felt something very warm falling down my face, and thought it was perspiration, but when I came to myself, and found it was blood, I screamed out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he? A. I do not know - I did not see him - I screamed very violently - I could not speak, but could scream - I heard somebody calling out of a window, but could not answer for some time; my husband then came to the left side of me, as I laid on the ground; he was knocking me with his knee on my arm, and told me to hold my noise - I still screamed, and when I came a little to myself, I pushed him away, and told him to go away, for he should never come near me any more - after that, a woman came to me, with a light, she never spoke, but turned back again when she saw me - I got up, and the person called to me out of window, to know who I was, I answered I was Joseph Scott's daughter; the woman with the light came back, with a man, and they led me home, and when the woman got opposite her house, she went in for a stick, which she walked with; my husband came running up the road, saying, "If any man has a mind to take me, let him take me - I know what I have done" - I do not know what became of him afterwards; he did not go home with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When he struck you, you say he took the hoe deliberately out of the basket - did he say any thing before the blow was given? A. No; I had two wounds on my head, in different parts; I should think they had been inflicted by different blows.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he abused you all the way - did he threaten to do you any bodily harm? A. No, except that he said he would kick me out of doors; he kept swearing at me, and calling me abusive names; I have been under the surgeon's hands ever since.</p>

            . I am in the employ of the Post-office, at Forty-hill, Enfield; my house is within a very few yards of the bridge. On the 10th of November I went to bed about ten o'clock, or a few minutes after; I was in a very sound sleep, and was disturbed by very severe shrieks, which alarmed my wife first; she got up and that awoke me; I opened my window, which looks directly down to the river - I heard very severe shrieks - I called out, "In the name of God, what is the matter - is there murder going to be committed?" I repeated the question seven or eight times, but nobody replied - the shrieks continued, but I got no reply; I heard a man's voice say, "Don't make such a noise - don't make such a noise:" I then heard a female voice say, "I don't know where I am - I don't know where I am: I wish my mother was here;" and I heard her say,"You have been a cruel husband to me, you have cut me down with the hoe; I am all in a gore of blood, and you have nearly murdered me;" the voice then was quite different to what it is naturally - I could not tell whose voice it was; at that moment I saw a woman come along with a lantern; I begged her to go to the bridge, and see what was the matter; she went to the prosecutrix, and exclaimed,"Oh, my God! I never saw such a sight in my life;" I was without my clothes, and did not go myself.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Astbury, a surgeon, at Enfield. On the night in question, about a quarter-past eleven o'clock, I was fetched to the prosecutrix, at Scott's house; I found an incised wound, three inches in length, on the top of the scull - it was cut to the bone, but had not fractured the bone; there was also a wound about two inches from that - it appeared to have been done by the same instrument, but with a lesser degree of force, and not at the same time; it was an incised wound, but not quite so deep; there was very little difference; there was a bruise on the forehead, which I suppose the stick of the hoe had done.</p>
               <p>Q. If the bone had been fractured by the first wound, might it have been attended with more dangerous consequences? A. Not more dangerous than showing the degree of force of the blow; the same members go inside - it was certainly done with an instrument that would effect a cut; it is a contused incised wound, not done with an instrument usually used to cut, but which would cut if force was applied; there was an artery divided, which had bled freely previous to my seeing it; in my judgment, the two wounds were produced by two different blows, and not by the same force; I attended her above a fortnight - I bled her twice, and kept down the inflammation; she is quite well now; if she had not been bled, there would have been an affection of the brain probably.</p>
               <p>Q. In what time does that affection of the brain take place? A. A month probably, but we have kept her low, and attend to her now; in my judgment the wounds might have been inflicted by this hoe. (looking at it) I have not seen it before this morning - I do not know where it came from.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not say that he called out, that he was ready to give himself up? A. That was while Mrs. Pinnick was gone into her house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury. - It now becomes my painful task to offer some defence to the serious charge alledged against me - I trust, that when you have seriously considered of my unfortunate situation, that under all the circumstances attending it, I shall be entitled to your pity, rather than rebuke. I kept company with my present wife about three years, and she went to another part of the country for two years; during her absence from keeping my company, she got acquainted with some strange man, who got a child by her, and afterwards left her. After our marriage, which took place about two months past, since which, I was respectably informed, that during my absence in my work, she would encourage strange men, and on the Saturday evening, when this unfortunate transaction took place, we were drinking together at a public-house, by appointment, at the Greyhound, Enfield Town. I gave my wife 8s. and kept the residue of my wages, to pay her mother what I owed her; my wife began abusing me, and both of us being rather intoxicated, a quarrel ensued about the young man by whom she had the child, by which means the blow was given at the moment, for which I solemnly assure you, gentlemen, I am very sorry, and have written to my wife to that effect, and to her father and mother, hoping their forgiveness, and promising that I never will molest her again, and that my wife can live with the man if she pleases, without any fear from me. Gentlemen, this is a brief statement of facts, and the truth of my unfortunate and very distressing case. I therefore most humbly beg leave to throw myself on the mercy of this most Honorable Court, and fervently hope that it will be extended to me, and restore me to liberty.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

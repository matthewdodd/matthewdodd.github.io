               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You seem to have been the principal engine in apprehending the prisoner; how long has he been in the factory? - A. He has been a twelvemonth upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. You and he have not been friends for these six months past, I am told; are there a great many weavers about the house? - A. There are about twenty, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Who carried the brass there, you cannot tell; you know nothing more about it than that the prisoner was charged with it? - A. I saw him come out of the carpenter's shop with something like a bulk under his waistcoat; I took it to be a carpenter's plane.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you and the prisoner, before you made any discovery, any quarrel with each other? - A. Not one; I was upon as good terms with him as I was with the others.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. In truth, your master had a great deal of his property plundered, and he suspected all of you, but you had not any quarrel with him, nor any body else? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a clerk to the prosecutor: Understanding that the brass was found under his coat, I gave orders that he should be watched, in order to find out where he sold the property; I went after him, and took him up at the dressing-shop; I charged him with stealing of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Tell us what you said to him, and what answer he gave you? - A. I charged him with stealing the brass, he denied it a short time, and then he said he had took it.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he acknowledged he had taken it, did you say it would be better for him to tell the truth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then we must not hear what the prisoner said; in consequence of what the prisoner said, did you find any thing? - A. I had it taken out from under his coat before his face; I was present when it was taken from under his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the coat to be his? - A. That I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. But they have their waistcoat on? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. What is the firm of the house? - A. Charles-Hampden Turner.</p>

               <p>Q. How long before had you seen the brass? - A. That very day at nine in the morning; he took it at three o'clock.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. We do not charge him with putting it into his pocket, but in his waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Where was this taken from? - A. This was taken out of my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men work there? - A. I have got one man and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q You were neighbourly enough one to the other; other men had access there? - A. There is no man had any business there besides them and me.</p>
               <p>Q. You must be very morose one with another; you are glad to see your neighbours sure? - A. No, not on that ground; Mr. Turner would not let you come in, if you were to come there.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took the brass there, you cannot say? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose he was gone to get some gin? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. The man was gone to get something, and when he was taken into custody there was nothing found upon him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. But it was found under his coat, and where he worked? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Robarts) Look at that brass? - A. It is the property of Mr. Turner; I can bring another box that this fixes in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. That is very heavy, it must be impossible to put that in a man's waistcoat? - A.Recollect, his hand was fixed here</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I think his arm could support it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

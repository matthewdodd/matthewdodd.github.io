                  </hi> I am a pawnbroker, at Richmond—the pri<lb></lb>soner was my shopman for two years—it was his duty to take in pledges, deliver them, and do the general business—when he took in this watch he had to examine it, and to lend according to his judgment, to make out two duplicates; one for the person pledging, and the other he puts on the article—before giving the money, he enters it in the auction book—he gives the money without coming to me—he had marked 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the ticket; he would ad<lb></lb>vance 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as we are entitled to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the ticket—he would enter in the auction book the name of the person, whether a housekeeper or a lodger, and the amount lent, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to correspond with the duplicate—on Saturday, 8th April, I found this ticket for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the till, the time of pawning being on 3rd May, and on 8th April redeemed—I said to the prisoner, "You have charged more interest than you ought; you have charged 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the back"—he said, "It is all right"—I said, "I suppose it is; you have only lent 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it"—twelvemonth's interest would he 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the interest on 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. would be</p>

                  </hi> I am a tailor, and live opposite Mr. COckburn, at Richmond. On Tuesday, 11th April, the prisoner came over to my shop—he asked me if I would allow him to burn some old letters and old books—I told him to go in the back kitchen, and he was in the act of tearing out some leaves and throwing them in the fire—he said his master suspected he had been robbing him, but he should not see the books—he said he should be imprisoned for what he had been doing, but he did not care for that—he said he should go out the back way—I said no, he came in the front way and he should go out that way—I then told the prosecutor.</p>

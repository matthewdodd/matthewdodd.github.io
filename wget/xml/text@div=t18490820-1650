               <p>asked him if he had a key to it—he said, "No"—I asked him if he would sell it—he said he did not care about selling it, as he might meet with a key some day—I asked how he came by it—he said he picked it up in some old iron—it is usual for persons in the same business that the prisoner is to buy these articles at old iron shops—I was not astonished when he told me that—it is not unusual for persons in that trade to have locks without keys; trusting to the chance of getting keys afterwards—if I get a lock I generally make a key.</p>

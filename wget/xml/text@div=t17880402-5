               <p>Can you confidently say it did not drop from the counter? - No, it dropped from her cloak; it was under her right arm; it dropped down on the floor the end next the counter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. This was between one and three? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A great many people in the shop? - Not a great many; there were not many goods on the counter.</p>

               <p>Did you see it drop? - I stood by her when she dropped it; I expected it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am shopwoman to the prosecutor; I served the prisoner with a piece of lawn.</p>
               <p>Where was that lawn that your master has at the time you served her? - This piece she supported against the counter by leaning against it; when she came into the shop it was on the counter.</p>
               <p>Did you see it on the counter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you been looking at it, or serving any body with it, or measuring it? - No; I got it out to serve her.</p>
               <p>How long did she stay in the shop? - About half an hour; when she went away I went round the counter and observed the lawn laying on the floor.</p>
               <p>Was that before she went out? - Before she went out, near where she stood, just under her feet; when I returned, the lawn was not there; I afterwards observed something under her cloak which appeared to me to be like that lawn; after that she went out.</p>
               <p>Seeing it under her feet, I wonder you did not desire her to pick it up? - Why, I understood, that unless the prisoner took the things out of the shop, they could not be taken up: upon this, I gave notice to Mr. Wilkinson.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This lawn was on the floor before she went out? - Yes, it was; I went round the counter, and I saw the lawn just under her feet; when I returned, the lawn was not there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to prosecutor. Has that lawn been in your custody ever since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was it delivered to you, and where? - It was delivered to me before the Justice; I know it to be mine, because it was my own marking.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to the counsel.</p>
               <p>Richard Perry. I never took an oath in my life.</p>
               <p>Are you a quaker? - No, but I never took an oath in my life.</p>
               <p>Have you any objection to take it now, do you know what it is? it is, that you are to call God to witness, that you are to speak the truth: have you any objection to taking such an oath? - I have no objection.</p>

            . I am an officer of St. Bride's. On the evening of the 11th of July, I saw the prisoner and two others following the prosecutor, who had a lady with him, in Farringdon-street - I saw one of those who has escaped take a handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, and pass it over to the prisoner, who received it from him - they were all three behind the prosecutor - I went up and told the prosecutor, and immediately went after them - they went different ways - I secured the prisoner in Fleet-street, at the corner of Bride-lane - I took him to St. Bride's watch-house, searched him, but found nothing on him; but as we went to put him into the lock-up-room, I found the handkerchief down by where he stood.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have for the last two years been in the service of Donna Maria at Portugal - I received several wounds, and not a farthing of wages since I came home, which drove me to do what I have.</p>

I am the daughter of the landlord of the Plough, at Lewisham—Britcher was having a pint of beer—he took it outside, and in a short time after the prisoner came in for two farthings for a halfpenny, which my sister gave her—a short time afterwards Britcher came in, appa-rently, looking at something in his hand—he went out again in a very great hurry—I am certain it was the prisoner came in, I knew her before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 50.)

                  </hi>. I am a waiter and live at 44, Falmouth Road, Borough—on the night of the 15th December last I was in the Borough Road with a friend and we saw the female prisoners standing at the corner with other females—my friend had had a little drop to drink, I was perfectly sober—the females were trying to decoy my friend away, I got him round the corner, and he being a little in liquor I could not get him away—after we had got round the corner of Kell Street they tried to push him into a door way, and Hogan struck me in the face and cut my cheek, and all four got hold of me, and took my watch and chain and picked my pockets of every<lb></lb>thing I had—I stopped at the door and called "Police!" and a constable came up and I said "I have been robbed in this passage"—he said "Do you know the persons?"—I said "Yes," and gave a description of them, and he went into the house—they would not admit him till he threatened to break the door in, and he then found Hogan lying under some old clothes in a back room conceded!—my watch was a silver geneva—I have not seen it since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was positive of the transaction at the police-court—I did not say two of the women had hold of me, but three—I didn't say that I thought—I think two of the women had hold of me while the man snatched the watch from my pocket—I said the same at the police-court about the man being concealed under the clothes in the room—<hi rend="italic">I</hi> heard my deposition read over and signed it—I was only a few minutes in the house—it was about ten minutes after my friend went down Kell Street that they were taken into custody—I swear it was not half an hour—I had nothing to drink in the house—I don't know whether my friend did, I did not know whether my friend was in the house or not—he is not here—he did not see anything of the robbery—I did not wish him to go into the police-station on the night they were given into custody—he was not pre<lb></lb>vented—he was not shut out or turned out—I don't know that he said out<lb></lb>side that the man had got nothing to do with it—I was inside—I heard the prisoner make a statement at the police-court—I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> hear him say" The prosecutor came and said I had taken his watch—I knew nothing, more about it then a new born babe—he had a friend outside the station who said "I knew nothing about it"—I would not swear he did or did not say that I went up into the room with the policeman where Hogan was there was no bed there—it was about 1 o'clock in the morning—I don't think he was asleep—he had not his eyes shut—I never saw him till the policeman went up to him when he awoke, he was up at once—whether he was asleep or not I don't know—the robbery of the watch took place in the passage—there was light from the street and light from the room—I should not have gone round there at all, except to try and get my friend—he is a big man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There was light from the door and from the room by which I could recognise the man's features. <hi rend="italic">Clarke</hi> Your friend went upstairs with a young woman and the policeman knocked at the door and I went down and opened the street door, and you and the policeman stood at the floor till your friend and the young woman came downstairs, and as she came down you said "That is the woman who had my watch." <hi rend="italic">Lamb. I</hi> was in the back room and had half a gallon of beer and we were drinking—I don't know anything about it.</p>

               <p>cries of "Police!" and "Help!" in Kell Street, and I went down there—I saw Giles standing there with his face covered with blood and asked him what was the matter—the prisoner was inside the house—I went in and saw Clarke in the passage and Lamb in the backyard and found the man concealed under some old sacking and bed clothes in the back room—there was no bed there—it was a round heap and he was lying coiled up awake, not in a sleeping position—I saw the prosecutor's friend afterwards—he was the worse for drink—Hogan said he didn't have the watch, and the prosecutor said in his presence he had robbed him of his watch while two women held him—I found these pieces of chain attached to the prosecutor's waistcoat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have not found the watch or remains of the chain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prosecutor was quite sober, he knew what he was about—he said he had had a glass—he said he had lost about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said at the police-court that prosecutor said he had lost his money, but did not know how much—his friend was not turned out of the station—he went away—I am sure he was not pressed to go away—I have not made enquiries about Hogan—we usually do when we have a case—I never knew where he worked—I heard his mother give her evidence at the police-court as to his character and say he was a carman—she said he is a hardworking <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> and never sleeps away from home, and you can refer to Mr. Heeseman, the man he has been working for for many years—I knew he had not been working there for the last nine months because I have seen him loitering about—the prosecutor pointed out these two women and the others he could not—Lamb was in the back yard, in the w.c.</p>

They all went out and left me in the room by myself. There was a bed in a corner of the room and I lay down and fell asleep and was awoke when the prosecutor said I had taken his watch. I know no more about it than a new-born babe. He had a friend who came to say I knew nothing about the matter and he was not allowed to come in."</p>

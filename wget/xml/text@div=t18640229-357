                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer, of 171, Waterloo-road—about a fortnight before 18th January, the prisoner came and asked me if I purchased second-hand furniture—I told him I did—he said, "I have my household furniture to sell; will you come, and look at it?"—I went to No. 2, Clarendon-place, St. Andrew's-road, Southwark, and looked at the furniture—the prisoner said it belonged to him, and I agreed to give him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—Mrs. Burr was in the room and heard him say that the furni<lb></lb>ture was his—she called the prisoner by some name, and <hi rend="italic">deared</hi> him—she said he was her husband, and the prisoner said, "This is my wife"—he said that he should be compelled to leave London to go to Paris in about a fortnight, and I was to keep myself in readiness to move the goods at a moment's notice, and to pay the money—on 10th January, he called about 8 o'clock in the evening, and asked me whether I could come and remove his furniture—my shop was shut up, and I said, "I can't remove it to-night, it is too late"—he said, "My goods must be away to-night, as I must be at the station to take the 12 o'clock train to go to Paris"—I told him if he wanted me to buy the goods, he must bring them to my house—I showed him the way to Mr. Perry's to engage a van, and he and Perry went together to fetch the goods—I did not go with him—I saw the van start—the van arrived with the goods about 11 o'clock, and the prisoner afterwards came in a cab with Mr. Burr—there was a large box and a trunk on the cab—my suspicious were aroused after the "van had started, and I called in Brischlayer, and gave the prisoner in charge—I was talking to the prisoner when Brischlayer arrived in front of my door—he was waiting for the money for the goods, but I did not pay him.</p>

I am the sister-in-law of the last witness—on 18th January, a little before eight, the prisoner called—I answered the door—there was no one at home—he said he came to ask Mr. Kerr to go back with him to take some furniture that was agreed upon, and bring the money with him to pay for it—Mr. Kerr was then out, inquiring whether all was right—I said that I would tell him—between 8 and 9, the prisoner returned in a great hurry—he came into the little parlour, and my brother-in-law told him he could not remove the goods so late; he must bring them himself, if he must have the money that night, which he agreed to do—he did not know where to get a van, and my brother-in-law went with him to Mr. Perry—while my brother-in-law had gone to the police-station, the van and the goods came, and the prisoner and Mrs. Burr came in a cab—they had two lamps with them—she got out, and gave me or Mr. Perry one of the lamps; she then went back into the cab, and I kept the prisoner waiting for the money—I went to the cab and spoke to Mrs. Burr, when the policeman came—I took hold of her arm at the cab, and asked her if all was right—she said, "Yes"—I said, "Is this foreigner your husband?"—she said, "Yes"—I spoke loud enough for the prisoner to hear that—I asked her if the goods were his—she said, "Yes"—somebody at the cab-door then said, "No, they belong to a police-constable," upon which she looked out of the cab, and told him to go anywhere, or go to the devil—she mentioned something about going to Paris, and said that that was why they were in such a hurry—they wanted me to pay them while the goods were at the door, that they might go there and then.</p>

               <p>wark—I have been residing at 2, Clarendon-place, St. Andrew's-road, New<lb></lb>ington—about four years ago a female came and hired a room for the prisoner, for which she paid eighteen pence a week—she did not stop, but the prisoner did—after he had been there three months he left for a time, and came back about six months afterwards—he came to and fro several times, and I always treated him as a brother more than anything else—about six weeks before 18th January he came again and took a back sitting-room over the kitchen—on the two last occasions when he came he had the front par<lb></lb>lour—having known him so long we were like brothers; he was like one of ourselves—he was very poor—he came there once with only a pair of old goloshes on—he had hardly anything to wear, and in consequence of that I was not very pressing about the rent—I left the management of that to my wife—about seven or eight days before the 18th January I was told some<lb></lb>thing, in consequence of which I spoke to the prisoner about what he should have to say to another constable, and had some words with him about my wife, upon which he took out a large life-preserver from his pocket, which belonged to me, and I knocked him down to save myself, or else I think the blow would have killed me, in the way he came at me—on the evening of 18th January I was at home, I took some keys out of my pocket about six o'clock, unlocked a drawer, and gave my wife a bill to go and pay some money—I looked the drawer again and put the keys on the drawer—they were there at half-past 9, when I went out to duty—I was on duty at half-past 11, and was called to the police-station, where I found a van laden with my own goods—the prisoner and my wife were both sitting together—those are the goods which the prisoner was indicted for stealing—there was a box there containing my wife wearing-apparel,—I said nothing to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>and he would leave, and my husband would bring him back next day—the prisoner paid the rent to me and my husband, and a great deal more than the rent—I never noticed that he came in goloshes, and without shoes; I should not like to swear it—he took our room the second time he came, at half-a-crown a week—it was a very small bedroom; and he was almost a stranger to us—he stopped two days, or rather slept one sight, and the second day fetched his things away, and we never saw him for twelve or fifteen months—he came then, and Mr. Burr drank with him—he asked for a room again, but I declined—I did not decline when he came for the six weeks, because ray husband wished him—and he did not have a room to himself, he bad a sofa in the front parlour—he came from Paris on the last occasion to our house, or rather he wrote from the Half Moon hotel in the Borough—my husband wished me to answer the letter to say that he should come to our house, but I refused, and my husband met him the next day, and sent him to our house—I did not often go to concerts without ray husband—he frequently took me—he gave me full liberty to go wherever I pleased—he was not unkind to me in that respect—I do not know that Mr. and Mrs. Shadwell are here—I always had the whole of my husband's wages—we paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week rent, and I leave you to judge whether we could have bought furniture with the remainder—I bought it myself, I did not put my earnings to what came from my husband—about a fortnight before this the broker was called by the prisoner to see the furniture—I spoke to Mr. Shadwell about my husband's unkindnees, and said that I should leave him—I did not object to the furniture being sold, because I wanted the money to get clothes to go to service with—I considered myself perfectly justified in taking away the furniture—my husband gave me full leave many times—I swear that most earnestly—I have seen Mr. Lewis, my attorney, every day this week.</p>

I am the wife of Mr. Sparks, and live at 38, Castle-street, Holborn—about three weeks before the prisoner was given into custody I went to Mr. Burr's house with Mrs. Burr—we had been at the music-hall for an hour or an hour and a half—we came back to the "Grapes," and Mr. Burr and the prisoner were drinking there together—Mrs. Burr spoke to him, and he abused her very much, and tore her clothes off in the street—he used very foul language to her and to me also—he pulled her shawl and things off her back, and threw them into the street—the words were too foul for me to repeat.</p>

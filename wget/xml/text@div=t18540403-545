                  </hi>. I live at Greenwich; I sell sheep's trotters. On the night of 20th March I was in company with my son in the Greenwich road, leading towards Woolwich, at 12 o'clock—I had a basket, containing about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of sheep's trotters, and about half a dozen eggs at the top of the basket—I put the basket down on the pavement—the prisoner came skip<lb></lb>ping and dancing along the road, and kicked my basket over—I did not see her till I heard her feet—she kicked my basket over, and knocked every<lb></lb>thing out of it into the road—she then went away along the road—my boy followed her, to ask what she did it for—I said to him, "William, my dear, come back; don't have anything to do with her; you know what she is"—I ran after him to bring him back away from her, knowing that she is a desperate character, and she made towards me with a knife, and stabbed me in the groin—I screamed for help, and the prisoner was taken into custody—I cannot say whether she was sober; I had not been in her company—I was sober.</p>

On the 25th of September I had been to Goldsmiths' Hall, and in going home I met the prisoner in Aldermanbury - I knew him, as he had applied to my master for work - I had two silver sugar basins and two silver milk-pots, which I had fetched from Goldsmiths' Hall - the prisoner said he was going my way, and when we were in <placeName id="t18341016-152-crimeloc822">Wood-street, Cheapside</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You knew him before? A. Yes; and Mr. Wakefield knew him - I refused to let him hold my bag, but it had no string to it, and he took it from under my arm - Wood-street is two hundred yards from Friday-street - when I got up to him he was laughing, and he told the gentleman it was only a lark - he walked on to Watling-street, and I walked with him - he told the officer it was only a lark - I did not know the prisoner's name till I heard him give it at the Compter - I have seen him at Mr. Wakefield's, but I do not know that he has ever worked there - I did not tell him these articles were Mr. Wakefield's, but he saw me come out of the hall with them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he an opportunity of running away after you had taken the bag from him, as he walked to Watling-street? A. There were a good many people walking behind us.</p>

            . Mr. Taylor and I are in partnership in the ironmongery business. On Friday the 25th of June I came home, and found all the lights in the shop out, and the prisoner in the shop; he is one of my <rs id="t17730707-27-deflabel155" type="occupation">porter</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17730707-27-defend341 t17730707-27-deflabel155"></join>s; he had no business to be there at that time; it is beyond the hours in which he should be there; upon my coming in I suspected him; I took notice he had something bundled up; I asked him what it was; he said it was victuals. I searched him and found the nails mentioned in the indictment; I charged him with having some of my nails; he said yes, he had a little job to do, intimating as if it was a small quantity of nails. I proceeded to search him, and found this large quantity of nails packed up in paper, so I could swear to them; the marks are upon the papers. (They are produced by the constable, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Q. From the prisoner's counsel. Whether he was entrusted to put the nails from the counter upon the shelves?</p>
               <p>Wylde. No, that was not his business.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called many witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, who is a hay and straw-jobber, and lives near Ilford. I was at the Bell and Mackerel, Mile-end-road, on the 23rd of March—I saw Titmouse there—she beckoned me across the yard, and went with her into the stable—I gave her a shilling, which I took from out of my purse—I had 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—three sovereigns, four half-crowns, and the Test in shillings and sixpences—about ten minutes after, she said, "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, you have dropped some money"—I then put my hand into my pocket, and missed my purse—I had screwed it up, and put it into my side pocket—she tumbled about the straw, and gave me a shilling, and then she got up from her knees, and ran to Parsons—I followed her, and said I should not leave her till I had my money—Parsons knocked me about—I never saw my purse afterwards—all she gave me was the shilling.</p>

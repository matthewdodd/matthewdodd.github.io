                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate woman, and live at No. 11 Wellesley-street, Seymour-street, New-road. On the night this happened, I went into Smith's coffee shop, Caledonian-road—I had four sovereigns and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in a purge—I had some supper, which came to 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I know Wren, he was a waiter there—I had seen him very often when I have been there—I gave him a sovereign to pay for what I had, and he brought me the change, half a sovereign, and the rest in silver—I then went outside the door, and Wren asked me if I would lend him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, "You do not want it"—he said, "I do"—I said, "I will lend you half a crown," and I did so—while I was talking to him a friend of mine, a girl, came up; she went in with me and I paid for her supper, and a young man's, who was with her—while I was talking to them Wren came in, and said, "There is a young woman waiting to speak to you at the door"—I went out, and he went with me; I said, "Where is she?"—he said, "I do not know"—I looked round the corner to see where she was, and Raymond knocked me down—I have seen him in the coffee shop, he was not employed there—he struck me on the back of the neck, and pushed me as well, knocked me down, and took my purse, which was round my finger—I saw no young woman: Wren stood on the step of the door looking on, while the other knocked me down, but he did not interfere at all—I did not see the man before he knocked me down, he held me down with one hand, and took my purse with the other—he hit me very hard, my neck and head were very sore afterwards; he hit and pushed me both at once—he hit me with his left hand, he had a crutch in his right, but did not hit me with that, he is lame—I screamed when he pulled my purse <hi rend="italic">off</hi> my finger, but Wren did not take any notice; he was there when I was knocked down and when I got up, but did not help me, or join in the attack upon me—Raymond walked from me and stood against the lamp post, and there he stood when I got up—I said to Wren, "You have been the instigation of my being robbed, and I will not have you locked up if you will give it to me, and I said the same to Raymond—at the time I was saying it, Jane Hamilton came out at the door; they both denied the charge, and said that they knew nothing of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> While you were talking to Wren, Raymond stood near the lamp post? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he did not run away—when Jane Hamilton came out I said, "I have lost my money, and this man has robbed me"—I had my hand on his shoulder, and he went into the coffee shop; I followed him, and told Mrs. Smith—she said that she knew nothing about it—when Jane Hamilton came, she accused Wren of the robbery, and he said that he knew nothing about it—while she was talking to Raymond, Wren went into the coffee shop—when I went in and spoke to Mrs. Smith, I left Raymond outside, still talking with my friend, she was accusing him of the robbery when I went in.</p>

               <p>got none of it that night; I got some of it two or three nights before—I have not got it back nor my purse—I got the money from different gentle<lb></lb>men, and had been saving it up to go into the country—I do not always carry my money about, but I was going to meet some young girls who I knew to wish them good bye—I was only going up to Islington, I do not call that the country—I was going to Bargewell, in Norfolk, fourteen miles from Norwich—I have been in London two or three years—I was knocked down and robbed before I could hardly get off the step of the door.</p>

RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long was it from the time you first saw these women to the time you apprehended Raymond? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About an hour and a half—there was a man with them when I saw them first, at a quarter past 12 o'clock, and there might be two or three others, but I cannot be certain whether there were two or three others besides Wren—I did not see Raymond at that time—they were outside the coffee shop then—there were two others, I believe—when I saw Wren the first time, he and the prose<lb></lb>cutri were by themselves—the second'time I saw Wren, the prosecutrix, Hamilton, and, I think, two men, I cannot be certain whether there were one or two—Wren was one—they were strangers to me—Raymond was not there—I do not know when the assault was committed—I cannot tell you whether it was before or after she was knocked down that I am speaking of—they were talking together, and I walked on—my beat is by there—I went on as far as North-street, which is about 150 yards—I went up the Caledonian-road, but at the distance I went did not command a view of the coffee house—I should not have heard a scream, because there are so many carriages—I go down as far as King's-cross—I was at the end of the Caledonian-road by King's-cross when King spoke to me.</p>

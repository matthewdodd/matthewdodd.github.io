                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 112.) On the 12th of July I saw the prisoner offering this shovel for pledge outside a pawnbroker's shop at Holloway—I asked where he got it—he said he bought it in Shoreditch—I said I should take him to the station—he said I had no occasion to go to inquire about it, it was no use, it was given him by Haynes to work with, and it was Mr. Pocock's—there were three men outside the shop-door hanging the things out, and he wanted It. on it—I took him about half a mile from Mr. Pocock's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. It was my own; I bought it for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of Mr. Dawkins; I was going to take it with me; two persons offered me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and the policeman caught hold of it—Haynes said at the office he could not swear to the shovel. I never said it was Mr. Pocock's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, of 42, Old Bond-street. On Wed<lb></lb>nesday, 15th Oct., about the middle of the day, Ann Lill came <hi rend="italic">to</hi> my shop, and asked for a pot of jam—she tendered in payment a counterfeit 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece—I asked her where she lived, and where she got the crown from—she said a man in the street gave it her—I told her to go and fetch the man who gave it her—she left the shop, and returned with the prisoner—there were nume<lb></lb>rous persons there, but she and the prisoner were two of them—she said the prisoner gave her the crown—I kept it in my possession, marked it, and gave it to the officer, who came through the crowd—he took the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. On the morning of 15th Oct. I was going along Bond-street—I saw the prisoner—I had never seen him before—he tapped me on the shoulder, and said he would give me a penny to go to the shop and get him a shilling pot of raspberry jam—I said I must not go—he said I should go, and he gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece to pay for it—I went, and asked for a shilling pot of jam—I gave the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece which the prisoner gave me, and it was refused, and Mr. Armstrong told me to go after the prisoner—I went, and found him in the same place—I told him Mr. Armstrong wanted to speak to him—I did not tell him the crown was bad, or had been refused—the prisoner ran away—I ran, and cried, "Stop thief!"—he was stopped, and I took him back to Mr. Armstrong's—I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> He was quite a stranger to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he was about 100 yards from Mr. Armstrong's when he told me to go and get the pot of jam—he stayed in the same place where I left him, which was a door or two from Burlington-gardens—when I told him to go with me he ran up Burlington-gardens and down Burlington-arcade—I ran fast too, and saw him stopped in the Arcade—the two gentlemen who ran are not here—there were not many persons in the Arcade—it was between 12 and 1 o'clock—there are a number of shops there, and persons stopping to look in the shops—the prisoner was stopped just by where the keeper stands, near the end next to Burlington-gardens—I was near him when he was caught—I am quite sure he is the man—I could run as fast as him—when I called "Stop thief!" the people congregated together—there were a good many people when I got back to Mr. Armstrong's.</p>

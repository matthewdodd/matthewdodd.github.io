               <p>Q. Had the carman and distiller access to the different backs of spirits - A. Yes, every day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time, and when, discover that you had lost various quantities of spirits - A. I did; in January, and before in October and November; in the early part of January I took the stock myself along with the excise officer, and one cask of brandy was missed of four gallons; my suspicion fell upon the prisoners. On the 21st of January, I went through the accompting house into the cellar, Thorn and Smith was in the cellar; I said Thorn your mistress wants you to go of an errand. When Thorn came back he went into the same place again, and when he came back again, I said Thorn you have been a long while getting your beer; he went further into the cellar, than where the beer was, that gave me suspicion; I there found a quart bottle filled with peppermint; I put it in the same place, it remained there till the Monday. On Monday, the 23d, at night, I found a bladder in the cellar behind the same cask where the bottle was; on Tuesday, in the evening, on examining the stable, in one of the stalls I found a bladder containing gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoners access to that stable - A. Yes, both of them. On Friday the 27th, Matthews the officer came to my house; we examined more minutely; on a load of straw were four empty bottles, apparently emtied of spirits; the bladder in the stable was full; Mr. Matthews thought it right to get a search warrant, and when we came back the bottles and the bladder were gone; the prisoners returned between one and two, and went to their work again, and continued there till<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150057"></xptr>night; the officer came to my house again at half past four o'clock; they were taken in custody on Friday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look in these places - A. I did; the bottles were returned there empty; and looking at them just before the time they went away the bottles were filled in the tub in the cellar under the distil house, and the bladder was filled in the stable; they left business about six o'clock; at the time they were going away, Mrs. Jackson desired one to go through the gates, the other to fasten the gates and go through the house. I went into the cellar, I found that the bottles had been removed; I came in and mentioned it to the officer; the officer went out and brought them back to my house; I saw a bottle that I had seen before in the tub, and a small bladder that I had seen before in the cellar; there was gin in both; the gin in the bladder corresponded with the gin in the vat. Smith then said, Oh! God, what have I done, I have been robbing my master, it will transport me. Thorn said there was no great harm in it, or something of that.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden office.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you applied to, to go to Mr. Jackson's - A. I was. I first went into the cellar; I found this bottle in the tub, that was about one o'clock, the bottle was full; I went into the stable; this bladder was full of gin, it was in the manger, covered with hay; I thought fit to have a search warrant to search Smith and Thorn's premises; we came from the office; the bottle and the bladder and the prisoners were gone away. When the prisoners returned to work, Mr. Jackson went backwards, and he saw the things all filled again. As soon as the prisoners were gone out I followed them; Thorn went out of the house; I came up with them and catched one in each hand; Smith turned round and struck me; Trott came to my assistance. I searched Thorn, I found this bottle in the waist of his breeches, buttoned with this loop; the bottle was full of gin at the time, it contained about a pint and a half. I was present when Trott searched Smith; he found this bladder full of gin in his coat pocket; I had seen the bottle in the cellar, I am pretty well sure it is the same bottle, and the bladder is apparently the same bladder I saw in the stable. I took notice of this string.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go and search these premises - A. I did; I found this bottle of gin and bottle of peppermint; this cloves and gin was found at Smith's house, the other I found at Thorn's, and more gin in the stone bottle.</p>

They are; I searched Smith; he had got a blue coat on his arm; we took them into Mr. Jackson's, I handcuffed them together; I searched his coat that he had on his arm; I took the bladder out of it, it contained a quart of gin; Thorn was shedding tears; Smith said, good God! what have we done, we have stolen our master's liquor, we shall both be transported; I told Thorn nor to fret, they were not tried yet, they did not know what would be done. Thorn said it was the first time, he was very sorry for it.</p>

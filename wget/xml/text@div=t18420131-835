                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Robinson, as soap<lb></lb>boilers, in White-street, Borough—the prisoner was in our employ for rather better than a fortnight. On Wednesday the 19th of January, my cash-box contained twelve sovereigns, a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, two 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. papers of coppers, and the lease of our premises—one packet of copper con<lb></lb>sisted of pence, and the other of halfpence, and the silver consisted principally, of shillings—I locked the cash-box up in my private desk in the counting-house, about half-past three o'clock, when I left—the prisoner was then at work behind the counting-house, only separated from me by a slight par<lb></lb>tition and glazed work, so that be could see into the counting-house, and I could see over the premises—he was melting fat at a copper exactly be<lb></lb>hind the partition, within about eighteen feet of it—he could see every thing that was going on in the counting-house—I went Co the premises about twelve the next morning, found my partner there, and received in<lb></lb>formation of the robbery—I called all the men together—they were all on the spot except the prisoner, who I did not see again till he was in custody at Union Hall, on the Friday following.</p>

                  </hi>. I am partner with Mr. Kitson. I remember his leaving the premises on the Wednesday afternoon—I locked up the count<lb></lb>ing-house myself about half-past four o'clock—I locked the door quite safe—there is a window to the counting-house, which opens on hinges like a door—I will not say whether that was fastened, but it was closed, and it is generally fastened when it is closed—I then left the premises—the pri<lb></lb>soner was then employed behind the counting-house—I could not see any one employed there besides him at that time—I went to the premises again between ten and eleven next morning—I found the counting-house door open—the lock had been forced back, the small window was also open, and Mr. Kitson's desk forced open, and the cash-box taken out—I had all the men brought down, and pointed it out to them—the prisoner was among them—I told them to take notice of it, and that I should make further inquiries when Mr. Kitson came, and that I expected him in a short time—the prisoner, when he saw it, held up his bands as if to express his surprise at the robbery—I sent them all to their work, and in about three quarters of an hour or an hour Mr. Kitson came—I told him the circumstance, and had the men called down again, but the prisoner could not be found—he had left the premises, and did not return—there were marks on the count<lb></lb>ing-house window, as if made by greasy fingers, and also marks outside and inside the door, as if some instrument had been applied to force it—it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184201310182"></xptr>
               <p>appeared to me as if an attempt had been made to force it both from the outside and inside—it could be opened from the inside by forcing the lock back, but in no other way without the key—the window fastens with a sort of snap, which by tapping at the outside would fall down, and the window could then be opened.</p>

On Thursday, the 20th of January, about half-past one o'clock in the day, I was walking in the New Cut, which is no great distance from the prosecutor's premises, and saw the prisoner drunk—in consequence of something that had been told me, I went and took him into custody for being drunk and incapable of taking care of himself—I had not received information about the robbery then—I found on him six sovereigns, a half-sovereign, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, one dozen and a half of spoons, one pepper-castor, and a cream jug, all metal and quite new—about three hours and a half afterwards, when he got better, he was asked in my presence how he came by this money—he said it was an annuity left him by his mother, and he had received at Cockburn's banking-house that day, the sum of 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he lodged at the house of Elizabeth Williams, No. 71, Granby-street—I went there that same night, and found a new blue pilot coat, a new suit of moleskin, some new flannel, a boa, some calico, three pairs of stockings, and a piece of toweling—I afterwards went to Mr. Lewis's shop, showed him the moleskin, and got from him this hat, round frock, and pair of trowsers—I produce all the articles—I was present when the prisoner was examined before the Magistrate—I told the Magistrate I had been to Cockburn's to make in<lb></lb>quiry whether the prisoner had an annuity, and whether he received it on that day, and that they had told me no—the prisoner upon that remarked that he was drunk at the time he told me so—this cash-box and book I received from a stranger at Union Hall, on the 20th, who said he had picked them up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, employed on the prosecutors' pre<lb></lb>mises, and have a little workshop there. On Wednesday, the 19th of January, about half-past five or six o'clock, the prisoner came to my workshop, and asked for a chisel to ease a door—I asked what for, and said he would spoil any door on the premises—he took me to the folding<lb></lb>doors, which are on the flooring of the soap-factory, in a line from my shop to the coppers, and said, "This is what I want to ease"—I told him if he did such a thing, he would injure the door, and I would not allow it—he then left me, and went to work at the coppers—in about half-an-hour I went down stairs to get a pail of soap-ashes, and found him against the counting-house without a light, between the copper and the counting-house—I asked why he was there without a light—he said he did not want one—I said it was very wrong his being there without a light, and then, left him—I had not been up stain above a quarter or half-an-hour, before he came up and wished me good night—that was about a quartet-past six—he then left, and never spoke to a soul there—I followed him with my light, but he shut the folding-doors, and I saw no more of him—the folding-doors are generally open till we all go away, that we may see persons come up the passage, but he shut them, which would prevent my seeing into the passage—we cannot see the counting-house from our door without coming outside—next morning I came to work just after seven, and found the position of two of my screw-drivers altered, placed different to what I had left them when I went away the night before—I went to the counting-house door and found marks on the desk and on the door, ex<lb></lb>ternally and internally, which might have been made by either of those screw-drivers—the door must have been opened from the inside—it could not be opened outside—it throws back—I know the counting-house win<lb></lb>dow well—it is large enough for me to get through.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Withers, and live at Exeter Place, Chelsea—the prisoners rented a back room on the second floor from us, at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week—there were three other married couples besides our<lb></lb>selves in the house—there were two persons on the first floor, myself and my husband in the parlour, and Mr. and Mrs. Howe on the same floor as the prisoners—there were no others higher up—there are no rooms above the second floor—the prisoners took the rooms on the 10th August—the fire took place on the 3rd December—Barrett came to me on that day, and said, "Mrs. Withers, have you been in my room?"—I said, "No"—he said, "Some one has been there and robbed the place, and set it on fire"—I said, "Wait a moment"—I went upstairs and said, "You are not satisfied with getting into my debt and robbing me, but you must set my place on fire; you are cruel"—he said, "Well, I don't know so much about that"—the woman was there then—I saw marks of fire on the bed—the bed was burnt about two feet square, and about fourteen inches from the bottom—it was cold when I saw it—there were embers—there were blankets on the bed; they were partially burnt—I said to Barrett, "These things were intrusted to your care, and therefore you are responsible for them"—he said, "Very well"—next morning he was going out, and I gaid, "Mr. Barrett, are you going out?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Are you going out as coolly as this?" and he swore that the things were safe when he was in the room at six o'clock, and the place had been set on fire during his absence—he said, "Mrs. Withers, you shall not be the loser of one halfpenny"—I said, "That is not the thing, you have endangered my life and that of my lodgers; I don't think it is proper that you should go out"—he said, "What time is the constable coming?"—I said, "About nine or a quarter-past"—he said, "Well I shall be back by that time"—I said, "If one of you are present I think it will be better"—he went out, but never returned—Willis left six or seven minutes afterwards, but never came back—I gave him into custody the following evening in the King's Road, Chelsea—I said, "I shall give you in charge for robbing me of two pillows, a counterpane, two sheets, and two pillow-cases"—he said, "Very well," coolly.</p>

On Tuesday night, the 3rd De<lb></lb>cember, I was called to Exeter Place—I saw the two prisoners in the second-floor back room—Mrs. Withers, in prisoner's presence, said that about ten minutes to six the two prisoners went out and came home again soon after ten, and came down to her room, and said that the place had been robbed and set on fire—I asked the prisoners whether they locked the door when they went out, and they said yes, they did—I asked if they had found it locked when they came back, and they said yes—Willis said that there was a coat of Barrett's gone, a dress of hers, a blanket, a pair of sheets, and a counterpane belonging to the lady of the house—I noticed that the bed was burnt about two feet square—no water had been thrown on it—it was quite dry—there were blankets on the bed partly burnt—there was a candlestick on a table at the foot of the bed—the female prisoner said she left a piece of candle about an inch long in the candlestick when she went out, with some matches; when she came back at eleven she struck a match to light the candle and found it was all gone—the table was close to the bed—the bedstead was a wooden one, and higher than the table or candlestick.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

At eleven o'clock on the 4th December I went to Exeter Place and examined the place—the room smelt very strong of burning—I saw a large hole in the bed, which had been burned—a counterpane on the bed was also burnt—I cut off the burnt edge round the hole—I also took part of the bed tick—I found in the fireplace a piece of burnt rag—I took Willis in Walton Place, Chelsea—I said, "You must consider yourself in custody for robbing Mrs. Withers, and being concerned in setting the place on fire"—she said she knew nothing of the fire, but she had taken the things—she told me where the things were pledged, and I found them there.</p>

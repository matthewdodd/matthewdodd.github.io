            . I am a refiner and live in Barbican. On the 11th of February the prisoner came to sell me two pieces of gold. I asked who he brought them from; he said from Mr. Brees. I asked if Mr. Brees had sent him; he said, Mr. Brees had not; but one of the young men in the shop had. I told him, if so, he must fetch a note from the young man; he went away leaving the gold behind him, and called again about one o'clock. I asked him if he had brought the note; he said, no; that the person had not time to write it. I said, I must call upon Mr. Brees, before he could have the money; he said he must have the money or gold. I said I was certain Mr. Brees never sent it for sale, and should call on him. He went away, and I called on Mr. Brees.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. When did you call? - A. About three o'clock, and found him still there. He said he picked up the gold out of his master's forge.</p>

About half-past three o'clock Mr. Child called, and told me what had occurred. Having a very high opinion of the prisoner, I thought it impossible, and sent for him. Child said, "That is the young man." He immediately confessed that he had taken the gold for sale, and had often found a lump in one of the gilding forges. I remonstrated with him, and gave him in charge. It is impossible that he could have found it. I went with the officer to his lodgings, and found three melting-pots, which had melted gold, which were not mine, and a pair of scales. I have observed a great deficiency in my gold for some time. Child produced seven dwts. and a half.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have no mark on it? - A. No; it is impossible that it could be in the forge. He bore an excellent character.</p>

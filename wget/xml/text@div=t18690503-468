I have heard the evidence just given—that is correct—I was present when he was taken—I went on the roof of 38, Moorgats Street, and I went over the roof of the houses till I got to 13, occupied by Mr. Fisher—I found the trap door broken open—on one side of the door, where the bolts pass, there was a pane of glass at the top, that was broken so that anyone could put their hand in—there were marks on the door, which I compared with this chisel—I found this screw-driver on the roof of 15, Moorgats Street—the prisoners were traced over twenty-seven houses—I went through the trap door into the house, and found on the staircase a door had been broken open—I proceeded down, and getting into the passage the door leading to the shop had been broken open—after passing through the shop into the counting-house, we found an iron safe lying on the floor, broken open, and the cash-box also broken open, and the whole place in disorder—I was present when some wedges were found, a hammer, and two crowbars—the safe appeared to have been opened by the crowbars—I took a lantern out of the prisoner Armstrong's pocket, and some silent matches—I assisted Sergeant Gisbey in waking him up—he was not drunk—I don't think he was asleep.</p>

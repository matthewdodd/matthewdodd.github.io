                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the night of the 16th of March, I was on duty in New-street, and heard a noise at the back of Mrs. Criddle's house—I went to see what it was, and saw the prisoner Fawcett in the prosecutrix's kitchen, with another man, who I believe to be the other prisoner, according to his height, dress, and general appearance, but would not swear to him—I stopped a short time, and saw them open the dresser<lb></lb>drawer, and take out a table-cloth, a purse, and several other things, and place them on the dresser—they took up a pair of gentlemen's boots, and put them down again—I got over the wall, and disturbed them, and Fawcett hit at me with a hair-broom which he had in his hand—they got over several walls, and parted in different directions—I followed Fawcett—he got over a wooden fence, and left his hat behind him—he came to a ditch by the side of the Zoological Gardens—he could not get over that, but he got over a wall, and my brother constable' caught sight of him the moment I lost him did—the other man got away, and was taken next morning.</p>

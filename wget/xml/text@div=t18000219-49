             sworn. - I am a city constable: I know the prisoners; I knew Rudd before this happened; on the 1st of February I saw them both with another person, between six and seven in the evening; I was going down London-wall; the prisoner, Cawdle passed me with a bag upon his shoulder, Cawdle is the tallest of the men; I went a few yards, and Rudd and another man passed me; I followed, thinking I knew their faces; I then turned back and came up to Rudd again, and the other person; I then looked at them, and I was thoroughly satisfied that they were the faces of men that I knew; upon that I made the best of my way to Cawdle; I laid hold of the bag, and said to him, my good fellow, what have you got there; he said it was sugar; I asked him if he had a bill or receipt of it; he said, yes; I then told him I was an officer; he said, d-n you, what was that to him; then up came Rudd and the other man, at the corner of Basinghall-street, the London-wall end, towards Wood-street; Rudd and the other had parted; one came before and the other behind me; I said to Rudd, you keep off, for I know you well; I then had hold of the bag; then the man that was with Rudd came up and struck me between the shoulders; some people then came down Basinghall-street towards London-wall, and Cawdle pitched his load upon me, but luckily missed me, or else it must have broke my legs, then they all three made their escape towards Fore-street; they all made off in one company; the bag I took home with the assistance of a porter. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. How long before this had you known Rudd? - A. For two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you possibly be mistaken that he is the man that was with Cawdle and the other? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure Cawdle was one of the men? - A. I had my eye upon him for three minutes, and from his height and his face, I think he 1s. After I had taken the sugar home, I met Sansum; told him this story; On the Monday night following, about seven o'clock, I saw the same three men in Bishopsgate-street again, in company together, coming from the Bull Inn; we looked at them some time; they were following the Walthamstow errandcart, which goes from the Bull Inn; I immediately went up to Rudd; Cawdle perceived me before I came up to him; he went side to buy a halfpennyworth of apples; I went to look at him full, with the light before him; I went away again to Sansum who was about six yards off; they went on further then, as far as Old Bethlem; we saw them cross several times by the cart, and then we stopped them; we took Cawdle and Rudd, and the other made his escape, upon taking them, I asked them where they were on Saturday night, at ten o'clock; Rudd said, he was in Brick-lane, Old-street, Smoking his pipe, and Cawdle said he was in bed at that time, at a public-house, in Brick-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What time of the night was this? - A. Between six and seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. It was then dark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Cawdle you knew nothing of before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it, you went, on the Friday morning, to my Lord-Mayor, and gave information of the prisoners at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give their names? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. And why did you not? - A. I told the Lord-Mayor how I had proceeded, and told him I should be able to get them.</p>

               <p>Q.Had Cawdle a round hat on? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you mean to swear that you knew the man again? - A. He had his hat in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Monday, while he was buying some apples, you went up to look at Cawdle, and therefore you were not sure that he was the man? - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180002190038"></xptr>Yes, I knew him, but I was willing to be thoroughly satisfied; I am sure Rudd was one of the persons, and I never saw two faces more alike than that man's, and the face of Cawdle; I never saw another man like him; I must be greatly deceived if that is not the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Have you any doubt but Cawdle is the other man? - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a light at this apple-stall? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore you had a better opportunity of seeing whether he was the man that you had been on the Saturday night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>

             sworn. - I am a constable; I was in company with Read, on the Monday evening, when the two prisoners were apprehended; as we turned from London-Wall, towards the Bull-inn, Read and I saw the Waltham slow errand-cart in the middle of the street, going towards Shoreditch, and almost directly, we perceived the two prisoners, and another man, that they call Ginger, he got away from me, when I apprehended Rudd; we followed them on the pavement, as they were in the road, they were walking behind the errand-cart; I then turned short round to follow them, and observed that they came away from the cart, on the pavement; Cawdle went and bought some apples; Read went to the light, and looked at him two or three times backwards and forwards; he immediately said, that is he, and I seized him, and delivered him to Read, while I pursued after Rudd; Ruff had got a little way on; I seized him; little Ginger was before him, and I desired another man to lay hold of him, but he got away; I took them into a tobacconist's shop, to the light, and Read there said, they were the men that he had stopped with the parcel on Saturday night; I asked Cawdle where he was at ten o'clock on Saturday night; Cawdle said he was in bed, I think, and Rudd said he was smoking his pipe, in Brick-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the persons of Cawdle and Rudd before that time? - A. Rudd I knew well, and I have met Cawdle several times in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a man whom you knew, if you saw him? - A. Just so; on the Saturday before this, I was going down Bishopgate-street, about six o'clock, and saw Cawdle, Rudd, and another man in company together, nearly opposite to the Bullinn.</p>

               <p>Q. What was there particular to draw your attention to Saturday the 1st of February? - A. Because we are always slack in the tap-room on a Saturday night, and I heard on the Monday that he had been taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you they were taken up? - A. I cannot say; it was somebody that came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the owner of this house? - A. Mr. Dean.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he there? - A. No; he has so much to do on a Saturday night, in the kitchen, amongst the brewer's servants, backwards, that he seldom comes into the tap-room on a Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your mother there? - A. No, only myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is Cawdle? - A. A jeweller.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is Stone? - A. A glass-grinder; he has worked for Mr. Seddons seventeen years.</p>
               <p>Q. What relation is Mrs. Dean to you? - A. Sister-in-law.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she there? - A. No; Cawdle's brother came in about half past nine o'clock, and he was gone; I told him he was gone home very poorly.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am a glass-grinder: I know both the prisoners by fight; I was at Mr. Dean's house when I saw both the prisoners, on Saturday the 1st of this month; I first saw Cawdle, between four and five o'clock, I was not particularly acquainted with him; I staid there till ten minutes before seven, he was there all that time, I left him there; and I saw the other prisoner there several times before seven; I returned to the public-house a little before eight, and paid him a shilling, that I owed him for a pair of gaters that I had contracted with him for; I did not stop then five minutes, I paid the landlord.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You paid the landlord? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was in the bar? - A. Yes; at different times I saw him, but not so much as

               <p>Q. You are sure you saw him in the bar? - A. Yes, at different times; he is generally backwards on a Saturday; I paid him backwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell me that the landlord was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180002190040"></xptr>backwards and forwards in the bar? - A. Yes; so he was in the course of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he backwards and forwards at the bar in the evening? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was he not in the bar? - A. I think I saw him once or twice; I could not swear whether he was or was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Cawdle often there? - A. I seldom go only on a Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Cawdle often there? - A. I do not think I saw him three times in my life, only that day in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. How many months ago was that Saturday you speak of? - A. Not one yet; three weeks next Saturday; every Saturday night, at ten o'clock, my work is booked; I remember well that it was the 1st of February that I booked my work at night.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was Saturday the 1st of February above all other Saturdays; - what day is this? - A. This is Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. It happens to be Friday, I believe? - A. Our Saturdays are always Friday night, or Saturday morning: on the Tuesday following I went into that house, and heard that they had been taken up; I said, bless me, can that be the man that I bought my gaters of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when Cawdle was taken up? - A. I heard it on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Rudd? - A. Only by seeing him that day, and once or twice before.</p>
               <p>Q. How many boxes did you sit off from them that night? - A. The box they sat in was the next to the bar, it was a box or two off.</p>
               <p>Q. How many else were there in that box? - A. I cannot say; there might be a shoe-maker, and a brewer's servant.</p>
               <p>Q. In the same box? - A. I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you applied to about this? - A. I spoke it open in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you here to-day - did you tell the prisoners of it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to them in jail? - A. No; Cawdle's mother came to me, and asked me if I was drinking with her sen on the Saturday; I said, no, I had not drank with him, I offered him a pint pot to drink, and he said he had a pain in his bowess.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you no reason to know that this was the 1st of February but by your book? - A. No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Cawdle, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. On the morning of the 15th of August, about nine o'clock, were you at home - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You were inside of the house at the same time information were given you, which is the substance of this charge - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your wife at home - A. I do not know how<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310057"></xptr>that was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any handkerchiefs inside of your shop window - A. I am sure I had, it was our constant practice of dressing that window with handkerchiefs exhibited for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the fact of your house being broke open between nine and ten that morning - A. I knew my window was cut after some person came in and gave information that the window had been broken. One of my young men came and told me that my window was cut; when I came forward I found the window cut, and a piece of glass laying inside, on the handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed the window that morning before you had information that it was broke - A. On Monday the 13th of August the window was cut, and on the Tuesday I had it mended, and the putty being new they found no difficulty in pushing the glass of oneside, and on the Wednesday morning it was cut again between nine and ten o'clock. It was whole in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When you perceived the window had been cut and the glass removed do you know whether any of your goods had been drawn out or removed by that means - A. I really do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see any of your goods removed - A. None, whatever. The way the handkerchiefs were put in the window was as them books are, one up against another, till the window was full, I dare say there were a hundred poundsworth of handkerchiefs in the window. In the morning at that time I could not miss ten pound worth of handkerchiefs. I never recollect buying a piece of handkerchiefs that cost me less than two guineas prime cost for seven handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. They are charged for stealing fourteen handkerchiefs - A. That is by the witness Bates, I know no more.</p>
               <p>Q. The goods in this indictment were your goods and your partners - A. Yes.</p>

            . Q. Were you near Mr. Middleton's and Jones's the haberdashers - A. Yes, I work for Mr. Lee, Field-lane, Holborn, he is a shoe-maker. On the 15th of August, a quarter before nine in the morning, I was going to my work, and at the end of Chancery-lane I saw Francis, I had just passed Mr. Jones's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know his person before - A. Yes; he had Turvy in his company; I never saw Turvy before.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they appear to be in company together to act together - A. Yes; I saw Francis and the other both go up to the window, I watched them both; I then saw Francis pull something out of his waistcoat pocket, and break the window with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do it so as to make much noise - A. No, he did it pretty quiet. Then they walked up to the dial of St. Dunstan's both together; I then saw them come back, Francis put his hand into the same window, he had broke; I then saw him pull out one piece of handkerchiefs and then pull out another, he put them in his bosom, the other was by him at the time; they both walked up Chancery-lane, I saw no more of them; I went home and informed my master of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go into the shop and inform the people of it - A. No, I was rather late that morning with my work, my master blowed me up, I told him what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not attempt to lay hold of these man, did you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you tell Mr. Middleton or any of them of it - A. I told my master of it first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you appear before the sitting Alderman when they were under examination - A. Yes, they were taken up on that very day, at six o'clock. On Thursday I appeared before the alderman, where they were under examination and repeated this story.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose the handkerchiefs which they took away was never found - A. No.</p>
               <p>Francis. Q. I wish to ask him why he did not apprehend me if he saw me - A. Knowing him to be such a desperate character I thought he might do me an injury. I knew where to find him any hour in the day.</p>
               <p>Francis. I think there were plenty of gentleman in the street for him to take me without hurting him.</p>

            . I apprehended the two prisoners at the bar. After the information I received from Bates I went to Mr. Jones's instantly, I examined the square of glass, I found some instrument had pushed in the pane six inches by four, the piece of glass lay inside; when I went I was the whole day after the prisoners, I found them at the top of Drury-lane, St. Giles's, about a quarter after six in the evening; they were standing together. I caught hold of Francis, and an assistant that I got from Bow-street caught hold of Turvy: Francis turned round and said, halloa, what is this? I told him, for Fleet-street; he said to Turvy, making use of an oath, have we been in Fleet-street to-day? I know nothing about it. I looked up a turning, saw a place of safety; I searched them, upon Turvy I found this small knife, the edges appears to have been rubbed off with a file, it appears to be an instrument for the purpose, I have seen such an instrument found off persons<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310058"></xptr>on a similar charge; I found another of the same sort on Francis, I had the misfortune to break it; I took them to Bow-street. This offence was committed in the city, they were remanded to the City. They were taken before the Alderman the next day.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband's name is William—we live at Russell-street, Stepney.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, P</hi> 97.) I took George on 11th Dec., and said he was charged with robbing his lodgings, at Mile-end—he said, "Very</p>

               <p>well; you have got to find it out"—I said, "I have already found it out"—he said, "You have got to find the things"—I said, "That has nothing to do with it"—I took him to the station—I took James on the 15th, and told him I wanted him for robbing his lodging at Mile-end—he said, "Very well"—I said, "Your must go with me to the station"—he said, "Very well"—he said, in going to the Police-court, "I did not pledge them, I only gave them to a young man to pledge; I do not know where he pledged them"—I said, "Did not you have the ticket?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Do not you mean to say you had the money"—he said, "That is another thing."</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="italic">James Bradfield.</hi> He said he had owned to part of it, and I had better tell him where the rest of the things were, and it would be better for me; he asked me a great many questions.</p>

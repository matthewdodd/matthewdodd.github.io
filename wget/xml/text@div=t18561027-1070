I was at my front window, and I saw three men loitering about—the first time I saw them was about 10 o'clock—I saw them again a little after 11 at the same place—the prisoner is one of the three men—I gave evidence last Aug. against two of the men, who were convicted—I am sure the prisoner was one of the three, I saw him, he went towards the street door—he went to the key hole and looked, and said, "All right, mate"—I was at that time at my window, which was open—I went down stairs—I had something in my hand—I went to the yard and then to the front door, and when I came to the front door I found the two men were in custody—that was about a quarter of an hour afterwards—they were the two men that I had seen with the prisoner—the prisoner was not there—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man—he had whiskers on that day, and there are no whiskers on him now—I saw him at the police court afterwards, he was with one other man, I picked him out of the two.</p>

Q.</hi> You had never seen this man before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not take particular notice of his clothes—I noticed his features—I do not remember what coloured clothes he had on, whether they were dark or light—the police constable came to me after the last trial, and asked if I could identify the third man—I said I could—he told me he had a man in custody—the prisoner was shown to me at the court in a room—I went in the room with the officer—the prisoner and another man were</p>

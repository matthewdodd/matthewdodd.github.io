On the 5th of October I concealed myself in a part of my premises, and watched him while he was cutting - I saw him much flurried, and looking about him; he put his things into his bag, and was going away - I called him back, and said, "I want to see the cut of a waistcoat you have in your bag;" he hesitated, and said, "I have been long enough here to cut out a waistcoat," but at last I said,"I want to see what you have got in your bag;" I turned out the contents, and found this yard and a half of cloth rolled up in the other things - the fellow piece of cloth was then laying on the cutting-board; he immediately implored forgiveness, said he did not know what possessed him to commit such an act, and it was his first offence -I had before spoken to him about cloth: I called in an officer, who found some things at his lodgings.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. How long had he been in your service? A. Upwards of three years - I had the highest confidence in him; he is married, and has a family - I never allowed him to take home cloth to cut out; here are other articles which I know to be mine, but this piece of cloth I particularly speak to - he had not left my house; he was just going out - he should not have taken any cloth out till it was cut up for garments; this cloth could not have been put in undesignedly - it was rolled up tight.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What were his wages? A. Three shillings and sixpence a day, and he had what work he liked to do; he could get 35s. a week.</p>

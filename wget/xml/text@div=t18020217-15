I live with Mr. Ware: On the 9th of January, between six and seven, or near seven o'clock, I went to the lower old shed; I found four pair and a half of boot legs concealed under a beam; I took them out to see who they were dressed by; they were dressed by a person in the manufactory, whose work I knew; a person shewed me where they were; I went to the upper old shed, and concealed myself under the stiffing board; I had a perfect view of the lower old shed; there was no flooring to the upper old shed; in the course of half an hour, this

            Samuel Ware and Richard-Cumberledge Ware: Having received information that some boot legs had been secreted with a design to be carried away, and put into an improper place, Roberts was appointed by Mr. Ware himself to watch who should take those legs away; Roberts went from the accompting-house with that design; he came down, and said George Oswald had secreted the legs; in consequence of that, we begged he would watch him out; and as soon as I saw him pass through the accompting-house to the shop, at that time Roberts was at the door, I laid hold of his coat, and said, he must come back to the accompting-house, and must unbutton and take those things out; he unbuttoned his waistcoat, and we took the legs from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the legs marked? - A. Yes, I marked them myself; they are the same.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, which was read as follows:</p>
               <p>"My Lord, intruding on your time and the patience of the Court, in addressing your Lordship, I wish not to vindicate my conduct, but, on the contrary, acknowledge the justness of the prosecution against me; but I wish, at the same time, to lay before your Lordship the true circumstances relating to my fate: - having been desired by one of my shop-mates to take the property mentioned in the indictment, concealed by him for that purpose, I went, and was carrying it away, during which time a watch was set for the purpose of discovering the person; the goods having been found by a man, after they had been concealed, previous to my taking them away, I was followed, taken back, and the property found on me; I was committed to prison, and, with the advice of my prosecutors, who promised they would shew lenity, I made a full confession of the affair; but to no purpose, as information was given to the receivers, who, in consequence of the notice, left their habitation, and have not since been apprehended. I therefore place myself on the mercy of the Court, hoping you Lordship and the Gentlemen of the Jury will consider these facts in my favour; I hope it may be the means of extending mercy to your unhappy prisoner, having a disconsolate wife and two helpless children entirely destitute of support, and wanting a friend to give them assistance: and, in addition to this, I have to state, that I labour under a dreadful complaint, which renders me incapable of hard labour, the testimonials of which the surgeon can produce, as also Mr. Kirby, who afforded me the earliest relief, and treated me with the greatest humanity. Hoping this defence from your unhappy prisoner will operate on my behalf, I place myself on the humanity and mercy of this honourable Court, to the sense of which I bow with submission."</p>

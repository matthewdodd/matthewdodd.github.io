The prisoner was my cellar man—on 17th April I went with the policeman to take him into custody—I stood outside the door—the prisoner was in the stable—I saw him, and spoke to him—I told him he had stolen some gin from me—he acknowledged it—I forget what he said—he begged my pardon—I did not tell him it would be better to tell me.</p>

I deal with Mr. Trehern for spirits—the prisoner used to bring them—the prisoner called on me one Saturday, called me out of the parlour, and asked me how I got on for rum and brandy—I told him I had enough at present to go on with, and when I wanted any more I should go to his master—the bell rang, and the prisoner said he should bring me a bottle, but he did not say of what—he afterwards brought me a bottle—I do not know what was in it—I mentioned it to Mr. Trehern's agent.</p>

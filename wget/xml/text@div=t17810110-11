On the 14th of December I lost a gold ring with five rose diamonds out of a drawer in the shop in which the goods were kept. The prisoner came in about a quarter after three in the afternoon with another person; one of them asked for a gold seal; I cannot take upon me to say which asked to see the seal. I took out the drawer and one of them took up a silver seal and asked the price of it; the other then said, they wanted a gold seal for a present. I said I had no gold seals. They then made an apology for giving me the trouble and went out of the shop. As soon as they turned round to go out I looked to see if any thing was missing out of the drawer, and immediately missed this ring. I went after them.</p>
               <p>When had you last seen that ring before they came in? - I cannot take upon me to say.</p>
               <p>Had you seen it that day? - I cannot say; I put it in the case the day before. When I went after the women and brought them back the prisoner threw the ring down on the counter. When I first went out I did not see them in the street; I looked up a passage beside the house and saw them running; I ran after them; I took hold of the prisoner's hand and said you must come back; one of you have taken a diamond ring! she said how could I think such a thing! I said I was sure they had; she hesitated at the end of the passage, but then went into the shop and threw the ring down on the counter.</p>
               <p>Did only the prisoner or both go back to the shop? - Both; I met a friend in the passage who brought back the other; but before she came into the shop I saw the prisoner throw the ring into the drawer which I had left on the counter; it struck on a pair of spectacles; she took her hand from under her cloak and threw it in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Did any other person see her throw it in the drawer? - No; there was no person in the shop but she and me.</p>

               <p>Did not you examine them both? - They were taken up and examined.</p>

I am manager to 6 Mr. Richard Roger Western, of West Ham—the prisoner was in his employ—it was his duty to collect accounts, to enter them in a book called the petty-cash book, and hand them to me the same day—I put my initials to them when I received them—I discharged the prisoner on 1st January, at that time he had the book—he had three weeks notice to quit before he quitted—I had several times applied to him for the book—he said he had taken it home and he would bring it back—he said that many times—when he left he had not brought the book back—it was sent to me by post on 8th January—the prisoner called on me about a fortnight afterwards—he came two or three times—I saw him—the book was produced—he said, "I have entered in this book the sums I have received but not handed over"—I asked him to put down his name, acknowledging the receipt of these sums, which he did—he entered his name to some sums, but not the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him what he had got to say about that account—he said, "I collected that</p>

               <p>also, and handed it over to you"—I said, "I never received it, or you would have had my signature to it"—I opened the ledger and referred to this account—I said, "You have entered in this book 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the account should be 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said he had paid that to me—I asked him what he would do about the other accounts which he acknowledged to have received and not paid—he said he could say nothing about them—I sent for a constable and gave him into custody—here is the entry of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in this book—it was his duty to pay me the money on the day he received it—I am sure I did not receive this money—when I receive a particular sum I enter it in the cash-book, and from that into the ledger.</p>

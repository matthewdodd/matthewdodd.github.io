On the 3d of this instant, the prisoner who married my own sister came to me. I told him I was going out to dinner. He said, he call'd to see me and my children. I gave him part of a pint of beer, and a glass of gin. We parted in Berwick-Street, at the Crown and Appletree; and he said, he was going home. He proposed to come again on Sunday morning; and I purposed to get a bit of dinner for him and his wife. I went home between four and five, and went to look for my great coat to go to the fair, and I could not find it. After I had looked about some time and could not find it, I took the rod and struck my child, who is between eight and nine years old; thinking she had let somebody come in and take it. The child said, nobody had been there but her uncle. Then my servant,

            , told me he had been there a second time; and she left him in the room when she went a milking. Then I went to look for a pocket-handkerchief in my box; and I found that broke open. I had a trunk in my box, which was taken away; and my money was gone, and the buckles mentioned in the indictment.</p>

            . I got only the buckles again. I went and found the prisoner at the sign of the Harrow, at the corner of Panton-Street. I took his own brother with me; and there he talked of lending his brother money, and of paying the landlord there an old score. Then I told the landlord he had paid him with my money; and desired the landlord would assist in securing him, but he would not; neither would he let the watchman come into the house to assist. While we were talking the prisoner had like to have got away; but I got hold of him. Then I took him to St. James's Round-house. Going along he confessed he broke open my box with the poker, and took the trunk out and wrapped it up in my great coat, and carried it away; and that he had sold my great coat for five shillings and six-pence, and spent the money. I ask'd him for the money he had left. He put his hand in his pocket in a passion, and pulled out three-pence halfpenny, my silver buttons, and a little bit of silver, which I found in the street two or three years ago (not laid in the indictment.) Presently he took out the two pair of buckles, and gave them to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175609150008"></xptr> me. Then I told him I lost three pounds seven shillings in money, in gold and silver. He acknowledged he took the whole, and that he opened my trunk, took the things out, and left it in Piccadilly at a publick house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him?</p>
               <p>Tame. No, we did not; but I found afterwards he had a guinea about him, when he said he had none; which he afterwards changed.</p>

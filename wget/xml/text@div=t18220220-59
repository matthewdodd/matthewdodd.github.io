On Saturday night the 26th of January, from eleven o'clock till a little after twelve, I was sitting in the parlour, the door was on the latch. One of her daughters came in about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock, she opened the door herself - I saw the door after that, and it was closed; nobody came in after her. As I sat in the parlour, one of the daughters got up, and screamed out that there was a man in the shop; I went and found the prisoner opening the street door, he got out and was stopped immediately, without my losing sight of him; he said it was not him. Another man ran out after I got out. I missed nothing.</p>

I heard the door open, and shut - I looked round the shop, saw nobody, returned to the parlour, and in five or ten minutes, a lamp which was burning on the counter went suddenly out; I got up to see the cause, and on getting into the shop, I saw a man on his knees behind the counter, his hands were on the counter - I screamed out, and he crawled to the door; I followed and kept him in sight till he was taken, it was the prisoner. Another man in light clothes ran from the house immediately after the prisoner.</p>

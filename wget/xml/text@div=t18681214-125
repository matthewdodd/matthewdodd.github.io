                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, of Chancery Lane—on 17th April, at the prisoner's request, I redeemed a ring for him, in his presence, at the pawnbroker's—I had this cheque changed at my banker's for the purpose—he said that he could sell the ring in half-an-hour, and I took it there, but we could not agree as to the price—he introduced himself to me as the nephew of Mr. Hunt, the billiard table maker, who I knew—the ring was to remain in my possession till he or I could sell it—on 24th May he brought me this string of pearl beads (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which he said he had pur<lb></lb>chased for 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., having got 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. off—he showed me this invoice of it, and asked me to take the necklace as security, and allow him to take away the ring—I referred to my Directory, and found that there was such a firm in Long Lane as where he said that he had purchased it, and allowed him to take away the ring, and deposit the necklace—I had refused to take it on the 19th, but several days afterwards he said that he had purchased it, and showed me the receipt—I allowed him to take the ring on the 23rd May—the next time I saw him was on the 17th November, in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, of 56, Strand—these are not real pearls; I would not give 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the necklace—I could make one for less than half a crown.</p>

               <p>it would be a good opportunity of getting rid of a string of pearls.

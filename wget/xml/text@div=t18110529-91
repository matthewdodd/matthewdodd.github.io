            . I am a sawyer. On the 23d of April, between three and four o'clock, I was about two hundred yards from Mrs. Arnold's shop, I was at a public-house door, I saw the prisoner running with the cheese, he was running as if in the direction from Mrs. Arnold's shop; two boys were calling stop thief.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290063"></xptr>In about ten minutes he was brought back with the cheese under his arm.</p>

            . I was standing at the Queen's Head, I saw the prisoner pass with the cheese under his arm as he passed us he tried to hide it under his coat; I heard the alarm of stop thief, and two little boys running after him; I saw him brought back by two men; he was let go by them men because they could not find out to whom the cheese belonged; and the cheese was left at the Queen's Head by a carpenter; about half an hour after the prisoner came back, and asked me if I knew the man who had got the cheese; I told him, yes; I did not tell him it was at the Queen's Head; he said he could prove where he bought it; I said I thought if he had bought it he would not have thrown it down and run away; he said he knew he bought it under price, and that was the reason of his throwing it away; he went from me, and he had not gone above twenty yards, and up came Mrs. Arnold; from what she said I pursued the prisoner, and brought him back; I then said, if you bought the cheese here is the person that you bought it off; he made no reply. Mrs. Arnold, in his presence, said the cheese had been stolen from her shop.</p>

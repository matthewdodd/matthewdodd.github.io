                  </hi> The prisoner was in my employment as a traveller—I can<lb></lb>not tell in what part of the country he was in July and August last year—he was traveling—it was part of his duty to collect money, owing to me from different tradesmen, and transmit it to me—Mr. Horsnaill, of Basingstoke, was a customer of mine—I recollect his rang being applied to for some money by a letter written by my clerk—the prisoner never accounted to me for that money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The prisoner was a little more than twelve months in your employment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he travelled on commission—I do pretty extensive business—I have not much connection in the country—the principal part of the orders the prisoner sent have been executed—there may have been a case or two where they have not been executed—I believe Mr. Horsnaill was one of the customers whom the prisoner procured for me—it was the letter end of Oct. I think, about the 30th or 31st that I heard that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184704050126"></xptr>
               <p>this money had not been paid—I did not give the prisoner into custody on this charge—a person named Cross did—I never charged the prisoner with receiv<lb></lb>ing this money before he was given into custody—he was not accounted for the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi> 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi> which is the subject of this indictment, and for many other sums as well—I never said to him, "Have you received this money from Mr. Horsnaill?"—he never said to me in words, or by letter that he had not re<lb></lb>ceived it—he received between 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi> and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi> of my money—he was in the habit of paying his expenses out of the money he received on his journey—he furnished me with a statement of the monies he received from my cus<lb></lb>tomers early in Oct.—he has complained that I did not execute the orders he got, but he complained without cause—I believe all the customers in the country were his own connexion that he brought to me—here is the account he rendered to me in the beginning of Oct.—it consists of various items—the amount of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi> 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi> from Mr. Horsnaill does not appear in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When that account was rendered did you agree with you prisoner striking a balance between you, that he was to give you security for the balance due to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He offered me security for that amount—I did not agree to accept it—I sent him to Mr. Jennings the solicitor—a draft deed of assignment was drawn up, by which I was to be se<lb></lb>cured for this balance, but not the other<lb></lb>if Mr. Horsnaill's account had been there I should not have noticed it properly—I should not have struck that out; you may say that the other amounts that he received have been treated as matters of account between us, but not the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi> 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—if that had been there it would have been so, but it is not down, it is one of the robberies—I should have compromised it had it been down—I have not treated it as matter of account—Mr. Jennings has not to my knowledge had constant communication with the prisoner—not more than three or four times—most likely that was sufficient to drew up the dead of assignment—the deed was not executed—if the prisoner would give me security I should object to take it now—I am not aware that the deed of assignment was nego<lb></lb>tiated as late as Dec. last—I have not heard Mr. Jennings state so—I never saw Mr. Jennings writing—I sent to him but he never had anything to do with me, neither did I know him—I do not consider that I employed him—he is doing this business—I believe he drew up the deed—I never saw it till the day before yesterday, when it was in Mr. Clarkson's hand—my brother-in-law is named Cross—he is one of my travelers—I sent him with the pri<lb></lb>soner to Mr. Jennings.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose the mode in which the prisoner would have to account was this—he should have remitted the money up within two or three days after he received it, and on his return he should have given the account in by word of mouth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> yes—in October the negotiation was with reference to a sum of between 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi> and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi> that he was found to be deficient, and in that this sum of 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi> was not included—it was after that I discovered he had not included in it the sum he had received—it was discovered by a letter from Mr. Horsnaill—I did not see the prisoner between October and the time of his apprehensive—I never saw the deed till the other day—I believe the truth was, the prisoner would not execute it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was the time he ought to have given you some account of the receipts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Within three or four days of the receipt of them—he mostly remitted the money up in lumps, and the statement of the accounts he had received—I had some negotiation with him about a deficiency of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi> or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—he owned that, but this sum was not in that account.</p>

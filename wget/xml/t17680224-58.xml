I was with the watch when the prisoner was taken, about ten minutes before eleven at night, on the 13th of February; the prosecutor described him about ten minutes before nine; when the watchman met him, he asked him where he came from; he said, no where; he asked him where he was going; he said, no where; we took a great stick from him and secured him; we found this pistol tinder-box upon him; as we were taking him to the cage, he said, they can't hang me, I wish they may transport me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer, and live in London-street, Green<lb></lb>wich—the prisoner was in my employment upwards of two years—I had him from his parents. On Saturday afternoon, the 14th of May, I gave him six sovereigns and ten shillings, to go to town and purchase some Sunday newspapers at the different news-offices—he generally brought them by the railroad—he did not return—next Monday he was brought to my house by my son—I asked what he had done with the money—he said, "I have none"—he had 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week—he always behaved well up to this time.</p>

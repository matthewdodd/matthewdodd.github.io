On the 3d of September, in the evening, about half past seven, the prisoner came in to redeem a bed-gown pledged for a shilling; while the bed gown was gone for she asked me to shew her a card of plain gold rings; I did, and counted ten on the card before I gave her the card, she returned the card with nine on it; she said there were not any that would suit her; I saw instantly there was one missing. I told the prisoner as soon as I had counted them again, that she had got one of my rings; she said it was her own ring, she had it on her finger; I told her I would send for an officer if she did not give me the ring; she said I might, it was her own ring; I sent for an officer, she staid in the shop untill he came, and persisted in her innocence; she was searched, and no other ring was found but that one on her finger.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed when she came in whether she had a ring on her finger - A. No. I saw a bit of thread on the ring on her finger, I told her of it.</p>

            . When the prisoner was brought to the office she had the ring on her finger, she said it had been on ten years, I could not get it off. I got it off easy, it was perfectly new. After that she said she had it on fourteen years. There was no other ring found on her.</p>

               <p>Q. to Goddard. Is that a new ring - A. I do not know; it is a plain gold ring.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My husband bought the ring, I had it fourteen years.</p>

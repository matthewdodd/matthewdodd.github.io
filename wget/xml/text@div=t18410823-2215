                  </hi>. I am apprentice to William James Stevenson, a linen-draper, in Ratcliff-highway. On Saturday, the 21st of August, I was serving a customer, and saw the prisoner come into the shop, go to the counter, and look at a shawl which laid on it—she took it up—I saw her pull up her dress, and put the shawl so as to screen herself—I called Mr. Brown forwards, he came forward—she asked the price of a shawl, which was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she bid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he went to the other end of the shop, and she went out—I saw she walked with difficulty, and called Brown again—she was fetched back, and as she came into the shop she made a shuffle with her legs—Brown said, "Now I will search you, and see what you have got"—he moved her away, and there was the dress underneath—she had left the shawl on the counter before she went out—I am certain the dress was not on the floor till she came back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I never laid my hand on any thing on the counter except the shawl—I offered 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he refused, and I went out—when I came</p>

               <p>back, I shuffled my clothes, because my petticoat was coming off, but I never had it—he said, "You must have had it about you;" but I had never seen it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It was on the counter about an hour, or an hour and a half before she came into the shop—I noticed the floor particularly before she came in—there was nothing on the floor at all before she came back—here is a mark on the dress.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Stevenson. The witness spoke to me—I went to the counter where the prisoner was—she offered 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the shawl—I then moved to the other end of the shop—I showed her another shawl, and said it was much better than the one she was looking at—I observed something rather bulky at the lower part of her person, but I did not like to examine her—I walked further down the shop—the witness called to me to observe her difficulty in walking—she could hardly walk, as she had the dress between her legs—observing her difficulty in walking, I fetched her back—she slipped from my hold—I followed her into the shop, and said, "Now I will see what you have"—she shifted her legs—I said, "Let me see what you have dropped"—I moved her on one side, and there was the dress—she imme<lb></lb>diately said, "You did not see me take it, though," and said I did it through spite, because she would not buy the shawl—I bad seen the dress on the counter not ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before—the bulky appearance of the lower part of her stomach was gone when the dress was found.</p>

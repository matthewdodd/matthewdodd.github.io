                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Ann-street, Westminster. On 31st March I was in Orchard-street, with a young woman who is not here—I saw a school of children walking—I said to the person with me, "Is not that</p>

               <p>the ragged school?"—she laughed—I said to her, "What are you laughing at?"—she still laughed, and I laughed—the prisoner crossed over to me, and she said, "What are you laughing at?"—I said, "It is nothing to you"—she said, "I don't know that," and she undid her hand from her apron and struck me on the eyebrow with a white mug—it bled very much—her mother told her to run, and she did—she endeavoured to strike me a second time, and the officer came up—I was taken to the hospital—I was there till last Thursday—I had not challenged the prisoner to fight, I only said it was a matter of indifference to her what I was laughing at—I did not strike her.</p>

On 31st March I was in Orchard-street, a little before one o'clock—I saw Tape laughing at the ragged school—the prisoner came over and said, "What are you laughing at?"—Tape said, "Not at you"—the prisoner took a white pot and struck her with it on the forehead—she bled a good deal—the policeman came up, or the prisoner would have struck Tape again.</p>

I was passing the end of Orchard-street—I saw the prisoner running down towards me, and Tape fol<lb></lb>lowing her, with her forehead bleeding—the prisoner turned and put herself into a fighting attitude, and would have struck Tape again, if I had not caught her—I called another officer, sent the prisoner to the station, and took Tape to the hospital.</p>

Tape was brought there about half-past one o'clock—she had a severe wound on the right side of the forehead, just over the eye-brow—it bled a good deal—she remained there only one day, but she left without the consent of the medical attendant—she attended two or three days as an out-patient—she came about twelve days afterwards, and was admitted with erysipelas, and was there nearly five weeks—when she left I told her not to get drunk.</p>

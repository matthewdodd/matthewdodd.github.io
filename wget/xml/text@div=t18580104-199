                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Pitfield Street, Hox<lb></lb>ton—Ihave known the prisoner, I should think, for two years; he was in the employ of Mr. Dutton. On 14th Dec. he came to my house, about 9 o'clock in the morning—he asked me to give him change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, for Mr. Dutton; he brought the note in his hand—I took it, and it being rather dirty, I said, "This dirty piece of paper don't look to be worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said Mr. Dutton was short of change—I took the note up stairs; I put Mr. Dut<lb></lb>ton's name on the back of it, and gave him the change—this is the note; I had no other 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—two days afterwards I paid the note to the bankers, and it was returned to me the following evening.</p>

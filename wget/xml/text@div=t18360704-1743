                  </hi>. I am a seaman on board The Albion, which laid on the 2nd of July abreast of Woolwich Dock-yard, on the south side of the river. I went on shore to a public-house, and was passing through the church-yard, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening—Mills came up to me, and knocked my hat over my eyes, and struck me three or four different times—I had seen him before, but he was no acquaintance of mine—he</p>

I apprehended Mills at his won lodging, in Chesnut-row, Woolwich, on Sunday morning, about half-past six o'clock, the day after the robbery—I told him I took him for assaulting and robbing Kingston of his watch in Woolwich churchyard—he said that circumstance had been mentioned the previous day, on board a ship—I asked him why he ran away from the watchman, when he said he was not guilty—he said he did not like to be taken to the station-house for such a circumstance, as that was—saying at the same time, that it was only a lark—I searched his lodging, but found nothing—I took Heas at a lodging-house about ten o'clock the same evening—he asked what for—I told him it was for robbing Kingston—he hesitated, and then said he was not near him by two yards—I searched him, and found a portion of biscuit, and part of a balled, which the prosecutor identified.</p>

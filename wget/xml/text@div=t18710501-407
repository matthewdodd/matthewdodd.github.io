                  </hi>. I have an office at 20, Coleman Street—I reside at Epping—in the early part of last year I had made some advances to a person named Feist—the prisoner came to me with another person, about October or November last year, and entered into a conversation in reference to Feist—in consequence of that I took him into my employment as clerk—he told me that Mr. Feist, to whom I was advancing money, was forging bills of sale; that most of the bills of sale were fictitious, and that no one knew about them but Feist and himself; and unless I took him out of Mr. Feist's hands, and employed him, and took an office myself, I should lose all my money—he was in Feist's service at that time—Feist has since paid me every farthing, but at that time I believed the prisoner's state<lb></lb>ment—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and took an office in Coleman Street, where he acted for me as clerk and appraiser—I took out an appraiser's licence for him—he recommended persons to me to whom advances were to be made, and prepared the bills of sale—I placed entire confidence in him—I was very little at the office myself—about the 2nd February I remember his making a representation to me about a Mr. Dyer—he said that Mr. Dyer lived at the address on the bill of sale, that it was a very nice house, and very good furniture, that the man was very respectable, that he had made every inquiry; and had been to Perry's private inquiry office, and ascer<lb></lb>tained that he was a man in good position, and I was quite safe in letting him have the money—he said he had seen Mr. Dyer, had taken an in<lb></lb>ventory of the furniture, and that was a correct copy of it—he showed me this bill of sale (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and gave it me as a registered bill of sale: (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">nd February, signed by John Dyer, of.</hi> 18, <hi rend="italic">Wilton Place, St. John's Wood, civil engineer, and contained a long list of articles of furni<lb></lb>ture.</hi>)—This is in the defendant's writing—also the attestation to Dyer's signature—at the bottom there is a signature to a receipt of Dyer's, for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., witnessed by Barrell—I gave him a cheque for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to Dyer—that was on the faith of the representation that he made to me as to the respect<lb></lb>ability of the house; having seen Dyer and the matters contained in the bill of sale—I believed that Dyer was in existence, and his furniture also—I believe the endorsement on this cheque to be the prisoner's writing—I also saw him in reference to a bill of sale of a person named Charles James Dixen, of 288, Essex Road—that was on the 10th February—he said an advance of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was wanted, that he was a respectable man; that he had made inquiries at Perry's office, that he had taken an inventory of the furniture, and that it was well worth the money, and that I could not be wrong in lending it—he said he had been to 288, Essex Road, had seen Mr. Dixon, and taken this inventory (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he also gave me this as a</p>

               <p>registered bill of sale—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th February, purporting to be signed by Dixon, and witnessed by Barrell.</hi>) I gave him a cheque for the money, on the faith of the representations he made to me—I produce my petty cash-book—it is in the prisoner's writing—on the 8th February he charges me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for registering Dyer's bill of sale, and on 25th February, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for registering Dixon's—at the back of one bill of sole I see stamped 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on the other 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—both the cheques I gave him have been returned through my bankers, as paid—he continued at my office till Saturday, 18th March, and then left without notice—I never saw him again till he was in custody—I made inquiries about him, and ultimately found him at a public-house, at the corner of the street he lived in.</p>

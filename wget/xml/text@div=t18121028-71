It was between six and seven in the evening, a person of the name of Conger was with me. There is a corkshop at the lower part of the house. We got a light, and proceeded up into the front garret, which is two pair of stairs high. The door was fastened; we burst it open. We found the prisoner standing at the bench, and this mould was upon the bench, and another mould ready to put the copper in. He was dressed in this soldiers jacket, a leather apron on, and a cap.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the moulds for - A. To make halfpence, these are the halfpence made of them; these moulds are for good halfpence. There was a furnace red hot. I found some copper, and this bag of halfpence, and this crucible was in the furnace, red hot. I asked him what he thought when we broke in. He said, I am never easy in my mind, when I am making them. This is the mallet to beat the earth in the mould, and these are the screws that keeps the moulds together. Every thing we found there to complete the business.</p>

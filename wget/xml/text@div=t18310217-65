            . I live at No. 1, Canterbury-court, with Mrs. Stoker, who is my mother; Brann lodged in the second floor for about four years, with another man. On Thursday, the 3rd of February, the prisoner came and agreed for a lodging in the same room; there were two beds in it - he was to have part of a bed, with another lodger, at 2s. a week; I left him in the room - I am quite sure he is the man; I saw him go out of the house afterwards - he had no bundle or any thing with him; when he went away he asked me for a bottle to fetch some liquor, saying he had been travelling all night, and was very ill - I gave him a bottle; he never returned - I went up stairs in a quarter of an hour; there are two boxes in the room - I saw one had been pulled up, but nothing taken from it; that was corded, and contained boots - Brann's box was broken open; I sent for him, and informed him what had happened - I saw the prisoner in custody next day, in the afternoon, and I was quite certain he was the man who took the lodging; he had asked me to let him lay down a few hours to rest - it was between eleven and twelve o'clock when he came; I gave him leave - he was not above half an hour in the room; I met him coming down, and asked what was the matter - he said he was very ill; I said he had better come and sit by the fire - he had the bottle, and never returned.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What did I ask for when I undressed and went to bed? A. You did not undress - you came and sat by the fire; you had nothing about you that was visible.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He did not open his coat to convince you he had nothing? A. No; his coat was buttoned up close to his throat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was a tall thin man in the house, dressed in a flannel jacket. Witness. There was nobody in the house but me and my mother. who is disabled - the box was perfectly safe before he went into the room; he was there alone about half an hour - he had asked me to let him lay till three o'clock in the afternoon, and agreed for the bed as a lodger - he brought nothing with him; my mother and I pay the rent between us - her name is Jane Sophia Stoker.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 4th of February, at the Acron public-house, for robbing this lodging - I found none of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170055"></xptr>property on him; he denied the charge - I do not know where he slept on the Thursday night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I certainly laid down there - I was tired when I took the lodging, and was going to return there the next day; I was just by there - I had no more property about me than I have now; I sat by the kitchen fire with her before I went out - she gave me the bottle, and opened the door to me; it was impossible for me to have the things without her seeing them.</p>

            . Q. Do you leave your street door open, or is it always shut? A. It was shut all that day, as it was very cold - we have a bell to the door, which rings when it opens; there was not a creature came into the house besides him - I and my mother live in the room close to the door, and can see any body going up and down - the door was shut when the prisoner was with me.</p>

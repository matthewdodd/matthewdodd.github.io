             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Ogle-street, Mary-le-bone. I was robbed of a bundle of linen, in <placeName id="t17780218-19-crimeloc111">Portland-street, near Carnaby-market</placeName>

The bundle contained the things mentioned in the indictment [repeating them], which I had to wash; he was stopped, and carried to the Justice.</p>

               <p>JOHN - sworn.</p>
               <p>As I was coming out of the stable-yard, I heard Mrs. Edwards call out stop thief; I saw the prisoner and another man running on the opposite side of the street; some other person threw the prisoner down; I laid hold of him, and kept him till Mrs. Edwards came up, which was in two minutes; she was in sight when he was taken; she said that was the person; I saw nothing upon him.</p>
               <p>HENRY - sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 22d January, about eight o'clock, I heard the cry of stop thief; I took my hat and ran out; when I came to the end of the street, I saw the prisoner stopped there, and Mrs. Edwards by him; I asked if the prisoner was the man who took the things; she said he was. I saw nothing then upon him; I went to a neighbouring magistrate, after that to Justice Welch's. I then went home, but as I went back, I saw in the place where the boy was stopped a taller man idling about there; I thought this might be one of his accomplices looking for the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177802180023"></xptr> things; seeing nothing there, I thought they might be thrown into some of the areas; I desired the people to look there, and at the fourth house from the place she said she was robbed at, the bundle was found down the area. I afterwards carried, the bundle to Justice Gretton's where Mr. Edwards was going, as Justice Welch was not at home; there the bundle was examined, and delivered again to me. I have had it in my custody ever since.</p>

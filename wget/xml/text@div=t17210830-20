She farther deposed, that she found some Linnen cut out, but not made, (which was produced in Court) in a Chest of Drawers, and that the Prisoner told her, she thought she had a Month longer to go, and her Mistress, being to go into the Country in a Week's time, intended to have made it up in her Absence.

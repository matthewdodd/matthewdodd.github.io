On Thursday, the 17th of June, I was returning from dining with a friend over the water, and came over Blackfriars-bridge to go to Brunswick-square - I was accosted by several persons of the same stamp, and among others by the prisoner Sheen, in Fleet-street; she asked me for money, and finding I would give her none, she asked me to go with her - we turned up Bell-yard; she said, "Here is a public-house, do give me something," and I very imprudently did go into the Haunch of Venison, and gave her a glass of spirits - I do not think I drank any myself; I came out to quit her, but she still followed me, and on arriving at <placeName id="t18300708-76-crimeloc437">Apollo-court</placeName>

I am, and have a family I do not usually go into public-houses to treat women; it was to get rid of her that I did so - I was perfectly sober, so as to know every thing that was passing; I was stimulated, but not tipsy; I did take the gloves, thinking them to be my purse - it was up in a dark corner; she hustled me up in that corner under a pretence of having something to say to me; I had five sovereigns in my purse, and I believe there was some silver - I certainly have not said in another place that I thought I dropped my purse; the question was never put to me: I did not count the notes when I went into the public-house - I am certain I had them; I had not paid any of them away: I had had them two or three days in my purse - I never thought of such a thing as having dropped it; I do not know whether I drank any thing in the public-house, from indifference to what passed - I believe I and my friend had drank a bottle that day.</p>

I think there was no writing on the note - I looked at the back of it, and did not see any endorsement on it; she said her mother had had 40l. sent her up out of the country, which was back rent of an estate that lawyer James, of Truro, had been redeeming for them; I gave her the note back, and she went away - I did not see her again till she was apprehended; I had no more conversation with her; but

             came to my room about nine o'clock the same morning, and asked if I had seen her daughter Mary Ann - I said Yes, I had; she asked if she had paid me the half-crown - I said No, she had paid 1s. 6d. of it: she asked if I would have any thing to drink - I said I did not care, and she gave my wife sixpence to go and get a quartern of rum, which came to 5d.; she gave her the penny to get snuff with - she asked me if I would cash her a 10l. note; I said I was going to Mr. Philmore's, and I would ask him - she went with me; I asked Mr. Philmore's man, and he gave me nine sovereigns and two half-sovereigns - I believe that note is not here, it is missing; we then came out, and on going along, near Mr. Warmington's, she said, "I wish you would get me change for another;" I said, "If you are going to lay the money by, why not lay it by in notes as well as gold?" she said No, she liked gold - I went in there, and asked the boy where his master was; he said in the counting-house - he took in the 10l. note to him, and brought out eight sovereigns and four half-sovereigns: I did not look at that note - I only took it from her hand and gave it to the boy; I gave her the money, and she put it into a small tin box - I went to my room, and she went home; I asked how she came by the notes, and she said she had them in part of seventeen years' back rent. from her cousin, lawyer James - I do not know what the Wyatts are; the man is a stranger to me, but I am told he has been a sea-faring man - his wife has 25l. per annum, as a boatswain's window in the royal navy.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The only note you speak to is the one passed to Warmington? A. Yes; Wyatt was in the street - she did not go into the shop: I did not look at that note - my name and address, and the number of my house are written on it by Mr. Warmington; I saw the male prisoner three times before the Magistrate, and about three times before - I know his wife very well, and have for thirteen or fourteen years; I have not quarrelled with her these seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, have you not said you would be d-d if you would not serve her out the first opportunity, because she would not leave her husband to come to live with you? A. No, I never said such a thing - I never solicited her to leave her husband to live with me; nothing of the kind: I never quarrelled, and said I would serve her out, and never had the least idea of it - I have heard of a will which lawyer James has in hand now.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you not solicited them to forge a person's name to that will, or to put her name to any document? A. No; I never did any thing of the kind, that I swear - I mean distinctly to say I never solicited Wyatt to leave her husband and rob him of 10l.; I never solicited Sheen or Wyatt to make an affidavit to present to any Court, stating that her mother or father was dead; I never heard of any thing of the kind; I never heard such a charge - I never solicited either of them to make an affidavit that her brother had died at sea, to get his wages.</p>

               <p>JOHN WARMINGTON. I live in Union-street, Borough, and am a cheesemonger. This 10l. note has my writing on it, "Law, June 18, 1830, No. 5, Silver-street;" I changed it about eleven o'clock that morning - I paid it the next morning to a sugar-baker in the Borough; he is in the country, and his clerk is busy - I changed no other note for Law.</p>

Bank note: I had not change, but I told them to wait half an hour, as Mr. Ashman was not come home from market; they said they would leave the note, and went away - when Mr. Ashman came in he looked at it;

            , I live in Fan-street, Aldersgate-street. I did not know any thing of the transaction till I was called before the sitting alderman, at Guildhall,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040040"></xptr>There were two casks that belonged to us with spirits in them, peppermint and bitters; the constable has got the custody of them. I knew they were mine by the mark on the head of the cask.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look afterwards at home to see whether you had lost two casks? - Yes, I did.</p>

               <p>I was sent out on Friday morning, the 9th of May with a cart load of spirits, and I left the cart for about three minutes in Leadenhall-street while I called on a a customer, when I came back there were two casks gone out of the cart, and twenty-five shillings worth of halfpence, but these are not apprehended, I drove on to a public house with the cart for fear any thing should be gone, and then I went back to the house and enquired whether he saw any thing taken out of the cart, I heard there were two men stopped but I never saw the casks till I saw them at Guildhall.</p>

               <p>I stopped the prisoner with the casks on Friday, the 9th of May, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I live in Leadenhall-street, I just then came from my breakfast going to my labour, I saw the prisoner up in a court along with another man, I then placed myself opposite to see the proceedings, and it led me to a suspicion that he had stole the things, I saw him and the other man, they quarrelled who should carry them, the other man had got something in his apron; the prisoner said, I will take them, he put one on each hip and went on, and I followed him and got close to him, I then examined the casks and see one had got a private mark on it, and the other a dealer's mark, he then went down an alley and thought it was a thoroughfare and it was not, and I got up to him, and I said, my friend, I really think you have stole these casks, and if you have not stole them shew me your permit, then I shall be satisfied you have not; he then said that his fellow servant had got the permit, behind him, he went down Jewry-street, I then said to him, I really think you have not come honestly by these; I then saw Mr. Cooke, an officer, coming, and I told him he had better stop him on suspicion; he then said he was going to Thames-street, into Darkhouse-lane, at the Antigalican, when we got there he said he was employed by a man to carry them to that house, we staid there a few minutes and then we carried the man and liquor to the Magistrate, at Guildhall, before Sir James Sanderson; and Mr. Read swore to the casks the next day.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was at work that morning for Mr. Fitch and another salesman, carrying mackarel pads, I was done about eleven o'clock, I was coming through Leadenhall-street, a man comes up to me and says, my friend, do you want a job; seeing me a porter, says he, here is a couple of small cags if you will carry them for me to the Antigalican in Dark House-lane, and wait there till I come I will satisfy you, in going along I went into a wrong passage instead of the right, I made a mistake it was no thoroughfare, and the man called to me and I came round by Aldgate pump into Fenchurch-street, and this man comes up to me and says, my friend, where are you going with these cags? my friend, says I, you are not the man that delivered them to me, says he, I will charge an officer with you, have you got any permit? I said I had none, but I supposed the man that delivered them to me had the permit, accordingly I went along and I stopped to make water, and went on again, and accordingly he followed me and charged that gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040041"></xptr>with me, and when I came to that place I gave that gentleman satisfaction how I got the property and where I was going with it, and when I came to the place I put down the cags on the table, and the gentleman asked me where the gentleman was that I worked for? I said, I supposed he would be in in a few minutes; now had I delivered the property to that man he would have let me gone about my business.</p>
               <p>Court to Samson. What did he say to you when you first stopped him? - My fellow servant has got the permit, them were the very words he said.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

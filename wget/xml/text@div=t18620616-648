                  </hi>. My husband keeps the Crown public-house, in New Oxford-street—about 16th May the prisoner and another man came there—I was serving—the other man called for a pint of porter, and ten<lb></lb>dered a half-crown, which I at once put in the detector and found bad—I told him it was bad, and I had taken so much bad money previously, I was determined to put a stop to it—I asked him where he got it, and the prisoner</p>

               <p>who was standing by him said that I must be mistaken in the person; that he was a very respectable young man, and worked for Day and Martin's, and that he received that half-crown in part payment of his week's wages—while he was answering me, I saw the other man take off his boot—I did not see him take anything out of it—I passed round out of the bar, and sent one of the customers to get a policeman—the prisoner was standing beside him after he took off his boot—they both ran away before the police<lb></lb>man came—the other man was brought back by the policeman—I gave the half-crown to the policeman—on 27th May the prisoner came again with another man, and asked for a pint of half-and-half, which was threepence—I served him, and he gave me a bad half-crown—I tried it, and told him it was bad, and that it was not the first time he had been there, and I was determined to have him locked up—he said nothing—I called my husband—the prisoner merely said that I must be mistaken; that the other one had passed it—he was very violent, and aimed a blow at me, and gave my hus<lb></lb>band two black eyes—he was ultimately given in charge—I gave the half-crown which I marked to the policeman.</p>

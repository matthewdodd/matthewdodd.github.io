                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Upper Whitecross-street, St. Luke's. On Monday, the 25th of June, I was going down Redcroos-street, Cripplegate, about twelve o'clock, to go to Newgate-market, and observed the prisoner with a lot of children, feeling down their bosoms—I suspected she was about stealing their necklaces—that induced me to watch her—I went to the corner of Jewin-street, and saw her call the children up to her again, and speak to them—she took one in her arms, and crossed the street, down Paul's—alley—I then crossed to the other children, and asked them if they knew that person—they said no—I ran down the alley, and caught her before she got to Aldersgate-street—she had got four or five hun<lb></lb>dred, yards, nearly to Aldersgate-street; she then crossed Aldersgate-street, and went up a court leading into Cloth-fair, and I think she bought the child something—I saw the child with something in a paper when she cama out—I followed her to Smithfield, and there she stopped to speak to somebody, and I asked the man she spoke to if he knew her—he said no—I followed her about Smithfield—she was showing the child the sheep and calves till about two o'clock—I saw her go into a public-house, and called the officer to come and take her in charge—she had had the child about two hours and a half—I went into the house with the officer, and questioned her as to whose child it was—she said the child's father lived in Duke-street, just across Smith-field—I told her I should go and see the father—we went with the officer up and down Duke-street—she could not find any house, and thern I told her where she took the child from—when we came to Jewin-street, she put the child down, and said it would know its way home—I told her I wanted her to tell me its name, and where the father lived, and she could not—she then directed me to Green Dragon-yard, Fore-street—we went up Green Dragon-court, and she went up to a female with a child in her arms, and said, "Say you know me"—the woman said, "I never saw you before; how can I say I know you?"—we then came back again, and in crossing Whitecross-street, we met a young woman, and she said, "Ah, Anna Holliday, we have been looking for you every where, in the work-house and every where"—I had the child in my arms, and the policeman</p>

               <p>had the prisoner—I asked the young woman where the parents of the child lived—she directed me to Long-walk, Lower Whitecross-street—I took the child, and the policeman took the prisoner, and found the person that had the care of the child.</p>

On the 25th of June, swaine came to me in Smithfield, and requested I would notice the prisoner—I went into the Golden Lion, and asked her a few questions—her answers seemed very unsatisfactory to me—she asked me to walk to Duke-street, which I did—when I got there, I saw she wished to shuffle away—I said I would not let her go—she said, "If you will go to Green Dragon-court, I will show you the father of the child"—I went there, but no one knew her—and then I returned back, and happened to meet the young female who recognised the child—I took the child there, and all the neighbours knew it—they knew nothing of the prisoner—I then told her it was my duty to take her to the watch-house—she told me that the mother of the child had been dead a fortnight.</p>

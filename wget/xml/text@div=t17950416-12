I told him I did not know, but there was a White Horse inn, in Cripplegate; immediately it run in my head that something was going forward more than usual, and I turned my head and see the prisoner coming out of the shop with a quantity of shawls in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160028"></xptr>his arms, he had them before him openly I immediately cried stop thief! and ran after him, he carried them about ten or a dozen yards, and threw them down in the kennel, and ran away; I cried stop thief! and he runs up a narrow court that leads to Honey lane market, Robinhood-court, he was stopped there.</p>

               <p>I live along with Messrs. Neale, Wright and Co. as warehouseman. On Saturday, between seven and eight o'clock, hearing the cry of stop thief! I went to the door after our porter, and the porter ran down Milk-street, and I did not run at all, I set my feet immediately almost on the goods, that lay in the kennel.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any body throw them down? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were they from your door? - The width of the pavement, directly opposite the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the goods? - Purple shawls.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do then? - The porter that pursued the man, desired the shawls might be picked up, and I picked them up, and took them into our front warehouse, and laid them on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were they delivered to after that? - To the constable that took the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver them to the constable or Mr. Stevens? - The constable took them I think, but I believe they were both present.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it wet or dry in the street? - It was quite clean in the middle of the street, but some of them got into the kennel, and got very wet and dirty.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you sent for on this occasion? - No, I was coming down Milk-street between seven and eight o'clock, and hearing the cry of stop thief! I ran as fast as I could, and seeing a concourse of people running in the court, I immedi<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160029"></xptr>ately made round the other way, and catched the prisoner in the court, Robinhood-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he running? - He was hardly running, when I came up to him there was so many people that he was partly stopped; I brought the prisoner back to Mr. Stevens and Nicholson's, and they gave charge of him, and I took him to the Compter; after that I went to Messrs. Neale's and Wright's, with Mr. Nicholson, and brought the shawls into his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they dirty or clean? - Two parcels I believe were dirty, the others were not, they are here in court.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been done with these shawls? - After that I then sealed them up, and left them at Mr. Nicholson's house.</p>
               <p>Q. They were carried I suppose to the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you seal them again there? - Yes, I sealed them at the Mansion House, before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say the prisoner was running, and you stopped him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was running towards you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Robinhood-court? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. One end of Robinhood-court leads into Honey-lane-market? - It does.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if he had been inclined to run away, he might have run away into the market? - He had not got through the court.</p>
               <p>Q. These shawls you received from Neale, and delivered them to Nicholson, that is all you know? - That is all.(The goods produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are the same shawls.</p>
               <p>Q. Have they your private mark on them? - They have.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen them, before this transaction happened? - Half an hour before, they had been shewn that day, and just put by in another place, they were marked No. 214, with a cross.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. That is no particular private mark of your's no more than another dealer? - No, no other than I know my own mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Persons in trade do mark their goods with private marks sometimes? - They do.</p>
               <p>Q. They are linen I believe? - They are cotton, all of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of all these things? - About fourteen pounds, that is the price that I am every day selling them for.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming through Honey-lane-market, and I was walking down this court, and two or three people run past, and I walked on, and a great many people came in a cluster together, and laid hold of me, and said I was the person; and I asked what it was for? and they said I had taken some shawls, and they took me back to this gentleman's house, I know nothing more.</p>

I went with an officer to Mr. Norman's, the pawnbroker, in July last, and found it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you take me up twice to Marlborough-street? A. Yes - I had my witnesses there the first time, but I did not bring them forward, not understanding the nature of it. I summoned her husband, and they told me to go Marlborough-street; it was some months after her confinement; I had seen her in the room several times - the key of the room was put into a place, where my bed-fellow and me could find it. The prisoner and her servant cleaned my room.</p>

I lent her 14s. 6d., and she left it with me as a security - I was going to the Theatre, and I gave it out of my pocket to Timbrell, to take care of for me - this was in July last; it was for a coat, pawned in the name of McDonald, but the prisoner said it was her husband's.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

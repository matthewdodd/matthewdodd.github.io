The person tried to wrest it out of my hand. When he could not do that very easily, I turned round and he seized my coat, still holding the umbrella; immediately then I was seized on the other side by some one else hold the other arm; then a third one came and took my watch out of my pocket, which third one is one of the prisoners at the bar I saw the man's hand and the face of that man. I was held on each side. I immediately made a hue and cry; the person then ran. The man who took the watch was one of the prisoner's and the right hand man was the other; but I could not swear to the third man.

These other eight or ten came, pretending to render me assistence; and the men who were about me pursued for some time, and I believe them to have been accomplices; we did not overtake the prisoners. If I had a doubt in my mind of the prisoners person, as I am an advocate for liberty, I should be sorry to take away the liberty of any of his Majesty's subjects, and I am sorry to say that I have no doubt. I naturally went to my master the next day, and he advised me to go to Bow-street. In consequence of that I sent my son to Bow-street early on Monday morning to state the circumstances of the case; and an officer came to me on my master's premises; he took me to several houses; I went into two or three, and did not see them; at last he took me into the Castle, I think, in Tothill-street, Gray's-inn-lane. The first person I saw was Latham; I saw the other prisoner some time after; I pointed each of them out to the officer, and they were taken in charge to Bow-street.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the Monday morning the prosecutor's son came to me, and in consequence of that, I went down to him at his master's premises. I asked him if he would know the persons who robbed him if he saw them again; he said he would. I told him I would take him to different houses which character's of that sort used. I took him to two or three. He looked about the tap rooms of several of them, and did not see any one he knew; at last I took him to the Castle in Tothill street, little Gray's-inn-lane; I did not tell him what sort of a house it was before he went in; but pointing to Latham he said that is one that seized my umbrella. Then he looked over the settle to another part of the tap-room, and pointed out Seawood. I asked him if there was any one else he knew; and he said, no. I asked him if he was positive those were the people, and he said, yes. I took them into custody, and searched them, and there was nothing about them. They made no resistance, any father then saying that they knew nothing of it.</p>

On Saturday the 28th of September, between five and six o'clock in the evening, Seawood came into the Castle public-house, quite drunk; he went and sat down by the fire, and then lay down. He had not laid there long before he rolled off on the floor. I picked him up and replaced him on the seat again; he then fell off the second time, and crawled and the bench. There he lay until nine o'clock, at which time I left him. I am a waiter at this house; I left him lying under the bench at nine o'clock. The prisoner Latham came in between six and seven, and remained there until about a quarter to nine, at which time he went out. There were near twelve people in this place. I was obliged to run in and out at different times, and I can't exactly say the number that was there. I don't know what time Latham returned; I don't notice; I was out until the house was cleared; I went out at about nine o'clock to my sisters.

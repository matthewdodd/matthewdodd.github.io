                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—on 27th January I came home between 9 and 10 o'clock, or it might be later—I was out in the yard when the prisoner came in, and sent the child out for something for his tea—I went in, and took the warming-pan, to warm something for his supper—he was rather nasty because I had taken 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of his pocket; he wanted me to give it to him, and I said that I had not got it—we had had a dispute about it in the morning—he went out; I gave him a shilling to go to his work, and then he wanted another shilling, but I said I had not got one—I did not see him afterwards till he came home at night—I then got the frying-pan, and was going to the table; as I passed him he jumped up, seized the frying-pan, and hit me over the head with it once or twice—I bled, and went down stairs <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the door—I was sent to the hospital—I know he would not have done it if he had not been in drink, for he is a very good husband when it is not for the drink, and I wish you to be merciful to him—I was three weeks and three days in the hospital—my head is well now—the frying-pan was a little bent at the side before; the handle was not broken off, but it was rather loose.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. George's Hospital—I examined the prosecutrix there on 27th January—she was faint from loss of blood, and had two wounds on the back of her head, one about an inch and a half long, and the other about three inches, clean cut, and each</p>

               <p>went down to the bone, exposing the bone—the larger wound of the two had made a fissure in her skull, and was of a dangerous character—the fissure was an indentation, very nearly approaching a fracture; it was a groove in the skull—a frying-pan would be likely to produce it if wielded by the handle, but it would require considerable force—she was under my care three weeks as an in-patient, and about a week afterwards as an out-patient.</p>

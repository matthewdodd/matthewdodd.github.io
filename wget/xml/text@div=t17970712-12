             sworn. - On Friday the 9th of June, I had been to Oxford-street, and on my return I went into a public-house, in <placeName id="t17970712-12-crimeloc65">St. Giles's</placeName>

               <p>Q. Were you sober or drunk? - A. I was sober enough.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it? -

            About ten o'clock, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see her again? - A. I went home very uneasy, and I got up early the next morning, and caught her standing at the very table where we drank the beer; says I, you robbed me last night, now I have you, you shall pay me my money back again; there were two women there, and they shoved me out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure, when you got change for the forty shilling note, that the five pound was in the pocket-book? - A. Yes; it might then be about nine o'clock, and I am sure it was there about two minutes before she took the book, I saw it there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This man desired me to sit between him and another woman, and then he asked me if I would have a glass of gin, and I said, I did not care, if he would give it me, and we went into the parlour, and had two quarterns of gin, and we went away to another public-house, to get change, and then we came to the Blach-horse, there he had some rum, and he wanted to quarrel with an acquaintance of mine that was in my company, I never saw the note in all my life.</p>

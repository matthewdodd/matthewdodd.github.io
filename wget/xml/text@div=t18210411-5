I locked it and put the key into my pocket - the prisoners were all in the house in the course of the day, but whether they were there when I went out, I do not know. I returned about twelve o'clock at night. Before I went out I was in the taproom - there was a great quantity of people there, smoking, I suppose twenty, or more. There was upwards of two dozen of Port, and two dozen of Sherry in the cellar - I saw it in the course of the day - there was some shrub and cloves also, On my return I found the brandy cask in the cellar turned upside down, and the bung out.

            . I am the mother of Blythe's wife, and was at his house on the 27th of February. I had lodged there for two months. I was in the bar in the evening - the prisoners were all there in the course of the day. Trumble and another man, who is not here, quarrelled and fought -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110006"></xptr>they began fighting, and I sent them out, but they went over to the skittle-ground, and so did several others. While they were there I saw a man come out of the cellar; I laid hold of him - he is not here - he denied being in the cellar; he was just pushing the cellar door to when I laid hold of him. He had a chisel in his hand. He got from me, and ran away. There had been dancing and singing, and a great noise before the scuffle. I sent for Gilmore, who came and cleared the house - most of them were intoxicated. The gas light in the room was put out twice, but it was burning when the man came out of the cellar. I found a cask of shrub or cloves under the taproom table - it was taken out of the cellar.</p>

I saw Blyth lock the door before he went out, and put the key in his coat pocket, which hung up in a little room - the cellar door is in the corner of the taproom; they danced between the cellar door and the bar, so that while they danced we could not see the cellar door. Trumble was very much intoxicated. I saw Ward and Murphy there, in the course of the evening. All that were in the taproom were dancing, they made a very great noise, and jumped very high.</p>

               <p>KENDRICK'S Defence. Twenty or thirty people were dancing; I went to light my pipe by the gas, and it went out.</p>
               <p>TRUMBLE'S Defence. I went there, the girl told me I should have been there two hours before, as some gin had been distributed, and she wished she could get a fidler, as the licence was gone, that there might be a proper outcry in the house. Her sweetheart kicked up a row, and we went into the skittle-ground to fight.</p>
               <p>MURPHY'S Defence. About fifty people were making a row near the house; I went in the skittle-ground, and saw a fight - the constable ordered us out.</p>

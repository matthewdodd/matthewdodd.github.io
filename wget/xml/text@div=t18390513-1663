                  </hi>. I am a coach-builder, and live in Park-street, Grosvenor-square. On the 15th of May, I sent 48lbs. weight of horse<lb></lb>hair in a bag to St. George's poorhouse, by one of my men—the prisoner was intrusted to bring it home to me after it was picked—he brought it back the same day, and was followed by a policeman, who asked if I knew any thing about that hair—I said yes, it was all right I believed—the prisoner was one of the paupers of the parish—the policeman said he be<lb></lb>lieved it was not right, for he had been selling some of it—I told him to follow the prisoner up stairs, and I followed him—I asked how it was he had been taking out some hair—he said he was very sorry, but he had got a wife and family, and he had sold a little to get some tea and sugar—there was 7lbs. weight of hair missing—it cost me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound, and a half-penny a pound I pay for picking.</p>

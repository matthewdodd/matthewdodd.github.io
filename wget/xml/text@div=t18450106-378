                  </hi>. I live in Kingsland-road, and am a hatter. This is a hat-body—the brim of it is felt, and the other part is willow—it is mine, and was hanging on a nail at my shop door on the 19th of Dec, about one o'clock—I then went out, and when I came home it was gone—I afterwards saw it in possession of the officer—I know it by the mark inside it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 365.) I was in Kingsland-road on the 19th of December, and I saw the prisoner lurking about Mr. Lloyd's shop—I then lost sight of him, and in coming down Hackney-road I met him with this hat-body in his apron before him—I said, "What have you got?"—he said, "Why a hat?"—I said, "Where did you get it?"—he said, "I just bought it of a man in Hackney-road"—I laid hold of him—he became very violent, and struck me and kicked me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was not in Kingsland-road at all; I said I had just bought it of a man; he struck me on the eye with the handcuffs; he was in disguise, and I did not know him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I saw him pass the prosecutor's shop—I did not strike him but once—that was after he hit me.</p>

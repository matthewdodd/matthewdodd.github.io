                  </hi>. I live in Nether-street, in the parish of Finchley. On Tuesday, the 21st of Oct., I left the house at two o'clock in the afternoon—I left the door locked fast, and the window down—no person was left the house—I returned at a quarter past two, and saw nothing amiss—at half past three I came past again, and saw somebody had been at the win<lb></lb>dow—I</p>

               <p>unlocked the door, and went in—I found the cupboard door open, and some bread and bacon gone from it—a little box was also taken from it, but nothing was gone from that—I missed the articles stated—the house appeared to have been entered by the bed-room window, by slipping the bed-room window up—they had nothing to do but to lift it up—the hat has been found—this now produced is it.</p>

About three o'clock on this tuesday afternoon I was going towards sibbley's house, and saw the prisoner standing out at the front of sibbley's house—he asked me what o'clock it was—I told him I did not know—he then threw dirt in my face—I went up and knocked at sibbley's door—no one answered—I saw a man, dressed in dark clothes, run from the back of the house down the field in which it stands—when he got to the bottom of the field I saw him take up a bundle—the prisoner ran down towards the man—they were together.</p>

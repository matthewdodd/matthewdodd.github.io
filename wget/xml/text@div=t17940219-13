               <p>Q. When was your house broke open? - On the 17th of January, on Friday; it was supposed to be broke open about half after five in the morning; I did not sleep in the house on account of its being lately finished, it was damp with the plaister, I was afraid of catching cold; there was no person in the house except a dog in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in it that day? - Yes, I was there on Thursday night, about ten minutes before ten; I was the last person in the house, I locked the street door, and sastened every thing in the house the last thing when I left the house, and fastened all the places.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you make your discovery that it had been broke open? - The next morning, I was the first person that went to it myself, I went a few minutes after eight o'clock. The first thing I discovered was all my pegs empty; I found the street door fast as I had left it, but I observed a pane of glass taken out of the parlour window the first thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Now this pane of glass, did you discover it when you was inside of the house, or when you went to the door? - I discovered it when I was inside of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What other parts of the house was broke besides the pane of glass, were there any shutters to the window? - Not any at all. I apprehend they broke in at the back door, but I could not get to the back door without going into the parlour, the pane of glass was taken out of the door of the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is this parlour door, is it a communication between the shop and parlour? - It is between the shop and parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you conceive this was broke, for any purpose, or was it a mere accident? - They could not get into the shop without taking this pane of glass out; but before they came to this they got in at the back door, with an iron crow or something; the back door is exposed to the street, I found that door broke all to pieces almost; they had forced the things that the bolts go in, and broke the door all to pieces almost; so then by breaking this pane of glass in the parlour door, they could put their hand in through and get up the latch.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came away, ten minutes before ten, it was quite dark then, I suppose? - O, yes, quite dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I want to know how it was when you went to this house in the morning, was it dark or was it not? - It was not as you say dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there light enough to distinguish a man's face? - Yes, plenty of light to do that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the shop finding your back door broke this way? - I did, I missed forty or fifty pair of shoes, I cannot tell justly how many mens shoes, and some boys, and half boots, all leather shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the shop did you miss them from? - I missed them from the pegs, some racks that I had made to hang them on.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they were there the over night? - I am confident of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing else missing? - Not that I can recollect, except a pair of half boots.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever recover any of these shoes? - Yes, two pair offered for sale, and one pair I took off the prisoner, Webb's feet, at the office; one pair offered for sale I saw in the hands of Mr. Ford, this was on Monday, they had wore them, because I should not know them. The other pair were offered for sale to Mr. Richardson, in Monmouth-street, that was on Tuesday; the third pair I took off his feet at the office, this was on Tuesday. He came in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190043"></xptr>over night, the Thursday night before the house was broke open; to get something done to his shoe. I have kept ever since, that pair I took off Webb's feet, the other persons who stopped the other two pair have kept theirs; Webb was in the shop the night before the robbery, to get his shoe mended, and he said when he was there it must be cold to sit here; and I said yes, it is very cold, and I saw him as he went out look through the parlour windows, I took notice of him particularly, and had some suspicion of him.</p>

               <p>Q. How far do you live from the house of Mr. Colwell, the last witness? - About a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a pair of shoes brought to you by any body? - Yes, by Webb; they were leather shoes; I asked him where he got them? as soon as I took the shoes into my hand I saw the private mark, and I thought they were Colwell's, he said he got them of a man at Kennington Common; I told him I knew the person that owned them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing more about them? - No, going along we met Mr. Colwell, as soon as he met him, he said you are the young man that I want to see, and he collared him, and took him to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the shoes that the lad brought to you? - I had them of him, and have kept them ever since, till I came to this place, I marked them myself in the office with an R.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look on them altogether, and tell me whether these are the shoes that you took from the prisoner Webb? - I can swear to the shoes; I have no doubt at all.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is that from the house of Mr. Colwell's? - About half a mile. The prisoner Lewis offered these shoes to fell to me the Monday following after they were lost; I have kept them ever since, till to day they were all put in an handkerchief, and given to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were the shoes you gave to the prosecutor? - I wrote my name, 
               <persName id="t17940219-13-person199">
                  Joseph

            , on them, at the Justice's; I am confident they are the shoes I took from Lewis, he offered them to me for sale, he asked me two shillings and six-pence for them, and I looked inside and see the marks correspond to a bill that I had left in my shop, I took him instantly to the office.</p>
               <p>Court to Colwell. What may be the value of the shoes that you took from Webb yourself? - One shilling; they were all old shoes only new foled and heeled, I know them by a cut with the knife in the inner foles.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you sold some with that cut? - Yes, many a pair.</p>

               <p>Q. Whether you can say with certainty that they were a pair taken out of your house that night you missed some, or a pair that had got into the world by sale? - It was a pair that I missed that night, because I had left them in the shop, I had been in the shop but five days, I could swear to them if there was no mark on them at all.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a pair produced by Mr. Richardson, have you got that pair here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know them? - They are marked according to what they cost, this is cut with a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had they been mended? - I cannot justly say, because I may have mended them before I was in business for myself, because I have mended many a pair before I was in business.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that you had not sold these shoes? - Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190044"></xptr>Q.Now there is another pair taken from Lewis, by Mr. Ford? - Those I had seven pair of one gentleman's wear, and I had not sold any pair of them, they are my own work, soled and heeled, and they are cut with a knife too.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you mended them? - I cannot say, it might be a fortnight, I cannot justly say, I missed the whole seven pair of one gentleman's wear.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you see there a pair only found, and these boys lives depend on your evidence; have you on your conscience any doubt about them; supposing these shoes had been put into your hands at York, should you have known them at York; should you have ventured to have said, supposing you had seen them at a shop in York. these are my shoes? - Yes, I should, I should have known them.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the whole three pair? - About four shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of the whole forty you lost? - Between three and four pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Would they sell for three pounds do you think? - Yes, they would.</p>
               <p>Jury. One shoe of this pair is marked and the other is not, have you any reason for that? - No, it is by accident; I keep them in pairs as I buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came in the morning, how did you find your dog? - I found it cut loose, it was out of the house, I met the dog by St. Giles's Church.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he hurt at all? - He was not, he was tied up in the house, and he was cut loose with the rope about his neck.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Webb. I works for a plaisterer, and I was going to work between six and seven in the morning; I was going across by St. Giles's pound, and I saw one of these shoes lay in one place and three or more lay straggling all in the road, and I picked them up, and one pair fitted me, and the others I went to sell them, and this man stopped me with the shoes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Lewis. On Monday morning I went to sell my things, and I met a man in the street, and he asked me to buy them shoes, and I told him I had but six-pence and half a dozen of mats about me; and he said he knew what to do with the mats as well as me, and I gave him the six-pence and half dozen of mats for them, and I went to sell them in Swallow-street.</p>
               <p>Court to Ford. Did he give you any account how he came by them? - He said he gave six-pence and some mats for them.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How soon was you to return to this house? - In the course of five or six days, or not so much, as soon as the plaisterers were out of it.</p>

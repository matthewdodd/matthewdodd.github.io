                  </hi> (Policeman M 38). On 10th September I went to apprehend the prisoner's daughter, a girl about twelve years old, for stealing a watch—I told her the charge, and she screamed, when the pri<lb></lb>soner came out of her house and endeavoured to rescue her—she said that she should not go, she would take her home—I told her to be quiet, we were going to take her to the station—I did not, notice anything in her hand at that time—we moved on a little further, and she said, "I will take my daughter home, " and she put her hand round against me—I put my hand up to save myself, and I felt a stab in my hand—it made a deep cut right across my four fingers, in the front part of my hand—I took the prisoner by the wrist, and took this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from her right hand—it is a common shoemaker's knife—if what she did with the knife was done accidentally I should not have attempted to take her into custody—she made a direct blow at me—I still suffer from the cut—it is getting on very well.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, in the employ of Messrs. Stanford, hay and straw dealers—on the evening of the 10th I was in Mr. Giltott's yard, talking to him, and heard a very loud scream from a young girl—I went towards Gunn Street, and there saw this young girl in the hands of an officer in private clothes, and there were two in uniform—she was screaming, "Let me see my poor mother; fetch my poor mother" pre<lb></lb>sently the mother came running across the road, and said, "What has my poor child done, that she should be taken away?"—no satisfactory answer was given her, and one of the men turned round and said, "What do you do with that knife in your hand?"—she said, "I have been shelling of walnuts"—he said, "Give me this knife"—she said, It is my knife"—he laid hold of the blade of the knife, trying to take it away from her—she held it very fast in her hand—I saw his hand flinch from the knife, and he twisted her arm round, and said, "I will lock you up as well as the child"—I said to him, "Don't hurt the poor woman; she has done nothing wrong"—no answer was made to me, and a man with me said, "Don't you interfere, Bill"—I saw the woman go away, and she was treated very cruelly by the officer—they are total strangers to me—I know nothing of them—I can declare that the prisoner never made any attempt to stab the policeman—I saw him take hold of the blade, to try and take it away.</p>

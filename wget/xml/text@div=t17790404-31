               <p>I lost my saddle about the 2d of April. The next morning I heard that a saddle had been seen at the palace-gate, and that the prisoner was sentry that night at the gate. I went and got further intelligence, and went to the lodging of the prisoner, and found the saddle on his bed.</p>

               <p>I was coming by the palace-gate; I found a saddle within a yard of the sentry; I was going to take it up, but the prisoner, who was the sentry, came and took it from me; there was a soldier ran away at the time.</p>

               <p>I was the sentry that night; a butcher's boy came and told me there was a saddle in the road; I went to pick it up, and the last witness was going to take it also; I thought I might as well have it, and get the reward, if there was any, as he. I took it up and carried it home.</p>

On the 18th of November the prisoner came before I was up; I heard him go into the work-shop, and then run down stairs. I was getting up. I went into the shop, and missed my gold watch, chain and seals, and a diamond pin. I had put them in the shop the overnight when I went to bed. As soon as I went into the shop, before I missed any thing, the prisoner told me my things were laying about the floor (he had come up again), meaning my coat and waistcoat, which hung on a chair - They did not appear to have been on the ground. I missed my watch, and asked him where it was, he said he did not know, they were not there when he came in the morning. I said I should send for an officer; he said I might if I liked. I asked him where he had been when he ran down stairs; he said, to the shop privy. I went there, and found nobody had been there for sometime. I saw some footsteps towards the door, which leads into Duck-lane; they appeared larger than the prisoner's footsteps. I told him what I had observed; he answered me very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150011"></xptr>impertinently, which made me suspect him. He was searched, but nothing found upon him.</p>

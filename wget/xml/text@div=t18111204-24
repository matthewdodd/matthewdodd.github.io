               <p>Q. Were you at that house on the 13th of November last. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You were at that time living at Mrs. Butler's house as a visitor. - A. I was, I had been to the Theatre, I returned about twelve o'clock, Mrs. Butler was gone up to bed and the two maid servants. I took a little refreshment, I said to my daughter, Betsy, get the the boot jack, she said father there is one in the kitchen. She went with the candle to get the jack, as she was passing the yard door which leads to the kitchen head, she saw the door latch move which leads into the back yard; she seeing the latch of the door move returned and says, father, there is somebody at our back door, I says you only imagine so, come, come, take a light and follow me, when I was at the landing of the stair head I saw the latch of the door move myself, I said there is somebody there, I'll soon see who it is. I took the alarm bells off and put them on the mat, two bells. I undid and took off the wooden bar, after that I unbolted the top and bottom bolt, and then immediately the door was forced open from the outside, a man presented himself at the door of course.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is that man. - A. The prisoner I suppose. I have no doubt of it. I shoved the bar against him to prevent him coming in, but he forced himself in. He came in and I went of the right hand side of him, I gave him a shove over down the kitchen stairs, down he went neck and crop, I fell down after him, I do not know who was down first, he or me, we had a scuffle at the bottom of the stairs, and I hove him over and kept him down. I then said d - n you let go me, he said you b - r what are you going to do with me, I said to beat his bloody jemmy or head, I don't know which, one of the two. I punched him with my right hand in the dark, a light came at the stair head, and he and I were at the bottom, as such I beat him prettily on both sides, by that time the watchman came, and then I discovered it was the prisoner. The watchman said let him alone, we will take care of him. No said I, I will know him again to-marrow, so I kept hammering at him until they took him away, they dragged him up stairs and said they would take him to the watch-house, I followed them. A woman met him in the street and said Jemmy my dear where is your hat. I said d - n you, if you come here, I will give you a topper.</p>

            . Q. Were you at this house of Mrs. Butler's. - A. I was on a visit there for the first time. An alarm was given that somebody was there. I made the best of my way to him, to assist him instantly, and as the prisoner came in I saw two more men apparently down the yard. I shoved the door to and put my back to it, and put my foot against the bannisters of the stairs, and bolted it before they could rush in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find them press against the door. - A. Yes. When I got the upper bolt and the bottom bolt in, I heard the rattle spring. Then all was quiet at the door, I heard no more. The watchmen came in with their lanthorns and took him in custody.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is the yard at the back of the house inclosed. - A. Yes, all round, they must have got over a gate and through a cow layer to get to the yard, and then to get over a brick wall to get into the yard.</p>
               <p>- HINCHCLIFFE. I was going one o'clock, we heard a rattle spring, the young woman said make haste my father will be killed, we were not a minute before we went into the house and secured the prisoner. There was a woman at she door when we came out, she said Jemmy where is your hat. The prisoner was without his hat, a watchman picked it up in Park Street.</p>

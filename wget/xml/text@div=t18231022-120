            . On Saturday, the 4th of October, the prisoner came into our shop, in Little St. Thomas Apostle, for a threepenny mug, and gave me a shilling - I thought it good, and gave him change. Bluison came up, and asked me, in the prisoner's presence, if it was good. I shewed it him, and he said it was bad. The prisoner ran out, but was caught a few doors off - he threw the mug down on the step of the door. I marked the shilling, and gave it to Bluison.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw the prisoner in Cox's shop - I went in when I saw him pay the shilling, and said,</p>
               <p>"Is that a good shilling?" The prosecutrix said,</p>
               <p>"I think it is," and rung it on the counter; he slipped by me, and ran out - I pursued and took him twenty yards off. I searched him, and took out 5 s. 6 d. in copper, and three good sixpences. He had four eggs, some apples, pears, biscuits, and other trifling articles. Caesar looked down close to where he stood, and found two bad shillings rolled up in paper, separate one from the other.</p>

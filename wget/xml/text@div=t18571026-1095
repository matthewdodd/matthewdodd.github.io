                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been doing busi<lb></lb>ness with the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About three months—I have sent him several cargoes of goods in that time, and bills of lading unendorsed—I do not know that he has obtained the goods which I so sent him; I did not see him—I have been paid for them by him—I sent him one endorsed bill of lading once—when I sent him the unendorsed bill of lading of this cargo of linseed, I did not at the same time draw on him for the amount, 799<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I drew the day before; I sent the bill the day before—I was not a partner with the prisoner in this cargo of linseed; I had not a joint interest with him—I know what partnership means—I had no partnership with the prisoner in this cargo of linseed, nor in another cargo which had just previ<lb></lb>ously been sent from Altona to London—I had no joint interest with him in the cargo of linseed, only when it was sold; not before—when it was sold he and I were to share the profits between us—I do not remember in how many different transactions he and I had a joint interest, to share the profits, within the last three months; I think no more than this; I do not remem<lb></lb>ber whether there were three or four, I cannot say; there were not so many as five or six; most of my transactions were sales to him—we had a joint interest in the linseed, and a cargo of barley was shipped to him—I do not remember another cargo—we had a joint interest in the cargo of barley—I had not a joint interest with him in a cargo of oats; I never shipped oats to him—I might have sent him a sample of grey oats; I do not remember—I remember mentioning in the letter a sample of a cargo of grey, about 500 quarters; that transaction was never done here; that cargo has not gone to London—I do not remember, previous to 3rd Sept, having a joint interest with him in a cargo of oats which were sent—there was not a cargo of oats, between Sept and Aug., in which I and he had a joint interest, and divided the profits; I say that positively—I do not remember how many bills I have drawn on him during the time I have done business with him; a great many—whenever I sent him a cargo of goods, and sent him the bill of lading, I did not always draw on him at the same time; I drew some<lb></lb>times afterwards; sometimes I drew at the same time, and sometimes afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You sometimes drew on him at the time you sent him the bill of lading; did you do so with this particular cargo? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say that, it was on the general account—I cannot remember how I sent it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But at the time when you sent this particular bill of lading, you then enclosed the bill of exchange on him for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not—I requested him to send me the bill immediately, as I wanted to make use of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time that bill was sent, was the prisoner, quite independent of that cargo, indebted to you or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he was, about 580<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was on what I call the general account—I had bills of him—what I mean by having a joint interest with him in the profits is this, if he had paid for the cargo, and it had been sold, and it had given a profit more than he had paid for it.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185710260145"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If he had paid for the cargo, and then sold that cargo for a price beyond what he had given, he then would have shared anything beyond that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in the profit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When would, he in the ordinary course, have any authority to sell the cargo? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When I had got my money; I mean what he owed me; that would have been a good deal, much more than 580<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he would have authority to sell the cargo just when he had paid the money he owed me—he owed me 580<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 2nd—at that time he would have had the cargo on paying the bill that was drawn on him, and the general balance he owed me—when the bill was paid, the bill of lading that I had sent to Young and M'Donald would have been delivered to the prisoner by me—it would have been returned to me by Young and M'Donald, as soon as the bill was paid—the prisoner would have had no authority at all to sell the cargo until that endorsed bill of lading which I had given to Young and M'Donald was placed in his hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not attempt to cash that bill of exchange the moment you received it at Altona? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was not discounted, I did not try to discount it; I handed it to some person for money, but I did not discount it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you explain; was the bill placed in the hands of anybody for discount as soon as you had received it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I placed it in the hands of Young and M'Donald, and they at the same time held the endorsed bill of lading—I drew the bill of exchange on the 2nd; I suppose it would become payable on the 26th, it was at twenty-one days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the object of sending him the bill of lading, if he was not to use it in any way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He owed me a good deal of money, and I must have his acceptance—I was compelled to send him the bill of lading to get an acceptance from him upon it—the bill of lading sent to Young and M'Donald was only kept; it was only a security—supposing the prisoner paid what he owed me, and for that cargo, the other bill of lading would have been sent back to me—the bill of lading was of no use at all—he was to pay me all that he owed me on the general balance, and for this cargo, before he had any bill of lading that could be of use—I have sent him bills of lading before; some unendorsed, by steamers, and he has obtained the cargo with those bills of lading—he must have obtained those goods—I knew, when I sent him this bill of lading unendorsed, that he had pre<lb></lb>viously obtained possession of cargoes by bills that I had sent to him unendorsed.</p>

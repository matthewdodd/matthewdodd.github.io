               <p>live in Lisson-street, Lisson-grove. On the 30th of May, about eleven or half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, I was going along Lisson-grove and saw the prisoner and four or five others with him—they were coming towards me—I passed them—as I came opposite to the prisoner, he took my handkerchief out of my left hand side jacket pocket—I turned round and saw it in his hand—I had nothing hut the handkerchief in my pocket—he threw it down and walked on—another one picked it up—I caught hold of the other one with my right hand, and held my left hand out to take the handkerchief from him—he threw it down in the scuffle and I picked it up—he began to knock me about with a bone which he had in his hand—three or four of them came round me, and threatened me if I did not let him go—I did let him go, but kept the handkerchief—I afterwards saw the prisoner in custody—I am quite sure he is the person that took my handkerchief—I did not know him before.</p>

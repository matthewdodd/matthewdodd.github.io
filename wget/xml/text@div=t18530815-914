                  </hi>. I am a labourer. On 20th June I was at work in Mr. Saint's brick field—I heard the prosecutor say to the prisoner, "You have got too much to say; I have worked more years than you have months"—the prisoner said, "If you tell me that again, I will knock you down with the——y kiln-iron"—the prisoner then went on with his work, and I went away with my barrow—I had not been gone half a minute before the prisoner came running up in his shirt-sleeves, inquiring for his jacket—he could not find it, and went away without it—I went round the kiln, and found the prosecutor lying down by the side of the kiln, bleeding,: and nearly black in the face—Varney went and fetched the prisoner back, and said, "See the state your brother is in"—the prisoner struck Varney—another man was sent for a surgeon.</p>

I was working in the brick field on 20th July, on a different side of the brick kiln from the prisoner and his brother—I did not hear any words between them—I saw the prisoner come quickly round the kiln, making away for home—he asked for his jacket, but could not find it—he appeared flurried and alarmed, and he was crying—I observed blood on his face, as if from the scratch of a finger—I thought he and his brother had been quarrelling—I went round the kiln, and saw the prosecutor lying insensible, and bleeding from the side of the head—I ran after the prisoner, leaving Williams with the prosecutor—I brought the prisoner back; I asked him if he was not ashamed of ill-using his brother like that, and he turned and hit me on the nose, and knocked me down—he was a little in liquor—I kept him till the constable came and took him into custody.</p>

               <p>road. On 20th July I was called to the Talbot, and saw the prosecutor sitting before the bar, half insensible—he had three wounds on the head; two on the left side, and one on the left side of the crown; and a contusion on the left cheek—I think one fall upon a number of bricks might have produced all the wounds—they were contused wounds—the one on the side of the head went to the bone; that was about an inch long; the one on the crown was longer, but very slight; the third was very slight—the deepest was a triangular wound, such as might be made by the corner of a brick—when I first saw him, I considered him in danger; that was from the insensibility; I dressed his wounds, and sent him to St. George's Hospital—I did not consider him out of danger when he was at the police court afterwards, from the concussion of the brain which he had received—I think the corner of this iron might have produced such a wound as I saw; if a man was struck with such an instrument as this, I should have expected it to fracture the skull.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, E</hi> 151). I took the prisoner into custody from Varney—I took him to the Talbot, where his brother was lying—he did not go in to see his brother—I did, and when I returned he asked me how his brother was—I told him he was lying in a very precarious state, having his wounds dressed—he said he was only sorry he had not killed the b—r—I asked him how it happened—I cannot recollect what answer he made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> We were loading our barrows, and I asked him to come and load his where I was loading mine, for I thought he could load it quicker; he asked me whether he did not know where to load his barrow, if he did not it was time for him to go home; I said, "Well, that is very likely, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>; but you are as you always are, you know everything;" he made no more to do but threatened me; I said if he hit me I would hit him again; he came up and hit me, I hit him again, and he fell and struck his head against the bricks that were lying down; it stands to reason that if I had hit him on the head with such a thing as that iron it would have knocked his brains out; it would kill a horse.</p>

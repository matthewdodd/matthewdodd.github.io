                  </hi>. I am sub-librarian of Lincoln's Inn, and as such, in conjunction with Mr. Spilsbury, the head librarian, I have the custody of the books—the members of Lincoln's Inn have access to the library; that is the rule of the Inn—others, who are not members of the Inn, but have chambers in the Inn, are also allowed to have access to the library, by benchers' orders—as a matter of courtesy a man, though not a student of Lincoln's Inn, if he has chambers near the library, has been allowed to come in and look at the books—Mr. Lamb is not a member of Lincoln's Inn, but of the Inner Temple—he has chambers at 25, Old Square, Lincoln's Inn—I believe I have on two occasions seen him in the library, as far as I can remember, but I am not always there—I am sometimes out on necessary business connected with the Inn; but the principal librarian is always there—at the end of July, last year, about the 29th, some books were missing from the library—they were five volumes of "Fisher's Digest," last edition, 1870; two volumes of "Shelford on Railways," 4th edition, 1869; "Addison on Torts," 3rd edition, 1870, a single volume; "Oke's Magis<lb></lb>terial Synopsis," 2 volumes, 10th edition, 1868; "Roscoe's Nisi Prius Evidence," 12th edition, 1870; "Chitty's Precedents and Pleadings," 3rd edition, 1868; and there were two other books, that had been missing for some weeks before that we have not accounted for—"Starkey on Libel," 3rd edition, 1869; and "Daniel's Chancery Practice," 4th edition, 1 volume—"Starkey" and "Daniel" had been missed for some week or so, and on the morning of the 29th I missed the others—most of them must have been in actual use the preceding day, became they were books that could not be</p>

               <p>possession took place before we got to his chamber; as we were proceeding there—I had reason at that time to suppose they were our books; a copy of a book was missing, and was being offered for sale; it is a very scarce book; there are very few copies in England—the conversation may have been continued at his chambers—I saw Mr. Lamb on two or three occasions between then and the time of his letter to the treasurer during August—at no time did he mention to me the name of Mr. Langbourne as the person from whom he had obtained the books—the first time I heard the name of Langbourne, in connexion with this transaction, was when the treasurer handed me Mr. Lamb's statement to read—he did not mention to me that the person from whom he received them professed to be a person living at Saltash.</p>

Sir,—I have been informed that some books have been stolen from the library of Lincoln's Inn, and I fear there is little doubt that I have been induced to become the purchaser of some of them. I have been asked to explain the circumstances under which these books came into my possession. Some months ago a gentle<lb></lb>manly-looking man called upon me and, handing me a card having upon it the name of 'Langbourne,' said that he was a solicitor giving up practice and shortly going to India. He informed me that he wished to sell his library, and among other barristers' names he mentioned that of Mr. Dixon, a gentleman with whom I am acquainted, saying that Mr. Dixon had bought some of his books, and had recommended him to call upon me. From time to time I bought books of this person, and now, nearly a month since, he called upon me again, and offered me for sale 'Gamble and Barlow's Irish Equity Index,' 'Fisher's Digest of the Common Law,' and the Equity Series of the 'Law Reports.' These books, he said, with the exception of three or four others, were all that remained of his library. I wished to purchase the 'Law Reports' and the 'Digest,' and asked him what he re<lb></lb>quired for them. He named a price, and said that as he would be in Lincoln's Inn on the following day, he would call upon me again. Next day a boy brought the 'Digest' to my chambers, and Langbourne, following soon after, told me that he would sell the work for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I said I could not afford to give so much, and requested him to take the books away, when he said he would send for them upon the following day. He also said that Mr.—(the name he mentioned I forget), he thought might purchase them, but if not he would see me again and try to come to an arrangement, as he was anxious to leave as soon as possible. The books were not sent for, but remained at my chambers for several days. In the meantime, as I was anxious to possess the 'Digest,' for the purpose of gaining a correct notion of the value of the work, I made several inquiries of booksellers as to what they considered was its proper price. Its value was estimated at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or there-about. Among the persons of whom I made these inquiries was a Mr. Turner, who owns a shop at the back of the Mansion House in the City. These inquiries were made under the following circumstances:—The first occasion upon which I spoke to Mr. Turner, or someone in his shop, upon the subject was one day, I think, at the latter end of July, when passing the shop it occurred to me to inquire the value of the work in question. I entered the shop and made my inquiry of some persons present, who said that Mr. Turner was not there, but that he should be spoken to upon the subject, when he arrived, and I was asked to call at the shop again. This I should not have done had it not happened that upon Wednesday, the 3rd of August, I met a friend in Fleet Street; he was walking into the City to get change of a cheque, and he asked me to walk with him. I did so, and in going to and returning from the Bank we passed Mr. Turner's shop, and in returning it occurred to me to inquire whether the value of the 'Digest' had been ascertained, and my friend wishing to purchase a small book called</p>

I ascertained what Mr. Turner considered to be the value of the 'Digest' and my friend being unable to obtain his book we both left the shop. This, sir, is the last time I ever entered the shop of Mr. Turner, with the exception of yesterday, notwithstanding that a person from his house pretends to recognize me as the seller of the books in question. Upon returning from the City I left my friend in Fleet Street, and went on to my cham<lb></lb>bers. According to appointment, Langbourne then called, when I told him that the book was a too expensive one for me to buy, upon which he said that he had a cab below and would take the books away with him, and I lent him a bag in which to carry them to the cab. When he was leaving, I think I mentioned to him the circumstance of my having called upon Turner, and I believe I gave him Turner's address; but upon this point I am not certain. Upon making inquiries of Mr. Turner I ascertain that he bought these books upon the 4th of August, the day after that upon which I had been at his shop, and the day after the books in question left my chambers; and he further says that the sale took place at about 1 o'clock. That I am not the person who sold to Mr. Turner the lost books, I most positively assert. That Mr. Turner is mistaken, I can prove by the evidence of a gentleman in whose company I was, upon the day in question, from half-past 11 or 12 o'clock until 3 or 4. I do not wish to suggest any motive which the purchaser of these stolen books might have in fixing upon me or any other innocent person as the individual of whom the books were bought. I will not attempt to theorize upon the subject, but will simply repeat that I am in a position to prove by one, if not two witnesses, that Mr. Turner is mistaken. Upon the 9th or 10th instant, Langbourne called upon me again, at about 12 o'clock at noon, and telling me that he had sold his 'Digest' and 'Reports' to a book<lb></lb>seller, whose name he did not mention, and obtained a good price for them, he again offered me the 'Irish Equity Index', saying he would sell it for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I at first declined, saying that the books could be of very little service to me; but afterwards I agreed to purchase them for a sovereign, but merely for the purpose of exchanging them for another, or of selling them again at a higher price. I paid him a sovereign, and he left the books. I think it was upon the same day that I ascertained of several persons in the book trade; persons whom I know, and who knew me perfectly well; that the book I had that morning purchased was of little value in England, and I then resolved to keep it by me and not to dispose of it at all. The morning after this I was in the Temple, when I was met by Mr. Nicholson, who re<lb></lb>quested to speak with me. He asked me if I bad in my possession a copy of the 'Equity Index' in question, to which I immediately replied 'Yes.' Mr. Nicholson then said that a book was missing from the library of Lin<lb></lb>coln's Inn, and I explained to him how it came into my possession, and taking him to my chambers, showed him the books. He asked permission to take these books away, which I, of course, accorded. Mr. Nicholson, after this, told me of the loss of the 'Digest,' and I made an appointment with him to meet Mr. Turner; but of this, Sir, Mr. Nicholson has doubtless told you. Since this time I have made every possible effort to discover the whereabouts of Langbourne, and I have reason to hope that these efforts will eventually lead to success. In making numerous inquiries some time has necessarily elapsed, but the necessity for making them must be my excuse, if any be needed, for the delay that has taken place. I have written,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187101090016"></xptr>
               <p>to Mr. Dixon, but without any good effect. I have written to all the solici<lb></lb>tors practising at Saltash, and from one, the Town Clerk, hare received a reply, which leads me to hope that I have discovered a clue to the person whom I seek. In reply to a letter from me, Mr. Cleverton writes, 'I strongly suspect that the person intended to be referred to by you is a Mr. T. P. Wymond, late of Shields, and theretofore of London and Meath, who has been recently here on a visit to his father.' He says, further on, 'If this young gentleman has subjected himself to a criminal prosecution, kindly write me before taking proceedings.' In my letter to Mr. Cleverton I did not mention with what object I made my enquiries. I am still in communica<lb></lb>tion with this gentleman, and am waiting: to hear from him further upon the subject. No one else at Saltash to whom I have written has given me any information. I may inform you, Sir, that upon one occasion Lang<lb></lb>bourne asked me to settle a bill of sale for him, which I did, and I have found among some waste paper which was upon my table two or three draught sheets, upon which I originally drew part of the document, and there is an entry in my fee-book at about the date when I must have drawn this deed. I have also the visiting-card, with 'Mr. Langbourne, Saltash,' engraved upon it, which he gave me the first day he called upon me. I believe, Sir, I have now told you all I know upon the subject of these books, and having done so, I will only express a hope that I may yet be able to find out the person whom I seek, and if I am successful in so doing, much light will undoubtedly be thrown upon the subject. I have the honour to remain, Sir, your obedient servant,</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>). This letter of Mr. Nicholson was enclosed in Mr. Lamb's letter, and this is the letter I wrote to Mr. Lamb—(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Nicholson's letter requested the witness to afford Mr. Lamb the informa<lb></lb>tion he required</hi>)—Mr. Lamb called on me I think the next day, the 23rd—he merely said that he had come for the information he had asked for in his letter, and I told him the date on which the books had been bought was the 4th August, and as far as I could recollect about 1 o'clock, or between 1 and 2 o'clock in the day—no one was present when he came on that occasion; but my brother came in immediately afterwards, and said something to him—I have not the slightest doubt that the prisoner is the person who sold me the books on the 4th August.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first saw the prisoner two days before he sold the books—he applied to me personally—no other person in the shop had been applied to before that—at all events they did not communicate it to me—other persons are employed in my shop besides my brother—there was no one else in the shop but myself on the first occasion, or on the second, I think—it was on the third occasion that the sale took place—my brother brought down the slip of paper on which the receipt was given—he was on the next floor, which is a gallery above the shop, so that anyone speaking in the shop could be heard above, and I asked him to bring the paper down—the prisoner said on the third occasion that he had brought the books that he had mentioned to me before, to sell to me—the price was mentioned again—he said that he would take the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that I had offered—I had determined to give 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and had told him so the previous day—I should say the whole transaction occupied about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I looked at each volume to see that the dates agreed on the title page, and he looked at what I was doing—I think he was not looking round</p>

               <p>the shop—it was at the conclusion of the transaction that ray brother brought down the paper—the receipt was written at once, the money paid, and the person left—when I saw the prisoner again after this correspondence I did not say anything to him as to whether he was the man or not—I had heard that he had denied selling the books—my brother came into the shop immediately after the prisoner had left, on the day that he came to make inquiries, and he went after him and recognized him—I told him to go into the street and see if he could see any such person—the prisoner had then just gone up Bucklersbury—he was out of sight of the shop—I did not go with my brother—this matter has been the subject of conver<lb></lb>sation between us—my brother had seen the prisoner when he gave the receipt—we gave a description of him to the detective, I think—I think it is very likely that we compared notes as to what he was like—my brother came back a very short time after he went out to see if he could recognize the man—it is not possible that I am mistaken about the man who sold the books—I did not make any entry about the time at which the sale took place, only the day of the month—I did not make any entry of the hour of the day—I may have written down the hour for the prisoner when he called—I am not sure whether I said "1" or "Between 1 and 2"—I believe I did say it was 1 o'clock—I don't think it is likely that I put down 1 o'clock exactly—I should probably hive written "1" or "Between 1 and 2"—I gave the paper to the prisoner—as far as I recollect that was what I said to the prisoner—the way in which I recollect the time is that I generally come back from luncheon about 1 o'clock, and I recollect that when I bought the books it was soon after I returned from luncheon—I don't think it could have been long after it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the brother of the last witness—I was in the shop on the 4th August, when "Fisher's Digest" and "Shelford on Railways" was brought—the prisoner is the person who brought them—I was on the first floor when he brought them in, and I came down to bring a sheet of paper and a receipt stamp—my brother asked me to do so—I came down into the shop, and saw the prisoner there—I am quite positive of that—I saw him write this receipt—I had not seen him at the shop before. (<hi rend="italic">Receipt read</hi>: "Received 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for 'Fisher's Digest' and 'Shelford on Railways,' 7 volumes; Richard Kinglake, Saltash, and 23, Old Square"—I saw the prisoner again about one or two days after he had sold the books—in con<lb></lb>sequence of something my brother said to me I went out, and went down the new street, Queen Victoria Street, and there saw the prisoner—he was the person that I had seen on 4th August, the day the receipt was given—I am certain of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should think the selling of the books lasted about five minutes—I saw the prisoner come in, and saw him leave—I should think it was about five minutes, I could not be sure—I was not up in the gallery during the greater part of the time—I was there when he came in; but I came down immediately, at least as soon as the receipt was wanted—it was not wanted until the bargain was concluded—I waited there while he wrote the receipt—he left the shop as soon as he had written it—I should think it was between 1 and 2 o'clock—I should think it was nearer 2 o'clock, if</p>

               <p>as to missing books from the library—I saw Mr. Lamb on that occasion, in the presence of Mr. Nicholson and the younger of the two Turners—Mr. Turner had just then identified Mr. Lamb, and, in my presence, he repeated his decided opinion that Mr. Lamb was the person—that was in Mr. Lamb's presence, and I then said an explanation was required—he admitted, and with apparent frankness, that the case seemed to bear a very uncomfortable complexion as regarded him, and he intimated his willingness to give all the explanation in his power.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective sergeant, of Bow Street—in conse<lb></lb>quence of a warrant, signed by Mr. Vaughan, on 16th November, I went to 38, Tollington Road, Holloway, and saw the prisoner—he came to the door—I told him that I was a detective officer, and held a warrant for his appre<lb></lb>hension, signed by J. Vaughan, Esq., the Magistrate of Bow Street—he said "What for?"—I said "For stealing some books: I will read the warrant to you"—we went into a back room—he said "Good God! what does all this mean? will you allow me to see my wife?"—I said "Yes, certainly"—we went into the front parlour, and he said to his wife "Don't be alarmed, this is an officer come to arrest me"—she said "What for?"—he said "For stealing some books"—she said "Where from?"—he said "Lincoln's Inn Library"—she said "But you never go there"—he said "Yes, I have been there on two or three occasions; I have heard about these books before, and I wrote to Mr. Walpole to-day"—and he said to me "Do you know anything</p>

               <p>about these books?"—I said "Yes; Mr. Nicholson, the librarian, found some of them at a shop, in the City"—he said "Where?"—I said "At a shop by the side of the Mansion House"—he said "Does the person say that I sold them there?"—I said "I can't say that he said it was you sold them, but he can identify the person that did sell them"—at the station he was searched, and upon him I found this letter—he said "That is a copy of the letter I wrote to Mr. Walpole—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I think it right to inform you, that since forwarding to you my explanation as to how the books stolen from Lincoln's Inn came into my possession, I have made every effort to ascertain something of the person of whom I bought them, but, unfortu<lb></lb>nately, without success. You, Sir, will perhaps not think it out of place if I afford you some information as to my private means, for the pur<lb></lb>pose of showing how improbable it would be for me, with a guilty know<lb></lb>ledge, to involve myself in such an affair as this;—although I am married, and not by any means rich, I enjoy a private income of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum; and for the last few years, from my practice at the bar, something over 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum. Besides this, I have near relations from whom, at any moment, I could readily obtain whatever I might, in reason, desire. I would ask you, Sir, also to bear in mind that, although all the information I can impart with reference to the person of whom I purchased these books is meagre, yet, whenever I disposed of a book so purchased, I invariably did so to a person to whom I was well known, and who could consequently have found me at any moment. Any questions you deem right to put to me will, I need hardly say, be answered with the greatest readiness;—nothing could be further from my wishes than that more light should not be thrown upon the subject, for of this I am convinced, that it only requires the whole truth to be discovered to entirely exonerate me, not from all censure, but from all that I now most fervently wish to be absolved from.")</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at 25, Southampton Row, and am an expert in handwriting—I have had a very large experience in that way for many years—some time ago I received from Mr. Pemberton, the solicitor of Lincoln's Inn, this receipt for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the letter addressed to Mr. Walpole, dated "30th August," and these four letters, produced by Mr. Tarn, addressed to Mr. Shee, and marked "1," "2," "3," and "4"—I have looked at them with a view to see whether they are in the same or a different handwriting, and I am of opinion, without doubt, that the receipt is in the same handwriting as these letters—the first letter that was given me was that to Mr. Walpole—that I believe to be a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> handwriting; but it is carefully written—the receipt does not appear to be carefully written, it is written in an extremely hurried manner—I identify the receipt from all the letters in combination—at first I was only shown the letter to Mr. Walpole—I believed it was in the same handwriting; but I declined to give a positive opinion unless I saw some writing that was ap<lb></lb>parently written under the same circumstances as the receipt, that is, in a hurried manner, carelessly, and not in the same set manner that the letter is; and when these other letters were put into my hands, I immediately identified the handwriting in a very short time indeed—I have not the least</p>

               <p>doubt that they are in the same handwriting—I have been engaged fifteen or sixteen years as an expert in deciphering handwriting.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. I expect to find some characters of handwriting the same, whether the writing be studied or hurried; but not all—in some respects the character will be different, and different forma<lb></lb>tions will be substituted—there might be the intention to disguise; but if hurriedly written, it would be more difficult to carry it out—the receipt is written in a large hand, and that seems to me to constitute its principal disguise, being written large, and as quickly as possible, otherwise it is the <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> handwriting; but it has been written too quickly to effect any real disguise—in testing handwriting we endeavour to find out what are the habitual characteristics of forming the letters, not taking one individual letter, but the general habit—in the "S" in the word "Saltash," in the receipt, the top stroke is completely to the right—the "S" in the word "Square," in the letter to Mr. Walpole, is a totally different formation—I do not trace anything in common between the two, one is in a set writing, and the other in the careless writing—they are of a different character, certainly; but when persons write rapidly they change the formation of the letters—I can give you a very striking instance in this letter—when persons write rapidly they substitute, in some instances, different formation of letters—the letter "S," in the word "Sir," in the letter to Mr. Walpole, also differs—the "S" in "Square," in the receipt, is formed in the same way as in "Saltash;" and that also is totally different to the "S" in the words "Sir" and "Square," in the letter to Mr. Walpole—the "D" in "Dickson," in the letter is not exactly the same as the "D" in "Digest," in the receipt—it does not differ in character, only in size; there are trifling differences, not essential ones—the "h" in "have," in the letter, is not of the same character as the "h" in "Shelford," in the receipt; the differ<lb></lb>ence arises from the scribbling manner in which it is attempted to be written; it is different in every respect in size and in character; it is of the same character as the "h" in "Saltash," especially the final portion of it; it is identical; the final part of the "h," in the letter, forms an acute angle; in the receipt it is rather more acute; the upper turning is very acute, and the lower turning very round, and that is the case in both—in writing figures persons are very often off their guard—the figure "2" in the receipt and in the letter decidedly correspond in character; one is written in a very studied, careful manner, and the other rapidly—the figure "1" is much taller than the "8" in the dating of the letter of 30th August, and so it is in the receipt; in other respects the figure is different; but that arises from the rapidity of the writing—it is totally different in formation, and you may find differences in the same document; for instance, the "0" in "1870" is different from the "0" in "30th;" one is left open at the top, and the other is finished; but the character is the same—the figure "7" in the receipt does not bear the least likeness to the "7" in "1870," in the letter—a person would make that difference if he had in his mind an intention to disguise his writing—I believe the intention was when this was written to write it so that it should not be recognized—I mean that there was an intention to disguise the handwriting—I infer that from the size of the writing, and the scribbled manner in which it is done, and those trifling variations that would occur at the time—there are symptoms of actual disguise, which you point out to me—I infer that not from having formed a judgment about this case, but from a comparison of the hand<lb></lb>writing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187101090025"></xptr>
               <p>—the difference in the form of the figure 7 is one effort at disguise, and a successful one; I assume, of course, that the writing is by the same person—I conceive that when the person wrote this receipt he intended disguise, but being written rapidly he could only disguise a letter now and then, if he had had more time to devote to it it would have been a very different production—without comparing the receipt with anything else, there is nothing on the face of it to show an effort to disguise—I have heard evidence given to the effect that the character of handwriting of itself shows whether it is natural or not, without comparing it with other writing, and I have given such evidence myself, but you cannot always do so—if the receipt was put into my hands by itself, I should say it was nothing tangible—I could form no judgment one way or the other—none of the "d's" that occur in the receipt are formed in the proper orthodox manner, that is, they are all turned over; but in the letter of 30th August they are formed in the proper orthodox manner; but when the prisoner writes rapidly, under the same circumstances as he has done in two of his letters, of 7th June and 15th July, there is not a single mistake made, as it is in the letter of 30th August, they are all turned over at the end like those in the receipt—when I say "under the same circumstances," I only judge of that from the internal character of the hand writing, that all the letters "d" there are made like the "d" in 'the receipt, and not only that, there are three different formations of the "d" in that letter, and they are all represented here; out of the four "d's" there are scarcely two alike; there are three essentially different, and all those variations are found in this letter—I will call attention particularly to the word "should," and compare it with the words "received" and neighbourhood" in the letter—there is a slight difference; the one is closed up at the top and the other not, but the general mode in which the "d" is formed is the same, and greatly dis<lb></lb>tinguished from the manner in which it is formed in the letter of 30th August—I have not studied the draft letter found on the prisoner so much—I have confined my attention to one or two of these letters that I have looked at, and that is all—the "1" in Kinglake, in the receipt, and the "1" in "reply," in this letter, are not the same character, but they might both be made by the same person—I will admit that there are a number of points that are not of the same character; there are many differences, and there always will be, but there are certain points of absolute identity to my mind, which I have not yet been able to explain; I have not said all I have to say upon it, you have interrupted me—the letter "d" in the word "Shelford" is generally represented by the "d" in the word "attended," in the letter of 15th July, and again in "finished," and in "proposed" in the letter of 7th June; they are both formed in the same manner, only the "d" in "Shelford" is written in a cramped hand, a restrained hand—I say all the three "d's" are made upon one plan, neither of them are identical; there is a considerable difference, but there is the same notion, and the same plan of formation very distinct from the other "d's"—are three distinct manners of forming one particular class of the letter in the receipt, and there are all those three manners in one of these letters—there is another formation of the "d" still more striking; the small "d" in the word "should," in the letter of 7th June, and the "d" in "Richard," in the receipt, are totally different from the other letters "d;" they are on the same plan, but they are not finished in the same manner as the letters "d" in this formal letter—they are all finished at the upper part of the</p>

               <p>letter, and none of them are so in the formal letter; that was one of the reasons why I would not give an opinion upon the examination of the formal letter alone—then the "y" in the word "reply," in the letter of 15th July, is nearly identical with the "y" in "Railways," in the receipt, and also in the word "July "at the beginning of the letter—I do not see any difference whatever—gentlemen in my profession do sometimes make mistakes—I am very cautious, I very rarely indeed make a mistake; un<lb></lb>doubtedly I have made a mistake now and then—I do not remember the case of "Vardon <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Ford," in the Probate Court; I do not remember being examined as a witness in that case—I don't remember proving a document to be forged which was afterwards admitted to probate—I don't remember that occurring in 1866; I can't undertake to say it did not happen; I have no memory of it—you must remember this, that sometimes, when I have given my opinion before a Jury, they have differed from my opinion, but another Jury has come after that, and supported me; so how am I to know whether I was right or wrong—two Juries have maintained my opinion against the decision of a first Jury—I do not remember the case of "Vardon <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Ford;" I think you must be mistaken; I can hardly think I was in that case, I don't remember either of the names, or the name of Eden, a solicitor, of Gray's Inn, who retained my services, or Dr. Wamby examining me—I assure you I do not remember any one of those circum<lb></lb>stances—I will not undertake to say that such things did not happen in 1866—you lead me to suppose it was so, because you seem to be asking me from some data, but I do not remember it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I remember the case of "Cresswell <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Jackson," in which such a thing happened—the first Jury said the documents were genuine, and my opinion was that they were forgeries; another Jury said that they were forgeries; it went through the House of Lords, and finally to a third Jury, and they said they were forgeries—there are some other similarities between the receipt and the letters which I have not yet pointed out; there is the "g" in "Digest," in the receipt, and the "g" in "again," in the letter of 30th August; they are particularly alike—then there is a very remarkable manner of making the letter "k;" you will find it in "Kinglake," in the receipt, and in "book," in the letter of 30th August—it does not matter whether the prisoner writes quickly or slowly, his cha<lb></lb>racteristic manner of making the "k" is the same; in the letter of 7th June there is a similarly formed "k" in "kindly"—in the letter "s" in "Fisher" and "railways" there is a peculiar touch, and I find the same thing in the letter of 30th August, in "barristers" and "books," in lines 12, 14, and 16 of the first page; it terminates abruptly, more like a strongly-marked comma—then there is another singularity in the "q" in "questions," in the letter of 17th August, and the "q" in "square," in the receipt—the receipt is written in a larger character than the letter, but that is not the only difference, there are a number of other differences, but notwithstand<lb></lb>ing those differences, they are written by the same person—if a person writes one thing in a hurry and others with care, there would naturally be differences—if I was shown the receipt alone, and nothing was said about it, I should sec nothing in it but a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> receipt; but when I was told it might be written under suspicious circumstances, and that the person might want to disguise his hand, then I should say, comparing it with other letters, those differences that I sec are accounted for—I have formed my</p>

               <p>opinion principally upon a comparison of the receipt with the other letters; of course the letter of 30th August somewhat supports it.</p>

I carry on business at 18, Golden Square—I am an expert, and have been so for thirty years—I have looked at this receipt, and also at the letter to Mr. Walpole, and other letters, and I have formed an opinion that they are written by one and the same hand—the letter to Mr. Walpole is written more studiously, more carefully, and would hardly bear comparison with some of the others at the first glance—some of the letters written by the prisoner differ from the letter to Mr. Walpole quite as much as from the printed receipt; I am speaking of style, not character—comparing the receipt with some of those letters, I find both style and character identical—the receipt is written much larger; but magnify one or two of the other letters, and then you see almost the same writing, without any disguise—the style of the seven-page letter is different; it is written more carefully and studiously; the receipt is more rapidly written—I did not hear Mr. Chabot's evidence; I purposely left the Court—there are about five lines in this receipt, and I have noticed sixteen remarkable characteristics; first, I will take the letter "d" in the word "Richard," and the letter "d" in "old," which follows directly—I find the same in the word "received" in this letter, and in the words "neighbour<lb></lb>hood" and "should;" the "d" in the word "received" corresponds with the "d" in the word "neighbourhood;" then there is the small "g" in "Digest" and in "Kingslake," the letter, instead of being made close together, is separated, so as to give it the appearance of "e j"—in the fourth paragraph of the letter to Mr. Walpole, in the words "originally" and "amongst," you will find the same characteristic—then the capital "R" in "Received," in the receipt, is perfectly similar to the word "Reports" in the letter, with the exception of its being written a little more apart; you will find even that the pen has caught at the bottom, exactly in the similar manner—it is formed exactly on the same principle; it has no loop, as an "R" generally has, and it comes down with a straight stroke—I notice also the connection of the letters "ol" in the word "vols." for volumes—that occurs in the word "following," in two places, and the capital "D" also, I find identical in the word "Digest"—there are three kinds of "r's" which I find throughout the documents; there is the "r" in the word "Fisher," in the receipt; that hag no head to it, it is made like an "i;" then in the word "Shelford," it has a head to it, and another in the word "square" has a top to it; and I can identify those different "r's" throughout the documents—I have marked sixteen of such characteristics as those in the small space of five lines—from those and other reasons, I am of opinion that the handwriting in the receipt and the letters is the same.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. The characteristics are the habits of the writer—style is whether the writing is upright or sloping, or whether it is written well or badly—you say a stylish writing, if it is written very<lb></lb>well, the same as you would speak of a stylish woman—the characteristics are the habits that man introduces, which he is unaware of himself, and which, when he writes, he introduces, and by which we find him out—it is the elements of handwriting, the distinguishing features which he always introduces—perhaps I speak professionally—I am a lithographer, and when a person comes to me and asks for a thing to be done in the best style, I understand what is meant—I include in that legibility, of course—in testing the handwriting of a person, I rely on the characteristics, and if on com<lb></lb>paring</p>

               <p>paring writing I don't find those characteristics, I should decidedly object to give any opinion whatever—I am able, from these five lines in the receipt, to detect enough to convince me that the letter to Mr. Walpole was written by the same person—I entertain no doubt whatever about it—the receipt is not in the same style as the letter—the one is written on the spur of the moment—I should say it was slightly feigned, because it is altered in places—it is touched up—the capital "O" is touched up; it is formed one way, and then distorted a little—it has been added to and altered—I allude to the letters "B K"—the initials on the receipt-stamp and the "O" has been added, too—it looks as if it was commenced and then altered—probably he was going to put a capital "O," and then altered it to a small one—that is what it looks like—I don't see anything else—with those two exceptions, the character of the handwriting looks like a natural hand—but for com<lb></lb>paring it with other things I should not say there was any effort to disguise—it looks like a natural handwriting, it is very slightly disguised—I should be sorry to give a strong opinion on that—I should say it would be an easy thing for a person writing in a hurry to disguise his handwriting—the more rapidly you write the loss chance there is of disguising—I have a note of the sixteen different characteristics that I have alluded to—this is it (<hi rend="italic">hand<lb></lb>ing it in</hi>)—the letter to Mr. Walpole is written more slopingly than the receipt—I don't say anything about the ciphers—I don't think that persons writing ciphers are more off their guard—I was first consulted about two months ago, before Mr. Chabot, and before the prisoner was taken into custody—I was not examined before the Magistrate—this is the first time I have given evidence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was first asked about Mr. Arthur Lamb's calling about two weeks ago—never till then—I see by the book, Mr. Arthur Lamb called on the 8th August—I should think he called about 12.30 that day—Mr. Francis Lamb generally went out to his lunch about 1 o'clock, and he was out at that time—I remember Mr. Arthur Lamb calling, about 12.30, and I remember Mr. Francis Lamb going out to his lunch shortly after—I am speaking of the 8th August now—he went out to his lunch generally about 1 o'clock—without referring to the book I can't say when Mr. Arthur Lamb called before the 4th August—he did not call between the 4th and the 8th—he called on the 1st—that was early in the morning I should think, because his name appears second on the 1st August—that is the only reason I hare—I remember that it was about 11 o'clock on the 4th that Mr. Martin called, because when I saw him and Mr. Bailey, a little while back, at the office, speaking about something, I remembered it—I mean a fort<lb></lb>night ago—Mr. Bailey and Mr. Martin were talking the matter over, and I heard them—I remembered what the time was when Mr. Francis Lamb spoke to me about it—I should not have remembered without being asked what time it was Mr. Martin called—when Mr. Lamb spoke to me about it I remembered it—that was after Mr. Martin and Mr. Bailey talked about it—it was Mr. Francis Lamb who spoke to me about it—he asked me what time it was Mr. Arthur Lamb called, and I said "To the best of my knowledge it was about 1 o'clock"—my attention had not been called from the 4th August till about a fortnight ago.</p>

I have attended to the study of handwriting as a person of skill—I have examined the receipt in question, together with the letter of 30th August, and this morning I have seen the five additional letters produced—I have also seen the draft letter to Mr. Walpole, found on the prisoner—I have examined all those documents carefully with a view to form a judgment whether the receipt was written by the prisoner, and the judgment I have arrived at is, that the receipt and the letters were written by two different persons.</p>

               <p>of Bedford Row, about two months ago; and on another occasion—I forget the name—it is some time since, in Lincoln's Inn Fields—five years since; and I once had to go to Norwich—I know Mr. Netherclift and Mr. Chabot—they are generally considered the most experienced gentlemen in that line of business, and they are looked on as such—I heard them give evidence—I saw this document on Friday last, and examined it with several letters—not all—part I saw this morning—in the first instance I examined it with the letter to Mr. Walpole, and this draft letter—I have compared the draft letter with Mr. Walpole's letter—there are slight differences, not consider<lb></lb>able, but still the character of the writing is the same.</p>

               <p>JOHN JENKINS. I am a porter to Mr. Willan, the Bull and Mouth, Bull and Mouth-street. I got acquainted with the prisoner at the Crown, in Lad-lane, I have known him about four years. Upon the 24th of January, about a quarter past two in the afternoon, I saw him at the Crown, in Lad-lane, he said he wanted to speak to me, and we went round into the back room; he said he had got some bad tokens to dispose of, with that he took two out of his pocket, and we talked a bit together; I asked him whether that was all he had, he said he had got one more, he gave me them in my hand, the three; I asked him what he asked for them, he told me I should have the three for seven shillings; I kept them some time in my hand, and I staid at the table; he put his hand in my pocket, I had some silver in my pocket, he took the silver out and spread it upon the table, thinking his tokens were there, I do not believe he meant to take the silver, the tokens were not there. I took the money up myself, and I told him he should not have the tokens at all. I came out of the Crown public house, and walked on towards Guildhall, and he with me; I was going to the Hall, and he came on to me; and nearly opposite to Guildhall coffee-house I saw two officers standing at the Justice-room door at Guildhall, and then he turned round and went back, and I after him; I catched hold of him and pulled him down, and the officers came to see what was the matter; we were both down together, and I found the tokens in one of the officers hands. I gave charge of him, and told the officer that this man wanted to pass bad money; they took him in custody, but I believe they found nothing more upon him. I gave the tokens to Porter, the officer, the three that the prisoner gave to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He was totally drunk at the time.</p>

            . I am a marshalman of the city of London; me and my partner were standing at the Justice-room door, I saw a struggle at St. Lawrence's church; we went to it, and Tickner said this man was offering bad money, and he gave me three three shilling tokens. We took them up to the Justice-room and searched, and found nothing more upon him. We asked how he came by them; he said he had them of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181202190048"></xptr>one Macdonald, he said he would be at Newgate at three o'clock. We took him to Newgate, he came to see one White. We searched Macdonald, and found four tokens in his pocket, and White was called down, and I believe two bad tokens were found upon him.</p>

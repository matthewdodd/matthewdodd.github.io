                  </hi>. I am housekeeper to General Shaw, who resides at Woolwich—the prisoner is my husband, he was butler in the same establishment—in October last year I was first ailing, I then got a little better, and then became very poorly again—about 1st November my husband brought me a glass of port wine, which he said was from the General—I went to drink it, and it was so unpleasant that I could not drink it—I said, "Oh, Chambers, you have put something in this wine"—he said, "Oh, I am sure there is not; if there is, the General has put it in"—I said, "I am sure the General would not put anything in a glass of wine that he sent down for me to drink"—he then said, "I only put a piece of bitter aloes in to set you against it"—he threw it away—next day I told him I felt very uncomfortable about the wine, and I had a great mind to speak to the General about it—he dared me to do so, he said I should know the consequences if I did—a few days after that my tea became very unpleasant, and there was a great sediment at the bottom of my tea-cup—on the morning of 8th December I made my tea as usual; I put in a grain of carbonate of soda to make it draw—I placed the teapot on the hot late by the fire while I did my work; I was in and out of the kitchen; my husband was in and out as well—there was no one else there—my husband breakfasted with me that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187802110052"></xptr>
               <p>morning—he did not have tea, he had cocoa, that was his habit—at first I partook of two cups with milk and sugar, the third cup I poured out without milk and sugar, and there was a large sediment rose to the top and went like water—the first two cups tasted very unpleasant, that attracted my attention—I put the contents of the third cup in a bottle and corked it down, and took care of it—my husband was not present when I did that—I put it in a drawer in my bedroom—a few mornings after that I found a paper containing a dingy white powder in the pocket of a waistcoat which my husband had been wearing, it was wrapped in blue paper; I took a portion of it, wrapped it up in a piece of white paper, and kept it in my pocket, and on the Thursday before Christmas I took it to a chemist and showed it to him, and afterwards my sister handed it to Dr. Robertson in my presence, and I also gave him the bottle on the Friday after Christmas, when he came to attend me—I told my husband that I knew I was suffering from this poison, and I must tell the doctor what it was—he told me to tell the doctor I had made a mistake in putting the sugar of lead into my tea in place of the soda, as the doctor would soon get me well and nobody would know anything about it—the doctor saw me in my husband's presence, and I told the doctor what my husband had told me to say—the doctor said I had had a very strong dose of poison, he could see it in my gums—he has attended me ever since, and is attending me now—I am still suffering from weakness and from my right hand; I think it will be paralysed—I had had no quarrel with my husband prior to October.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. He is a teetotaller and a Good Templar; he has never tried to persuade me to become so—I keep the carbonate of soda in a bottle in a cupboard—the sugar of lead is something like soda in its appearance, there is a different shade in it; it is a slight difference, the lead shines more—I don't keep any sugar of lead in the cupboard—my husband did not tell me that I might have made a mistake and put the powder in instead, I am sure of that; he told me to tell the doctor so—I left the bottle with Mrs. Podd, a friend, from the Thursday after Christ<lb></lb>mas till the Tuesday following, because I became so ill.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I did not keep any other bottle of that size in the cup<lb></lb>board or any packet—I never had any sugar of lead; I never heard of it till the chemist told me what it was—my sister fetched the bottle from Mrs. Podd's and handed it to Dr. Robertson.</p>

From information received I went on 3rd January to the residence of General Shaw in Wood Street, Woolwich—the prisoner opened the door to me—I asked for his wife—he took me into the kitchen, where I found her—I called the prisoner to my side and asked his wife whether it was true that she was suffering from lead poison; she said yes—I said "How long has this been going on?" —she said "On the 1st November my husband gave me a glass of wine which was sent by the General; it tasted so beastly that I could not drink it—I accused my husband of putting something in it; he at first denied having put anything in, and afterwards said that he put a little bitter aloes to set me against it"—I said "Was that the first time that you tasted anything unpleasant in anything?"—she said "Yes; but I have been poorly on and off ever since October; I also found my tea unpleasant, and I pre<lb></lb>served a portion and handed it to Dr. Robertson"—I then told the prisoner that I should charge him with administering poison with intent</p>

               <p>to do grievous bodily harm—he made no reply—on leaving the kitchen he said to his wife "Good-bye, dear; I did not mean to do you any harm"—I took him to his master in the dining-room and related the circum<lb></lb>stances to him, and the prisoner made no reply—on the way to the station he said "My wife is acting very sharply towards me, as she is getting on nicely"—on the same day I received a powder in a paper and a bottle from Dr. Robertson; he tested the powder in my presence—I kept the bottle till I handed it to the analyst, Dr. Debus.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, practising in New Road, Woolwich—on 28th December I was called to attend Mrs. Bellchambers at General Shaw's—I examined into her condition, and found that she was suffering from lead poisoning—she told me, in the prisoner's pre<lb></lb>sence, that she had taken the lead by mistake for carbonate of soda—I asked her how—she said, "In tea"—I gave some directions as to treatment—I saw her again next day, and from the symptoms I should say that she had been taking it for a long time—there was a large deposit of lead in the gums, round the edges of the teeth—the symptoms of lead poison<lb></lb>ing are very marked when it has been taken some time—paralysis is a common result of it—Mrs. Bellchambers is suffering from partial paralysis of the flexures of the right forearm—I received a powder from Mrs. Bellchambers's sister, and a bottle containing liquid—I tested the powder in the presence of Inspector Ford, and found it to be lead; I obtained a globule of metallic lead from a small portion of it, and from the smell and other things I came to the conclusion that it was acetate of lead, that is sugar of lead—Mrs. Bellchambers is still under treatment, and is likely to be so for six weeks or two months.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Sugar of lead would not necessarily produce sickness, it might do so—I have frequently given it for hemorrhage, without pro<lb></lb>ducing sickness; if given in large quantities it might cause vomiting, not dysentery, it produces constipation, not one dose, a number of doses—I asked Mrs. Bellchambers a few general questions as to her symptoms, but I told more by her face; the outward symptom of taking sugar of lead would be duskiness of the skin, and internally you would find de<lb></lb>posit on the gums, a blue line—she has duskiness now, which I attri<lb></lb>bute to the lead—the other symptoms would be colic, griping and twisting pain in the bowels and limbs, which she has.</p>

                  </hi>. I am professor of chemistry at Guy's Hospital—I re<lb></lb>ceived this bottle from Inspector Ford, it contained 2¼ oz. of a liquid which I submitted to analysis, and found 4 grains of metal in a part of the liquid—after standing for a time a sediment separated from the liquid, and a precipitate of this sediment contained nearly the entire quantity of the lead—the liquid itself contained a little lead in solution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Sugar of lead differs in appearance from carbonate of soda; it is sold in crystals, and carbonate of soda is sold in powder, and the weight is very different—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) found in the prisoner's</p>

               <p>pocket might be mistaken for carbonate of soda in this condition; if sugar of lead is kept in a warm place it would lose its wall of crystalisation and become like this in course of time—a quantity put away in a cupboard near the fire would be likely to have this appearance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. In a hot place it would take two days to produce this appearance, it depends upon the atmosphere; if the air is dry and warm, very soon, if moist and in solution it might keep for six months or a year—carbonate of soda is usually sold as a white powder, and it is whiter than this, still a mistake might be made; not looking, you might mistake one for the other.</p>

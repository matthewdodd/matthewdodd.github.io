I followed them all up Wilkes's-street; they were about one hundred yards from the prosecutor's house; when I first saw them the prisoner turned round to me and said, d - n your eyes, what are you nosing of us? I said if you have done no harm you need not be afraid of my looking at you; then he said to the man who had the bag d - n your eyes he is down! he is down! meaning as I am told that I was watching them; I went on till they came to Wood-street which leads to Spitalfields Church; the man who had the bag wanting to 20 up Wood-street, he gave the bag to the prisoner; the prisoner said to him d - n your eyes, come this way, meaning that they should go down Brown's-lane; they continued going on till they came to the corner of Red-lion-street, and then he said to the man, d - n your eyes he is down; then they went up to the market; I then said to them if it is nosing, I must know who you are; then the prisoner pulled the bag from the other man's shoulder and said d - n your eyes ding it; he threw down the bag and then they run up the street; I called out stop thief! stop thief! I cried out, d - n your eyes, I know you, and you know that I know you; I took the bag to a butcher's in the market; from thence I took it to the gentleman's at whose door I stood when I first saw the prisoner; while I was there a person came in and said the prosecutor's house had been robbed; I went next morning to Justice Wilmot and gave a description of h: men.</p>

On the 9th of April the prisoner came into the shop, and bought a body coat and pair of trousers, which came to 25s. - he gave me two sovereigns; my own coat was on the counter, with a pocket-book in the pocket - I went down into the kitchen to get change, which I came up and gave him; he then walked out with what he had bought under his arm, and my coat, with the pocket-book in it, on his back, leaving his old coat behind, which he had on when he came in; he had put mine on instead of his own while I was down stairs; I met him three weeks after, in the street, with my coat on - I turned round, and collared him; he said, "Oh, how do you do? I was going to bring your coat back;" I took charge of him - he had been frequently to my shop, offering half a crown for an old hat.</p>
               <p>THOMAS TILLMAN. I am the prosecutor's brother. I was in the shop, and saw the prisoner put the coat on, and put his own down, but did not know at the moment which coat he had on - the one he left behind was worth nothing; he went away with a blue coat on - my brother went to put his coat on, and could not find it.</p>

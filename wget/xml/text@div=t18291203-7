            . I am a scale-maker. On the night of the 28th of November I was with the prosecutor at the Crown and Shuttle, in Shoreditch, which is kept by Mr. Turner; I went in a little after nine o'clock - the prosecutor came about ten: we remained there till past twelve - he drank pretty freely; he was sober when he came in: I was not exactly sober, nor quite drunk - he went away between twelve and one o'clock; I went outside the passage, and asked if he would go to bed with me, as I thought him too drunk to go home; I lodged that night at Mr. Turner's - the prosecutor then said he would go home, as he could get in at his father's at any hour; he then went away, and I did not hear of any thing happening till Monday night. I know Cock-lane - I suppose it is five hundred yards from Mr. Turner's; the streets about there are very narrow, and I believe some of them are winding streets- I saw nothing of the prisoners, and did not notice whether the prosecutor had a watch or not.</p>

As I was going home from the Jane Shore I picked up this hat in crossing the road, as any other person might have done; I did not know how it came there - there were two or three men on the other side of the way, with great coats on, and one of them hit me in the neck - I walked on; I did not know how the hat came there - I did not pick it up with an intention of stealing, nor know the person it came from, or I should have given it to them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant of Mr. Frederick Wilkinson, of High-street, Deptford. About twelve or one o'clock on the 30th of March the prisoner knocked at my master's door, and asked if the lady of the house was at home—I said, "Yes," but she was then engaged—he gave me a letter and a basket, and asked me to take it up stairs to my mistress—I took it, and she told me to go down and see after the things—when I came down, the umbrella was gone from the hook, and the stick next to it was gently vibrating—the prisoner was at the door, waiting for the basket, and I saw the umbrella under his jacket—he went on—I watched him a few yards—he took the umbrella from under his jacket, and put it before him—I told my mistress—she told me to go after him—I did so, and a gentleman took him, while I went for a policeman.</p>

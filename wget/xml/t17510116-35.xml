            . I am wife to the prosecutor. I went out on Christmas Eve, about half an hour after 9, and before 10 my house was broke open: I was gone to a neighbour's house, the news was brought to me. I went home, and met the prisoner coming out of my gate. I took hold on her, she wanted to get away. She had got the goods under her arm, and she let them fall to the ground. [The goods were produced in court.] The lock of my door and my window were broke open. The casement was fast when I went out; I lock'd the door, and had the key in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Eliz. North. I live near to Mrs. Frances; I saw a light in her house. I went and ask'd at the door if my son was there? I was answered, it is not Mrs. Frances, it is I. Said I, who are you? Said she, I am just come from her. I knowing where Mrs. Frances was, I went to her, and ask'd her, if she had sent any body to her house? she said no. She was but about 20 yards off. I told her there was a light in her bed-chamber, so she came, and we met the prisoner with the goods mentioned, and my son and we stop'd her.</p>

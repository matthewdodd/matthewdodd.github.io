               <p>Q. Was the rope ship'd do you think, when you met Gater in the yard?</p>
               <p>Batson. I do not think it was. Mrs. Lee was weighing the rope which they had brought in, her servant and Gater were at the scale.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did the whole of it weigh?</p>
               <p>Batson. It weighed four hundred and seven pounds. Stoaker put the parcel he was bringing into the scale; that is what we call three hundred and three quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. What might that be worth?</p>
               <p>Batson. She was to give them half a crown a hundred for it, as she told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the common price, new or old?</p>
               <p>Batson. They include all in paper stuff.</p>

               <p>Q. Was all the rope your property?</p>
               <p>Batson. Some part of it was, and some of it belongs to merchants, which is laid to be the property of persons unknown.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of it was your's?</p>
               <p>Batson. About a hundred weight of it was, it was mixed; it was rope and junk nooks, thimbles, and the like, all called ship tackle. I should have given Gater the rope, if he had asked for it in the middle of the day; but I wanted to find out the bayer, for I lose near fifty pounds a year by such a pack of thieves. I should be glad to recommend the prisoners to your Lordship for mercy; I believe they are capable of serving his majesty.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it customary for your labourers to have the old ropes?</p>

               <p>Taylor. On the 27th of November, betwixt six and seven o'clock at night, a little before high water. I saw two bundles of rope lying, and a parcel in a wheelbarrow.

He said, no, and began to be very angry with me for not stopping of them. I said, there lies some in the yard, they are not gone. He went to see, and then they were gone. He came back to me, and said, I'll go and see if Ellick is gone through the tap-house. I had then got my anchor on shore. Then he and I went together to Limehouse Hole, but could not get a boat, so we walk'd up to Mrs. Lee's, and went through her house into her warehouse, where she was holding a candle to Ellick Gater, who was putting a bundle into the scale. I saw Stoaker come up out of his boat. We charged them both with taking the ship tackle out of Mr. Batson's yard, and they both owned it.</p>

            . I have known Gater seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character.</p>
               <p>Jennings. He has lodged in my house six or seven years; I never knew any dishonesty by him in all my life, he always paid me honestly; I never heard any ill of him before this, and a little affair one time before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Stoaker?</p>
               <p>Jennings. I do; he was employed as a waterman. On the 27th of November last I was at Mr. Peirce's house, where there stood Ellick, who said to Stoaker, will you go along with me. Stoaker said, if he came into no trouble he would. Ellick told him it was only to carry some old rope, his property, and he could not come into trouble for that. Then he went with him.</p>

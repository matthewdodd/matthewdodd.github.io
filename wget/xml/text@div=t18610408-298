                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, D</hi> 12.) On Saturday, 12th March, about twenty minutes past 6, I was on duty in Wellington-street, Strand, and saw the prisoner there, with a bundle at his back—I followed him into White-Hart-street, and asked what he had there—he said, "Some desks"—I asked where he got them from—he said he picked them up in the Strand—I then took him into custody—I looked in one of the desks and found an envelope there, directed to 14, Craven-street—I went down there and found the property had been stolen from there—I saw Mrs. Gresham, and took her to the police-station, where she identified the property—the prisoner was present.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived in Craven-street, Strand, at the time of the robbery, with my mother, who occupied the drawing-room floor—on the night of 12th March, I heard a noise—I got up and went into the drawing-room—I saw that the table-cover was gone from the table, and a box, and two writing-desks, and three pairs of boots were also gone—I then aroused the inmates of the house—as soon as I had done that, I heard the hall-door shut down stairs—it had struck a quarter-past 6 by the Westminster clock about three minutes after the man had left the house—I went down to the door, and soon after the policeman came to the house—he gave me informa<lb></lb>tion, and I went to the station and saw the property there—the prisoner was there at the time—this desk is my property (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there were also two pairs of the boots belonging to me, which were returned by order of the magistrate—all this property belongs to me or my sister, Kathleen—the clock had struck 6 just before I heard the noise—the noise was the door creaking on the hinge—that was the first sound I heard—it was about five minutes past 6 then—I did not see how the man had come in—he must have entered with a skeleton-key; there was no breakage, the door was left on the latch—the first noise I heard was the creaking of the drawing-room door.</p>

               <p>about in the passage—we kept a dog—I heard no one come in—the creaking of the drawing-room door was from some one going out—that was on the first floor—I am quite certain the street door was closed; I closed it myself—we did not generally leave it on the latch all night long, but we did then—I am quite certain I closed it.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of the prisoner, I was alarmed by the patrols that somebody was in the house, that was about nine, it was in the parlour, the patrols found the door open and came into the house, the door was shut about half an hour before, I fastened it with the lock myself, my parlour was about twelve yards from the door, there is another door into Fetter-lane, I do not know whether that was shut or no; when the patrols alarmed me I went out, and they were standing with the prisoner, they asked me if I knew the young man, and I said no.</p>

               <p>R. WOOLLET sworn.</p>

               <p>I am a patrol, on the 5th of January my partner and me were going our rounds, we saw the prosecutors door was not shut, and the prisoner was coming out, we asked him if he belonged to the house, he said he did not, he went in to buy a book, and it not being a booksellers shop we alarmed the people.</p>

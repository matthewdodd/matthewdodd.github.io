            . I am a painter and glazier. On the 9th of April I had some business in Rutland-place, Upper Thames-street. As I returned I saw three men and five women together by <placeName id="t18180506-12-crimeloc68">Puddle Dock</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18180506-12-crimeloc68" type="placeName" value="Puddle Dock"></interp>

I saw a respectably dressed man pass them. Two of them immediately separated from the others and followed him - They passed me on the opposite side of the way. I saw one of the prisoner turn round and beckon to the other six at Puddle Dock - They came up very near to them. I followed them on the other side of the way. When they came a little further on, I saw the prisoner, Birch, open the prosecutor's pocket with his left hand, and take the handkerchief out with his right hand-the other was covering him. I instantly crossed over, and followed Birch. I called to the gentleman, to know if he had lost any thing. At that moment one of the prisoners dropped the handkerchief on my foot; the gentleman turned round, and said he had been robbed of his handkerchief and claimed it; the others immediately joined. A scuffle ensued. I got the prisoners into a public-house, and secured them both. My coat was torn off my back before I could get an officer - I am sure Marrs was one of them. While I was getting them into a public-house the gentleman went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I do not know the gentleman's name.</p>

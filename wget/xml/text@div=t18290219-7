Bank of England note, a guinea, about 70l. in gold and silver, two promissory notes, one for 50l. and the other for 30l.; I know the number of the note, and stopped it at the Bank - about three weeks after I saw it; the prisoner was taken up soon after; I have not found the gold or silver, or promissory notes - a guinea was found, but mine had no mark on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you, on the 3d of January, know the number of the note? A. I did - I had it entered in my book, (which is not here) on the Friday night, when I wanted my money, and saw it there on Saturday night, about half-past ten o'clock, when I gave change; I missed it in about an hour - I had not seen the prisoner that day; I was busily engaged in the shop - my cash-box was in the back parlour adjoining the shop; the person must have come over the back premises.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where was the cash-box? A. In the parlour; a door from which leads into the wash-house, and then into the garden - both those doors were found open.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you married? A. Yes; my wife was sitting in the back parlour at ten o'clock, and about a quarter to eleven she went next door for some bread - I saw her go out; she returned in about ten minutes, and went into the back-parlour: my children were in bed- the servant was gone home; she does not sleep in the house: the back doors were fastened: my wife left the door leading from the parlour to the shop open - we missed the cash-box three-quarters of an hour after she returned; a person could come in at the back-door, and take the cash-box in her absence without my hearing them: the two doors were only on the latch - I had seen them latched at a quarter-past ten or a quarter to eleven o'clock; it must have been taken during the ten minutes my wife<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190009"></xptr>was absent; I was in the shop all that time, but could not see the wash-house door, as it is rather on the left-hand side - the door leading to the shop is opposite to it, and was open, but I was behind the counter, which lays back, and I might have had ten or twelve customers to attend to; I do not know where the prisoner lived at the time - the same shopman lives with me now.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you seen the cash-box after the maid-servant went away for the night? A. Yes; when my wife came in, she found both doors open; when I went into the parlour I found the doors open, and missed the box.</p>

            . I am clerk at the Secretary's office at the Bank; I know the prisoner - I remember his coming to change a 20l. note, on the 26th of January; (looking at it) this is it - it was presented for change, but not in my presence; the cashier to whom it was presented, brought the note to me, with the prisoner, and he said in the prisoner's presence, "This person has presented this note for change, and I find it is a stopped note;" the prisoner made no reply - I turned to the notices of stoppage, and found it had been stolen from Mr. Denman; I asked the prisoner if his name was William Fossett, and if he lived at No. 8, William-street Blackfriars-road - he answered in the affirmative; I then told him it was a lost note, and must be detained while we sent notice to the person who lost it, to give the loser an opportunity of invalidating, if possible, the title of the holder, and said of course he must know from whom he took a 20l. note - he said he did not; I asked how long it had been in his possession - he replied about three days; I asked in what way of business he was, and he replied not in any - I asked if he was a housekeeper - he said No, he lived with his mother, and then stated, for the first time, that the note was her's; I took him to the chief cashier's office - he repeated the statement there, and was informed that if he and his mother would come to the Bank next morning, and prove that they gave value for the note, it would be restored to them - I am quite certain he told me he lived at the address he stated.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You allowed him to go away? A. Yes; I could tell on what date the note was stopped, but my book is not here: I affix the notices against all notes that are stopped, and place the numbers on a card, which is put on each cashier's desk.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I apprehended the prisoner at a house in Lion-street, New Kent-road, on the 2d of February, and told him I wanted him for breaking open a house, or for robbing a gentleman at Camden-town; he said, "Oh, Mr. Fowler, for God's sake let me go, or I shall bring my poor mother's grey hairs with sorrow to the grave;" (I had cautioned him, in the first instance, not to say any thing unless he liked) I do not recollect his saying any thing else - I had been to No. 8, William-street, Blackfriars-road, and waited there nearly all night, on Sunday, the 1st, but he did not come home; I did not go into the house - I had heard that his mother lodged there, in the kitchen - I know she lodged there last summer; I looked through the bars of the area, and could see into the room, but he was not there. On the 2d, I disguised myself in a smock-frock, and went to Lion-street - I knocked, and asked if a woman named Tidmarsh lived there, but he was denied- I apprehended him there afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was last summer that you knew his mother lived in William-street? A. Yes - I had not been there since till the 1st of February, but have no reason to think she had left; I did not knock at the door, because if he had been there they might have told him I wanted him; I cannot swear he did not live there on the 26th.</p>

On the 5th of January, Monday, at the Secretary's office, to Mr. Stewart; my wife was out about ten minutes - I came in in about half an hour; she told me the doors were open - I went into the parlour, and found them open; the robbery must have been committed while my wife was out - my garden wall is about four feet high; it is a corner house: there is a street on the side of the garden wall.</p>

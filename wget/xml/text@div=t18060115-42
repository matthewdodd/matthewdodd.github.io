On Friday the 27th of December, about one o'clock in the day, I was sitting in my parlour which adjoins the shop, I thought I heard some noise, I immediately opened the door, and saw the prisoner with two pair of shoes in his hand, which he had taken out of the glass case; the door was open of the glass case then. The moment that he saw me he threw the shoes down and ran off; I immediately pursued him, I called out Stop thief; in about one hundred and fifty yards from my door, a gentleman that is here met the prisoner; he knocked him down, and brought him back to my shop; I sent for an officer at Worship-street; when he was brought back, I looked at the door, and missed a pair of gaiters from the door, and the crowd informed me that they were thrown into a linen draper's shop; I went and took them out myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know who throwed them there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he is the man that you saw in your shop? - A. Quite certain.</p>

             sworn. You saw the prisoner running, and Mr. Stiles following of him, crying out Stop thief? - A. Yes, he was running very fast, I held out my elbow which caused him to fall.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into Bishopsgate-street, to the sign of the Ship, to meet one or two of my shopmates that I worked with; I am a smith, finding they had been gone from there about three quarters of an hour, I made the best haste I could to overtake them, and when I was running after them in Crown-street, a gentleman stopped me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

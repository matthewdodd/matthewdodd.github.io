               <p>How soon after you saw him come out of his house with a bag, was it that your brother came and told you that there was a sheep lost? - My brother came just after, and I told my brother, I suspected the sheep, was in the bag, my brother got a search warrant, and went into the out-house to search for it, in the course of the afternoon, I found this bag, and the flesh of a sheep, (the bag produced) there were four quarters of mutton, and some stakes cut off the loin, two loins were cut together, this is the bag, the prisoner was not at home when we searched; I found the skin directly behind his house, in a meadow of a Mr. Jones's premises, which the prisoner lived in, about a hundred yards from the prisoner's house or not so much, (the skin produced, marked G.

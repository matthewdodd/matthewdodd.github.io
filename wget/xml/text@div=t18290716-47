            . I keep a ladies' boarding-school at Chelsea. The prisoner has been about six months in my service, and conducted herself to my satisfaction; she had the liberty of going to my drawers and to all the plate - she was perfectly honest, and I had a good character from a lady whom she had left, merely on account of illness; my servants quarrelled, and that was the reason why I parted with Shaw - I sent her out of my house that very day; I have no doubt of the prisoner's honesty, and would take her back to-night.</p>

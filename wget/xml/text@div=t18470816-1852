                  </hi> I am a surgeon, living in Great Percy-street, Clerkenwell. On the 3rd of Nov., 1844, between one and three o'clock in the morning, I was called to a house in Constitution-row, Gray's Inn-road, and found there a person, who I afterwards found to be Henry Williams—he was in an insensible state—one of his eyes were swollen—it had a small wound over it, under the eyebrow, within the orbit of the eye, at the corner—the direction of the wound was upwards and backwards.</p>

                  </hi> I practice as a physician.

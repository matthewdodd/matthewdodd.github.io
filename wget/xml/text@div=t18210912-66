I had missed shoes before, and watched him, and detected him with a pair in his pocket; he said he was very sorry. He had only lived a fortnight with me. They were not wrapped in paper, they were sale shoes. I gave him no order to take any out. I had a good character with him. I gave him in charge, he lived with his friends.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ballast-getter. I knew the deceased, Thomas Connor, he was also a ballast-getter—on the 5th of June he was at the Ballast-office, in Narrow-street, Ratcliff—he was very nearly drunk, and not in a fit state to go to work—I was in the street—we went down a passage leading from the street to the water-side, and when half-way down the passage he was told he was too late—we returned back—I and a per<lb></lb>son named Power were joking together, and in passing by, I tapped Connor at the back of his neck with a cinder—he turned round and asked what I did that for—I begged his pardon, and said I did not do it designedly—he said I ought to mind where I threw things—he stood for a minute, then turned round to the prisoner and uttered some words; I could not understand what they were, but the last word he said was "Peter"—the prisoner was standing opposite to me, with his two hands in his pockets—as soon as the words were spoken, he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his fists and struck Connor under the left ear—he fell to the ground, with his head on the stones close to my feet—his head turned to the right side, and blood flowed from his ear—he was carried to Mr. Buchanan's, the doctor's, at the corner of Ratcliff-cross, Ratcliff-highway—I saw no more of him till I saw him at the inquest, at the London Hospital—I then saw his dead body—I do not know whether he and the prisoner were acquainted before—Connor did not attempt to strike the prisoner before he struck this blow—I could not tell whether the language Connor used to the prisoner was abusive or not, for I had ray head turned the wrong way—Connor's head came against the ground first when he fell—he fell on the back part of his head—"Peter" is a nickname of the prisoner's—he is offended at it—he has often got upbraided with that name at public-houses.</p>

               <p>at Power when I heard the word "Peter," and when I turned round again, I saw the prisoner strike him—Burgess and Smith, ballast-heavers, were there also—Power was not so near as me—I swear the prisoner was not the worse for liquor—he might have had two or three pints of beer, but that would not make him tipsy—Connor was not a friend of mine parti<lb></lb>cularly—I was a mate of his for two years, in the same craft—the prisoner had worked with us five or six months—I never had any quarrel with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ballast-heaver. On the 5th of June, I was standing at Ratcliff-cross, and saw Connor going down the ballast-office passage—I saw a cinder strike him in the head as he was going down—I did not see who threw it—the prisoner was standing outside with his back to the wall—he said, "Connor, come out"—some other words passed between them which I did not hear—I saw Connor turn his head round to<lb></lb>wards the prisoner—the prisoner stepped out from the wall, and hit him with his right-hand on the left ear—I did not see Connor strike at the prisoner before the prisoner struck him—Connor fell down, and when he was lying down, the prisoner walked towards where he was lying, changed colour and shed tears, and said he was very sorry for it—I saw no other blow than I have mentioned—Connor appeared in liquor—I did not suppose he was angry when he went up to the prisoner—when he fell his head went on one of the paving stones of the street—he was carried to the doctor's shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I attend at the London hospital—the deceased was brought there on Saturday, the 5th of June—he was in a state of insensibility—I examined his head, and found a quantity of blood flowing from his ear—I found no mark of any blow outside—he was in the hospital till the 13th of June, and then died—he continued insensi<lb></lb>ble the whole time—I afterwards examined his body—his skull was frac<lb></lb>tured, and the brain torn considerably—there was a quantity of blood in the base of the brain—before I opened the head, I examined to see if there were any external marks—I attribute the immediate cause of his death to pressure on the brain from the blood—the appearances I saw might un<lb></lb>doubtedly have been occasioned by a blow or fall—it was the lower part of the skull that was fractured, behind the ear—it would very likely be occasioned by the head coming in contact with a stone—I should think it almost impossible it could have been caused by a blow from a man's fist—it was no doubt a recent injury—I do not remember seeing the wit<lb></lb>ness Hagerty at the hospital—I saw him before the Coroner when Con<lb></lb>nor's body was there—it was the same body I had examined.</p>

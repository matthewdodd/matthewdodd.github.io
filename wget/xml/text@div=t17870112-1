Gentlemen, it is certain that there were the names of three persons on this paper, how she got these names, or where she got them I cannot possibly give you in evidence, but the fact was, three names were produced, but how they were produced we do not know; having possessed herself of the warrant of attorney, and having been to Mr. Langdale, it was perfectly easy for her to transfer this stock; Mr. Langdale could not have any suspicion of a young woman that came to him in the name of a gentleman whom he knew very well, and the two chairmen could suspect nothing. Gentlemen, as to the law upon the subject, it is perfectly clear, a person forging the name of another, to defraud a third person is an offence, and an offence of a very high nature indeed; in this case the Bank have been defrauded, they are answerable and have made good the loss to Mr. Winterbourne, whose name has been forged. Gentlemen, the Bank in this case, think it their duty, though as men, they lament their situation, for it is a painful one, to bring a young woman to be tried at this bar for so high an offence; but it is a duty they owe themselves, a duty they owe the public, and also to every one of you, to put a stop if possible to these kind of practices; the property that you have acquired, you have placed in the hands of men from whom you expect to receive it; your earnings which you have placed there you expect to leave to your children; it is therefore incumbent on the Bank to protect that property, and to bring every criminal of this kind before you: This scheme seems to have been calculated more artfully, than one would expect from such a young woman; but Gentleman, the facts are, I am afraid, too plain; for it will be given in evidence to you, that she went to the Bank in the character and name of

            , and demanded to act under that power of attorney as such, and in that character received the money. Gentlemen, I say, if the crime is too plain and too pointed, it is incumbent on you to discharge your duty, which though a painful one, you will be forced to do, namely, to pronounce that young woman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701120006"></xptr>guilty of that high crime of forgery, for which she must answer with her life.

               <p>You are a broker? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you know that unhappy young woman at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where did you first see her? - It was about the 12th of December that she came to me at the Stock-Exchange, in company with another person, an old woman whose name I have since understood is Mears, and asked me if my name was Langdale; I told her, yes; she produced a piece of paper, with the name wrote upon it; she likewise asked me if I did not do business for Mr. Good, of Queen-Ann-street, East; I told her, I did; she said, she wanted a power of attorney to sell 100 l. three per cent. for her father who was in the country; I asked her name, she said Winterbourne; that Mr. Good was her father's intimate friend, and that he had recommended her to me; that her father, William Winterbourne, of Cannon-street, sawyer, for that was his name and description, as she mentioned Ratcliffe-highway, had run a nail into his foot, and was at Clapham for his health, and could not come; and that her father had wrote her a letter, desiring her to take out a letter of attorney to sell out 100 l. part of his three per cents, and for her to be the attorney; this I think was the 12th of December, or thereabouts; it happened to be about two o'clock; I asked her which three per cents; she said, she did not recollect, for she had left her father's letter at home; I told her, if it was the three per cent. consolidated nothing could be done for a month, that she might go away for that day; and she returned the next day, and said it was the three per cent. reduced annuities; the books of that stock were open; I wrote the instructions, and carried them to the clerk; the description agreed, the Christian name, the sirname, the place of abode, and the profession, according to the books; I left her in a corner of the office with the proper clerk to make out the power, which he did; she said, she would go over to Clapham that afternoon, and get the power executed, and bring it the next day; the next day she brought it, and left it with the proper clerk in the office; I looked at it, and upon inspection it appeared to me to have all the necessary parts; it was left; the next day she came according to my desire, and said, if the power was passed she would do the business; that was on the 15th; when she came the next day, seeing her, I went and asked whether the power was passed; he said, it was; accordingly as I could have no suspicion of the business, and all was regular, I sold the stock, and paid her the money; this was on the 15th; I paid her 73 l. 12 s. 6 d. nett, in three 20 l. notes, and the rest in cash; I always take a memorandum of the number of those bank notes; she went away, and I believe she said, she was going to Clapham; I think there was a young woman with her when she went to Clapham; she was then dressed in a very plain decent manner; on the 20th she made application to me again to transact some business of the same sort; but I cannot say I recollected her immediately on her coming, she had metamorphosed herself so much; I did not know her till she told me her name.</p>
               <p>In what rank of life might you have supposed her to have been in the first time? - As the daughter of a sawyer, a man in trade; the next time she was dressed like a lady; she told me her name was Winterbourne; I looked at her and discovered it was the same; she then said her father wanted to sell another 150 l. reduced annuities, and desired I would take out another<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701120007"></xptr>power of attorney; accordingly I gave the necessary directions to the clerk as before; but having been struck with this alteration in her garb, I recollected that Mr. Simpson had done business for this person before; on inspecting the books to see whether the account was right, therefore I applied to Mr. Simpson, and in consequence of something that he said, Mr. Winterbourne attended on a subsequent day, when she was in the accomptant room; on the 22d, when she came to bring the second power of attorney, she was asked whether her name was

               <p>Mr. Fielding. When the girl recovered so as in your opinion to have her intelligence about her, did he say who she was? - I continued in the room but a short time with her; I left her in that situation in the accomptant's room.</p>
               <p>Had any thing more been said in her presence and hearing by Winterbourne who she was? - I do not recollect there was; the next day I saw her in the Bank parlour at the examination.</p>
               <p>Who were present at the examination, was Winterbourne there? - During part of the examination; I do not recollect whether he was there the whole time; I believe not.</p>

               <p>What was said to the girl when she was in her senses? - It was during the time of her fainting away.</p>

               <p>Is that exactly in the state as when you first received it? - Exactly in the state as when I received it; there is no alteration that I can perceive, nor no erasure; there is no other addition made on the face of the power, except the bank notes.</p>
               <p>Has there been any alteration in the name by which it is executed? - None at all that I can perceive.</p>

               <p>Was that in the hearing of the young woman? - Yes, I told her I could write a very indifferent hand, and she brought a piece of paper, and a pen, and ink, and I wrote about five letters of my Christian name, and she said that would not do.</p>
               <p>What passed then? - She said she wished I knew of any body that could write a good hand; I hesitated a minute, and I recollected my partner Devenish, and I told her so; she wished I would go and fetch him, and I did; and there was a pen and ink, and she desired him to write, that she might see how he wrote; and he did so, he wrote once or twice, and she said she thought it would do, only she mentioned one word, she said she wished it to be fuller at the top; then he wrote that word again; then she desired him to write the name upon another piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Who produced that other paper? - She had the paper there, then he wrote a name upon that other paper, but what name I cannot say, I did not take any particular notice.</p>

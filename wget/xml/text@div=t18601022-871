I live at 15, Hill-street, Finsbury, with my father—On Saturday afternoon, 29th September, I was in Basinghall-street—I found a crowd there listening to a man who was playing some music—when I was leaving the crowd I found I could not easily get away—I. felt; my watch-guard pulled; I looked down and distinctly saw ray watch in the prisoner's hand—I put down my hand to take it out of his hand—he had got the case off, dropped it on the ground, and ran away—he was stopped by a butcher—he ran through Mason's-avenue, a court from Basinghall-street into Coleman-street—I picked up the watch-case.</p>

I live at 11, Gold-square, Minories, and am an artist's assistant—On the afternoon of 29th September, I was in Basinghall-street, drawing a truck—I saw a crowd—the prisoner was in front of the handle of my cart and pretending to push out of my way, and he laid hold of the guard with the left hand, and the prosecutor's watch with his right hand—when he saw the prosecutor looking down he made a slight tug at it and ran away—the case fell on the pavement—I went after him; he was stopped by a butcher before I got to him.</p>

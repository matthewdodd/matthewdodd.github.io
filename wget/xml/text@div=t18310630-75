            . I am a City-officer. I was in Houndsditch, and saw the prisoner with two boys; they all three turned up Bishopsgate church-yard after Mr. Turner and a gentleman; the two boys walked first and Sheen behind them - nearly opposite the church-yard they made a stop, and some man that was going on before them ran forward; I went to catch hold of Sheen and the other - Sampson, who was taken, stopped; he did not run; I saw Sheen throw the handkerchief away as he ran: it was produced, and Mr. Leach claimed it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been to Limehouse to look for work - there was a cry of Stop thief! several boys ran round the corner; the gentleman laid hold of me, and accused me of throwing down the handkerchief; I know nothing of it.</p>

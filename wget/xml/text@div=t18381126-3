I know the pro<lb></lb>secutor's watch—it was silver, and had the hand and glass broken—I re<lb></lb>member the prosecutor going on shore at Portsmouth—I afterwards saw his watch in the prisoner's hand in the Commercial-road—I asked him to let me look at it—he said, "No, there is nothing more to be seen in my watch than in any other"—one night he and I went together to the theatre, and he left the watch with a girl for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I know the prisoner. I remember his taking me to the Ship Tavern, at Limehouse—I saw John there—the prisoner taxed him, in my presence, with having charged him with stealing a watch—John said, he knew nothing at all about it, and he said he had done it—I mean that he had made the charge—the prisoner told him about the watch, and he said he did not know the apprentice had lost a watch—John said he had done it—he was addressing us—he said, "I have done it"—I have known the prisoner about eighteen months—I knew him before he went the voyage in the ship John went in—he had a silver watch.</p>

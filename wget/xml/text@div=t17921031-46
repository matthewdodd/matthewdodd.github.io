               <p>I am a servant to the prosecutor Mortimer; I saw the lead some days before; the 14th of October I went to the barn to bind a load of hay, the doors of the barn were broke open, and I observed about half the gutter was cut off and laid on the mow, none of it was taken away; while I was on the hay, I heard a rustling between the wall and the hay, and I saw the prisoner in the barn; I asked him what he did there, and he said he did not know; I got down from the mow immediately, and he broke a hole through the barn; the door was locked, but a plank was broke off it; he ran away; he was taken in Hampstead road; I saw the lead fitted.</p>

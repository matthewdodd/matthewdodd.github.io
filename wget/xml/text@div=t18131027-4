               <p>Q. What age is she - A. I believe she is thirteen years of age. They had lived with us five weeks before this happened. Their apartment joined my bed room up two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the mother - A. A widow. I did not know any thing of them until they came to lodge with me. On Saturday the 16th of October I missed a sheet from out of my drawer in my bed room; that drawer was not kept locked. I missed two shifts at the same time, a black and white silk handkerchief, and a gold broach. I had seen them in the drawer the Monday before.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the mother - A. The mother worked at home at straw bonnets, and the girl worked out at sattin stitch work.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not keep your room door locked, did you - A. No, nor the drawers. On the Monday following the Saturday I went round to the pawnbroker's. I found my sheet pawned at Mrs. Crouch's, in Paul-street, Finsbury-square. I have found nothing else. The prisoner was taken up as soon as I found the sheet.</p>

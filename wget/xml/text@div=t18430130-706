                  </hi>. I live in High-street, St. Giles, and am an ironmonger, This vice is mine—I lost it on the 7th of Jan.—it had been by the side of another vice in my shop—Ashley used to come to my shop at times with his father—I received information from my servant, Brown, and went to a house in Nottingham-court, Short's-gardens—I found Beer there—I was given to understand by the landlord that it was Ashley's father's premises—Ashley's father was not there, but Beer was in the act of taking away the vice from under the stairs in the cellar—I asked what he was doing with the vice—he said Ashley had sent him to take it away, and to meet him at the corner of Long<lb></lb>acre—I gave Beer in charge—I had missed the vice a few minutes before.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the weight of this vice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say about three quarters of a hundredweight—it is rather heavy—I did not hear Ashley mention at all when the vice was found—I should say a boy like Ashley could carry such a vice as this—I have seen it done—I have seen him come almost every other morning with his father—the vice was found about five minutes' walk from my place.</p>

               <p>—I went to his father's shop to look after the vice—I was there a few minutes before Beer came—I did not see him come in—it is a corner house—he came it at the side door—we did not hide ourselves—after we had searched the front shop, we found Beer taking out the vice, lifting it on his shoulder—the passage was very narrow, and I was before the policeman—he was to meet Ashley at the corner of Cross-lane and Long-acre—neither of us went to see if Ashley was waiting there.</p>

Yes—I went first by myself, but did not go into the house—I left a female servant at the corner of the house to see that they did not take it away—I then went to the station, and came with a policeman in about ten minutes—it was the second time that I saw Beer—I never saw Ashley there at all—Beer came in I suppose while we were there the second time—it is a very dark place—I do not know whether he was there when we went into the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's service. I was in the street on Saturday morning, the 7th of January—I saw Ashley with the vice on his shoulder, about nine or ten o'clock, in Bowl-yard, going towards Belton-street, which leads into Nottingham-court—I know it was my master's vice—I went and told my master.</p>

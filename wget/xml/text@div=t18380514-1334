                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. John Jackson, of Knightsbridge<lb></lb>terrace. On the 12th of May I saw the prisoner lurking about the door for some time—I observed a hand round the corner of the door—it took a shirt which was hanging on the door inside—I then saw the prisoner put the shirt into a handkerchief, and go by the door with it—he crossed the road, and put it into his hat—I followed him to Hyde-park—when he saw a policeman he ran, and I ran after him with the officer—he took the shirt from his hat, and put it under a tree—I saw him stopped, and saw the bundle picked up—the shirt was in it, and our shop ticket is on it.</p>

I reside in Stanstead Lane, Sydenham, and am an accountant—I remember the morning when this took place—I saw the prosecutor pass my house, and then the prisoners, about 7.45 in the morning—I was in my garden—I heard a noise and went to my gate—I then saw nine men violently assault Cheasman—one struck him in the eye, another threw him down with great violence—his head struck the kerb—they seemed to be round him—Holmes was punching him while he was on the ground—I also saw him put his hand into the prosecutor's breast pocket, and snatch something away—I called out, "Don't murder the man!"—I went up to them as soon as I could get my gate open—they said the man had a knife, and had threatened them with it—I asked him if he had a knife, and he said he had not—they did not do anything to me—I am positive the six prisoners were there on that occasion—Holmes threa<lb></lb>tened me, but he did not do anything to me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">a prisoner.</hi>) I was formerly in the perfumery line—in Sept. I had no particular way of getting my living—I have seen William Watts at Mr. Newhouse's, a publisher, in Maiden-lane, Covent-garden—I did not know he was in the service of Messrs. Longman—I had seen George there—I did not know his name, or that he was the brother of William—on the 15th Sept., as I was passing the obelisk in Farringdon-street, George spoke to me—he said, "Good morning, will you <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> a pint of porter?"—I said, "I had no money"—he said, "Have you nothing to do?"—I said, "No"—he said, "Could you use a few books?"—I said, "I can't myself, I know a person who very likely would buy them"—I said, "Where do you live?"—he said, "In Poppin's-court, next door to the green-grocer's"—I said, "I will call on you to-morrow morning, at ten o'clock"—I then went to a person named Saunders, in Wellington-place—on the 22nd Sept. I saw William Watts at Mr. Smalcomb's, in London-house-yard, St. Paul's Church-yard—he asked me to meet him at the Ship, in Little Bridge-street, at one o'clock—met William again that day on Ludgate-hill—he was on the opposite side of the way—he whistled—I went over to him—in consequence of what he said, I went the next morning to the Blue Last to meet him—when I got there William was not there, but George was sitting in front of the bar—I had seen</p>

               <p>nothing of him on that or the previous day, to lead me to suppose that he was coming to the Blue Last—he asked me to come into the tap-room—when we got in, he produced five books—he did not make any observation—I said I would take them to my friend, and asked him where I should see him to give him the money for them—while I was talking to him, William came in—he said, in George's presence, "Have you got the books?"—I said, "Yes, it is all right"—I showed them to William—there was no publishing price on three of them, so I asked him the price—he said I must inquire the price, I could easily ascertain it—I had had no directions from them at to the price I was to sell them—I appointed to meet William at twelve o'clock the same day, at the Blue Last, to give him the money—I left them—I went to the West End with the books to get the money—they were all new books—as I was going along I was taken into custody—the officer took them from me.</p>

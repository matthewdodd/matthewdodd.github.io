               <p>Q. Was there no other person in the warehouse at that time? - A. No: Lilly was trying to get over the paling; I told him it was of no use; Mr. Prior's men came in, and then we secured them both; the constable came in, and then I went to the gate and took the key out of the lock which was inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoners say any thing? - A. They said they only came there to hide themselves; they thought the drum-major was coming.</p>

               <p>Q. What was deposited in that warehouse? - A. All glue entirely; Mr. May went to the other warehouse; I kept them in that warehouse till the constable came; I asked them what they came there for; they said to practise; I said I never knew drummers to practise without their drums; I told them they should not pass me till the constable came.</p>

               <p>Q. Did your master keep glue in a bag? - A. No; the prisoners denied knowing any thing about the glue; we delivered the bag with the glue in it to the constable.</p>

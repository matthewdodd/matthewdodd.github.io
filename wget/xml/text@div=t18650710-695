                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, and keep the Cock at Hounsfield—on 7th Jane, the prisoner and another man came into my place and asked for two <hi rend="italic">twos</hi> of gin, and they walked up into my parlour—they were there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—they then came down into the bar, and asked me if I had a skittle ground—I said I had not—they asked me if I had got a garden—I said I had—they asked me to draw them a pot of ale, and they would go into the garden, as they wanted to kill an hour or two—these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my property—I last saw them safe about 10 o'clock on the 7th—the prisoner came about 3, as near as I can say.</p>

I am servant to the last witness—on 7th June, I showed the prisoner and his companion into the garden—about 4 in the afternoon I went up stairs into one of the bedrooms—I observed the valance of the bed moved at the bottom—I lifted it up and saw a man's legs—I lifted it higher up, and saw the prisoner underneath the bed lying on his back—I can swear to him—I went down stairs to give the alarm—the ostler came up with me—I drew up the valance again, and the prisoner was not there—there were three drawers open, and I noticed a footmark on the table—I next saw the prisoner at the station—he could not have gone down stairs without my observing him.</p>

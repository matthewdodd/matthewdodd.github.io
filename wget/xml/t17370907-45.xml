About the 27 of July, the Prisoner asked me to carry a parcel of broken China, and a bundle of Clouts into Broad St. Giles's, I carry'd them there, but I never saw them open'd, 'till my Master and I went together to ask for them. One of the Bundles prov'd to be Sheets, and at the same time the People of the House produced 5 Bundles more, which the Prisoner had left with them. I carry'd the Candlestick, and the Shovel and Tongs to the same Place for her. The Things were my Master's, Mr. Harris's.</p>

I told her I had not much Room in my House, but I would put them in a Neighbour's Lodging for her. One Parcel was broken China (which she said were her Perquisites ) and there were 2 Bundles of other Things. Three Parcels came afterwards, in Elizabeth Morgan's Name.

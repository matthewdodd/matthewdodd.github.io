                  </hi>. I live at Penge, in Surrey, and am in the service of Messrs. Leaf and Co., No. 39, Old Change—I knew the defendants carry<lb></lb>ing on business as wine merchants—in 1857 Terence McClean called on me—he wanted me to lend him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he had an opportunity of pur<lb></lb>chasing some wine—I agreed to lend him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I shortly afterwards gave him a cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he gave me a "We O U" signed by James McClean and himself, dated 6th June. On 10th or 12th June he called again, and requested a further loan of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I took a cheque to their place of business in Skinner Street for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave it to James McClean, and he gave me this memorandum, "We O U, Mr. Bigg, one hun<lb></lb>dred and fifty pounds sterling. J. &amp; T. C. McClean"—in the following October, towards the latter end of the month, I applied for my money to James McClean, and he wrote me a letter to say that his brother was out of town—this is the letter—it is in the handwriting of James McClean (<hi rend="italic">read:</hi>) "Skinner-street, Nov. 6, 1857. Dear Bigg: I cannot at present appoint a day to let you have the needful, as my brother is not at home yet. I expect him on Monday, when I will write to you, but I fear we will not be able to let you have it till very near Christmas, as he has been buying largely in Dublin, not expecting you would require payment for some time yet With kind regards to Mrs. Bigg, believe me yours truly, J. McClean."—In a few days afterwards Terence called upon me—he said he could not let me have the money at present, but he would in three or four weeks' time—I re<lb></lb>quested him to give me a bill of acceptance for the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on the 21st November he brought me this bill accepted, dated 18th Nov. 1857—it is drawn by Samuel Bowles Bigg, and accepted by J. and T. McClean, for payment of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. one month after date—it became due in December—on the Sunday previous to the bill becoming due James McClean called on me and told me that they should be unable to meet this bill, and proposed to give me three other bills for the amount, and the security of his mother-in-law, Mrs. Ann Southgate, for the payment—I agreed to that, and on the follow<lb></lb>ing day Terence came and brought me three bills at one, two, and three months, for 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—these are the bills dated the 21st December, 1857, and accepted by them—in addition to these he brought me a promis<lb></lb>sory note from Mrs. Ann Southgate—this is it (<hi rend="italic">read:</hi>) "21st Dec. 1857. Six months after date I promise to pay to Mr. Bigg 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Ann Southgate."—I believe the body of it is James McClean's writing—the note is drawn at six months, and Terence McClean said it was drawn at a long date for this rea<lb></lb>son, that Mrs. Southgate was very fidgetty in money matters, and she did not like to accept a bill unless she was sure to be provided with the means of payment, and in order to that she had to give notice to her trustees—he requested that I should give him a letter to Mrs. Southgate before I received that note, as a collateral security for the payment of the three bills, and I did so—I wrote it at the time, and gave it to Terence McClean.</p>

Dear Madam,—I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your note of hand for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated this day, as collateral security for the due payment of three bills of exchange, accepted by J. &amp; T.

               <p>and three months.—Obediently yours, S. B. Bigg.—To Mrs. Ann Southgate." After receiving the three bills and the promissory note, I returned to Terence McClean the acceptance for the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the first of the bills would be due in January, 1858; and about the 21st January I received this letter, signed J. &amp;. T. C. McClean—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) "To S. B. Bigg, Esq. Dear Sir,—Finding that we cannot pay our acceptance due on the 24th inst., may we request that you will use the enclosed, if necessary, to pay the amount? Let us know the expenses, and we will hand it to you. We date this at three months, and trust we will be able to take up all the bills when they fall due, as we are happy to inform you, and know you will be glad to hear it, that we pretty well see our way, having got over the difficulty of which we told you. "The letter enclosed a bill for 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for three months—I returned that acceptance—the other bills were presented, and not met—James McClean called on me some time before they became bankrupts, and told me they should be obliged to suspend payment—he told me that I should ultimately get my money, and I received a letter from him after that, expressing a hope that I should not oppose him in the Bankruptcy Court—I have lost that letter—the prisoners became bankrupts about February 4th—I did not oppose them—the promissory note became due in June—it was not presented in consequence of my hearing that Mrs. Southgate was away from London—on 17th June I received this letter which is the writing of James McClean—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) "Elberie, Normandy, 15th June, 1858. Dear Sir,—I regret to in<lb></lb>form you that it will not be in our power to pay your bill due the latter end of this month, and I think it better to let you know so now, so that you will not be disappointed at the last moment. It is with much reluctance I make this communication to you, after having told you at the time we got your money that there would be no disappointment in the payment, of it; but things having turned out since then so contrary to our expectation, there is no alternative left me. In trying to ward off the evil day we unfortunately have involved Mrs. Southgate to a very large amount,—indeed, far beyond her present means of payment; so that she will be compelled to remain on the Continent for some time, to enable her to pay a composition of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound, which two out of the three creditors whom she guaranteed for us have consented to take, giving two years to pay it. The other creditor would not give the time; so she is compelled to set him at defiance, and I expect he will soon be glad to come to the same arrangement as the others. We did not wish I her to bring you under this agreement, as we hope to be able to pay you in full ourselves, now that we have secured our business and commission without the assistance of our many pretended friends. We have certainly proved the old adage that a friend in need is a friend indeed. When you have got whatever small dividend there will be from the Bankruptcy Court, my brother will see you, and I hope will be able to make soon arrangements with you as will be satisfactory for the payment of the balance of your claim. I will send this letter to Old Change, so that you need not make the contents known to your friends, unless you think it necessary; as the fewer people know of such matters the better. Hoping Mrs. Bigg and yourself are quite well, I remain, Dear Sir, Yours truly, James McClean. "To S. B. Bigg, Esq., at Messrs. Leaf &amp; Sons, Old Change, London, England." After this I instructed my solicitor to take proceedings against Mrs. South-gate to recover the amount of my promissory note—that was in June or July—about the middle of September Terence McClean called on me—he said he had come to make some proposition with reference to this promissory note for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he proposed to give me bills payable every three months</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185906130050"></xptr>

B. Bigg, Esq. Dear Sir,—Having nothing to add to what passed yesterday, I deem it useless to take up your time. I expect my brother will wait on yourself and Mr. Dignum to-morrow or next day. I am, yours respectfully, T. C. McClean. Sep<lb></lb>tember 21st." I told Mr. Dignum, my solicitor, and left the matter in his hands.</p>

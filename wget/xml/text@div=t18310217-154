            . I have known the prisoner about five weeks; he has been in the habit of coming backwards and forwards to me - we had lived together; he gave me eight dollars to get changed, and two he had given me before; I changed them at Mr. Cushway's, at the Royal Sovereign, and took two and 2s. to the Angel, to get half a sovereign for them, and two I took to a pawnbroker's in Ratcliff-highway, but I do not know the name - the prisoner told me he wanted the half-sovereign; I got it, and gave it him on last Friday fortnight.</p>

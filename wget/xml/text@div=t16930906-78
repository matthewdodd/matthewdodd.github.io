Griffis was below, and wanted to speak with Mr. Newbolt; he went down, and when he came up again, he told the Company that Capt.

               <p>Another Evidence swore that the Prisoners had a Printing-Press, and this was kept at one Douglosses at Westminster, and there they printed the Declarations, and that both the Prisoners were concerned equally in the matter, and that they were seen to compose the Press; and the Frame so set by their hands was brought into Court, on which the Declaration had been printed, and proved to be set by the Prisoners, &amp;c. All this was fully and clearly sworn against them by the King's Evidence; and that they once made their escape.</p>

And Printing was not in that Statute, therefore Printing could not be an Overt-Act of High-Treason; and that they were but Servants, and hired to work for their Livelihood, the Press not theirs, &amp;c. therefore they hoped that they could not be found guilty of Treason, and that it was never known, that Servants did suffer for their Masters Faults.</p>
               <p>But they were answered by the Court, That Servants and Masters too were equally principals; and the Matter contain'd in that Paper was Treason of the highest rate, designing to change the Government, depose Their Majesties, and raise open War in these Nations, of which Design they could not be ignorant, being the Composers and Printers thereof, and all done with setled purpose and intent to be published throughout the Nation, to accomplish and effect the same.</p>

               <p>When they received Sentence, they desired Mr. Recorder to make a favourable Report of their Circumstances to the Queen; And that they were Poor men, and only work'd for a Living. Who told them, That he would report to their Majesties nothing but what should be just and true, and advised them to repent of their wicked and evil Purposes, and to thank Almighty God that they were prevented, and these Nations blessed in the safety and preservation of the best and most religious King and Queen that ever did rule and govern these Realms.</p>

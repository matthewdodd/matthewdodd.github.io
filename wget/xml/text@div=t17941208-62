             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Sunday the 27th of July last, I was walking down the <placeName id="t17941208-62-crimeloc360">Strand</placeName>

                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17941208-62-defend849 t17941208-62-deflabel361"></join>; I bargained with him for five apricots, I gave him a shilling, he put it in his mouth to bite it, and returned it to me, and said it was a bad one; I gave him another, he affected to bite that also, and returned it to me, and said it was not a good one, and then I pulled out several shillings, and there was one with a head on, and he said, give me that with a head on; by that means he got at my hand, I had five or six shillings in my hand; after he had got a shilling out which he liked, he said he had not a six-pence, but if I would give him two more shillings he would give me half a crown I gave him two other shillings, and he was some time fumbling in his pocket for money and he pulled out a vast many half crowns, and I observed to him, good God, you have got a vast deal of bad money here, you must be an utterer of bad money; he offered me three or four half crowns which were bad ones, at last he gave me one which was a good one. I went into the Temple-gardens, when I got into the Temple-gardens I was very much dissatisfied that I had left the man, and I went up to one corner of the garden and examined my silver, and I observed three shillings quite bright, just new, that I could not have had in my possession without observing they were bad.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by quite bright? - As if they had not been in circulation; I could not have seen them in my possession without knowing of it. I knew I had not changed any of my silver that day, nor had I taken any silver in my possession that day. I was very much dissatisfied with myself, and I was determined to find the man; I came back and he was gone from the spot. I supposed he might be gone up towards the park; I followed him, at Somerset house I observed him, he was there selling his fruit, I went past him and took no notice, and I found two men that seemed connected coming to him and talking to him, sometimes taking the fruit out of his basket. I soon found that these two men were connected with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they exchange any thing else besides fruit? - I did not see.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they cross over frequently? - So often that I was pretty sure that they were connected with him, and I thought it would be rather dangerous to attack the man by myself, for I was determined to take him. I went to a constable, and all the time this man and another man of the name of Lazarus, were beating their way up towards the Park. The constable, whose name was Bewley, did not like to encounter this man, with the men that I told him of, and we found another constable of the name of Hyde. Bewley, after I spoke to him, said he would get another man and desired me to watch the prisoner, and I believe the prisoner observed that I watched him, for this man still kept going up by the side of him; they knew that I was watching them. When Hyde and the other constable came to me I pointed him out,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080210"></xptr>and they took him; I said, that was the man we took in the Strand, and he was carried up to St. Martin's watch-house. Lazarus, when he was taken, was at the distance of about five hundred yards; I had observed him before, but I did not know that he was alarmed at any thing that had passed between me and the prisoner; but in going up Round-court, Lazarus was making his escape another way. He was another Jew also selling fruit.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he either of these two men that you saw at Somerset house? - No, he was another man selling fruit at about five hundred yards from this man; he was taken, but discharged. When the prisoner at the bar was taken, I did not observe those two men that had before kept by the side of him, but after he was in the watch-house these two men came to the door, and I desired the constable to go and take them. The moment the constable opened the outside door, these two men made their escape; these men were connected with him I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - After church in the morning, between one and two o'clock. Half after one.</p>
               <p>Q. As you was taking Franks to the watch-house did you meet Lazarus? - We met Lazarus, turned him about, and took him to the watch-house, and he threw something from him into the prisoner's basket; about six and thirty bad shillings. I told him the prisoner had enough to answer for without his throwing his bad silver in. The prisoner was searched, there was a good deal of good silver about him, indeed all that appeared about him was good.</p>
               <p>Q. How many shillings do you believe were changed? - Three, I have had them wrapped up in paper. They were very bright, they are now very much discoloured indeed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. When he returned you the three shillings back again, did you put them in your pocket before you went into the Temple-gardens? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you that about the person of the prisoner, though searched, there was no bad silver at all? - There did not appear to be any.</p>
               <p>Q. How much silver had he about him? - About two guineas worth, and all good.</p>
               <p>Q. The money that you state to be bad, and found, was thrown into the prisoner's basket? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any sixpences found about him? - Yes there were some.</p>
               <p>Q. You apprehend that he changed the shillings by pulling them out of his mouth that he gave to you; - I suppose so, because he affected to bite those shillings I gave him, but I did not find any bit ones in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you at first two? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he must have had two in his mouth, and the shillings that you gave him in return must have remained in his mouth? - I don't know what he did with them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from the time you met him at Messrs. Child's house, and the time you went back again to Somerset house? - In the outside, twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. This young man you had never seen before? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. There were a good many jew boys in the streets, especially in the Strand, selling fruit, I take it for granted? - Yes, I don't remember any other that day but Lazarus and this. The two that were going with him were not dressed as selling fruit. One was dressed very genteelly and the other very shabby. I understand that the prisoner is a glass grinder by trade, but he sells fruit on Sunday.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080211"></xptr>Q. We know very well that from the Temple to Somerset-house, there is no occasion for twenty minutes? - I went from Child's door to Temple gardens to meet Mrs. Redhead, who was there, and he was pursuing his journey on.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do with the money after he gave it you? Did you put it into your pocket? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put it with the other money? - I did. When he gave it me back I supposed that I might have given him the shilling.</p>
               <p>Court. When he was examined, did you find these bad half crowns about him? - Not one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them you do not know? - I can only guess.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I wish to know whether among the silver that was found on him, there were not some good half crowns among them? - There were, but these half crowns I had in my hand, and I am certain that they were bad.</p>
               <p>Court. You are sure that these three shillings you produce now, were not in your possession before your dealings with this man? - I am certain I could not have looked at them without knowing they were bad.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; on Sunday, July 27th, a little after two o'clock, Mr. Redhead came to my house and said he was an officer, and as we went out of the door, he said, he believed one would not be enough, he asked where I could get another? and I went and got another, and we went and took the prisoner immediately, just opposite Bedford-street, in the Strand, we searched him and there was nothing bad found on this man, there were seven and thirty shillings apparently all good, and there was something thrown in a basket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that? - I did not. I searched the other prisoner before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look into the basket? - I did not, I believe the other constable did.</p>
               <p>Q. He was taken before the Lord Mayor and there he was bailed, and now he surrenders to meet this trial? - He did.</p>

               <p>Q. You was present at the taking of the prisoner? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find on him? - I see Lazarus heave one pound twelve shillings, or one pound thirteen shillings, into Frank's basket, in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. And what was in the basket when you looked at it? - It was all bad. I delivered it to the solicitor of the mint.</p>

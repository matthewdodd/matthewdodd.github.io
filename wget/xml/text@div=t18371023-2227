About a month or five weeks ago, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, there were some persons round Mr. Longstaff's door, and among the rest was the prisoner—I had suspicion and gave information—I went home I and changed my dress—when I came back there was a piece of cloth gone—I saw the prisoner afterward in Watling-street—I went to lay hold of him, and he ran away—I had been looking for him from Wednesday last, and could not find him.</p>

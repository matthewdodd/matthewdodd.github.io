On the 25th of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was informed by my little boy, four years old, that a man had taken away one of my cheeses, and was rolling it along the street. Upon the child telling me the second time I went out and saw the prisoner rolling it he was about twenty yards off; I pursued him, I took hold of his collar, I asked him where he was going with that cheese; he answered, I found it in the street. I requested Mr. Daniel to take charge of the cheese while I took the man back to my shop. This is the cheese, I am sure it is mine, there is my name on it. In the morning I had put out three cheeses on my area bars, and when my little boy gave me the information there were only two.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning home from my work, I was crossing Wild-street, I saw a tall man in a blue coat carrying the cheese, he let it drop; and at the time the gentleman came up I was wiping it; I called for assistance. I suppose the gentleman heard me. Speak the truth gentleman.</p>

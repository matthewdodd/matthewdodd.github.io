                  </hi>. I am a constable, employed at Nicholson's Wharf, Thames Street, and have been for twenty years—the prisoner has been twelve or fourteen years in the service of the firm, and for the last three years in a permanent situation—on the 9th March, about a quarter past seven, I stopped him as he was leaving the wharf—I asked him if he had anything about him belonging to the firm—he said "No"—I then took him into the office, and found under his waistcoat this piece of cloth (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), wrapped round his body—I asked him where he got it from—he said, "I shan't tell you"—I told him I should give him into custody, and he asked me if I would look over it until morning—I said I could not do that—he then said he found it in the <hi rend="italic">dummy</hi>, that is a lighter moored to the premises—I have never seen any cloth in it during the time I have been there—I gave him into custody, and then went to his house, where I found several other pieces—two pieces exactly corresponded with that I found on him—and I also found a piece with the name of the firm branded on it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been employed at the dock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Twenty-one years—my duties are to regulate the traffic, and to protect the property—the prisoner has never complained of me, or reported me on any occasion—tea and coffee is not sold on the wharf—that I swear—I stopped the prisoner as he was leaving the premises—it was round his body, under<lb></lb>neath his clothes—I took him into the office—no one was present but myself—it is not customary for the men to make aprons out of new pieces of cloth—sometimes the old stuff is given to them—the men have not borne a good feeling towards the prisoner—the stuff is worth about fourpence a yard.</p>

On the evening of the 9th March I went to Gravel Lane—it is a sort of pawnbroker's shop which the prisoner keeps—I there found eight pieces of cloth, some hanging up in the shop, and some underneath the counter—I think I found the piece that is branded, in the bedroom—I also found 120 duplicates.</p>

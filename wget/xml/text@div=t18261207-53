            . I live in Three Tun-court, Redcross-street, and am a widow. On the 30th of September the prisoner came to my house and asked if I had a son at sea - I said, "Have you come from Sydney?" he said,"No; but my son has" - I said, "Then you have brought me a letter from my son;" he said, No; but if I would go to Captain Jones, No. 20, Stepney-causeway, at ten o'clock in the morning, I should receive twenty-five dollars; I cried, and said I knew it was no such thing, as I had heard from my son in August; he said it was the case, and asked if I had any letters from my son; I gave him four; he asked for a pen and ink, which I went downstairs to fetch; I fetched him some porter, and gave him a knife to cut a slice of bread and some bacon; and while I turned to get the bacon, he must have taken my knife, which was a good one, and left this one of Allen's behind; I gave it to Allen; I found his account entirely false; I am sure of his person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Tranquil Vale, Blackheath. The prisoner came into my service on the 30th of January, and on the 30th of April she had leave to go out for a holiday—my wife opened her box, which was in her bed-room, with a key we had about the house, and some things of mine were in it—the constable was afterwards sent for—the box was opened in the passage in the prisoner's presence, and in it was</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 84.) I went to Mr. Tuck about nine o'clock at night, on the 30th of April—I waited till the prisoner came home, and Mr. Tuck charged her on suspicion of robbing him—she said, "Me rob him—what of?"—I asked her to give me the key of her box, she took it from her pocket and gave it to me—the box was searched in her presence, and a great number of things were found in it—amongst the rest these six towels, this necklace, these duplicates, and other things—I afterwards went to the house of a person at Lewisham, where a child of the prisoner's is, and there I found this wine-glass, basin, and egg-cup, and a handkerchief which Mr. Tuck identifies—after the prisoner had been searched at the station-house she said, "I am very sorry for what I have done; I hope my master will not come against me."</p>

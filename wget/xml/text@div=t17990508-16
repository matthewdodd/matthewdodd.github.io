             sworn. - As I was passing by Mr. Adams's, on Tuesday, the 16th of April, I perceived a person in the shop take a roll of carpeting up in his arms, and carry it from the shop to a post not far from the house, for the purpose of putting it on his shoulder; I suspected that he had not been sent out with the carpet; I went and gave the alarm; I am sure the prisoner is the same man; he was secured by one of Mr. Adams's journeymen; what was done with the property I do not know.</p>

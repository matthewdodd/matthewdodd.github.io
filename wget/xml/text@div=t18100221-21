On the 25th of January last between two and three o'clock the prisoner came into the shop, and asked for some galloon; she bought two yards, I was measuring the third yard, and then I missed a piece of galloon out of the drawer on the counter; I removed the drawer and saw that she had three pieces in her hand concealed under her handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they part of what she had been buying - A. No; they were not like what she had been buying.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your back been turned at all after the drawer had been put on the counter - A. No; when I took the pieces out of her hand I asked her what she mean't with taking the pieces out of the drawer; she immediately begged my pardon, I severely reprimanded her and sent another young lady to call Mr. Etches. Mr. Etches came and sent for a constable and she was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. If your back was never turned what opportunity had she of taking them out of the drawer - A. While I was measuring the last yard of ribbon that she was purchasing. I kept the pieces of galloon till I delivered them to Hutchins the constable; they had Mr. Etches private mark on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner before - A. I have seen her in the shop before.</p>

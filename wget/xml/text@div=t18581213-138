                  </hi>. I am a widow, living at 33, Spray's-buildings, Woolwich. I remember the time Woolley was taken into custody—he was not lodging at my house for a fortnight previously to that—he was a lodger at my house at the latter end of September—he was lodging there on Saturday, 2d October—on that day I remember Mr. Webster coming there—he remained to dinner with Woolley that day—I saw them in conversation together—on the following Tuesday I saw Woolley at my lodgings; he was there during the whole of the day, in and out—he is an artisan in the Arsenal at Woolwich—he came to my apartments and asked me, if he brought his son down, and Mr. Webster as a friend, would I make it convenient to dine them?—I said I would; that was Mr. Woolley's son, Mr. Webster, and Mr. Woolley; which I did on the Sunday, and I saw no more of Mr. Woolley till I met him promiscuously at the Lewisham station, on Monday morning—he said his son and daughter were very angry with him because he had given over the plates without getting the money for them; he was to have 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, and he had only received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—he said he did not intend making them perfect without he got the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said this to me at the Lewisham station, about 1 o'clock in the day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police—from information that I received, I watched a house in Brompton, 10, Upper Queen's-buildiugs, on the evening of 30th September—that was a house where Barnard was a servant—I saw him go in and out of that house—on the eveniug of that day I saw him go to the Pakenham Arms public-house on Knightsbridge Green, and join two men there—on Monday, 5th October, I accompanied several officers to 4, Portland-street, Walworth Common, about 10 o'clock in the evening—the house was occupied by Richard Webster—we remained about 30 yards from the house for about three quarters of an hour, or more—I saw Barnard go into the house and come out again; he returned with a cab, and stood by the outer door of the house—at that time, I, with the other officers, rushed into the house—on going in, another officer was ahead of me; he laid hold of Webster, and was having a violent struggle with him—Webster was in a back room, and I saw him and Holmes, another officer, struggling violently—I saw Holmes with two plates in his hands; he said, "Here, I have got them, sir," and handed to me these two copper plates (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—we apprehended, at the same moment, Barnard and John Webster, a brother of the prisoner—Webster's brother said, turning round to Barnard, "This is all through you;" that was in the hearing of Richard Webster-John Webster was subsequently discharged by the Magistrate—Barnard made no reply to that—I did not observe Richard Webster say anything at that time—I took the whole of them to Carter-street station—in the station, when the charge was entered, Richard Webster said, "Other parties are more guilty than we are;" that was alluding to himself and his brother—I had not seen Richard Webster go into that house that evening; John, I had—I saw Barnard and Richard Webster in company together, on 1st October, at the Pakenham Arms, Knightsbridge Green; I saw Barnard join Webster in the parlour of that house—I saw Richard Webster at the station-house on the following morning, Wednesday 6 th—he told me that he had received the plates from Woolley and that Woolley was an artisan or a workman at the Woolwich Arsenal—he said that he had called the previous morning on Barnard, and had left the back plate (that is the counterpart of these other two) with Barnard at his lodgings, in Queen's buildings, Brompton—in consequence of what he told me, I went to Woolwich on 8th October—I found Woolley at 33, Spray's-buildings, Woolwich; he was sitting in the front parlour—I asked him to step into the back yard with me to speak to me and I asked him if he knew the man that accompanied me, a policeman who belonged to the neighbourhood; he said that he did not—I told him that he was a police officer; I said, "I have come to ask you about some dealings you have had with plates"—he said, "Yes, I have had some dealings with plates"—I said, "Copper plates?"—he said, "Yes, copper plates"—I took him into custody, and brought him to Lon<lb></lb>don—he said, before I brought him to London, that he was to have 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the plates, but had only received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account, from Webster—when at Bow street, I read the charge to him—he was charged with engraving copper plates, for the manufacture of forged ten-rouble Russian notes—I had, at that time, the two plates that I had found on Richard Webster—he said, "No, I have not engraved them"—nothing further passed on that occasion—Webster and Woolley were confronted together on 9th October—I said to Webster, "Is this the man whom you say you had the plates of?"—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185812130081"></xptr>
               <p>said, "Yes, that is the man"—I said to Woolley, "Do you hear that?"—he said, "Yes, it is all right"—afterwards at the police court, Woolley said that he had engraved them, but they were not complete—that was before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did Webster say anything at all about Woolley having engraved the plates? Did not he say that he had them from Woolley? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the expression was, that he had got them from Woolley; nothing about Woolley engraving them—the 5th October was the day upon which we went to Portland-street, Walworth Common—I took two policemen with me on that occasion, and three or four came in subse<lb></lb>quently, belonging to the neighbourhood—three or four persons went in at the same time, or about the same time—Webster and John Webster were in the back room—Barnard was there, and Webster's wife—she was on the staircase leading up to the bedroom—she was dragged down by the cons<lb></lb>stable—she and her husband were dragged down together—I did not observe that she was coming down the stairs just about the time we went in—she came down when the constable pulled her and her husband down; he pulled them down together—Webster's foot was on the staircase that leads into the back room, and his wife was on the stairs—I cannot tell you whether she had been recently confined; I saw an infant, in her arms, or rather I found an infant in the bed—I think it was a very young infant—there were not any other persons there at the time we went in—there was one cab outside—two did not come up—a cab came up to a public-house about a dozen doors from Richard Webster's dwelling—I do not know that two persons who were there went away, and got into one of the cabs—at the time we went into the house there was an old man and a young man there, respectable looking persons—they were outside the door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And did not one of these two, the old man or the young man, give you a signal to come on the premises? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A certain signal was given—I daresay it was given by one of them—I know it was given by one of them—they were not very respectably dressed persons—they were decently dressed—I do not know that they were foreigners, nor do I think they were—I do not know that one of those two persons went away in a cab; I would have answered you in a moment if I did—they disappeared from the scene—I did not see any cab go away besides one—I took one cab away with the prisoners, and that was the only cab that I saw go away—when I saw Webster with Barnard, on 1st October, at the Pakenham Arms, Boll, the witness, and the other two persons I have spoken of, were there.</p>

I was present on the 9th, the following Saturday, when Woolley was confronted with Richard Webster, by the Inspector—I saw the plates produced—Mackenzie said to Richard Webster, "Was this the man you received the plates from?" producing the plates—Webster said, "Yes"—Woolley replied, "That is right," or "All right"—on the following Tuesday, in consequence of instructions which were conveyed to me, I went to 10, Queen's-buildings, Brompton, the place where Barnard lived, and made a search—I went into the cellar and found a plate there—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the plate—I was in company with Franklin there; we had to remove a great quantity of wood in the cellar, under the stairs, and between two joints we could just discern the edge of this; we pulled it out from the back part, and it was this plate—that is a third one—we pulled it out from between two joints—it was very tight, only just room to get it in—I had previously searched that house, and been unable to find any plate; it was such a mass of rubbish, it was impossible; we were obliged to have a regular search or we should not have found it then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker of Holborn. The prisoner was in my service—on 8th March, he was going to his dinner about 12 o'clock—he left his work in the shop—he was away about an hour—after he returned from his dinner I spoke to a policeman, and about an hour after the prisoner returned I missed two pairs of boot legs—he afterwards went out again, and I did not see him again till I saw him at the station-house—I saw two pairs of boot legs there—they were what I had lost—they have two private marks on them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe he had been in your employment between three and four years? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he was a clicker—the duty of a clicker is to cut out the uppers of ladies' boots and shoes—we give the work out to workpeople—the binding is done by one set of workpeople—I give them out to the binders myself, book them, and number them, and after they come back they are delivered into the prisoner's possession to take care of—I never take them to the binders myself, they always fetch them—I take them of the binders myself, and after that they come under the shopman's care—persons in my employ never take out things to the binders or closers without my orders; I have given orders to the contrary, but if a particular pair is wanted in a hurry, I should send them out—it is no part of the prisoner's business to take them out anywhere—I have no foreman, I conduct the business myself—there was no one in my employ but the prisoner who had to do with these goods—I employ several persons—my sons act for me in my absence—they are not here to day—it would be the prisoner's duty to obey my sons in my absence.</p>

               <p>in consequence of which I watched his door, and about a quarter to 4 o'clock saw the prisoner come out—I followed him into Greystock-place, Fetter-lane—I then missed him, and afterwards saw him near a public house—I did not see him actually leave the door of it—I followed him again, a man stopped him, and I told him some one had been inquiring after him, and took him into custody—I told him he must come with me, he must go to the station on a charge of stealing these boot legs (he had got this parcel in his hand)—I asked him what he was going to do with it, at the shop—he said, after a little hesitation, he was going to take them to the binders—I asked him if be had any more—he said yes, and took one of these pairs from his coat pocket behind—I asked if he had any more, and he took this other pair from his right hand trowsers pocket—the parcel contained a pair of materials which he is not charged with—I searched his house, and found a pair of children's boots under the bed—he has got children of his own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you went up to him me the street, did not you say you took him into custody on suspicion of robbing his master of some boot legs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not mention boot legs at all then—it was previous to taking him to the station that I told him he was charged with stealing these boot legs—I did not ask him what he had in the parcel when I took him, or what he was going to do with the parcel till we got to the shop—there was nothing said at the time I took him, about boot legs—I am sure he said he was going to take them to the binder's, not to the maker's—I have been three years in the force.</p>

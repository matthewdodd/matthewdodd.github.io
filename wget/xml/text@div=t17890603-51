               <p>I went to the house of Denton on the 25th of March, at Bell-court, I saw a quantity of these puncheons in the cellar; Carpmeal took them out of the press, I call them dies, these are the same I found, I call these dies; this has the head of a shilling, this has the head of a shilling.</p>
               <p>Court. You call them dies or puncheons? - If they were dies, the head would be reversed, the shilling is the puncheon, and that makes the die.</p>
               <p>This which is a good shilling was made use of as a puncheon to make the die? - Not a doubt of it; these two were found in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Court. If I recollect your evidence right, there were no dies found but in the bureau, not in the cellar? - No; the bureau Denton had the key of; and of the cellar-door Jones had the key.</p>
               <p>Look at that half crown, would that make an an impression? - Yes it would.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. One is a good shilling, and the other is a dye which they say is produced by it.</p>

            ; now with respect to Denton, to before, the evidence is extremely strong, for two of these dies were found in a bureau in his house, the key of which bureau is in his own pocket; therefore they are in his own bureau locked up, with the key of it in his pocket, and in his house; it is therefore extremely difficult to suppose that he did not know that these things were in his bureau; there is, to be sure, a bare possibility that they might be put there by some other person, without his knowledge; but that is a very strained supposition; and it is not the duty of the Jury to go quite so far as that in favour of innocence, to make supposition grossly contrary to the probability of the fact.

            , the evidence is this; you see it was not the house of Jones that they were found in, but Jones had a key which opened the door which gave access to this place, where they were found; he had in his pocket the key of the cellar in which was the stamping-press with some dies, and in which were other dies answering: if you are satisfied that they do answer the description in the indictment; you are therefore to consider whether they were or were not in the possession of Jones as well as of Denton; they were not in his house; but he had a key which opened the door where they were; now that would be open still to another question, whether Jones knew what was in that cellar; there is no direct evidence that he had ever opened that cellar, or been in it; what he had to do with the key, if he had not, does not appear: in point of fact, he had the key of the place in which these were locked up in his possession; if while he had that key; he was a stranger to what was doing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030072"></xptr>in the cellar; and it does not appear that he had ever made use of that key, nor how long he had had it; nor does it appear whether Jones did or did not lodge at the place where he said he did, there is no evidence one way or the other as to that: now as to the things found on Jones, there is no counterfeit money except dollars found on Jones; there is no counterfeit half crown nor counterfeit shilling; so that there is nothing found on Jones actually corresponding with any of these dies; these dies are produced, you will judge whether there can be any doubt that they have the similitude of the lawful coin, and then you will judge first as to Denton, and then as to Jones. There is an observation stated by the prisoner Denton upon the metal, of which these stamps is made, which he suggests is too soft to make the impression upon other metal; I doubt a little whether that observation is founded in fact; you are to judge of it, but you are to consider this also, that there is a count in the indictment stating, not that this die was capable of making the impression only; but that this die had upon it the impression: now that it had some impression there is no doubt, and you will judge that that impression, is an impression resembling the coin of this kingdom. Gentlemen, you will take the whole into your consideration; if you can find any reasonable ground to doubt, you will acquit one or both the prisoners; but you must convict one or both of them if you can find no reasonable ground to doubt.</p>

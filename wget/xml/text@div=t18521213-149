               <p>to her I sometimes was not able to obtain an answer for some minutes—I have put a question to her about two or three times, before I have got any answer—she said she could not talk, she was not herself—if I told her a thing, and spoke to her about it shortly afterwards, she did not recollect it—she had no memory, and could not recollect—the nurse, Mrs. Davis, made a communication to me about what she thought was her state—Mrs. Davis is here—in consequence of this low and desponding state of mind it was thought best that she should live apart from her husband; which has been the case six or eight weeks, since the latter end of Sep.—after the separation from ber husband she appeared to grow worse; more desponding—I do not know that her memory was worse, for it was dreadful bad in the summer—after the separation, she spoke to me several times of communications she had from God—she did not say she had any communications or commands from God, but she said God would not let her die—she slept in the same room as me, and whenever I awoke she lay awake, and she said she never slept, and I do not think she ever did soundly—one evening, a short time before this melancholy affair happened, she went out with the child—I went with her—she did not go to any particular place;' she walked up one street and down another, near the Waterloo-road—she was very cross; more cross than ever I had seen her before—that was about a month before the death of the child—she appeared to have no purpose in walking up and down—I offended her by saying I thought she had not fed the baby—she put her things on and went out, and I followed her—I tried to prevail on her to come in, and succeeded—she continued in that state down to the day this happened—I thought she was worse on the Sunday evening, before this Monday—I could not get her to speak at all—I said, "It is so dull, I wish you would talk;" and she said, "I cannot"—she continued to suckle the child as far as she could, but she had very little milk indeed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one the coal-meters appointed by the Com<lb></lb>mittee of Coal Factors and Merchants. On the 19th of November I was in the discharge of my duty on board the <hi rend="italic">Union,</hi> of Whit by, lying at Stone-stairs tier, in the river—it is usual for me to have a certificate-book—(<hi rend="italic">look<lb></lb>ing at a book</hi>)—this is the book I had on that occasion—it is a certificate-book, which we receive out of the coal-meter's office when we go on board ships—they are certificates which we give to different merchants—they are not signed as they are in the book—there are blanks left for the name of the ship from which the coals are delivered, the quantity, the barge, the number of it, the lighter man, and to whose account they are delivered, and the date of the delivery—it is signed by the meter—I should think there were upwards of from thirty to forty certificates in the book that morning—I went into the captain's cabin several times that morning—my book was down in the cabin on the locker—I left it there the first thing in the morning when I went on board, till I left the ship in the afternoon—a man named Venables came on board between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning—I did not know Mr. Morris, the defendant—I believe Venables was in his service—I remained on board the brig from a quar<lb></lb>ter past seven o'clock till half-past four o'clock in the afternoon—Venables was on board about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—he came down into the cabin while I was sitting there along with the captain—I left the cabin while Venables was there—the captain was there at that time—there were several barges there, and the <hi rend="italic">Lark</hi> among them, coming towards the brig—Venables had the management of three or four of them—MR. Stewart, the mate, was on board—Venables drank with him down in the cabin—I did not notice that any thing had happened to my meter's book while I was on board the brig—when I got home in the evening I found there were several sheets torn out—I can undertake to say that it was perfectly sound that morning—there appears to be nine certificates torn out—there is a margin to the certificates, to enable me to keep a check of the contents of the body of the certificate—the margins were torn away as well as the bodies—the book was lying on the locker when Venables was in the cabin.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you any papers at the end of it, which you were in the habit of referring to in the evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, orders—it is my practice to refer to them almost every evening—when I got home that evening I referred to the end of the book, and then missed the certifi<lb></lb>cates—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a certificate produced by Ledley</hi>)—this is one of the nine certificates—all the written part of it is forged—it is not my hand-writing, any part of it—it does not bear my name, but the name of <hi rend="italic">Robert</hi> Johnson—there is no official coal-meter named Robert Johnson—there is one named John Johnson—this certificate bears my printed stamp on the back of it—it is, "R.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you fill up all you give away with your hand-writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—the particulars of all the others are in the margins—I have not compared the particulars of this certificate with the margins, to see if it agrees with any of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who was on board the vessel besides Venables? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was no lighterman on board—the captain, Mr. Stewart, and I, were down in the cabin, having some ale at the table, which is not more than a yard from the locker—I left the cabin for about ten minutes, while Venables was there—I will swear that—he was on board ten minutes or a quarter of an hour altogether—I drank one glass of ale—there was a bottle drunk—I left the Captain with Venables in the cabin—I met them on the deck coming out of the cabin, I think, about ten minutes after I had been on deck—I cannot say exactly—I will swear I was more than five minutes out of the cabin before Venables came up—you go up a few stairs from the cabin to the deck—MR. Stewart followed me out of the cabin—he left Venables in the cabin, perhaps a few minutes—I will not swear it was one minute—I did not meet them coming out of the cabin together—they followed one another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you sure that Stewart ever left him in the cabin alone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He must have done, because he followed me out—I went on deck first—MR. Stewart followed me afterwards, and must have left Venables there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps five minutes—I do not swear he left Venables below five minutes—he came up about five minutes after me, alone—it was about five minutes after I had left the cabin that I saw Mr. Stewart and Venables, one following the other—MR. Stewart came up alone, and Venables followed him in a very little time—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184003020056"></xptr>
               <p>might be about two or three yards behind him—they were never apart, except the time it would take Stewart to get on the deck before Venables.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any means or opportunity for Venables to take the papers without Mr. Stewart seeing him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell that—I only know that Venables was Mr. Morris's servant from his bringing barges from Mr. Morris's wharf, I considered him Mr. Morris's lighterman—I never saw him and Mr. Morris together—I had never seen Mr. Morris but once—I knew he was a coal-merchant and in a very large way of business—he has not got his name on the barges—Capel's and Slaughter's name is on them—the prisoner kept a wharf called Sun wharf—I never saw his name on a barge—Venables might be Capel and Slaughter's servant, but I considered him Mr. Morris's—I was subpoenaed as a witness here to-day—I have seen no one as the prosecutor, but the solicitor and his clerk—I believe Mr. Bentley is a factor—I do not know him—he has given me no orders to come here—no one has spoken to me upon it except the solicitor—I know Mr. Gammon, a merchant—he has not given me any instructions about this prosecution, or about my appearance at the police office—I was examined several times at the police-office on a charge against Mr. Morris of having forged this certificate, or uttering it knowing it to be forged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Not having stolen it, or received it, knowing it to be stolen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know what the charge was—I told captain Stewart the next morn<lb></lb>ing, about a quarter-past seven o'clock, that I had the certificates—I did not sec Venables that day—I cannot say whether he was working on board the brig that day and the following day—he might be—he came there every day and brought barge to the ship—he brought barges while I was delivering the ship—I never charged Venables nor any body with having taken these papers—I merely mentioned to Mr. Stewart that I had lost them and to two of my brother meters, Yates and Rix—I mentioned it to them next morning—Yates is one—I forget the others name—(<hi rend="italic">looking in a book</hi>)—I was going to see if I could recollect the meters name—I thought I might have a list of the meters in my pocket—it appears by this book, which is in my writing, that Venables was on board working on the 21st of Novem<lb></lb>ber—I never mentioned to him about the loss of my certificates—I did not make it public—I only told two meters, Yates, and I think Rix is the name of the other—it begins with Ri—I take the certificate book on shore when I go at night—I went home on the night of the 19th of November—I am almost sure I did not go to any ale-house, or any place before I went home—I am quite sure I did not—I went home—it was quite dark—I have never, on any occasion, gone to any ale-house or other place and lost my book—I never lost it and had it returned by any body—I have not seen Mr. Gammon this morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked whether you ever charged Venables with having stolen the certificates; were you aware on the 19th, 20th, or 21st who had taken the certificates? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I was not—I had no suspicion that Mr. Morris had any of them in his possession—all the certificates in the book No. 5 are accounted for by the margins, except the nine which were torn out—I can account for every one, numbers and everything.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you supposed Venables to be Mr. Morris's agent, had you any order from Mr. Morris to deliver coals to him on Mr. Morris's account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—not on board the <hi rend="italic">Union.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But at any former time have you had orders from Mr. Morris</p>

               <p>to deliver coats to Venables? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—MR. Morris is in the habit of drawing his coals by means of Capel and Slaughter, from the wharf—I have seen the wagons loaded with coals from Capel and Slaughter's barges, which have gone to Morris's wharf—I saw Venables at the police-office—the mate was on deck while Venables was in the cabin—when I first went on board, for two or three days I considered Stewart to be the mate, but afterwards he was appointed captain—the mate I speak of is another person—there was a mate on board besides Stewart, and another man and two boys.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a weaver, and live in Manchester-street, Beth<lb></lb>nal-green. I was secretary to a club held at the Greyhound public-house, for the purpose of purchasing coals—it is an association of working people to purchase large quantities of coals, and by that means getting them cheaper—on the 25th of November I received, as secretary to the club, a tender from Mr. Morris, to supply coal—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">The tender was here ready signed "Thomas Morris" proposing to supply the members of the coal-club with sundry coals, and amongst others with Belmont, at</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per ton</hi>)—the club agreed with Mr. Morris to supply some Belmont coals—this is the memorandum of the contract—(<hi rend="italic">"This being read, was an agreement to deliver to the members of the Greyhound coal-club,</hi> 45 <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 60 <hi rend="italic">tons of Belmont coals, and for the merchant to produce the ship's certificate."</hi>) On the 11th of December I attended at the defendant's wharf to see the coals worked—my attention was directed to two barges, one, the Mouse, laid by the shore, and another laid off the shore—that was the <hi rend="italic">Edward,</hi> as Mr. Morris represented—I saw him there—he said those barges contained the coals we were to have—three rooms of the <hi rend="italic">Mouse</hi> had coals in them—MR. Chapman was with me—he was appointed by the club to go down with me to witness the delivery—MR. Morris said, "They are ready now for you to go to work"—I asked him for the ship's certificate—he said, "Come along with me"—I walked with him up the wharf to his counting-house, and went in with him—he handed a file to me, which I supposed to be certificates—I said, "This is it at the top"—I said so because he banded me the file—I did not know whether it might be the one at the top—I said, "This is it at the top," and Mr. Morris said, "Yes"—I saw the word <hi rend="italic">"Mouse"</hi> on it—he was standing alongside of me when he said yes—I do not know that he looked at it—alter I looked at it, I took it off the file myself in his presence—this is the certificate—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—my name is written on the back of it—it is in the same state now as when I received it, except having my name on the back—(<hi rend="italic">This was the certifi<lb></lb>cate identified by Johnson as having been taken from his book; it was headed, "Ship-meter's Certificate from the Coal-meter's Office" "I Robert Johnson certify that I have delivered from the</hi> Mary Anne, <hi rend="italic">Robert Jones, master, from the port of Sunder land, with Belmont coals,</hi> 21 <hi rend="italic">tons, delivered into the</hi> Mouse, No. 1055, <hi rend="italic">on account of Capel and Slaughter, for Mr. Morris.</hi>

                  </hi>. I live in Charlotte-street, Bethnal-green. I was a member of the club—I was present the evening Mr. Morris's bill was paid—after the payment I heard Macey find fault with regard to the coals being the wrong name, and he produced some documents, which were read—after that I heard Mr. Morris say he admitted he had practiced a deception as regarded the name of the coal, and he had taken off something per ton tantamount to make that level—I was taking his part, thinking at the time he had taken off sufficient, but afterwards I found he had not—he</p>

Morris might have said at the meeting that he had practiced a little deception—I do not know that I heard him say so—I might not un-derstand what he said exactly—I will not swear he did not say so, because I might not recollect it—I heard somebody say that Mr. Morris did say so—I never thought of telling M'Crea of what passed between Mr. Morris and me—it must have slipped my memory.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber and glazier. I am secretary to the Greyhound coal-club—I went with M'Crea, on the 11th of September, to Sun Wharf, Ratcliff, to see the coals supplied—I asked the lighterman whether he had got Belmont coals on board, and he said no, he thought there was everything else but Belmont—I cannot say that M'Crea heard it—he was standing close by, near enough to hear it, I should suppose—I turned round to him and said, "I think we have done for to-day," meaning the supply would not take place that morning—he made no remark—I cannot say that there was any further conversation either from Venables, M'Crea, or myself—we waited, expecting that the coals—at least, that we should commence operations.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the publisher of the prices of coals—(<hi rend="italic">producing a book</hi>)—this book contains from day to day the price of coals in the mar<lb></lb>ket—on the 1st of November, 1839, Belmont coals were 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a ton, and Evenwood 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the 9th of December there were Evenwood in the market, but no Belmont that day.</p>

               <p>Court. Who was present when they were left? - Nobody that I know of, the prisoner Leo had the key of the box, and he left it under the box at two o'clock, and Sharp took the key out from under the box, and put in the trusses of hay, that he confessed himself, I went up when Leo was paying Sharp for the hay; he did not say it was for the hay, I cannot tell whether it was sixpence or one shilling that he gave him, but the man says a shilling; I heard Sharp mention it before the justice, I saw the hay there every night, but I did not know where it came from, till the last truss, then I heard it was Mr. Allowley's waggoner; Sharp confessed he had taken the hay, and sold it to Leo, and that he gave him 6 d. for the first truss, and one shilling for the last.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say whose hay this was? - He said it was his master's Mr. Allowley's.</p>

               <p>When was it that Leo, and you quarreled together? - We never had any quarrel, only when I went on the road at first, he told some of the commissioners, that I was afraid to ride on the road.</p>
               <p>And had not you a quarrel on that account? - I told him I was not afraid to ride on the road, nor to face him, or a better man.</p>

               <p>I believe Leo has lived in that neighbourhood a long time? - I do not know any thing of him, I never saw him before he came on the road.</p>
               <p>So you would have the jury believe that he having spoken of you as not doing your duty, he should let you see this hay there, in order that you might come to be an evidence against him? - This was two months before.</p>

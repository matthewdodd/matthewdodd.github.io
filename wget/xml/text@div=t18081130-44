               <p>Q. What were the prisoners - A. I do not know, they did not belong to my ship; the ship cabin had two doors, one had a glass; the door of the other side at the top part was entirely stoved in, where some person<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300032"></xptr>had entered the cabin, and had moved several articles; among the rest this copper funnel; they had taken it from the top of the stove.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know by whom it was taken down - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all you know the cabin door had been broken and some person had got in - A. Yes.</p>

I was standing at our place on shore where we put our things in, I heard a noise as if cabin windows were knocked in; I listened again, I heard the glass break again, I went alongside of the ship, I saw Summers looking over the gangway, abaft the gangway; I said to him, who are you; he said, ship keeper. What noise is that aboard of that ship. - None at all. Who is aboard besides yourself. - Nobody but the mate and his girl taking a glass of grog in the cabin. I shall come on board and see your mate; I went up the side and told him to go and call his mate, I wanted to speak to him. I saw Shay sitting on the hatchway; I asked him who he was and what business he had there; he said he made his craft fast just along side, he was coming over to go on shore; I told him to stop by me for there was something going on that should not be, he should not go till I saw the mate. I told the man that called himself ship keeper to tell the mate that I wanted to speak with him. He called Mr. 
               <persName id="t18081130-44-person453">Johnson</persName>
             a number of times. I told a young man that came with me, his name is Howell, to fetch me a candle and lanthorn; while he was gone I told the man that called himself shipkeeper that no Mr. Johnson was there. Summers came rolling from the cabin as if he was very drunk; he shoved me and Shay, and told us we had no business there; he said you rascals get out of my ship. I said I shall not go out of your ship, nor shall neither of you, I am an officer here, till I see who you are. Shay put his hand in his bosom and pulled out this marlin spike and struck at my head. I dropped down, he hit my hat and knocked me backwards; I sung out murder and stop thief as loud as I could; Shay went over the side and Summers followed as fast as he could; Summers was the hindmost and he sung out stop thief. I passed Shay and turned Summers back. People by this time were coming out of their cabins; I had Summers in sight the whole time, and caught him and gave him in charge of Howell, while I went and seeked for Shay. Shay jumped into the boats in the bason; I said to the people, take care of him, he has got a marlinspike; two or three people in the boat took the marlinspike out of his hand and shoved him on shore to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure Shay is the man - A. Yes; I knew them both perfectly well by sight before.</p>
               <p>Q. You never lost sight of Summers - A. No. And as for Shay he made his escape into the boat with the marlinspike in his hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. The night was a very light night - A. It was a dark night.</p>
               <p>Q. You perhaps can see as well in the dark as in the light - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance were you from the gangway where Summers was - A. About two yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Shay you lost sight of - A. Yes: he went in the boat, the boat was a stern of the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find any thing in the possession of either of them that belonged to the ship - A. I did not.</p>

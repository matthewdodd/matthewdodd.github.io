               <p>I was coming to town about half after seven, in my carriage, from Hillingdon, near Uxbridge; when I came upon <placeName id="t17850511-1-crimeloc4">Ealing common</placeName>

               <p>Was it day-light, Sir? - It was as light as it is now, except the sun.</p>
               <p>Had Honey any disguise over his face? - Yes, over part of his face; Honey stood on tip-toe on the foot-path to look into the carriage, and I observed his person, his face was towards me, he then had a disguise over part of his face; he says to Mr. Hammond, your watch; says Mr. Hammond I have never a watch; says he, I saw you put the seals into your pocket, therefore you have a watch; says I, no, I do not believe he has a watch, I have one, you may take mine. I am apt to be robbed, and therefore I bought a watch on purpose; it was a silver watch, and there was a steel chain, and a compass seal. I saw Honey's face, his handkerchief was not quite over his mouth, I saw the bottom part of his mouth very strongly; I knew them both again the next morning, I might not have known them two or three months hence, but I have not the least doubt now, I wish I had for their sakes; I cannot swear to Yeldham.</p>

Then Mr. Gray gave him his watch; he then said to Mr. Gray, have you given my partner your money; he said he had; then they shut the door, and wished us a good night; they were both of them dressed in green; their persons are so very clear to me, that I am very sure these are the two young men, I cannot say I know Yeldham: they had both handkerchiefs, I saw only their chin.</p>

               <p>I live at Acton; on the 21st of April I was at home all day; about four, or a little after four, I saw them three gentlemen walk by opposite our house, they seemed to be in liquor, and were playing and talking as they went along, and about six, I observed two of them come back again opposite my house, the tall one, that is Ivemay,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110004"></xptr> and this man that stands on this side, that is Yeldham; I am very sure these are the three men that I saw at four o'clock; I saw Yeldham walk back the town way, then I saw the tall one, Ivemay, run after him, and talk to him; at last the little one seemed to be rather in a passion, and would go to town; then the other man reasoned with him, and they went down to Ealing common together; and about eight there was a piece of work about a man being taken up, and I went down, and I looked at the man, says I this man has got two more with him somewhere, for I saw them twice this afternoon; we went and searched every where, and we met three of Sir Sampson's men, and the next morning we brought Ivemay to Sir Sampson's, I had no doubt the next morning but these two men which I saw, were the same I saw the afternoon before; they went towards the Cock and Crown.</p>
               <p>Jury. What coloured clothes had Ivemay and Honey on? - They had both green coats, and black breeches and silk stockings: I had so much time to observe them because I was bled at twelve o'clock, as I was not well, and so I did not work for fear of setting my arm a bleeding.</p>

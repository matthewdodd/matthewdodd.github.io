                  </hi> I live with my father, a tailor, at 87, Quadrant—the prisoner was in his employ, and used to come about seven o'clock in the—morning—I used to open the shop. On 30th March I came down about half-past seven, and found the door that leads from the shop into the passage open, and the prisoner in the shop—I asked why he was there—he said that he came and found the door open, and went in to see whether there was anybody inside—this was after the time that he ought to have been there for his work—there was a drawer of the counter open, and two coats had been removed from it, and were lying near—I pointed them out to the prisoner—he said he had not noticed them before—I tried the door which leads from the shop into the street—It was locked, as it was the evening before—there was no mode of getting into the shop except through the passage—If I was not up the servant would open the door for him when he came—I believe she did let him in.</p>

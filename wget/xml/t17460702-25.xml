               <p>Dell. I lost 20 Lambs, Sir, the 12th Day of June last.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they?</p>
               <p>Dell. They were at Welpley-Hill , in the Parish of Chesham, in Bucks .</p>
               <p>Q. What, you live there, do you?</p>
               <p>Dell. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose Lambs were they?</p>
               <p>Dell. Mine and my Brothers.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of those Lambs belong to you; how many belong'd to you?</p>
               <p>Dell. About five of them belong'd to me, more or less.</p>
               <p>Court. All 20 belong'd to your Brother and you; pray which of them were the Widow's?</p>
               <p>Dell. She is my Mother, and we go on together.</p>
               <p>Court. Now give an Account in relation to these Lambs.</p>
               <p>Dell. We lost them out of the Grounds the 12th of June last; I came up to Smithfield at Ten the next Morning, thinking they might be brought there; but I found them on the Road in Henden Parish, about the Five-Mile Stone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Prisoner with them?</p>
               <p>Dell. No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Bowden. My Lord, as my Man was on the Road with a Drove of my Lambs, I overtook him and the Prisoner at the Bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the Prisoner any Lambs?</p>
               <p>Bowden . No, my Lord, none that I saw; he had a Scythe upon his Shoulder and a Bundle in his Hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that you overtook this Man and the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Bowden. Just beyond the Seventeen-Mile Stone at Watford .</p>
               <p>Q. What Day was this ?</p>
               <p>Bowden. On a Wednesday, the 11th of June .</p>
               <p>Q. What more ha ve you to say ?</p>
               <p>Bowden. When I came up, my Man said, now you may talk with my Master about your Lambs yourself; so Crips, pull'd off his Hat to me, and said, How do you do Master Bowden? I said , I do not know you; said he, I understand you sell Lambs at London; I wish I had known it, I would have brought a Lot of Lambs for you to have sold for me. He told me he liv'd at Aston-Cliston ; I said that was a pretty Way; but he said my Lambs are not kept at Aston-Clifton, they are at Chosberg ; that Keeping was short and the Butcher could take but few at a Time, and he wanted to sell them all together. He said, I have a good Mind to leave my Scythe and Bundle at your House; I am a pretty good Walker, and if I can get away at Two or Three o'Clock I can bring them; and away he went, so I never saw any more of him. I went to Hempstead Market on Thursday. I ask'd my Wife whether she had seen the Man with the Lambs; I said, I wish it is not a bad Thing. On Friday Morning I was at Smithfield; about Ten o'Clock Mr. Dell came to me; he said to me, don't your Man Peter drive for you now? I said yes; he ask'd if any Body else drove Lambs for me; I said, there is a Man come through Edgworth Turnpike, and had no Money; but said he was bringing twenty Lambs to sell at Smithfield Market for me. I said to Mr. Dell, be so good as to go into the Alehouse and I'll take Care of him; but he never brought the Lambs at all: I said, we will go back to see if we can't find these Lambs. We came to - Bridge; the Man said he saw a Fellow pelting them along with Stones, about Six o'Clock, very dirty and much tir'd. I told Mr. Dell we would ride up towards Hendon, where we heard nothing of them; but found them at last in the Road in Hendon Parish: When me met with them no Body was with them; but discovering they were his Lambs we drove them home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter at the Oratory at Brompton, which is a religious order of men. The dwelling house of the clergymen, the Rev. Mr. Faber and others, communicates with the church by a covered passage—on 3rd Dec., at 10 o'clock, I closed all the doors of the church that had been open, went out at the front door, closed and double locked it—about 4 o'clock next morning I received information, and went into the church to see if I could find anybody—I found the folding doors at the end of the church unbolted from the inside—I bolted them after me, went through the church, and found the door communicating with the house unlocked and on the jar—I went through it, fastened it after me, and went into the house to see if I could find any thief, but did not—(about twenty-four gentlemen live in the house)—I then went to the lodge where I live, and at 5 minutes after 6 o'clock in the morning, as near as I can say, I went to the church again, and missed the poor box and two offering boxes—I have seen them since, and know them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of No. 6, Montpelier-road, Brompton. I know the prisoner by his being at work in the employment where I was—on 3rd Dec, about a quarter past 1 o'clock in the day, I saw him at the top of Hill-street, about a quarter of a mile from the Oratory—, he asked me how I was getting on—I said, "Very well," and that I did not wish to be getting on better—I asked him how he was getting on—he said, "Very badly," and that it was his intention to rob the Oratory that night at 1 o'clock—(I was then working at Lord Howard's, at Rutland Gate)—I said that he was going to do a very wrong thing—he said that he did not care—he went down Hill-street, and I immediately went to the Oratory, and gave information.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He has been committed for twelve months. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I will not deny that I was in prison—it is about five years ago, for stealing, but I did not steal, it was the person who was with me—I got twelve months, and he had seven years—that is the only time I have been in prison—I am twenty-one years old.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. What he has stated is quite wrong; he told Anderson to get the silver. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I know that there is such a person as Anderson, but I did not tell him to get the silver—I did not speak to him about this matter—he was with the prisoner when he said that he was going to rob the Oratory—I work at the Oratory now, half a day, in the morning, and half a day at Lord Howard's—the prisoner got the place, and I got into Lord Howard's—the prisoner was not working at the Oratory when this happened—I gave information to Father Balston about half-past 1 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the priests of the Oratory, and reside there. There are three boxes kept at the church, fastened against the wall—two are for the congregation to put in their offerings, and the other is the poor box—on 4th Dec. I saw some marks on the wall of the refectory, which is part of the dwelling house, and in the course of the morning I found half a button on the ground underneath the window</p>

               <p>inside, which I gave to the constable—there is a communication from the refectory to the church by going down the corridor into the narrow corridor, which leads into the church—the boxes were fastened to the wall by screws, which were not fixed very tightly in—I do not know what they contained—the last witness gave me information, but later than he says—it was about half past 3 o'clock, I think—I scarcely believed that what he said was likely to happen, but mentioned it to some of the other Fathers, and we had a man in the house to watch that night, named Nolan—he is not here—he was placed in the corridor—I gave information to Munser, the porter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener, of No. 1, Chapel-place, near the Oratory. I occasionally work in Brompton churchyard—I went to work there on 4th Dec., at about 10 minutes past 9 o'clock; part of it is culti<lb></lb>vated as a kitchen garden—I found some alms boxes there, which I thought were from the parish church, but did not touch them; I only went within four or five yards of them—I went in a state of consternation to the church, then returned, took one of them up, saw the inscription on it, and knew where it belonged to—about ten minutes afterwards I went to the Oratory, and found one of the Fathers and a constable—I took the constable to the boxes, and he took charge of them.</p>

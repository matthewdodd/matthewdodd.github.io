            . On the 4th of March, I had been spending the evening at Somers Town, and was returning home about twelve o'clock, I was quite sober; as I turned round <placeName id="t18170416-9-crimeloc52">Red Lion-street</placeName>

One of them came behind me, and the rest surrounded me, and forcibly pushed me against the shutters, when one of them struck me a violent blow in the face. I got away, and the prisoner came up to me by himself, I had seen him with the others before, he pushed me against the wall, and put his fist in my face, as if he meant to strike me, which threw me off my guard, he then drew my watch out and ran away; I pursued him, and the other men ran after me, we went up Featherstone-street, down Hand-court into Holborn again, and then through Brownlow-street into Bedford-row, I kept calling out stop thief! he fell down, was secured and taken to the watch-house; three or four men went to the watch-house with me, I believe they were part of the gang; they were searched, but nothing was found on them, or the prisoner. I am sure the prisoner is the man, I did not lose sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. I am near-sighted. I did not see him do any thing with the watch, nor was it found upon him.</p>
               <p>ROBERT ANDERSON. I am a watchman. On the 4th of March, about twelve o'clock, I heard the alarm and ran towards the sound, the prisoner was running towards me, I made a catch at him, and he fell, I then secured him; he said he did not take it, but the other man did; the prosecutor said he was the man. Five or six men came up, and said I should not take him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. If he had thrown the watch away I must have seen him.</p>
               <p>JOHN CARRINGTON. I picked up the watch in Bedford-street, about three o'clock in the morning. It is not bruised.</p>

            . On the 17th of September I was in London fields, I saw the prisoner with two bundles of calico, walking across the fields; I had no suspicion of his being a thief, I thought he might be some washerwoman's husband. I first saw him in a ditch in a field looking over the property; I saw some lads run across the field; it gave me suspicion that it was stolen property; he was stopped at New Haggerston by

               <p>JAMES CHAPMAN. I am a gardener; I saw the prisoner coming across the fields at New Haggerston with two bundles, which I took to be dirty linen.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the calico now in question - A. Yes. - When I first saw him he was walking quite fast, and seeing it done up in a rough way I suspected him; this was about eleven o'clock; there were two or three boys following of him; I heard one of them say you did not come honestly by that; I stopped him, he said he bought it in Kingsland road.</p>
               <p>Q. You took him with the assistance of the last witness Avory - A. Yes. Then he said he bought it in Shoreditch; I told him he must shew me the shop, he said no, he should not; then I took him in custody and took him down to Worship street. At Worship street he said he bought it at Woolwich.</p>

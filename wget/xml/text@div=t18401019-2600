                  </hi>. I am in the service of William Tucker, an ironmonger' at Brentford. The prisoner, Henry Witham, was in his employ for about twelve months—he worked on the premises—it was my duty to give him out materials to work on—he used his master's tools—this piece of metal which was bought by Mr. Solomon's nephew I believe belonged to Mr. Tucker—about three weeks previous I gave the prisoner a quantity of these metal spoons to melt down to solder, which he never produced—here are a pair of soldering-irons which were found at his house afterwards—he was authorised to take them away to do work with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Henry Witham. Q.</hi> How do you know these spoons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe them to be my master's by their appearance—there is no particular mark on them—in my judgment they look like the same—I can swear to them from the make of them, and from the handles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any other piece of copper or brass that you can speak to with more certainty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is not—only a screw-driver, which was found at the prisoner's house, with Mr. Tucker's initials on it—he had no right to take that without leave—we can hardly tell whether such is missing—we had such, and as far as my judgment goes, I believe them to be my master's—the prisoner has had frequently to go out to do work with this kind of metal, but he ought to have brought what he did not use back—I suppose this to be the same that was delivered to him—this piece</p>

               <p>of brass screw was sold to Solomon, and I have the cap which fits it—I can swear I gave this to him to do a job with—he did the job, but did not bring the remains back—he had no right to dispose of any—I never saw Mary Witham there—she was not allowed to come.</p>

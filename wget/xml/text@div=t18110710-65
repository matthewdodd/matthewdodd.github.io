               <p>Antonio's Defence. The men cut my head.</p>
               <p>King's Defence. I had that little knife in my hand going to eat bread and meat, one man came, I do not know which it is. This man was going past, he said, ho, ho, and then the other men came after him; one cut my head with a cutlass, I began to run away; one came after me and catched me; in about two or three minutes after that they tied my hand to his, he asked me where my watch is, I saw no watch at all, he took my hat off, he said he took the watch out of my hat. I never saw the watch.</p>

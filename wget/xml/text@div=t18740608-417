                  </hi>. I live at 4, Pierpoint Terrace, Upper Street, Islington—I did live at 6, Wood-Street—I left there about three months ago; I can't say exactly how long it is, I should think about six weeks—I was living there at the time I was examined before the Magistrate—I am single, and an unfortunate woman—I know the prisoners—I went to live with them, at No. 3, Sermon Lane, Islington, last October twelve months I think; before that, I had lived with them in St. George's Road, Holloway—up to 12th February, 1873, I was living with them in Sermon Lane, until I went to the hospital, on Wednesday morning, 12th February, 1873—I did not know them before I went to live with them—I was in the family way when to the hospital on Wednesday morning, 12th February, 1873—I passed as Mr. and Mrs. Alexander—it was a house of ill-fame—the hospital I went to was St. Saviour's, Upper Holloway—I had made inquires, three or four weeks before I went there, whether I could be taken in—the two prisoners took me there in a cab, and I was confined there the same day, early in the <hi rend="italic">morning-</hi>—the female prisoner came there to see me on the ninth day, and brought me a bottle of port wine—she came again, and brought me some little refreshment, such as cakes, or something like that, and some cooked ham, and she brought some linen to the sister for me—I took with me some baby's clothing of my own when I went in—I took what was necessary for the child, a change of clothes—I took all the things necessary to put on an infant, I had bought that myself—I remember a letter coming to the hospital from Alexander, on 27th February, the day before I left—I after<lb></lb>wards saw Alexander destroy that letter; it was addressed to me by the name of Jessie Smart—I entered the hospital in that name—it was the prisoners' proposal that I should change my name—Alexander did not sign. any name to the letter. only "Your brother"—before I went into the hospital, I had been going by the name of Miss Edwards—the sister in charge first read the letter to me, and I read it afterwards—he said in the letter that he would take me to Manchester—I know Alexander's writing, that letter, was written by him—next day he came, alone—he saw sister Elizabeth—I was prepared to go away with him, with my child, I came down into the waiting-room to see him, he asked me if I was willing to go, and I said "Yes," I dressed the child that morning, it had on a little calico night dress, with a frill of the same round the neck, a shirt trimmed round the sleeves with white lace, a white flannel petticoat, a white flannel roller, two or three times round the stomach, and a white cotton band—it was rather a delicate child, a girl; it had sore eyes, they were red, and very much inflamed—the nurse, Cotton, used to sponge it, and attend to it—it</p>

               <p>had a birth mark over the right eye, it was not very large, I suppose about half an inch—the child was christened before it was taken away, but not en<lb></lb>tered into the Church of England, it was christened by a gentleman named Fleming, the chaplain of the hospital—Miss Cotton stood. as godmother, and Alexander stood as sponsor—it was called, Ada Mary Smart, I suggested the name—both the sister and Miss Cotton asked me to call and see them again when it was convenient, they should like to know how I was getting on, they all wished me well—I left the hospital with Alexander, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon; we walked away—I carried the baby—there was a wrap put on it, a shawl that Alexander brought with him—it was a grey and black shawl, a mixture, with a reddish looking border—I should know it again—I had seen it before in the prisoner's house—Clifford has worn it several times, and I afterwards saw Alexander wearing it, after I had parted with the child, three or four different times—the sister at the hospital placed the shawl round the child, and I carried it away with the shawl on, it was a cold night—we went together as far as the Nag's Head, at the comer of Seven Sisters Road and Holloway Road, that is about ten minutes' walk from the hospital—we met Clifford outside—she appeared to be wait<lb></lb>ing—she asked how I felt, was I better in health—we went into the Nag's Head together, into the coffee-room, and had some refreshment—Clifford took the child from me in the coffee-room—we stopped there about half-an-hour—the child continued to have the shawl on—Clifford took off the hood that they had given me' at the hospital, and put on a scarlet hood which she brought with her—I saw her take it out of a parcel, and she placed a piece of brown linsey on the baby underneath the shawl; she brought that with her—she had it doubled four times and placed it round the child—no other alteration was made in its dress—I should know the linsey again—we all three left the Nag's Head together, Clifford carrying the child—we went up the Camden Road, and up a turning opposite the Brecknock tavern, to a small public-house, on the left, the Copenhagen Arms—we only remained there a few minutes—we had some refreshment there—we all three left together, Clifford carried the child—we then went to the Commercial coffee-shop in the Hampstead Road; that was about a quarter-of-an-bour or twenty minutes' walk from the Copenhagen Arms—Alexander and I went in there—Clifford, was asked if she would come in—she said no, she did not feel hungry, and she did not come in, and I and Alexander went in without her—Clifford still had the child—Alexander called for some refresh<lb></lb>ment and immediately left me—I remained there about half-an-hour—he returned alone—I have never seen the child from that day to this—I should think it was between 5.30 and 6 o'clock when I was at the coffee-house—when Alexander returned I asked him where my child was—he said it was all right, and that Lizzie, meaning Clifford, would meet us at the Victoria public-house at King's Cross—he usually called her Lizzie—I did not know that she was going to take my child away—I expected to see her with it at the Victoria, that is about half-an-hour's walk from the coffee-house—I went with Alexander to the Victoria—it was then getting dark—it must have been between 6 and 7 o'clock—we went into the Victoria and remained there about a quarter or half-an-hour—I did not see anything of Clifford or the baby—I asked Alexander where she was—he said he would go out and look for her—he went out and came back and said he could not find her, and I also looked about myself, but could not see her, and I then asked him if he would take me home in a cab—I felt very fatigued and tired—he took me</p>

               <p>home in a cab to 3, Sermon Lane, where they were living—Clifford was not at home—she came in in about an hour and a half without the baby—I asked her where my baby was—she said it was in good hands, she had placed it out to nurse, and she said I had to pay them seven shillings weekly for it—Alexander was present the whole time—she did not tell me where the woman lived—they never would tell me—they never told me any name—they told me afterwards that she lived twenty miles away in the country—they said I was not to worry, it was in safe hands—I asked them many times where the child was, and they told me it was all right and they would take me to see it—that was some time afterwards—I paid seven shillings the third week after I came out of the hospital—I paid it to Clifford—I paid it to both in the presence of both—I continued paying the seven shillings a week to them from time to time until about four or five months ago—I paid them altogether for about twelve months—I made them some payments after I went. to live at Wood Street, in December—I can't tell when I left the prisoners—I have my rent book here which will show—it was some months before Christmas—I continued to pay the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week all the time I was living with them and also after I went to Wood Street—it was about two or three months after the child was taken away that they said it was twenty miles in the country—I asked them several times if they would give me the address where the child lived—they said if they gave me the address where the people lived that had my child it would be making them out story tellers, because they had told them it was their own child—I never had the address—I asked them again afterwards where the child was, and they said it was about twenty miles in the country, and if I saved up 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. they would take me to see it—the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to pay my fare there—they were always both present when these conversations took place—"the third time I paid the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. they asked if I would give them some extra money for clothes for my baby—they did not say how much, as much as I could afford—and on several occasions I gave them 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., instead of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to go towards the clothes—they never told me whether they had purchased clothes—when I was living in Wood Street Alexander came to me several times for money—he used to say that he had come for the payment for the child—on one occasion I pledged my waterproof cloak to get some money to pay them the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I sent Bertha Colvin to pledge it—she was a lodger in the same house in Wood Street—it was not a house of the same description as the prisoner's—it was said to be a respectable house, it was not a house of ill fame—Colvin pledged the cloak and brought me back 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave part of it to Alexander, I had some, and I took part of that to make up the difference—I paid the prisoners 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for my lodging in Sermon Lane and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. extra for clean linen—when I first went to them I paid Is. a day for my board, afterwards I paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week, 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day—I did not pay them anything else only the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the baby—besides this I was paying 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for the support. of a former child which was born in 1871—that child was being nursed by a Mr. and Mrs. Masters, at 99, Grove Street, Park Street, Mother Red Cap—I sent the prisoners to Masters while I was in the hospital to pay 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for me—Mr. Masters came to me in Sermon Lane the Sunday after I got out of the hospital—I don't remember whether I paid him any money then—I sometimes took the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. myself to the Masters, and sometimes sent it by post office order—I generally paid it myself—they had the child until last Friday—I paid them the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week regularly until then</p>

               <p>—I took it then because they had no one to leave it with while I was here—when I sent the post office orders I got Alexander to write me a note, because I thought he could word it better than I could—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the pawn ticket for the waterproof cloak; it is dated 29th January this year—at the end of March this year I was living in Wood Street, Cromer Street—Alexander fetched me out of a night some times; I have often gone out with him of a night—we have often had words about my child; I have asked him where it was, and he has refused to tell me—that has occurred on several occasions—I had a disturbance with him at the end of March about 12.30 at night, or in the morning—he came up to me in Upper Street, Islington, and asked what I meant by telling my landlady and a lodger in the house about him and my child—I said that was my business—he up with his hand to strike me; then I spoke in a loud voice, and asked him what he had done with my child; I asked him to produce it, and I asked him whether he had murdered it or not, or what had he done with it—I repeated that over several times, until I was dragged away by one of the lodgers of my old landlady, who I am living with at the present time—I had got very much excited, and a great crowd assembled—Alexander did not make any answer to my charges, that I know of, but he came across to the house where they took me to and told the landlady that he was going to the police station to bring two policemen to give me in charge—he did not say for what—that was all that took place that night—next day he came to Wood Street and left this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) it is his writing—it is directed to Mrs. Glendale—she was one of the lodgers there—she read it, and showed it to me, and I read it. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 31st April</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">and professed to give a history of the transaction; it stated that after leaving the home the prisoner told him (Alexander) that she had left her baby with a woman, as she had previously arranged; but that three weeks after she said she had left it upon a step in the Hampstead Road—that from motives of compassion he had abstained from mentioning it, but as she now persisted in accusing him of having murdered the child, he was determined to have the whole matter settled; and as it was in the hands of Kelly, the detective, he should advise her to get out of the way for a long lime to come.</hi>)—Mrs. Young was my landlady in Wood Street—I saw Clifford the next morning after the row with Alexander—I went to her apartments at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Pierpoint terrace—I first sent Bertha Colvin to ask her to come over to the public-house, where I was—she did not come; and I and Colvin went to her—I asked her what she had done with my baby—she said that was her business—I said "If you will tell me where it is I will bother you no further"—and Colvin said "I should think you are sorry you spoke; you spoke out of your turn"—Clifford again said that was her business—we tnen left—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the shawl my baby was wrapped in when she was taken from the hospital, which I have seen both the prisoners wearing; but it has been altered since—I saw it round the prisoner Clifford's shoulders' that very same night about an hour and a half after I had parted with my child when she came home—I did not see it again after that till the last cold weather, about four or five months ago, because it was pledged—I then saw it around Alexander's shoulders at the Victoria public-house, Kings Cross—that was before the row in Upper Street—we had some rows before that, but nothing to speak of—Clifford told me that the shawl was pledged the morning after I saw it round her shoulders, the morning after I came home from my confinement; they said they were short of money—this is the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When Clifford took the child away this linsey was wrapped round its body and this shawl was also wrapped round it and within an hour and a half of my return to Sermon Lane I saw the female prisoner wearing that same shawl—I wore it before I went to the hospital—it is Clifford's shawl—she lent it to me to wear from time to time before I went to the Home to be confined—I know a Mrs. Field—I did not ask Clifford to lend me the shawl before I went to the Home in order that Mrs. Field might not detect that I was in the family way—I asked her to lend it me to keep me warm—it was not because I had not one of my own, I had one of my own, I did not wear it because it was of too bright a color—that was my only reason—I believed the story they told me that night that my child had been put out to nurse—I asked where it had gone to—they said it was all right; that was all I asked about it that night—I made no remark about the shawl—it was about three or four months after that I heard the child was twenty miles in the country—I did not ask where it was till then—I had often asked them where it was, I used to ask them every time I paid the money and that was every week and they always told me it was all right and well cared for—I did not understand you when I said I did not ask for three or four months—their answer did not quite satisfy me—I asked for the address where the child was, they said if they gave the address it would be making them out story tellers—that conversation did not take place at the time they said it was twenty miles off, it was before that—it did not satisfy me—I did not ask them any further questions upon that, I asked them each week where the child was—I asked them who took it into the country, they said the woman they had left it with—they did not say where they had left it with the woman—I did not ask them—I did not ask whe<lb></lb>ther Clifford had taken it down into the country that night to the woman—I asked where the woman lived, not that same night I did not, I asked them the night they said it was twenty miles away—I asked the name of the place—they said it was only about twenty miles away—they said the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to pay their fare; I believed that to take us three twenty miles into the country—on the night of the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> in Islington with Alexander, he did not to my knowledge make any answer to what I said—he did not call a policeman, to my knowledge—I said before the Magistrate "I don't know what answer he made, I was so excited, I repeated it several times and he call<lb></lb>ed for a policeman"—he did call for a policeman—I don't know whether the policeman came, I was dragged away—I did see a policeman but I don't know whether they were coming for me or not—I saw two sergeants coming down the street—I did not see whether he spoke to them or not—I could see that they were police sergeants by the stripes on their arms—I had not an opportunity of seeing whether he spoke to them or not, for I saw them coming down the street before I had any <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with him at all—I heard that he went to the station with them—it is correct that I went to Clifford's apartment the next evening—there is no mistake about that—it was be<lb></lb>tween ten and twelve—it was not the same night—I said before the Magis<lb></lb>trate" the night I called out to Alexander in the street I went to No. 5.

I 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to go in—it was all composed of my own money—I entered in the name of Jessie Smart—I had not said anything to Clifford before I went to the Home about my fear that the child would suffer from the same disorder that I had while I was in the family-way, not that I remember—I think I did say so—I had already had a child named Lilly—that child was not suffering from scrofula—that was the child that the trial was about—it was born in June, 1871, after the trial—it was affiicted with a touch of the bad disorder which I had suffered from before its birth—I remember a conversation with Clifford, in which I mentioned to her that Lilly was suffering from the remnants of the" had disorder, and I think I then expressed my fears that my second child would be affected in the same way—I said I did not wish the girls in the neighbour<lb></lb>hood to know it, if the child was born in that state—Clifford came to the Home to see me before this letter was received from Alexander—she saw the child—she came about three times and saw it on each occasion—I don't know whether the child was suffering from the same kind of symptoms as Lilly had been suffering—it had sore eyes—I think I said something about</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon and medical officer to St. Pancras Workhouse, and am a M.R.C.S.—on the night of 28th February last year, shortly after 9 o'clock, I saw a female child at the workhouse—it had great difficulty of breathing; it seemed in an exhausted condition; it was also suffering from opthalmia, inflammation of the lining membrane of the eyelids, what would be properly called sore eyes; and it was a thin, delicate child—there was nothing specially to indicate that the opthalmia arose from any syphilitic complaint; it would not be unlikely—I did not consider it with that view; it frequently arises simply from cold—the child appeared to be about ten days or a fortnight old—it was suffering from congestion of the lungs; that became worse, and passed on into inflammation of the lungs and bronchial tubes—the congestion had evidently not existed long; it was in the first stage of inflammation; it might only have been an hour, or a few hours; it comes on very quickly in children—I saw the child from day to day—it died on the evening of 12th March—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the cause of death was congestion and inflammation of the lungs—exposure to the cold in the way described would be a very likely cause of that—the brain and other organs were all fairly healthy;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187406080046"></xptr>
               <p>they were small and weak, but there was no special disease—it weighed 3 1/2 lbs. at the time of death—it was known in the workhouse as Mary Albany.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It would not be an uncommon or unlikely thing if a woman, during the period of gestation, suffered from syphilis, that the child should be born with eyes in that state—the congestion of the lungs was evidently in the first stage; therefore I conclude that it could not have lasted long, not more than a few hours—it is caused by different things besides exposure to the cold; it is liable to come on from other causes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If it comes on before exposure, the cold would increase it and make it worse.</p>

                  </hi>. I now live at 99, Grove Street, Camden Town—in February, 1873, I was living at 6, Howland Mews West, Tottenham Court Road—I know the prosecutrix—my wife took charge of a child for her, called Lilly, somewhere about a year and nine months ago—we received 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week for its keep—I knew the prosecutrix as Miss Edwards—we some<lb></lb>times received the money by a post-office order, and sometimes Miss Edwards used to call and pay my wife the money—there was generally a letter accompanying the post-office order—Inspector Taylor has some of them—they were always signed "George Alexander"—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the letters—two or three times, on a Sunday morning, I have taken the child to see its mother when she lodged at Alexander's in Sermon Lane and sometimes, previous to that, in St. George's Road, Holloway—I never had any conversation with Alexander about these letters, or who sent the post-office orders—I saw both the prisoners on a Thursday in February, 1873; I should think it would be about the Thursday week before I received this letter dated the 24th. (<hi rend="italic">The prosecutrix slated this letter to be in Clifford's writing, and the others in Alexander's.</hi>) They came to my place where I worked, 44, Cleveland Street, Fitzroy Square, a timber yard—Alexander said "I have come respecting Miss Edwards. I have received a letter from her this morning; she has gone down to some friends in Corn<lb></lb>wall to be confined. You know what things are in this world; you must have noticed that she was in the family way, though I believe it was always her wish that she should never let it be known to Mrs. Masters"—we went over to a public-house, and had a glass of ale together, and in the course of conversation at the bar he said the child was dead—he paid me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for one week's keep of the other child, and asked me to give him a receipt for it, which I did—Clifford was at the bar with him when this took place—they then went down to my place to see my wife, and I went back to my work, and when I went home to dinner at 1 o'clock, they were just about going away; I saw them at the door—after receiving this letter of 24th February, I went and called on the prisoners in Sermon Lane; I think about a fort<lb></lb>night after—I believe I received the letter on the Tuesday, and on the following Sunday week I went to see them—I saw Miss Edwards there—some time after this, one of my daughters was ill, and the child Lilly was sent to the prisoners' to be taken care of. (<hi rend="italic">The letter of</hi> 24<hi rend="italic">th February</hi>, 1873, <hi rend="italic">was from Alexander to the witness, stating that he had received a letter from Miss Edwards informing him of her satisfactory recovery, and to expect her home on the Friday or Saturday, and requesting the witness to call on the Sunday.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—I have had charge of the child Lilly since September, 1872—she was then about fifteen months old—she was put under my charge by Miss Edwards—I agreed to take her at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—she told me that she was a machinist—in August, 1873, my daughter was ill for about ten days, and died—at that time Lilly went away from us for six weeks—I wrote to the mother to fetch her home—I fetched her back some time in December last year—with that exception she has been with me until she was taken away last Friday, and I have received 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for the care of her—sometimes the mother paid me, and some<lb></lb>times I was paid by post-office orders sent by Mr. Alexander—in February, 1873, I remember seeing the prisoners; I think it was the 14th or 15th; it was nine or ten days before this letter came—they had seen my husband first, and then came to me together—Alexander said he had come from Miss Edwards or Miss Southey, and that he had paid my husband 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that was due, that Miss Edwards was confined, that she had gone into the country; he did not tell me what part—I said how shocking it was, and was it a girl or a boy—he said "A girl"—I asked if she had a father to provide for it—he said "No, the child is dead"—the female prisoner was present when that was said.</p>

I live at 6, Wood Street, Cromer Street—I have known Miss Southey between five and six months, when she was living at 6, Wood Street—I have seen Alexander come to the house repeatedly, to see her, and they used sometimes to go out together—I have seen her give him money on two or three occasions—on one occasion she sent me to pawn a waterproof mantle, which I did, for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave her the money—this is the ticket—I knew her by the name of Eliza Parker—at the end of March last I was with her in the Star and Garter public-house, Islington—she sent me to ask for Mrs. Alexander at No. 5 in some street opposite the Star and Garter—I think this was about the 31st March, and between 11 and 12 o'clock in the morning—I saw the female prisoner, and said she was wanted at the Star and Garter—she said who wanted her was to come to her—I went back and told the prosecutrix, and we both went across to the female prisoner—I asked her what she had done with the girl's child—she said that was her business and not mine—I said "Perhaps you will be sorry you spoke"—I asked her again what she had done with the child, and she gave me the same reply—the mother stamped her foot and said "Have you murdered it?" and she again replied that was her business.</p>

Have you murdered it?"—a young woman, who is now dead, laid hold of her arm, and took her across the road—two policemen came up and spoke to Alexander, but I did not hear him say anything—he went across the road to 4, Pierpoint Terrace; he then went to the station, and I followed him, and heard him make a complaint about a female annoying him in the street—I afterwards went with Taylor when he apprehended Clifford—I took Alexander on 7th May, about 12 o'clock—I said to Alexander "I am going to take you for being con<lb></lb>cerned with a woman you are living with in detaining a female child of Jane Southey"—he said "Very well"—he afterwards turned round to two prosti<lb></lb>tutes who were with him and said "I am going to be taken for that child of <hi rend="italic">Jennies</hi>"—he was then conveyed to the station.</p>

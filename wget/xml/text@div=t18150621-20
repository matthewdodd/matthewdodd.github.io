            . I am shopman to Messrs. Simmons and Jones, I was in the shop on the 20th, and saw the prisoners come in, I served them, they wanted to look at some lace shawls, I cannot say which spoke. I shewed some immediately to them. After turning over a considerable quantity, at last there appeared to be one which they liked, and they asked the price of it. The price was three pounds ten shillings; she did not approve of the price. I mean Thompson did not. They were going out, I stood chattering to them at the door, and at length I got them in again, I then lowered the price to two pounds fifteen shillings, and she bid me two pounds ten shillings, and which I agreed to take. I put it into a paper, and Joscelyn took out three one-pound notes and gave them to me. I went into the adjoining shop to get change, and when I returned into this shop again, I perceived Joscelyn with her right hand upon a shawl, which she was going to steal. I kept my eye upon her. She requested me to reach her a shawl, which she pointed out to try whether the one she had bought, was as long as it, she measured and was satisfied. While I was reaching, she pulled some shawls with her left hand, over her right hand, to avoid being seen, and she then took a shawl with her right hand, and put it into her pocket. She then expressed herself satisfied with the shawl she had bought. I wrapped it up in paper. She said, good afternoon, I have stolen that piece. I directly jumped over the counter, took hold of her by the arm, and I was putting her up four pair of stairs, into a passage to take her into a room to search her, she threw the shawl from her into the passage. I saw it fall from her about a yard. I called to Mr. Simmons, who came to my assistance. I did not see Thompson do any thing. She did not try to run away, if she choosed she might have escaped.</p>

               <p>MR. SIMMONS. I was called into the shop by Pike, and saw the shawls on the ground. I sent for a constable, Burn was his name.</p>

On the 11th of June, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner rolling it away, he had got nearly to the top of the lane, about fifty yards - I ran and caught him just round the corner, and asked what he was going to do with it - he said he was going to roll it over to the owners', Messrs. Potts' - there was a brand mark on the head, with their name on it; it is a vinegar pipe. I went for a constable, and gave him in charge - he was going towards Messrs. Potts'; it is not usual to take them away without our leave.</p>

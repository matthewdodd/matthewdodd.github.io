                  </hi>. I live in Baker's-rents, Hackney-road. About seven or eight o'clock, in the evening of the 3rd of October, I was in Baker's rents, close to the prisoner's house, with some more boys at play, and heard the screams of "Murder"—we ran through a fence, looked over, and saw a quarrelling—I saw the prisoner take a poker or stick up, or whatever it was, and strike a blow athwart the bead of Catherine Hall with it—one part of it fell on the ground—it was about the thickness of my thumb—she ran out of doors, bleeding dreadfully, and fainted away, opposite the fence where it was done—we ran round and fetched a police<lb></lb>man—the woman bled very much indeed at the head—a doctor was sent. for directly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. Catherine Hall is the prisoner's daughter-in-law—in consequence of information, I went and apprehended the prisoner—my brother officer told him what it was for—his wife was lying ill in bed at the time—I asked the prisoner what it was done with—the wife said, "With the poker"—I took it up, and the prisoner said, "No, it was not the poker, it was the tongs"—I took them up and said, "Why they are broken"—he said, "Yes, I broke them over her head"—in going to the station-house, he said it was done for love—and at the station-house he said it served her right, and he would be d----d if he would not do it again—the tongs were broken in half, fresh.</p>

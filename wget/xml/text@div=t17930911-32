               <p>Court to Mrs. Doggett. Did you ever find any thing besides this petticoat that is mentioned in the indictment? - No, never. I had bound the petticoat the same morning, I had left it on the chest that was broke open.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, Did not you swear to another person before the justice? - I took them both up; this was committed for taking the petticoat, and the other for robbing the lodging.</p>

               <p>Court to Mrs. Dogget. What is your trade? - My husband is no trade at all; we <rs id="t17930911-32-viclabel180" type="occupation">keep an old iron shop</rs>

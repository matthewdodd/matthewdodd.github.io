               <p>I think it was on Thursday the 5th, I received information that there were some people at the prisoner Tatham's, with a quantity of silk; Mr. White happened to be at the office, I took him with me to Mr. Tatham's house, in Drury-lane; I think it was No. 65, if I mistake not; Tatham and the other two were in the parlour, there were Tatham, Francis, and M'Donald, I know nothing at all of Sullivan; we searched the house, and in the shop under the counter, in the front room, we found several things; it is a shop where they sell ribbons and handkerchiefs, and things of that sort, Tatham keeps the shop.</p>
               <p>What did you find in the back room? - After searching that, I asked what rooms they had, and he told me there was a back kitchen, and I think a one pair of stairs; I sent Macmanus up for the key of the kitchen, and I stood by while he took this and a dark lanthorn out of the back kitchen; these three men were in the back parlour, there was no property there.</p>
               <p>What were these three men about? - They were standing upright round the table, I made no other observation, there was a paper laying before them, which contained some account, that paper, I believe, is in the hands of Mr. Jealous, this was on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. White. Look at the several articles that are produced? - I do, I have measured them since the robbery; and they all agree with the number book, and as for the waistcoat piece, some of the pieces were cut off for my children, and I have them also, and they all correspond.</p>
               <p>This piece corresponded with the number opposite to this in your number book? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you swear that you had such things in your house on the 31st of October? - I can.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you any doubt that they are yours? - None in the world.</p>

               <p>I went into the back parlour, I saw Tatham sitting by the fire, and M'Donald and Francis sitting round a little mahogany table, then Macmanus secured Francis and M'Donald, and I searched Tatham; on Tatham I found twenty guineas, and upon the table lay a piece of paper with some writing upon it; I then left Macmanus in the parlour, and came into the shop where I was present when the silks were found, but not when the silk damask was found; this is the paper that was on the table.</p>
               <p>Did you find anything else there? - I found a glove there.</p>
               <p>Can you explain what it means? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. According to the position of the prisoners sitting round the table, there appeared to be a kind of settlement of money, here is 514 which comes near the sum of the goods which were missing (The paper contained two articles 310 and 204 and another class of figures of pounds and shillings, 19 l. 14 s.) the 514 yards comes near the goods that are now missing, there was a yard that seemed not to have been long made use off, lay by the place where they were; Mr. Clarke said to the people, what I see you have been measuring, there lay the yards, and we absolutely thought this was the money that was found on Tatham, and that the other was the goods which they had sold which was deficient; there are seven hundred and nine yards missing, and there are two hundred recovered, now here is five hundred and fourteen.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220016"></xptr>Court. Was any answer given by either of the prisoners when Clark said, I see you have been measuring? - No, I did not take any notice, but they all denied knowing any thing of the paper, though it lay before them on the table, nobody knew any thing of the hand writing or any thing.</p>
               <p>That was all the observation you made on the paper? - It was.</p>
               <p>(The paper handed to the Court and Jury.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan to Mr. White. M'Donald and Francis were searched, I believe, before you, were they not? - They were searched, and there was some money.</p>
               <p>Who took the money? - One of the officers.</p>
               <p>Which of them? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court to Clarke. Do either of you know whether any money was found on either of the prisoners besides Tatham? - Yes, Macmanus has it.</p>
               <p>Court to Clarke. In what condition were these goods? - They were rather in a rough state, they lay simply just as they do now, any body that is used to silk would not let them lay so.</p>

               <p>I went to Francis's lodging, on the same day that Mr. Clarke went to Tatham's, I was at Tatham's also; at Francis's I found this in a drawer in his lodgings, which was in Newtoner's-street, this is a piece of crimson damask silk which Mr. White owns; the other which Mr. White says is the same, was found in the back kitchen at Tatham's.</p>
               <p>Mr. White. This is part of the same damask, and corresponds with what we have at home, what we found in Tatham's back kitchen, and this corresponds with the admeasurement, when we took stock in October last, with the addition of this that was found at Francis's, it makes up the quantity exactly, and it is the same pattern.</p>
               <p>Macmanus. In Tatham's back kitchen, where this silk and damask was in a trunk, there was a board looked like an ironing-board stood out, and there was a piece of brown paper, and under the piece of brown paper, this dark lanthorn lay concealed; this damask was not with the rest of the silks, it was in a trunk that was locked, we had the key from Tatham; I went to Francis's afterwards, and found this striped piece in the corner upon a little shelf.</p>
               <p>Mr. White. I called directly to Clarke, and said, here is some of my property, I can swear to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan to Macmanus. You searched the two prisoners, M'Donald and Francis? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You found some money upon them? - Yes, I found two guineas and a half on Francis and on the other, there might be a guinea difference, I returned the money again.</p>
               <p>You found this piece of silk at Francis's lodgings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There are several lodgers in the house, I suppose? - I do not know, it is a neighbourhood I seldom go to.</p>
               <p>You do not know what parties reside in that house? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding, Prisoner Tatham's Counsel. I want to know whether the goods were not found in different places, they were not all in one spot jumbled together? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan to White. This is not an uncommon pattern, I suppose? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>You was not the only person that bought all that was made of this silk? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Then, Sir, is this not a common pattern for a chair cover? - We look upon it as such.</p>
               <p>There or thereabouts? - Yes, I bought them at a sale, a number of them, some I have made use of myself, and some I have sold.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the kitchen up stairs or down stairs? - Down stairs, a back kitchen.</p>

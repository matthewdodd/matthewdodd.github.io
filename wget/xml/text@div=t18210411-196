On the 3d of April a boy (not the prisoner) came about some potatoes; we ordered some - then the prisoner came with the boy; we had not seen him before - they carried the sack of potatoes down stairs together; my mistress had been to the door to look at them. The boys waited down stairs for me to take them the money; some silver spoons were on the kitchen shelf over the dresser; they took the potatoes into the back kitchen. I was cleaning knives while they waited for the money; they were in the kitchen about ten minutes - mistress paid them, and they went away about eleven o'clock. About an hour after they were gone, I missed two salt and a dessert spoon. I saw them at Worship-street last Monday fortnight.</p>

            . Another boy came first, then the prisoner came with him, to take the potatoes down into the back kitchen; they remained there about six minutes while they emptied them. I left them in the passage between the two kitchens. I was up stairs a few minutes; they said they would not have the money till I had tried the potatoes to see if they were good; but when they emptied them, they wanted their money directly: I paid them 18 d. short. After they were gone I missed the spoons, and found them afterwards at the office. The boy asked for the money, the prisoner did not speak; he heard what was said.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ATTFIELD. I am a constable. I took the prisoner into custody on the day mentioned in the indictment. was coming from Walthamstow, and received information of some men who were selling potatoes about Hackney being suspected of a robbery. I met the two; I took the other, and left him in care of a gardener while I run after the prisoner. I caught him, and found the spoons wrapped in paper in his pocket.</p>

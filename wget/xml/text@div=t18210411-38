               <p>GEORGE FOX. I live at Deptford. On the 26th of February, I was at the <placeName id="t18210411-38-crimeloc237">Court of Common Pleas, Guildhall</placeName>

As I felt it going, I put my hand down and caught it - he was the next person to me; others were near enough to do it. I called him a villain, and told him I always put an old one in my pocket when I came to town; he denied it, and left - some people followed him, and I was sent for.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner in custody just by the Court of Common Pleas; a gentleman fetched me to him, and charged him with picking his pocket - he said nothing. I searched him and found a handkerchief round his neck, another in his breeches, between his legs - he had one in his pocket - I found one pair of scissars in his waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to several brass founders to look for work; I went into this place, and staid hearing the trials; the gentleman turned round and charged me with it - I denied it; after that, he went for an officer, who found a handkerchief in my trowsers - my pocket was torn, and I put it there by accident.</p>

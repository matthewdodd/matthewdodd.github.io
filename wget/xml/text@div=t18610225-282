                  </hi>. I am a baker of 14, George-street, Southwark—on Saturday, 9th February, about 8 o'clock, a female came into my shop for a half-quartern loaf—she gave me what appeared to be a half-crown—I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and she left—I put the half-crown in the till—there was no other there—directly she left the shop I took it out, put it on the parlour table, and left it there—I did not then know it was bad—after she went out, the prisoner came in and asked for two half-quartern loaves—I served him; the price was 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he tendered me what I supposed to be a half-crown—I said, "I do not know what I shall do, governor, for I have not any halfpence"—he said, "Give me half a quartern of flour"—that would make it 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had not a sixpence in the till, and I called to my wife to go up stairs and fetch me a shilling, which she did, and I gave the prisoner a</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—I remember my hus<lb></lb>band bringing some money into the parlour on 9th February, and putting it on the table—the prisoner afterwards came in—he is the man—I went up-stairs to bring my husband down a sixpence—when he left the house I looked at the money that he had put on the parlour table—it was a bad half-crown—I gave it to my husband when he came back—I put no money on the table while he was away.</p>

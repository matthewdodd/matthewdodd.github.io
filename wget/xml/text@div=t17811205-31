               <p>I lost my hogs the 10th of October, on old Michaelmas day; I went to work in the morning, about six o'clock, and fed them before I went; in the evening I came home again about six, and the next morning I got up as usual to give them some meat; I made search and could not find them.</p>
               <p>How many had you? - Three.</p>
               <p>Where were they kept? - In the yard; they used to go into the orchard, and sometimes go over the river, into my neighbour's orchard; I sent about noon, to know if they had seen anything of them; I searched all about home, and came as far as Hounslow, to see if I could hear any thing of them at Hounslow market.</p>
               <p>Where did you find them? - I found them at Turnham Green on Thursday.</p>
               <p>When did you lose them? - On Wednesday night, or Thursday morning, I can't say which.</p>
               <p>Where did you find them at Turnham-Green? - I found two at Mr. Keeve's, and one at Mr. Grimsdale's.</p>
               <p>What are they? - Mr. Grimsdale is a baker; one of them was killed and hung up.</p>
               <p>You found two at Keeve's, the one dead and thd other alive? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were they your pigs? - I could not swear to one, by reason it was scalded, and the hair off.</p>
               <p>Did you know the other pigs? - I could swear to the two living.</p>
               <p>How do you know them? - By the marks; one is a black and white, another black all over the loins, and a little bit out of its ear.</p>
               <p>In your observation of the marks, you are able to swear positively to those two? - I have got a man to swear as well as myself.</p>

               <p>What time of the day? - About twelve o'clock, as high as I can guess: I saw this man driving three pigs along the road; I staid there till he came up to me, and then I asked him if they were to be sold; he told me, yes; I asked him what he asked for the black one, he asked me a guinea for it; I told him I would give him eighteen shillings; he said he would not take that, but he would split the difference; I said I would not give him any more, whether I had it or no.</p>
               <p>Did you buy it? - Yes; then he said I should have it, and I put it into the stable, and went to the public house and paid him the money.</p>
               <p>Did you buy one or two? - Only the black one.</p>
               <p>Was the pig you bought the same as the last witness found to be his? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where did he say he got these pigs? - That he had bought them at Uxbridge fair, and sold all but these three the day before.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>How long was you bargaining for these pigs? - About ten or a dozen minutes; and after I paid him, he treated me with a pint of beer; I had another, and I believe we had three.</p>
               <p>You are sure this is the same man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How did he come to be taken up? - I took him up myself.</p>
               <p>How soon after? - About fifteen days after.</p>
               <p>Where did you see him? - He was coming by with a couple more pigs; I happened to be at the public house, and the ostler halloed out, here is a man coming again with two more pigs; I said I did not want no pigs: when the man came up to me, he asked me if I would buy a couple of pigs; I asked him what he asked, and he said 16 s. a piece; he went to the public house, and set himself down, and then I said to him, it is my opinion you was here about a fortnight or three weeks ago; yes, he said he was.</p>
               <p>Did you stop him? - Yes; I had him up to one Mr. Lambe at East Acton.</p>

               <p>Who bought it? - Grimsdale had bought one; I asked him if he would sell the boar pig alone, he said he would not sell it alone; I then told him I would give him thirty-four shillings for them both, he said he would not sell them at that price, but at last he agreed to take the money, and they were drove into my yard.</p>

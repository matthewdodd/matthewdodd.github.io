                  </hi>. I am potboy to Mr. Looby, who keeps the Nag's Head, is Houndsditch. On Wednesday night, 7th Sept., I left my place, at a quarter past 12 o'clock, and was going home—when I got outside my master's house I saw the prisoner and a gentleman together in the street, about two doors from my master's house—I saw her strike the gentleman in the pit of the stomach, and knock him backwards—he fell on the ground—I ran to his assistance, and picked up his hat—I then saw the prisoner with her band in his side pocket; she drew a pocket book from it—she put it under her arm, under her shawl—I was trying to assist the gentleman up; the prisoner was still standing there, but I thought I bad better not make any alarm for the police, or she might run away—as I was trying to help him up, I saw the policeman a little distance from me—as he came towards me, the prisoner turned round, and saw him coming, and threw the pocket book into the middle of the road—I saw that—the policeman picked it up, and took her into custody directly—she was quite close to the gentleman at the time she threw the pocket book away, and then the policeman took hold of her—the gentleman appeared to be very much in liquor—while the constable was holding the prisoner, she said to the gentleman, "Have I robbed you?"—he replied, "I do not know"—at the same time she dropped some silver from her right hand—I believe a gentleman who assisted me to pick up the prosecutor picked up a shilling, and the policeman picked some up—just as the police, man had the prisoner in custody, a young woman passed by, and the prisoner said that that young woman had given her the pocket book to throw away—that was not so; I saw the prisoner take it out, put it under her arm, and afterwards throw it away—the young woman did not have anything to do with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commission agent, and live in Bevis Marks, St. Mary Axe. I was passing through Houndsditch, about 10 minutes past 12 o'clock, on the night in question—I was walking on the side of Duke-street, which is on the opposite side to the Nag's Head, and I saw a man fall down, with his back towards the pavement—I crossed over to pick him up, and when I got there I saw the prisoner leaning over him, and rifling his pockets of the contents—from her manner, I was induced to believe that she was his wife—she said, "Do get up, George, because if the policeman comes and finds you here, you will be taken to the station, and fined 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" and she asked some of the people who were passing to get him up—I was about going away, when the policeman came up and took bold of her—she then threw the pocket book which she had taken from the man's pocket into the road, and the money she let fail by her side—the policeman said to her, "Halloo! I have got you now," or something to that effect—the boy had picked the gentleman up the moment before the policeman came up—two or three of the leaves of the pocket book were scattered about—I helped the policeman to pick up the money; I believe I picked up a shilling and a sixpence, and two leaves of the pocket book—I did not assist at all in picking up the gentleman—while the policeman had hold of the prisoner, she pointed to a woman who was standing in the road, and said, "I hare not done the robbery; that is the woman standing there"—that woman had not taken any part in it, or gone near the gentleman—she was about two yards away from him all the time—she had not taken anything from his pocket; she was in the road, and the prisoner was on the pavement—I saw the book taken from the pocket distinctly—the other woman had no more part in it than I had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a retired publican, and live at No. 35, Cowperstreet, City-road. I remember seeing the prisoner on this Wednesday—I did not marry her sister—she is no relation or acquaintance of mine—I never saw her before the night of 7th September—I then saw her in Bishopsgate-street—I had been making rather free with a few friends, and was the worse for liquor—I do not recollect what occurred when the prisoner met me—I had a memorandum-book with me—the one produced is it—I had a half sovereign, and from 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, in a bag in my trowsers pocket—I had another bag, with nothing in it—I do not know what became of my money; it went, the empty bags were left—I did not give any money to the prisoner—I did not go anywhere with her that I am aware of—when I was in Houndsditch I remember receiving a thrust in the pit of the stomach, which knocked me down,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185309190016"></xptr>
               <p>and I came with my head on the pavement—the prisoner gave me the thrust my head was cut very severely, and I was obliged to go to the hospital to get it strapped up; I lost a deal of blood—I remember nothing else.</p>

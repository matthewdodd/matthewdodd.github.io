               <p>on 11th July, and went to the defendant's factory, in Goldsmith-place, Hackney—they have been in the habit of discounting bills with our firm—I believe I saw them both—I stated that I had two bills drawn by them on Fawcett and Parrott, and accepted by them; one at maturity for 109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was dishonoured by us; and the other for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not fully due—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them—this policy was placed in our hands as a colla<lb></lb>teral security—one bill only, the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. one, was discounted while this policy was in our hands; the other was discounted before it came into our hands—I was requested by the firm to procure, if I possibly could, collateral security; in consequence of which, I had an interview with the defendants just previous to 27th March, 1854—I cannot tell you precisely the date—I requested further security, and I think on the very same day, this policy of the Guarantee Society passed into my hands on behalf of the firm, as collateral security—I cannot recollect what was said; nothing was said about what the bills were for—I am not aware of having communicated with either of them about it after it came into our hands-—they addressed a letter to the Commercial Assurance Society on 27th March—this (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) is a copy of it—(<hi rend="italic">This letter was dated</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th March</hi>, 1854, <hi rend="italic">and was to the Commercial Assurance Society from the defendants, authorizing the pay<lb></lb>ment of all moneys due to them under the policy of insurance, to Messrs.

               <p>to the defendants still, as holding their acceptance, they are liable for the bills—if they cannot compel the Guarantee Society to pay, they will be compelled to pay themselves—if Messrs. Harvey had known that they were accommodation bills, they certainly would not have discounted them—the defendants were straitened in capital, and the failure of Parrott and Co. increased their embarrassment.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on the business of a boot and shoe manu<lb></lb>facturer, at No. 14, Lisle-street, Leicester-square. I was in partnership with Mr. Parrott—we have had dealings with the defendants—this account, alleging goods to have been supplied to us amounting to upwards of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the course of that year, is not correct—we have not had one portion of the goods which are charged to us after 15th April this year—nothing is correct in the account for goods supplied to us, except 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—these two bills are my partner's writing; excepting the balance of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., they were for accommodation—the amount of them is 309<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we had the misfortune to stop payment in July, and these two bills were dishonoured—I believe that they became due on the occasion of our stopping, but one is not due by the date-—I believe the defendants were at our house on 12th July—I did not see them—I have seen them since our failure—I saw them both together, in the city, in the beginning of July—they gave me some papers, which they said they wished put into my book, or something of that kind—I believe Mr. Wright said that if they were put into our book it would make him all right, and Mr. Bateman said he knew I could do that—I said I would not do it, but did not look at the papers—I told them that I could not meddle with the papers—nothing was said to me about the Assurance Society—Mr. Honey was the accountant of our estate—after he had gone over the books, I saw both the defendants near my house, and told them that he had detected that the account was not for goods—that was a fort<lb></lb>night or three weeks after I first met them—I do not know what they said, but they were very vexed that their wishes had not been complied with in inserting the account in the books, as they had requested.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you, in point of fact, owe these defendants 299<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly; although that was not for goods, there was a debt due from our estate to them—they had large dealings with us for goods in former days—I should think we have owed them as much as 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for goods; but these acceptances of ours did not represent goods, they were for their accom<lb></lb>modation; they having previously given bills for ours, which bills were not paid at maturity, and they took them up—when the request was made to enter the matters in our books, it was for the purpose of carrying on their discounts with the Bank at Norwich, I believe.</p>

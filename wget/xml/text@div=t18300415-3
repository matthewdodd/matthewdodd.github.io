               <p>Q. Who was in the house when you went to bed, besides the prisoner and your brother? A. A little boy about twelve years old, who is his brother; the prisoner was not in the house when I awoke - my brother was still in the room; we got up and made inquiry about the house - every body remained in the house except the prisoner; I have recovered none of my money - I saw him in custody in a month or six weeks after; I had been making inquiries for him before, but could not find him till I saw him in custody at Worship-street - I did not promise him any thing or threaten him; he acknowledged that he had robbed me, and said he had sold the 40l. for 20l. - the Magistrate asked what he had done with the 20l.; he said he had spent it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you sober went you went to bed? A. I had had a glass, but was not tipsy - I was tired and fatigued with my journey; I believe you were sober - I had been with your father that night, and left him at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not leave him at Sam's, in Long-alley? A. You went home with my sister Thompson.</p>

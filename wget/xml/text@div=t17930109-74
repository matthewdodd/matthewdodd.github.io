             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an ironmonger; I at various times have had iron nails stolen from me, and the man that stole them informed me that he had sold them to this man.</p>
               <p>Court. That is not evidence. - There are goods of mine which I found in the prisoner's possession, on the 29th of November.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090110"></xptr>Mr. Garrow Do you charge him with receiving any other nails than those stolen by Ashburton who was convicted of stealing last sessions? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the nails which you charge the prisoner with receiving, a parcel of those nails stolen by Ashburton? - I presume they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Ashburton has been already tried for stealing the nails from you? - Not these.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that 22,500 nails were found on Ashburton, for which he was convicted, besides those found on the prisoner? - That I positively swear.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you do with the nails the 29th of November 1792? - I knew they were my nails by the writing on the paper, marked by my servant; at various times I missed nails and suspected nails were taken away, but I did not know by whom nor what with.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you have sold these nails with these papers on them? - They were never sold, they were stolen out of my warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before this 29th of November had you missed the nails? - I suspected loosing nails at various times; many parcels before that time. The nails are here, upwards of sixty pounds weight; I found them in a corner of the room where the prisoner resided, for when I went up with the officer to search the room, the prisoner was not at home; we went up stairs and saw his wife, she said, he was gone out with the cart and would be at home by two or three o'clock. The prisoner is a dealer in rags.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He was not at home when you went? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where these nails in the same packages in which they were taken from our warehouse? - They were, the papers never appeared to be opened.</p>
               <p>Q. There is some written mark that was not attempted to be obliterated? - Not in any respect.</p>
               <p>LEMON CASEBY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable belonging to Hatton-garden; I was ordered to go along with the prosecutor to get a search warrant, at Guildhall, to search Mr. Cox's house for some nails; I went with it and went up stairs, and found a bag with some nails up in the corner of the room, up one pair of stairs, and I went down stairs and I found a single paper; I found another paper below when Mr. Hattam was not with me, I found them in a cupboard under some old rags; when the prisoner came I took him to Guildhall; we stopped a good while before we came before the magistrate, and there the prisoner said, he would not mind giving a trifle if he could get the business settled.</p>

               <p>I was employed by Mr. Cox in picking rags; I remember I was working in the warehouse on the 28th of November last, there was a man came in at a door adjoining to the warehouse, and he asked if Mr. Cox was at home; he brought in a large parcel on his back, and another under his arm; and Iles, who worked with me, said Mr. Cox was not at home, but Mistress Cox was up stairs; he put down the little paper parcel, and the knot, and went up stairs and stayed there the value of ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and he came down again and took away the little parcel, and in about a quarter of an hour he came back again with a parcel,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090111"></xptr>and asked if we had got any place he could put it, and he would call for it on Saturday; we told him there was a cupboard there that stood open, and he might put it in there; my master was not at home, we gave him leave; I had seen him before, but I did not know his name; I was here to appear on the behalf of Mr. Cox when Ashburton was tried; I will swear positively that my master was not at home for some time; I was at work the next day, while Mr. Hattam was there, and I believe they took the same parcels.</p>
               <p>Court to Hattam. I understand that a man of the name of Ashburton is convicted? - He has been.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had your master any thing to do with leaving these things? - No more than any gentleman in the court, my master never saw them.</p>

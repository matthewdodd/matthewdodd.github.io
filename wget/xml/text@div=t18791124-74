                  </hi>. I live at 18, Sturdy Road, Peckham, and am a cheese<lb></lb>monger's assistant—on Saturday, the 9th November, at 12 p.m., I was outside the shop (Mr. Tobitfs, 142, High Street, Peckham), serving cus<lb></lb>tomers—there were some 12 or 16 persons outside, most of them in the road—I saw a one-horse cart coming towards Camberwell from the direc<lb></lb>tion of New Cross—there were two men and a female in it—I could not see who was driving—it was coming at eight or nine miles an hour, but I am no judge—I should not call it a slow pace—it is a very narrow, thoroughfare; the width of the road is 25 feet, I think—there is a single line of tramway—Baker was standing with others in the road, some three feet from the kerb, looking towards the shop—as the cart came up Baker seemed to throw his body back or take one step back—I could not see whether he was sober—the wheel or the step of the cart struck him, and he was thrown to the ground and run over—the cart proceeded on its way—I afterwards saw it stoped—I don't know whether it stoped itself or was stopped—I did not observe any slackening of speed—a cab was</p>

I was a cheesemonger's assistant, of 43, Marlborough Road, Peckham, but have been discharged through having to appear as a witness, and am now living at Chelsea—I was standing near Mr. Tobitt's shop at the time in question with some others—I saw the cart coming from the direction of New Cross—I did not see who was driving—there were three men and a female in it—I saw it about 150 yards off, and remarked at the time it was coming rather fast—I did not notice Baker—I was in the road, and rushed on to the pavement as the cart passed—it passed about two or three feet from the kerb—they did not alter the pace as far as I know—after the cart passed I heard a cry of "Stop"—I saw the cart going on—I saw it stop 50 or 60 yards from me; I also saw a man lying in the road who had been run over—I afterwards found he was John Baker—I heard no cry before the man was run over—as the cart passed there was a Hansom cab also in the road passing in the opposite direction—the off-side wheel of the cab was about the middle of the tram lines—there was nothing to prevent those in the cart seeing the people—I am no par<lb></lb>ticular judge, but I should say the cart was going nine or ten miles an hour.</p>

               <p>three men standing in the middle of the road—two backed on to the kerb, and the other one in going on to the kerb stepped bark And fell on to the stock of the wheel—the stock of the wheel caught the man as he was stepping back, and threw him down, and that frightened the pony, and we could not stop for 10 or 20 yards—the prisoner stopped as soon as be could—the road was very greasy—it is a wooden pavement—just before the accident a cab met us going towards New Cross—one wheel was in between the line, and the other on the near side—after the cab passed we got more in the middle of the road—we had pissed the cab before the accident occurred, perhaps about 30 yards—we were three or four feet from the pavement when it occurred—the immediate cause of the accident was the man stepping back and falling against the wheel—it happened sud<lb></lb>denly—if he had taken a step forward instead of backward he would have been on the kerb—he faced towards the shop—we were all sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was sitting next to the prisoner—there was a basket covered over for me to sit on—I was not sitting lower than the prisoner—he called out to the people "Hi, hi!"—I don't remember people calling out "Stop!" after the accident.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prisoner has lived in Peckham all his life, I think—I am sure he called out as loud as he could.</p>

I live in William-street, East-lane, Wal<lb></lb>worth—on 2d July I was in Billingsgate, and saw the prisoner—he told me to go and get a pint of shrimps and he would give me two pence—he gave me a half-crown, which I took to Mrs. Lane's stall—she broke it in two, and gave me the pieces back—I saw Granger there—he went with me to St. Mary-at-Hill, and I pointed the prisoner out—he saw the gentleman with me, and ran down the hill before I pointed to him—Mr. Granger took him, and he was given in custody—I gave the pieces of the half-crown to the policeman.</p>

I sell shrimps in Billingsgate—about 11 o'clock in the morning, the boy came to me for a pint of shrimps, and gave me a bad half-crown—I broke it, and gave him the pieces back, and took back the shrimps—I had received another bad half-crown within half an hour, but do not know from where—I gave it to the constable.</p>

I am a fish salesman of Billingsgate—I was near Mrs. Lane's stall when Bury came, and saw her give him back the half-crown—I spoke to him, and went back with him to the top of St. Mary-at-Hill, about 150 yards right into East Cheap—he pointed out the prisoner coming up the hill, and said, "That is the man"—as soon as the prisoner saw me he turned round and went back again between a run and a walk—I followed and caught him—he said, "What are you going to give me in charge for?" I said, "You will see directly"—I gave him in charge.</p>

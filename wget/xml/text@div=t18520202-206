                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 437). On 31st Dec., about a quarter before 7 o'clock, I was in Cheapside, and saw the prisoner in Bow Churchyard at the dark part, placing something under the left arm of his coat—he then came out into Cheapside, and went towards Leadenhall-street—at that moment I saw Trew, my brother officer—we followed the prisoner into Fenchurch-street—I stopped him in Fenchurch-buildings, and asked him what he had under his coat—he said he was a respectable man and a gentle-man; he produced one of his cards to Trew, and asked by what authority we stopped him—we told him we were police-officers, and were about to produce our authority (I was in plain clothes)—I said I should like to know what it was he had got under his coat—he produced from under his coat this piece of mousseline-de laine—there are thirty-six yards of it; it was not in any paper—he said he had bought it of a Mr. Reed, in Tottenham-court-road—I said, "What is Mr. Reed's address?"—he said he did not know; the fact was, he had sold Mr. Reed two pounds of cigars, at 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per pound, about ten days previous—he did not say where—he said he had met Mr. Reed in Tottenham-court-Road, and he had not the money to pay him, and had given him this piece of goods to hold until he could pay it—Trew asked him which way he came from Tottenham-court-road—he said he had taken an omnibus at the corner of Tottenham-court-road and rode to the Bank, and from the Bank he walked to where we saw him, Fenchurch-buildings—Trew asked him if he had not been in Bow Churchyard—he said no, he had not been there that night,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185202020002"></xptr>
               <p>he could take his oath of it—I then said I had seen him there a very short time ago—he then said he had forgotten himself; he got out of the omnibus just by St. Paul's instead of the Bank, with the exception of turning up some court in Cheapside for a necessary purpose—Trew then said, "You had better tell us plainly in what way you did come;" and the prisoner said, "I walked the whole of the distance; I did not ride at all"—I said, "This is a very unsatisfactory account, and I must take you to the station"—I took him to the Bow-lane station, searched him, and found on him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. seventeen duplicates, a latch-key, and a plaid scarf—he said at the station it was a Mr. Reece, and not Mr. Reed, that he had it from—he did not know the address.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Felkin and Ellis, calico-printers, 52, Old Change; there are only two partners. On 31st Dec, about 6 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to see our warehouseman whom he knew—I left the warehouse about 6, and saw the prisoner in the warehouse then—this piece of mousseline-de-laine is my employers' printing—we had such in stock; it might have been printed some months before—I find their name on it—I keep a journal in which I enter the sales of goods by different persons in the house—it is not here—I did not sell this article—it would have been put in paper if it had been sold—it is worth about 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you say it is their manufacture, all you mean it that at some time or other within the last ten years it has been in stock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was printed at Ratcliffe, in Lancashire, and came to London—if it went anywhere else from Ratcliffe it would be irregular—I cannot undertake to say it has been in our warehouse at all, and if it had been we sell great quantities of it.</p>

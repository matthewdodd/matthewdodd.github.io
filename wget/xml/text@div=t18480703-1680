                  </hi>. I am a baker, at Wapping—Whitehead was my errand-boy. On 28th June I had a brooch safe on the mantel-piece, on 2nd July I missed it—I asked Whitehead about it—he said he knew nothing about it—I told him to tell me the truth, and I would forgive him—he then told me something, and I went with him to Aston's, who keeps a watch<lb></lb>maker's shop—I asked him if he had bought a brooch—he said he had, and produced it—he said he gave a shilling for it, and he was not aware of the value of it, he regretted very much that he bought it of the boy—this is my brooch, it is worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

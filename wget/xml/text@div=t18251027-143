The prisoner Curtis lives in Queen-street, opposite the back part of our premises; Church was in our employ. In September last I went with my clerk and Ballard to Curtis' premises, about some springs, and orders were given to remove some from there. I then asked Curtis if he had any thing more of my property on his premises - he said nothing whatever; he then varied his answer, and said, "Nothing at all." I did not go to Church's, but I saw Ballard and Atwell again in about an hour and a half afterwards, and went with them to Curtis a second time. The officer told Curtis he had been speaking falsely, he had told lies, and asked where the axletrees were - after they were produced one of us said, "Where are the steps?" he looked about, and said, "O! there they are, among a quantity of old iron;" a pair of steps were then brought out, which my clerk said were not ours; another pair were then brought out, which I did not know, but my clerk did; there was a sum mentioned, but I cannot tell what. The officer said, "You gave (I believe it was) 4 s. for them;" Curtis said Yes - it was more than they were worth.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did Curtis work as a jobbing smith for you? A. Yes. I saw one man in his shop and two boys - it was an open shop, and there seemed to be several odd steps laying together; my pair laid uppermost. I have no recollection of Curtis saying<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270065"></xptr>ing he knew nothing about their being there, but I will not say he did not. Atwell and Ballard, and some of his men, were there; I had not missed the steps. I am quite certain he said he gave some money for them - it did not apply to the steps which had been put back, as not being mine. I certainly did not say to Curtis, "I am come to detect a robbery, and I put you on your guard;" he was charged with a fact, and he admitted it.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Was he not charged with having told a falsity? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. When he said he had no property of your's had you been talking of property that was lost? A. Yes. I said my men had robbed me, and I came to see whether my lost property was there. It was in the course of that morning he said he had no other property of mine. I went in first, the officer second, and the clerk third.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for on the 20th of September, to go to Mr. Thrupp's. I went with him and Atwell to Curtis', about a spring - I questioned him about it, and said Thomas had been seen to bring a spring over. I then asked him if he had any other springs, or any thing else belonging to Mr. Thrupp, which the men had brought over - he said No. I then went to Church's and saw him - Mr. Atwell was with me. I told him I was an officer, and had come to take him into custody upon a charge of having robbed his master - he denied it, and said, "Of what?" I told him to mind what he was about, as I had Thomas in custody, and I had been to Curtis'. After something had passed about the springs I asked him what else he had taken over - he said he could not recollect; I said it was nonsense - he must recollect, and what was it - he then mentioned a pair of axletrees, and then a pair of carriage-steps, which Curtis had given 4 s. for-that he had received 1 s. 6 d., and Pitcher, Harry, and John had something to drink out of the remainder, with Thomas, meaning Brian. I then went to Curtis' again, with Mr. Thrupp and Atwell; I told him I was sorry he had deceived me, and told lies. After the conversation ended about the axletrees, I said, "You have got a pair of carriage-steps, for which you paid 4 s.;" he said he believed he had - a pair was then looked out, which Mr. Thrupp and Atwell said were not his; another pair were found, which were marked by me, and taken away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who was the first person who spoke to Curtis when you went the second time? A. I was - Mr. Thrupp spoke to him, but I did not hear what he said; if he had said, "My men have been robbing me, and I am come to see whether any of the property is here," I might have heard it, or I might not. I did not wish to get him into conversation to convict him - I went to get his answers; I asked him respecting the springs, and said Thomas had been seen to come over with the springs, and I asked where they were - he said, with some little hesitation, "There," and pointed to the side of the shop - we did not tell him that Mr. Thrupp had been robbed, and we were come to see if any of the property was there; Curtis looked out the first steps, and Atwell the second. When I said, "You have got a pair of carriage-steps, and you have given 4 s. for them" - he said he believed it was so. This was before the steps were looked out.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Thrupps. - On the 20th of September, about eleven o'clock, I went with Mr. Thrupp and Ballard to speak to Curtis about some springs; he was then asked if he had got any thing else - he said, No, he had not. I then went with Ballard to Church's; Ballard told him he had come to take him into custody for stealing some springs - he was afterwards asked if he had taken any thing else; he said, "Yes, a pair of wheels, and a pair of steps" - that he had received 4 s. for the steps, and had received 1 s. 5 d. for himself - that three men of the shop were treated with one shilling, and Brian had kept the remainder. I went again to Curtis' with Ballard and Mr. Thrupp; Ballard said he was very sorry he had deceived him, for he found he had received other things - he said, "You have received a pair of steps, and given 4 s. for them" - he said he had. I was desired to look about the shop, and I found a pair which were Mr. Thrupp's property. Curtis had before taken up a pair of steps, and I said, "That is not Mr. Thrupp's" - they are worth about 10 s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Who put the question to Church about the steps? A. There was no question about the steps; Ballard put the question after mentioning some other things - he named the steps. He told him he came to apprehend him about some springs - he said, "What springs?" he told him he knew he had taken three springs to Curtis', and Brian one; he then asked what else - he said a pair of axletrees. He then said, "What have you done with the pair of wheels?" he said he had taken them; he then said, "What else" - he said, "I have taken a pair of steps." No promise had been made to him to make him confess.</p>
               <p>Prisoner CURTIS. Q. At the time the steps lay in the shop how many pairs were there? A. Two pairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, "I think these to be the steps; I was going to sell them to a hackneyman?" A. I said "I know them to be the steps, as I was going to sell them to a man for half-a-guinea."</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Is there any thing by which you can swear to these steps? A. By their general appearance; I believe them to be the make of Mr. Holland - I had had them in my hand a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>CURTIS' Defence. I do assure you that all this is false, for when Mr. Thrupp asked me whether I had got any more springs, he did not mention about any other iron - I said, "I declare to God I have no more springs here," but with respect to other iron work I could not, because I had a seat iron to make some more by, and several other articles; and how was it possible I could say I had no more iron work, when they could see it in the shop. - There were bolts and other things to make new ones by; there is iron work that stops there a month from Messrs. Coleman and Taylor's, and there it lays till I get directions to get it done. With respect to these steps I declare to Almighty God I had not seen them, nor did I know they were there, for I had been out all the morning. - There have often been jobs brought to my shop before Atwell was up, soon after six o'clock - jobs to steps and other things - and the workmen now in their employ can prove it.</p>
               <p>CHARLES ATWELL re-examined. Q. Do you know whether there was any more iron work there of Mr. Thrupp's? A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270066"></xptr>Prisoner CURTIS. I have a new seat iron there now that has not been opened.</p>
               <p>CHARLES ATWELL re-examined. Q. Was any thing to be done to these steps, in the way of Curtis' trade? A. No, there was not - he had done work for the firm; he had made a seat iron, and done some other jobs. An old seat iron had been sent over as a pattern, to have some new ones made by. I did not see the old one there when I went. When work was taken to him to be done it was customary to take a verbal message from me or Mr. Thrupp.</p>

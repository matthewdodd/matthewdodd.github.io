                  </hi>. I live in the Knightsbridge-road. On the 14th of January, the prisoner came to my father's shop, who is a tobacconist—he asked for a pennyworth of shag tobacco—I served him—he gave me sixpence—I said, "I think this is a bad sixpence"—he took it out of my hand again, and tried to bend it, but it would not bend—I then put it into the till, and gave him the change—there was no other silver in the till then—the policeman brought him into the shop—I marked the sixpence, and gave it to the policeman.</p>

I was on duty, in company with Banister—I saw the prisoner three quarters of a mile from the prose<lb></lb>cutor's—I knew him—he was coming from Westminster—I followed him to Knightsbridge, and there I lost him—I then saw him a come along the road—I did not see him go into the prosecutor's shop, but I saw him come out—I laid hold of him, and asked what he had been at—he said, "Buying tobacco, to be sure"—I said, "What did you give for it?"—he said, "A sixpence"—I said, "Was it a good one?"—he said "Yes"—I took him back to this witness—he said he had given him a sixpence, which he said was bad, as it would bend—that the prisoner had taken it, and tried to bend it, and said it would not bend, and it was good—I then searched the prisoner, and found seventeen sixpences on him in a rag—I asked where be got them from—he said, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> gave them to him—that he did not know his other name, but he was a tall man, and wore a fustian jacket—I said, it was odd he could not tell who the man was—he said he had seen him last night, and he gave him threepence to get him a lodging, that he gave him this bad money to pass, and was to meet him that night at the corner of Pye-street, and he would pay him for what he had passed.</p>

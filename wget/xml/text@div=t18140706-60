               <p>Q. On the 3rd of July did you lose any property - A. Yes; a blue coat, of the value of thirty shillings; two shirts, value ten shillings; a silk handkerchief; a cotton handkerchief, value sixpence; two one-pound bank notes; and three five-shilling and sixpenny pieces. I lost them between eight and nine in the evening; I saw them when I went out; that was about a quarter before six in the evening. I returned a few minutes after nine. My box was in the tap room; where the prisoner and myself lodged. Immediately I went up stairs, I missed my things. The prisoner was in the room when I left the room. He was not there when I returned, and my things were missing. I did not see the prisoner until the following Wednesday. He had lodged in the room with me four or five weeks. I lost my property on Sunday evening, the 3rd of July. I saw my property and the prisoner at the office on the Wednesday evening.</p>

            , JUNIOR. I am an officer. On Tuesday, the 5th of July, the prisoner came to me, and told me he wanted me to take him into custody. I asked him what for; he said, for a felony; he told me he had robbed a person at No. 4, Baldwyn's-gardens. Me and my father, another officer, on the Wednesday went with him to St. Giles's, and took the two witnesses into custody; they told us, they had bought it fairly, and they would give it up to us. All that is recovered, is a coat, handkerchief, and a shirt. The prisoner told me he had spent the money, and the other shirt he had sold to a strange man in the street; he did not know who he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner his senses - A. Yes. He said these two men had his tools, and they would not give them up; he might as well resign himself up; he could not go to work. I went and found his tools.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at the coat - A. I am sure it is my coat; I had the coat made for me; I value it at thirty shillings, it is worth more; the handkerchief is worth five shillings; the shirt is worth eight shillings. I am sure they are my property.</p>
               <p>Q. to Read. What parish is this house in - A. In the parish of St. Pancras.</p>

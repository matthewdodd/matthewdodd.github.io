                  </hi>. I am a corn dealer—the prisoner entered my service about six months ago—the terms of his engagement were in writing—he brought me an order for hay—he said Mr. Miles, of Kingston, would like to have a load—I said, "Very well; I will send it"—the next morning I did so—it amounted to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner has never paid me that—it was his duty to hand it over immediately he got it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was he in the habit of buying hay and corn for you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, never—there was an agreement that he was to have sixpence a quarter upon corn—the people at the railway would deliver the corn and hay to order—the prisoner would say that he had sold so much to Mr. Philips, and I would hand him an order to take to Mr. Philips with a contract note of the price—that would be entered in my day-book, which is here—it was not the prisoner's duty to cart it from the station—the purchaser would do that—there was no account with the prisoner for commission, it was paid when he asked for it—sometimes he had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., sometimes 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he has had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—he took very good care to charge the commission directly he sold the corn—I have seen a Mr. Larter once—there is one entry in the ledger in his name, as being sold by me to Mr. Larter—I was not constantly in the habit of making out invoices to the prisoner—if there has been some surplus corn lying at the wharf, and he said he had a customer for it, probably an order might be made out in his name—I have not done that constantly—I might have done it once or twice; not more—I think (<hi rend="italic">Looking at some papers</hi>) these two are for one, for the five quarters of oats that were lying at the wharf—the prisoner did not frequently buy</p>

               <p>corn for me—I have had plenty of experience myself—I have been twelve years in the market—I know the names of all the customers he sold to—the hay is entered as sold to Mr. Miles on 16th November, for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I can't tell what amount of business the prisoner did while with me, probably about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have three other travellers.</p>

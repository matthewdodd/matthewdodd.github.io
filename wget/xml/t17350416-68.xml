               <p>S. Chapman. Nay, I can't tell not I, but so she did, and when she saw me in a surprise at missing my Rings, Lord, says she, sure you don't think that I have got them. Indeed but I do, says I. Then pray search your self, says she. So I begun to strip, and then she went away. A Week afterwards a Constable going to take her up, she got out of a Window into a Skettle Ground, and got into a Milk Womans House. I went to her, and she said, she hoped I would not hurt her; but I told her Justice and Newgate should be her portion. And she said afterwards that she would pay all the Charges if I would throw in a Bill of Rigmaramus.</p>

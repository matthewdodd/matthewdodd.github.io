               <p>I have known the prisoner many years, he has not been in England but about half a year, I knew him before he went to the train of artillery; he was abroad five years and ten months; he is my brother in law; both by the same mother; I know no more than I am come to speak what I can for him; I hope the Court will be merciful to spare his life; there is plenty of trades people that know me, that are neighbours: This fellow, that is the ringleader, is a very bad fellow by all account, we have kept the prisoner for theee months out of the time that he has been in London, and he has lived at the Cardigan, Charing-cross, about two months; it is but within this little while that he has got acquainted with this fellow; he was discharged for being disabled to serve; I live in Piccadilly, I am not afraid to tell where I live.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I received a piece of a cannon ball upon a place called Willis's, in Gibraltar; I was going to be recommended as soon as ever the battallion came home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 76, Liston-grove, North, in the parish of St. Marylebone. It is my own dwelling-house—about the 30th of June the prisoner came to my house—he had a female with him, who passed as hit wife—the prisoner stated he had just come by the railway, and would tike my apartments to lodge there—I let him my second floor back room till the drawing-rooms were empty, which would be in a fortnight—he and his wife took possession that night, and remained there till the 9th at Sept.—the prisoner said he was Captain Kelly—on the day he left; I missed a gold watch of mine out of a trunk—I had seen it about a week before—the trunk was not locked—it was kept in a wardrobe in the front kitchen—I went up stairs, and missed it—on coming down again I met the prisoner coming out of a room—he said to me, "What is the matter? you look extremely pale"—I said, "I have lost my husband's gold watch out of the trunk"—he said, "What a shame it is to rob a lone woman"—he did not say anything more to me about it—I went to my mother's to tell her about it, and next morning I received a note—I went home the next morning, and the prisoner and his wife were gone—the prisoner never returned—I went into his room and missed a razor and case, which had been my husband's.</p>

I took the prisoner on the 16th of Dec. at No. 10, Boyle-street, Regent-street, on a charge of stealing this razor which I found there—he denied stealing it, and said Mrs. Oakey lent it him—there was a carpet-bag upon the floor—I opened it, and found in it the affi<lb></lb>davit respecting the watch-case, and some duplicates, in a pocket-book—I went to the pawnbroker's and saw the watch-case, and Mrs. Oakey identified it.</p>

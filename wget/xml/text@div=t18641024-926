                  </hi>. I am proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Arrow</hi> newspaper, at 23, Tavistock-street—on 13th September, the prisoner came there for a paper, and paid me with a five-shilling piece—I put it in my pocket—I had no other there—I afterwards tendered it myself and found it was bad—I then locked it in a desk in the office, separate from other coins—on 30th September, the prisoner came again, and purchased another number—he then gave me a florin—I handed it over to the man and told him to test it in the detector—it did not bend very quickly, but it was apparently bad—I had recognised the prisoner again the moment he came into the shop—a few minutes before, I had been looking at the crown-piece, and I showed it to the prisoner, with the florin, and said, "You know this"—he directly ran away as hard as he could—my man ran after him, and brought him back—I sent for a constable and gave him in charge, with the coins. <hi rend="smallCaps">EDWARD MARSH</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, F</hi> 163). I was called, and took the prisoner into custody with the coins—I asked him if he had any money about him—he said he had not—I searched him in the shop and found nothing on him, but I found at the station a portmonnaie in the fob-pocket of his Waistcoat, containing 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper. <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM WEBSTER</hi>.

               <p>- COHEN. I was coming along the street; the prisoner at the bar asked me if I knew any one that dealt in glass; I am the person that he left in the cart for a short time; I told him I knew of several being in the trade myself, and accordingly I took him to Mr. Lyon's house, and that is all I have to say.</p>
               <p>- BRIGGS. On the 18th of September, a jew glass cutter came to me, and asked me if I wanted a job; I told him I did, and he said he would recommend me one. Accordingly he left me Mr. Lyons's address in the shop. I went, and was shewn the articles by Mrs. Lyons. I afterwards heard that Mr. Naylor's shop had been robbed, and I sent him word.</p>

            . I am a marshalman. On the 25th of September, Bring and another person applied at Guildball for a search warrant to search Lyons's place. I found some difficulty in procuring a warrant. and so I went with them, and I sent Briggs in to bargain with Lyons about the glasses. I went in in a moment or two, and found him shewing the two large trifle dishes to Biggs. I then told Lyons I would take him into custody, unless he gave some satisfactory account of them. He then shewed me all the rest, and said he got them from Barnett Barnett.</p>

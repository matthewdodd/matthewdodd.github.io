                  </hi>. I am Secretary to the Marine Department of the Board of Trade—inquiries about wrecks come under my department—the inquiry which took place before Mr. Traill at Greenwich, in the case of the loss of the <hi rend="italic">John Sugars</hi>, was directed by the Board of Trade; by an order from the solicitor—Mr. Cumberland sometimes acts as solicitor in such prosecutions by the Board of Trade.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the report made by the Magistrate laid before you afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The report is sent by the Magistrate to the Board, with a copy of the evidence certified by the Magistrate, and all the documents exhibited in the case, and the Board of Trade form their opinion upon it so far as their jurisdiction is concerned. Here is the report that has been transmitted by the captain in this matter and which was sent to the Board of Trade, and the evidence which was given by the captain before Mr. Traill, and also the evidence given by the mate—there was also this protest marked A.—on the foundation of those documents the captain's certificate was suspended for twelve months—I cannot say that that is a very high amount of punishment, it is an ordinary amount of punishment, of course punishments differ very much; in this case the cer<lb></lb>tificate was suspended for want of seamanship and losing the vessel, it had nothing to do with any criminal charge; not taking into consideration the charge of wilfully scuttling the vessel, had that been proved the probability</p>

               <p>is that the punishment would have been very much more severe—we should have still been called upon to pronounce it—it is of course, as you may be aware, a very difficult thing to distinguish the criminal from the other charge, but the Board and Mr. Traill did not proceed with regard to the criminal charge—I was not present at the inquiry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SEYMOUR</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the event of the captain disobeying the rules of the Shipping Company, would that be a case for suspension? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The Board of Trade have nothing to do with the rules of navigation, but they would no doubt take notice of it—in a recent case a captain was suspended for twelve months for negligently losing a ship in the West Indies—we have the power of cancelling a certificate as well as of suspending it—it is difficult to say what course the Board of Trade would have adopted—if a graver charge, a criminal charge, was laid before them, they would be called upon to cancel it altogether, but it does not come within their jurisdiction to enter into criminal charges of this nature—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the original depositions—I produce them from the custody of the Board of Trade.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand you that the Board of Trade would not form any opinion as to the evidence upon the criminal charge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They endea<lb></lb>voured to put that out of sight altogether—in their letter to Mr. Traill they stated that they threw aside the evidence on the criminal charge altogether—if a captain was convicted of wilfully losing a ship they would cancel his certificate; they would no doubt take into consideration whether the evidence was sufficient in their minds.</p>

Before that intimation was given as to the first portion of the inquiry, some obser<lb></lb>vation was made to Captain Anderson, and then the charge was entered as one under the Merchant Shipping Act—the counsel who represented the captain, pressed the Magistrate that his evidence and that of the mate should be given on oath, and the Magistrate declined, it not being the practice on these inquiries—no nautical assessor appeared—it is usual generally for these inquiries to be conducted in the presence of a nautical assessor—the Magistrate in reporting on the nautical part of the case had no aid of a nautical person—Captain Hewitt and the mate were bound over afterwards on the application of counsel, to prefer this prosecution.</p>

               <p>went before the Board of Trade—on the fourth day, speaking of one witnedd and only one witness, I said to Mr. Bull that it was quite clear that the Board of Trade would not make any inquiry dealing with it in a criminal character if they had to deal with such evidence as that—the upshot of the matter was, that having heard the case till the fourth day, I determined not to act at all upon the evidence which pointed to a criminal charge, but to treat it generally under the Merchant Shipping Act, and I can explain why I took that course if necessary.</p>

I am a master mariner, and was lately Captain of the British barque <hi rend="italic">John Sugars</hi>—I was appointed to the command in 1859 by Mr. Wilson, of Liverpool—I sailed on 13th December for Adelaide, with a general cargo—there were 16 hands, including myself—we shipped the prisoners as part of our crew; four of them are foreigners—I do not know whether they are all Germans—before we left London my attention was called to the ventilator holes which were in the stem of the ship—this model shows their position on each side—the ventilator on the starboard side was a brass one, the glass of which was broken—the vessel was then taking in heavy cargo, going a long voyage, and for the sake of the ship I thought it would be better to take those lights out, as they were not wanted in the ship—I believe the vessel had carried troops—we were not going to carry passengers, and the ship might have struck and the glass broken, and she would have sunk, so we took them out—this is one of the original glasses (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I plugged the holes up and drove a large fender in from the inside as <hi rend="italic">taut</hi> as we could get it—it was wider inside, and narrow on the part outside—I then wedged it from the outside all round the edge of the fender, and then <hi rend="italic">keyed</hi> it <hi rend="italic">trunnel</hi> fashion—I had the projection cut off, tarred it over, then put a piece of tarred felt and a piece of deal board over that—I made it as safe as I possibly could, and in my opinion a moderate force would not be capable of opening that hole again; especially from the inside, it would be almost impossible—I had no share in the ship whatever—the value of my personal effects on board was about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had asked Mr. Pugh if he would put 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my goods, and I ascertained, when I returned to England, that they were assured to the amount of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., out of which I had to make good my instruments which I had lost—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my policy—it has never been handed to me before—I received 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., out of which I made good my chronometer, the price of which was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., leaving 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took my wife with me, but left our little boy behind—the ship was lying in the water with her cargo, about 16ft. 9in. aft, and 16ft. 3in. forwards—we had tolerably fine weather when we left London, which continued pretty</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186005070166"></xptr>
               <p>well going down channel—the wind was north—we crossed the Bay of Biscay, and I think the first sensible change of weather was on the 21st or 22d, when the wind veered round I think, and I put the head of the ship round W. N. W., it freshened into a gale either on the 22d or 23d—we were under close reefed topsails—we had not, up to that time, been making any water—on the 23d we had very heavy weather—I cannot say whether the ship strained much, but we shipped some water, and I think it was on the 23d a very heavy sea washed away part of our bulwarks forward, and a portion aft also—I think that was the day that the ship commenced to make water—I sounded the pumps that day, and kept them going after that—we had very heavy weather on Christmas-day, and the cabin sky-light was broken in by a sea—we had then close reefed topsails, and part of the day close reefed main-topsails, and I believe we had also a storm trysail only—more bulwarks were then washed away—from the 25th to New Year's Day the weather con<lb></lb>tinued very heavy, and on New Year's Day, Hodson, the chief mate, stated that either the carpenter or cook had told him that there was water coming into the ship forwards—I went down into the lower forecastle, and saw water coming in through a leak in the bows—it was an opening in the wood ends—I think the water was a little above, and a great body of water came in every time the vessel dipped—I made every effort to stop the leak, and the chief mate and the carpenter helped me—the leak was two or three feet, I think, and my impression was that the ends had started—the carpenter, myself, and the chief mate were slung over the bows, and we got a piece of wood and a piece of flannel nailed over the wood end—I was over the bows several times that day, but it was impossible to stop over any time together, the vessel was plunging too much—I did my best to stop the leak, and it kept a little water out, but not all—one pump was kept constantly going, and the other for an hour and a half, at the end of every watch as the watches were relieved—there is a watch every four hours—the pumps suck at 6 inches, and I tried to keep the water down to that depth, and was able to do so down to January 4—I was then trying to make a W.S.W. course—I used one of Norrey's charts, I think—on 4th January we were lying-to under close reefed topsails—it was blowing very heavy indeed, and between 11 and 12 in the forenoon, I was in my cabin with Mrs. Hewitt, when a very heavy sea struck the ship forwards, and I felt it tremble—I went on deck, met the mate, and said, "What is that?"—he said, "A very heavy sea has struck the ship in the bows"—I went forward and examined the state of the bows—I found almost all the gear, immediately below the cutwater, gone—this is the cutwater, these are the knees, and these are the head-rails—the head-rails were completely washed away on the starboard side, and the two lower knees completely washed off—the upper knee was washed from the cut<lb></lb>water, and the wood ends all completely started to the water's edge—this is so constructed as to fit into the stem of the ship—the stem slightly overlaps the end, so that with the knees, and all together, the effect is to brace the whole together—the straining of the cutwater caused a dislocation of this end, and the planks were completely disjointed; they sprang out at the extreme end—it exposed the wood end, and that made the opening—I think the stem must have <hi rend="italic">slued</hi> and forced the plank out—I saw the wood ends completely started out—(<hi rend="italic">The witness went to the model, and explained where the damage was</hi>)—the sea struck the vessel right in the bows, so, and the great leverage here must have <hi rend="italic">slued</hi> the stem and forced the plank out—I distinctly saw that the planks were started out, and an opening made; I saw nothing else to account for it—the cutwater was loose and moving—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186005070167"></xptr>
               <p>when I discovered this I immediately put the ship before the wind—most of the gear on the port side also was gone—the head-rails were gone, but the rails were there—water was also coming in on the port side, but the principal damage was on the starboard side—as soon as I got the ship before the wind, I gave orders to bring a blanket, which we tried to get nailed oyer the bows, and were about an hour about it, but it was washed away almost before our eyes—I next tried a piece of blanket, but it kept on for a very short time, and was then washed away—when both these efforts failed I hung a sail round the bows, and made one part of it fast to the cat-head in this way, but cut a slit to allow it to come up to the bows, and these two parts were all <hi rend="italic">taut</hi> with the cutwater, and as the vessel was running before the wind, it kept a little of the water out—it was passed over the bows—it remained there till about 4 next morning—I kept the pumps constantly going all night, and next morning (Thursday) I tried to get at the leak on the inside—we cut away this inner plank, called the ceiling, from the outside, for the purpose of getting at the planking outside; but I found that it would be very dangerous to wedge the opening from the inside, for fear it should wedge the planking and make it worse, and we were only able to keep poking oakum in the holes, which the carpenter kept doing with some oakum which was got from the fore-part, where it was kept under the direction of the carpenter and steward—finding I could not do anything more effectual than poking oakum in from the inside, I resolved on bearing away for Cadiz—I did so—we saw a schooner next morning (Thursday, the 5th), and ran up the ensign, with the Union down—that is a signal of distress, but the schooner never saw it, as it came on foggy, hazy weather—we saw St. Vincent's light on the coast of Spain, on Friday morning, the 6th, at 4 o'clock—the wind was then about N.W., and we were about 160 miles from Cadiz—we had both pumps going that forenoon constantly up to dinner-time, which was at 12 o'clock—the men had not had breakfast—they were very bad with regard to strength, and were all complaining of sores, and chaps, from their clothes constantly rubbing up and down with the salt water, and their physical strength was getting worse from pumping all that time, and from the sea constantly washing over them—after they had had their dinner at 12, the ship was getting down in the water—we bad no tea that day, because the galley-fire was washed out—I gave directions to haul the chains up, and the men commenced doing so after dinner—it took about three hours altogether—I had, at that time, altered my intention about Cadiz, and in<lb></lb>tended to try and get the ship in under Cape St. Mary—I did not abandon that intention, but we did not make Cape St Mary, because the wind would not allow us to reach there, so I altered her course—the wind headed me all the time, so that she broke off that course—after hauling the chains up we pumped again with all hands—I think it would then be approaching 5 o'clock—they continued pumping about three-quarters of an hour or an hour, and then refused to pump any more—I tried to encourage them to pump longer—I rallied them, and asked them if they would not pump a little longer—I entreated them to do so, and said that the land was not a great distance from us—they said, "No, captain, you see the state our hands are in, and we cannot pump any more"—I said, "Now there is less wind, and there is a chance to save our lives"—they said, "We cannot pump any more"—my efforts were unsuccessful, and the pumps were abandoned—the ship was then getting further down—the deeper she went, the greater the rush of water would be—we had all the light goods on the top; not on deck; I mean the upper stratum—if I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186005070168"></xptr>
               <p>had ventured to risk letting the men leave the pumps for the purpose of throwing out the cargo, a very great deal of water would have gone down the hatches—it would have consumed a considerable time before we got through the light cargo to the heavy cargo—when I found that the men would not really pump for me any more I gave orders to put the boats out—we commenced doing so about 6 o'clock, and in doing so, the pinnace got broken—that was not done by my directions, for I had nothing else to fly to but my boats—we had nothing then left but the long boat and the gig; and the chief mate and eight of the crew got into the long boat, and myself, my wife, and six others, into the gig—I was the last person on board the sinking ship—the water was then washing over her—she was level with the water's edge—there was a heavy sea—the wind was light—neither of the boats had masts—I rigged a mast with oars—the long boat, under the command of the chief mate, pulled away—I stayed by the ship as long as I could; then got into my boat and pulled in the same direction—my wife sat at the stern, on the stern sheets—it was a narrow-sterned gig—we had no ballast in her—there is a seat round the stern, and we had to seat ourselves as well as we could—I had my desk in the boat, the sextant and case, and one bag of clothes—my desk contained the log and the ship's papers—I had not my octant—I did not, before I left the ship, throw out an octant or sextant from the vessel—it is not true that I threw any instrument, or any box, from off the ship, before I left it; in fact I had not an octant—the second mate, Beschott, steered the fore part of the night, and I steered the remainder—he sat on the top of my desk—I agreed to change places with him before day<lb></lb>break, I think, and took the steerage—the wind was freshening all the time, and the sea was getting up too, and running higher—when I took the helm I had to sit on the box—it raised me so high that it nearly threw me over the quarter, two or three times as the boat plunged in the sea; and in my opinion it was necessary for the boat's safety that I should get lower down in the boat—I therefore threw my desk, my box with the sextant, and the bag of clothes overboard—that was all that belonged to me—anything else that had been at my hands at the time, I would have taken—the desk con<lb></lb>tained personal valuables of mine—I made a sail with a piece of old canvas which was thrown into the boat, and used an oar for a mast which was broken when the wind freshened—we were shipping water—I saw smoke about 8 o'clock in the morning, and then saw a steamer, which turned out to be the <hi rend="italic">Nicholas Wood</hi>—we bore for her and tried to attract her attention but did not succeed; she steamed past us—it was about three-quarters of an hour after that that I threw the things overboard—we were then I think about thirty or forty miles from any accessible shore; I cannot say exactly; and if we had not been picked up next day, I do not think there was the slightest chance of saving our lives, and I did it as an inducement to the men to throw their things over if it should become necessary—I could not order them to throw theirs over unless I showed them the example—two or three hours after that the <hi rend="italic">Nicholas Wood</hi>, commanded by Captain Doll, picked us up—there was then water in our boat and we were very wet—the boy Cox was in very bad health previous to leaving the vessel—he was not in a condition to attend his watches regularly, and did not do so—he was not able to leave his berth for six or seven days up to a day or two before the ship went down—he was not able to discharge any duties up to the time of leaving the ship—the boy Wager, waited on him, and sometimes the steward, and sometimes I did—the <hi rend="italic">Nicholas Wood</hi> brought us to Newport—I wrote out, on board of her, a memorandum of what happened to the ship, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186005070169"></xptr>
               <p>after doing so I asked Beschott, the second mate, whether he would come aft and hear it read over and sign it, if it was correct, in the presence of Captain Tuck; he said, Yes, if I would give him two months' pay—I am quite sure that document was not read over to him before he claimed the two months' pay—I said that I could not give him anything of the sort; I could not give him two months' pay out of my own pocket—he said that it was German fashion to give two months' pay when a ship was lost—I said that he could only claim wages from me up to the time the ship was lost—he then refused to hear the paper read—I then asked the carpenter Lehmann, if he would sign it—he said, Yes, if I would give him two months' pay—I said, "Will the crew sign this document?"—he said, "Yes, if you give them two months' pay"—I called them a set of rascals and told them I would put them all in gaol when I got home—upon that the second mate shook his finger at me in this way and said, "There are ten of us, and not so many of you, what you speak is for nothing"—I do not know of any holes being bored or cut or made in any part of the ship—I never directly or indirectly sanctioned or directed the making of any holes—I did nothing after leaving London to the ventilators that were filled up, nor do I know of anything being done—they could not have been driven out without my knowledge—I never directed any of the men to say when they got ashore that there was fourteen feet of water in the ship—the chief mate did not say to me "We have made a hole, and we have made another one, or we should have been there till 12 o'clock"—the mate did not come to me on the 6th in the forecastle and speak to me, laughing—before I totally abandoned the ship, and after putting up the signal of distress, I put the name of the ship in a bottle, with a short account, and threw it overboard—the chief mate prepared it—he kept the log.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The throwing over of the bottle was on the 25th, was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The bottle went overboard the day before the ship was abandoned—it was thrown over on the 5th, about noon, after the mate had written his log—I asked Besohott and the others to sign this report, because I wanted to have the document with me, as something to report the loss of the vessel—there had been no suggestion that I had anything to do with the loss of the vessel—I never heard of a captain asking for such a thing before—I believe it is usual for the captain and second mate to certify—I asked the carpenter to do so, and I asked him whether the crew would not sign—I wanted the crew to sign, because I really thought the second mate and the carpenter had been saying something to these men—I thought so because the carpenter said, "If you give them two months' pay they will sign it"—I had no particular reason for the men to sign it; all I suggested was for the officers to sign it: I suggested that they should; through asking the carpenter, and his answering on the part of the crew, I naturally thought that there must be an understanding between him and them—I had drawn up the report at the time the carpenter said, "The crew will sign it if you give them two months' pay"—I did not ask the crew to sign it—I never had such a thought in my mind until after the carpenter answered on the part of the crew—I asked the second mate and the carpenter; and then I asked the carpenter if the crew would sign it, and he said, "Yes, if you give them two months' pay"—I knew nothing about the claim for two months' pay till the carpenter told me—I drew that statement up in the cabin for the purpose of having the carpenter's and second mate's signatures to show the loss of the vessel—I never asked them to sign it; I did not want them to sign it—I asked the second mate first</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186005070170"></xptr>
               <p>and then the carpenter, and he said that he would sign it if I would give him two months' pay—this report is true as nigh as possible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it half true? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my oath there are not half of the occurrences in that document—nobody signed it at all—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is my writing—I had not heard any demand about two months' wages when I signed it—I drew it up on board that vessel—(<hi rend="italic">The report was here read</hi>)—we had very serious damage done to the ship on 1st January—a very heavy sea struck her, and a fissure about two and a half feet wide was made by the blow of the sea, which caused a straining of the ends of two planks—there was an opening there (<hi rend="italic">Pointing to the place in the model</hi>) and the waves came in every time the ship plunged—I make no mention of that in my report—I did not consider it so serious a matter as the second occurrence—the leak was two or three feet wide, and a heavy sea came in every time the vessel plunged; but I considered the next occurrence was more im<lb></lb>portant to mention—I wrote this report only two or three days afterwards, when I was on board the steamer that rescued us—I did not think, when I wrote it, of what had happened to the vessel on 1st January—we were a con<lb></lb>siderable distance to the west of Lisbon Harbour on 1st January—I quite forget the latitude and longitude of the vessel on that day, though I give you the latitude and longitude on the 22d and 24th—I remember it on the 4th January because I was compelled to remember it—I had to run for some place and had to shape a course—I think Lisbon might be the nearest harbour, but we were a long way to the west of it—I made no attempt to get into Lisbon Harbour—the gale was N.N.W. to S.W.—when the heavy sea struck the vessel on 1st January, I talked to the chief officer about getting her into harbour and getting her repaired—I considered it a serious injury—it was after that injury that I was slung over to remedy the injury that was then effected—I was also slung over on the 4th—I discussed the matter with my first officer as to the propriety of running for Lisbon, but we were uncertain of the position of the ship, and had I run down and missed the Lisbon bar, the ship was not in a condition te ride off it—I knew at that time pretty well what our position was, but I have forgotten now—I cannot give you any idea of latitude and longitude, nor of the position of the ship when I thought the bar prevented her entering Lisbon—I can give you no idea about it—I discussed it with the mate—I dare say there might be some talk about it—the discussion would not be entered in the log; it was a short discussion—I have forgotten where we were—I dare say the injury was entered in the log; I have not the slightest doubt of it—the particulars of the latitude and longitude may or may not have been entered—the mate would keep the log—I saw it almost every day—I will not speak positively of the latitude and longitude at the time this happened—it ought to have been reckoned, and if the log was properly kept it would have shown the position of the vessel when this occurrence took place; but the position of the ship was so uncertain that it was only a rough account—the vessel was struck on Wednesday and went down about 9 o'clock on Friday night—the ship sank on the 5th, the sea having struck her on the 4th—that is according to this report which I wanted these men to sign—there may be a mistake in it, but the days and times I cannot be mistaken in—I wrote this report myself, and may have made a mistake, but it was on Friday night that the ship went down—I did not consult the second mate or read it over with him; I read it over with the chief mate—he and I were both acquainted with the terms of it—the men refused to work the pumps just before I gave orders to get the boats out—several days before the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186005070171"></xptr>
               <p>ship went down, I saw them very sulky at the pnmps—they refused to work them the day before the ship went down—I did not receive so flat a refusal to work the pumps that day as I did the next, the day the vessel sank—I cannot account for the mistake, so important a thing occurring that day; omitting the intermediate day altogether—the last entry was made in the log the day before the ship went down, on which day a bottle had been thrown over, and yet I omit that day from my report—I forget the date on which I drew up my protest—the <hi rend="italic">Nicholas Wood</hi> arrived At Newport on the 14th; I think it was Saturday—I entered my protest at Newport—I had it formally drawn up at Liverpool in conjunction with the chief mate and the steward, who were acquainted with its contents—(<hi rend="italic">The protest teas here read</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I need not go over the same ground again with you; you say in Liverpool, in that formal document, that the vessel went down the same day that she was struck by the sea? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say anything further; only that it was by mistake—there are many things that I do not mention—I did not leave out intentionally from the report that I threw the log over—there are many things that I left out and did not mention that really occurred in the ship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The log as you know is an extremely important matter on board a vessel; did you leave out of the report you wanted the men to sign, that you threw it overboard by accident, or negligently, or by design? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not mention it—I suppose it was forgotten—there were many things occurred that I did not think of—I remembered it at Liverpool because I was getting the thing done in a proper manner before a notary, and I took paina of course, and recollected many things which transpired—I forgot all about the bottle on the intermediate day—I mean to say upon my oath that my omitting that there was one day's interval between the injury done to the ship and her sinking, was a mistake—it must be a mistake, for she was struck on Wednesday and foundered on Friday night—I never thought anything at Liverpool of there being a day's interval—I did not at the time I was making this protest, think how long the vessel sank after she was injured—I did not know at the time that I had made a mistake, or it would not have been there—I did not write the protest—I do not know that this is a true copy—I went in personally and gave the notary the facts in the chief mate's presence, but not in the steward's—I cannot say whether I gave the fact of the sinking of the vessel, in the chief mate's presence—he was in London on the night the protest was drawn up—I suppose the chief mate did not see the mistake any more than myself—I did not find this mistake out till Mr. Traill or some gentleman mentioned it to me at Greenwich—I was not aware till after that that the protest contained that false statement—I do not recollect whether it was before or after the men had given their evidence, that the mistake was pointed out to me—I think the first I heard of it was when I was in the witness-box, after one of the men had been examined—Hodgson was the chief mate; he is here—I have seen him since yesterday; I have been with him—we have not being staying together—I cannot say that I talked anything directly about this matter—he called at my house last evening when I was at tea—it is impossible to say the whole of the conversation—he was with me about half an hour—I had not told him to call—I will not swear that I might or might not have said, "You may as well call in the evening"—he visits me and my wife—I cannot, on my oath, answer the question whether I told him to call.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I want to know if you forgot it in making the formal protest how you came to recollect it so as to put the very position down in the chart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did that to account for the loss of the vessel in the track I was making—I have also forgotten in the protest that we made for Cape St. Mary, and have made no minute of it—I have remembered it since—it was between Cape St. Vincent and Cape St. Mary that we left the vessel, and about ten o'clock at night—during the afternoon of that day, the 6th, I was trying to get hold of Cape St. Mary—I mean that I bore for Cape St. Mary, but I was never nearer to it than the track laid down—(<hi rend="italic">Pointing out the track on the chart and Capes St. Mary and St. Vincent</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>, <hi rend="italic">after looking at the chart, considered that it was 35 miles exactly</hi>)—I bore away in the first instance with the intention of searching Cadiz, and was making for Cadiz up to 1 o'clock, and at 1 headed the ship to and made for St. Mary's, or about that time—the wind was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186005070173"></xptr>
               <p>hauling round—if we were going to St. Mary's we should not have to sail north, but east and a little southerly; instead of which we were obliged by the wind to go S.E.—it was after dinner that we hauled up the chain, just after 1 o'clock, and we finished it about 5—that was done with the intention of anchoring under Cape St. Mary if I could reach there—the ship was heading in that direction when I gave that order, and she went about 3 miles on that course and then broke off; she was making water at that time—the only object of taking up the chains was with a view of anchoring if I could get there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to take the men away from the pumps and keep them away? why did not you stop that order when you found the veasel did not act? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not tell that the wind would not back again—if I had not hauled the chains up ready to anchor I should have been censured by the Board of Trade—I did not take the men away from the chains at 3 o'clock and put them to the pumps, because it was impossible for me to tell, the wind might have hauled to the westward again, and if it had I should have still pushed on with the same intention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It was a very important matter to take up the chains, and an equally important matter making for St. Mary's; I ask you to tell the Jury why you never mentioned either of those matters in your protest or in the report that you drew up three days afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because it was forgotten—the mate gave me the log on the 6th, just before leaving the ship; it was the ordinary sized log; I think I asked the mate for it just before leaving the vessel—I took it out of his possession to have charge of it—I thought it was an important document—he had kept it all the voyage—I thought it safer to put it into my desk, which was in the cabin—I do not know whether anybody was present and saw me put it in—I cannot tell why I did not put it into my pocket or about my person—when I threw the desk into the water I said, "There, I shall not want you any more"—I do not know whether I said "There"—I do not think I said "There go all my papers;"I will swear I did not, nothing of the kind—I do not recollect saying a word about papers—it was an ordinary shaped master's desk—I did not recollect at the time that the log was in it, and if I bad there would have been a great deal to prevent my taking it out; I did not think about logs, or books, or anything else—I do not know whether I mentioned, on board of, or to the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Nicholas Wood</hi>, that I had lost my log.</p>

               <p>because I might have made the land, but my ship was not in a condition to beat off a lee shore—the wind was blowing N.N.W. part of the day, and as it was blowing so fearfully I could never be certain of it for an hour—some<lb></lb>times it would fly into the northward, and not give the slightest warning, in two or three minutes—the danger in making for Lisbon harbour was on account of the weather, and not on account of the state of the ship—the 5th is mentioned in my report, but I have no date whatever of the day on which the ship sank—it was on a Friday—I never had the slightest doubt of the day on the week on which the very heavy sea broke upon the bows of the vessel and caused that damage; it was Wednesday, the day before the ship went down—there was a refusal on the part of the crew to work at the pumps—it was what we term a general growl—the men were all grumbling, and refused to go to the pumps, and physical force was used to make them go—they did work, but the chief mate had to rope's-end them—he thrashed them to the pumps—they worked rope's-ended on 5th, and up to noon on 6th—they worked for an hour or so after they had hauled up the chains—their last hour of working at the pumps was between 5 and 6 o'clock—they then separated from the pumps, and gave a flat refusal—it was then that I urged them to pump—it was on the 6th, the day on which the vessel sank, that I was at one time trying to make Cape St. Mary, and went about three miles—the wind was N.N.E. and the ship heading east—I was in hopes if I reached Cape St. Mary, as the wind was off the land, I might have anchored there, and perhaps stopped the leaks from the outside, and pushed on to Cadiz—it is not a place of shelter—it is a very wild open place, but I should have let down the anchor there; and if we had been under the lee of the shore I hoped to repair the vessel—this was the first time since we left home that we hauled up the chains for the purpose of being ready to let go the anchor—if the crew had worked properfy at the pumps they might have kept the vessel up for a short time longer—we had kept her np through the day, but I do not think we could have kept her up through the night, so as to leave her by daylight in the morning, because she was so settled down, and the water was coming in with great force—my desk rested on the seat that goes round the stern of the boat when it was first put in, and I was sitting on it, my wife filled up the whole space in the body of the gig—she was sitting there—I sat upon the box when I was steering, which raised me above the gunwale of the boat—my feet were on a level with the gunwale—in con<lb></lb>sequence of the way in which my wife and other persons were disposed, that was the only way in which I could sit—sometime after we left the ship the wind freshened—the sea was getting up all the time, and I found that I could not sit with safety to my own life on that raised surface—one clothes-bag was on a seat on the other side, and the sextant was a little nearer astern—they were in the way of any one sitting with safety.</p>

               <p>before she was ready for sea—she began to take in cargo on the day I joined—I saw the crew go on board—I noticed the ventilator holes—there were two side scuttles in the starboard—the glass of one was broken—we had them taken out, the captain and I together, and had the holes filled up, and all was made <hi rend="italic">taut</hi>—the hole was seven or eight inches inside, and eleven inches out<lb></lb>side—it was impossible to drive it out—there was also a bit of felt and a piece of deal nailed over outside—that was exactly in the same state when the ship sank, as it was when we left London—we left on 13th December, landed our pilot on the following day, and for some days had fine weather till we crossed the Bay of Biscay; but a part of the time the wind chopped round to the north-west, and about the 21st or 22d of September it changed and became bad—we had a succession of gales from that time till the ship foundered—before the bad weather had set in, the ship had been making no water at all to speak of—on New Year's Day, or somewhere thereabouts, a sea struck the bulwarks on the port side, and the bulwarks on the starboard side were washed away by the sea on 23d or 24th—on Christmas Day it blew away the topsails, and broke three panes in the sky-light in the stern—some watercame in, and the steward baled it out—on 1st January a heavy sea struck the ship—it started two planks, on the lower knee on the star<lb></lb>board side of the cutwater—the head rails were not disturbed anything to speak of that day, but there was a starting on the starboard side, and the ship made much more water—you could see daylight through from the inside, and every time the ship plunged, the water came rushing in with tremendous force—the captain, the carpenter, and myself were slung over the bows, and we tried to make a patchy affair of it—he tried to put a bit of flannel and boarding over it—we were hanging over by a rope—that was all that was done that day—we used to go down to look at it to see that all was light between the 1st and the 4th—it kept a little of the water out, and we were able by pumping to keep the water out with ease, as the leak was above the water-line; but the water came in when the ship pitched and plunged forward—nothing else was done between the 1st and 4th to stop the leak—on 4th, about 11 o'clock in the morning, a heavy sea struck the ship—I was on deck at the time, standing by the pumps—I felt the ship shake and tremble fore and aft, and the cook was washed out of the galley—the captain was below—he came up very shortly afterwards—the sea washed the cutwater and the figure was quite loose—it carried away the lower knee and head-rail on the starboard side—the sea struck the vessel on that side, the cutwater shook backwards and forwards—it was all adrift: all loose; the ship had completely opened forwards—all the plank timbers on the starboard side had started from the stern, as far as you could see from the inside—I could see that the leak was about three-quarters of an inch wide—this was not the same strain or opening that had happened on the 1st—planks were started on the 4th that had not started on the 1st, and it was as much as I could do to keep her above water after that—we got blankets over the bows, but they were washed away as fast as we got them there—the sea was too high, and the ship was knocking about too much: it was impossible—somebody was slung over the bows to fasten the blankets—I took my turn, and Captain Hewitt was over too; we found we could not really stop the leak from the outside, the sea was too high—from that time one pump was constantly kept going, and at the end of every watch both pumps—they continued to work the pumps between the 1st and the 4th—they were constantly going after this happened—we left the ship on Friday; it was two days before that, Wednesday, that the great blow</p>

               <p>struck the ship—the pumps were kept constantly going on the day before the ship sank—we had a difficulty all along to keep the men to the pumps; it was as much as I could do to get them out of the forecastle, out of their berths—they had very hard work some days, they were fatigued and ex<lb></lb>hausted; but previous to the 5th they only wanted pressing to the pumps; but the day before the ship went down I had to lug them out of the fore<lb></lb>castle and drive them to the pumps—I talked to them quietly in the first place, and found that did not take effect, so I was obliged to hammer them to the pumps—I mean that I rope's-ended them to the pumps—I recollect very well the day on which the ship was left—it was the 6th, Friday—it was my watch from 8 to 12 that morning, the forenoon watch; and the morning watch was the second mate's—I was not seeing what was going on from 4 to 8—my watch was from 8 to noon, and during that time the pumps were kept continually going, and we had two meals in one, breakfast and dinner—7 o'clock was the breakfast hour of the watch below, and 8 o'clock the other; but they did not breakfast at all that morning—the first meal that we had was between 11 and 12, breakfast and dinner in one, and after that they started to get the anchors over the bows and the chains on deck, for the purpose of being ready to let go an anchor if necessary—all hands were employed in hauling up the chains—it took two hours and a half or three hours, after which they pumped about an hour, and then turned round and said that they would pump no longer—they had sores on their hands and legs—they said that they were really exhausted, and could not keep the ship afloat, and that the land was in sight—the captain tried to get them to keep her afloat till we arrived at Cadis—a man named Gorth was spokesman for all the rest, and they began showing their hands and legs, and saying they would pump no longer, and there was no more pumping—we kept the carpenter continually employed inside for an hour before the ship went down, poking oakum into the hole—Stovell, the cook, is an old man—I think he has been forty or fifty years at sea—the captain spoke to him in the presence of the crew as the oldest man, and he replied, "You are the captain of the ship, you ought to know how to act better than I do"—at 5 o'clock on the 6th there was a tremendous sea, but yery little wind—it had gradually died away to a calm, but still there was a considerable sea—after they refused to pump, the captain gave orders to get the boats ready—they began to get them ready at half-past 4 or 5 o'clock—there were three boats, but one was stove—the long boat and the gig were got out—I went in the long<lb></lb>boat—it was about three-quarters of an hour before the ship went down that we got into the boats—we stopped by till we saw the ship go down, which was while we were getting a sail rigged in the long-boat—we had not got too far to see it—we were 200 yards from it—we were picked up next morning by the <hi rend="italic">Nicholas Wood</hi>, between 11 and 12 in the forenoon—the wind was then gradually increasing—there was a cross sea on, with a westerly gale—it was not a worse sea than when we got into the boat, but a different sea, a cross sea—there were two winds meeting—the water came into the boat I was in, and we had to keep two buckets continually baling it out—we were 30 or 35 miles from land in the morning—if we had not been picked up there would not have been a soul left three or four hours afterwards, with that sea, to tell the tale—we must have gone to the bottom, no doubt—on the 5th I threw a bottle into the sea, with the latitude and longitude, as far as I could tell by dead reckoning, and stated what our prospects were—I never expected, at that time, to see the land again, but did not give up all hopes—it was my business to keep the log—I gave it to the captain on the 6th,</p>

I am a stevedore—I was employed to stow the cargo of the ship <hi rend="italic">John Sugars</hi>—there was no bulk-head dividing the forecastle from the hold; the cargo itself made the bulk-head—the first cargo, that came was sixty tons of wire, which was put in the bottom of the hold; and fifty tons of blacksmiths, coal, which consisted of dust, was stowed with the, wire to keep the weight at the bottom—the ventilators were filled up, what they call the scuttles of the ship; I saw the one on the port side filled up, the one on the starboard side was filled up when I was not there, but the one on the port side I saw done and assisted in ramming the plug in—it was a bit of an old spar and was tapered off at one end—on the outside was a piece of felt, and outside that was a board again—I saw it wedged from the inside, and it was as strong as any part of the ship—no foroe could have forced it out—you might have pushed it in, but from inwards to outwards you could not have strength sufficient, because the inside was so much larger that the out, therefore the plank would have had to give way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a native of the Dutch country—I was steward on board the <hi rend="italic">John Sugars</hi>—the weather was middling fine going down Channel; it changed in the Bay of Biscay—we had very bad weather indeed about Christmas Day—I remember it because I could not carry out my orders; I had to make pudding for the men, but we had such heavy gales that I could not make it, and the men had beef and potatoes for their Christmas dinner—during that weather a great deal of the bulwarks were carried away at different times—the cook was washed out of his galley—I cannot say whether that was before the new year—it was about Christmas—I recollect some water casks being washed away from the lashings and away from the deck, and some harness casks were smashed—we shipped a very heavy on the starboard quarter, which smashed the sky-light glass in the cabin, and a great deal of water came down, which we bailed out with buckets, which were passed up on deck by the youngster, named George Wager—on Wednesday, the 4th, a very heavy sea struck the ship right forwards—I was in my pantry, and the captain was in the cabin with his wife—he came on deck and said, "My God, what is that?" and the vessel shook a great deal from the blows—I looked over the bows, and saw that the out-water was jiggling along, nearly washed away, and a portion of the rails were washed away—the lower knee on the starboard side had gone entirely—after that I was down in the forecastle, and noticed that the sides of the stem opened a great deal up and down, I-could see the light through—I had a lamp at the time, and the sea put it out—I saw the captain, the chief mate, and the carpenter that day out over the bows, and saw blankets got to stop the leak with; one came from my bed, a very large one—I gave it, and Mrs. Hewitt gave part of another blanket; besides that blanket and half blanket, a sail was brought out of the cabin, which was put over the bows, and I think it remained there twelve hours—the oakum was under my charge—I gave a great deal out several times during the last two days to the car<lb></lb>penter Lehmann—I also recollect the carpenter being hung over the bows on New Year's Day, trying to stop the leak—from the time this very bad</p>

               <p>weather set in, the pumps were continually going—they could not be left on the day we left the ship—on Friday we were pumping till dinner time, the captain never stripped, and went to bed; he could not during the gales—I recollect the chains being hauled up, after that I saw the men go to the pumps for awhile—I was there at the time they left the pumps—they pumped for an hour, and then said they would pump no longer, because their hands were sore and they were tired and weary—the captain entreated them to keep pumping a little longer, as they were not far from Cadiz—they said they could not, as their hands were very weary, and it was very wearing, therefore they left off pumping the ship—the captain addressed the cook, he being the oldest man in the ship—the men were not willing gene<lb></lb>rally to go to the pumps—the chief mate had to drive them and shove them, and take the end of the rope and drive them to the pumps—all the top<lb></lb>sails were set on 6th January—on that day the carpenter appeared to be tipsy—all I had given him that morning was a wine glass of rum and water—we had no bottles of brandy on board—we had brandy in small casks—I do not know whether there were any spirits among the cargo—I saw the chief mate order the carpenter out of his bunk that day—I went into the second cabin on the day we left the ship, the 6th, and saw the second mate packing up his clothes—I told him that the captain had given me orders to tell him to set the foresail, and asked him what he was doing, he said, "That is my busi<lb></lb>ness"—I went up and told the master, who went up on deck after him—that was between half-past 4 and 5 in the morning—I left the ship in a small boat, the gig, with the captain—I recollect a sail being put up to it, or a bit of canvas—I kept it up for a few minutes, but the wind blew it down very soon—I saw the captain's desk in the boat—the second mate was sitting on it when he was steering—the men did not sit on seats, they were in the bottom of the boat—after the second mate came away from the helm, the captain took it and sat on the box, and the second mate lay down in the boat covered with some oil skins—I recollect a steamer passing us—we tried to signal to her, but she took no notice at all, and all hopes were gone—I recollect the captain saying something to his wife, and very beautifully too—he put his hand on her shoulder and said, "Mary, it is a case with us"—she said, "Well, James, we both shall go together, and God shall provide for Harry," who, I suppose, was a son—I saw the desk thrown over—that was after tho steamer passed, and after the captain had spoken in that way to his wife—when the desk was thrown over, the captain sat lower in the boat, and was a little more comfortable—the sea and the wind freshened in the night—the sea was getting very rough at the time the box was thrown over—I noticed the second mate with two bottles in the boat—they looked some<lb></lb>thing like brandy—we had not any such bottles in the usual stores of the ship—I was steward—on the night after we got on board the <hi rend="italic">Nicholas Wood</hi>, she suffered a great deal from the wind—she was dismasted, and the wind kept rising till it blew a gale the next night—it was a very good thing she did pick us up, else we should not have been here now—the boy, Cox, was very sick indeed—he fell in my hands in the cook's galley—I do not exactly recollect the day, but it had just commenced to blow a little—it seemed to me that he fell in fits—I carried him down to his berth—a youngster named George Wager assisted me—he remained ill about ten or twelve days—I stripped him; and the captain and I put my own flannels on him—from that time until the time he left the ship, he was not able to attend to his duties—I never heard of any holes being bored in the ship, before I came ashore—Cox could not go on deck for any purpose.</p>

I am a ship owner in business at Liverpool, and have been so for some time past—I have had a considerable number of ships; the number varies—for the last two or three years I have had somewhere about 40—I was the owner of the <hi rend="italic">John Sugars</hi>—I purchased her, I think, in October—this (<hi rend="italic">producecd</hi>) is the bill of sale under which I took her—it is dated 31st October, 1859—the purchase money was 2,150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid that amount for her—this was the first voyage she had gone after my purchase—between the time of my purchase, and the time of her leaving London, I had made various disbursements and incurred various expenses in addition to the purchase-money—certain disbursements had been made for the ship by my brokers, Seymour, Peacock, and Co., to the amount of 275<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and by myself to the amount of 235<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—besides that, I tent up from my stores in Liverpool some sails for the use of the ship, the value of which I estimate at about 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were two bales of canvass sent from my stores besides, value about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I effected insurances on the ship to the amount of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the expenses of which were 139<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was also rather more than 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I put in the course of business, to the debit of the ship for calculation in the event of a loss—I took care to insure such an amount as would cover the expenses of the ship, and the expense of the insurances—these sums added up come to 2,900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have the vouchers, if necessary, to support that statement—I effected 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. insurances on the ship, and 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the freight—there were two policies in London, one in Glasgow, and one in Aberdeen, to cover the 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the Aberdeen is paid, and a portion of the London one is paid, and another portion is to be paid this week—one is a time policy, for twelve months—a portion of that has been settled, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is a thousand pound policy—we were told that it would be paid, but two of the underwriters have failed—we have been paid 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have three policies in Court out of four—two of them were on the ship, the other two are in Glasgow—they have not been paid; nothing has been paid upon them—one is in the name of M'Kearn, and the other of Wingate and Sons; they are the brokers—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the policy on the freight, 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had a manifest rendered to me by my broker, showing me the amount of freight that was insured—this is it; it is to the amount of 1,962<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the policy was for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 1,900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd was all mere freight without premium, or interest, or anything of the sort—the disbursements that I have mentioned are money disbursements, and the statement does not include any interest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Let me understand clearly the state of things; you have been paid 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have been paid 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on one policy, and some<lb></lb>thing on another; I could not tell the amount—I had no insurance in Liverpool; I do insure in Liverpool often, and have some polices there now—I have not been very unfortunate—I have lost three vessels—the <hi rend="italic">Thetis</hi> which I lost in September last, she was partly insured; the <hi rend="italic">Panola</hi> in October last, and the <hi rend="italic">Birkenhead</hi> in October—the <hi rend="italic">John Sugars</hi> was in January—I had not a ship called the Jessie—that is Mr. J. R. Wilson—the <hi rend="italic">Mary Oxley</hi> was managed, but not owned, by me—she was abandoned two months ago—she was not a ship of mine; the <hi rend="italic">Caledonia</hi> was mine—she was lost in January or February—I do not know such a ship as the <hi rend="italic">John Lucy</hi>—I did not see the captain when he came to Liverpool; 1 saw him in London about</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186005070190"></xptr>
               <p>a fortnight after the ship was lost—that was not before he went to Liver-pool; he went there first—it was before he made the protest—I did not see him after he made the protest—the parties who got the command of the freight have made no advance to me; I have received none of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Here is your own manifest, "Freight to be paid in London?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it is very possible—my brokers would receive freight in London if it was there—I do not know what arrangement they made—if they got a policy of insurance, of course it was not returned—no lives have been lost in any vessels of mine that have been lost that I am aware of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said that three of your vessels were lost last year; what fleet or number of vessels had you at sea during that year? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About thirty-six or thirty-seven—the <hi rend="italic">Thetis</hi> I did not consider fully insured, the <hi rend="italic">Panola</hi> was short insured, and the <hi rend="italic">Birkenhead</hi> the same; none of them were over insured—the <hi rend="italic">Thetis</hi> was going out to Quebec with timber; the <hi rend="italic">Panola</hi> was bound from Bombay to Lisbon with general cargo: she was lost about 1,500 miles from here at sea, on her homeward voyage with her cargo; the <hi rend="italic">Birkenhead</hi> was a timbership, too; a ship called the <hi rend="italic">Caledonia</hi> was lost, which was also a timbership from St. John's to New Brunswick—none but the usual difficulty has been made by the underwriters to get off if they can—there has been nothing whatever out of the ordinary eourse—I only know by this account whether the freight or goods loaded on the <hi rend="italic">John Sugars</hi> was made payable by the shippers, a certain time after the ship had sailed—whatever we received was by the broker, and would be credited to me in his account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that your practice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is the captain's practice—it has to be decided who is to pay for it—I supply the means as far as I can—the captain has had nothing to do with the matter, and I will carry him through—I expect I shall have to pay.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a son of Mr. Davison, the second partner of the firm of Fry and Davison, in Fenchurch-street—they were the loading brokers of the <hi rend="italic">John Sugars</hi>—the stipulated freight of goods loaded for that ship was 1,963<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—part was to be paid in London two months after the sailing of the vessel—we have received the amount to 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. something—this manifest is from our office—180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. appears there—I think that is near enough—that is the amount within a pound or two.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clergyman, residing at Methering<lb></lb>ham, Lincolnshire—about December, last year, I had a quantity of hay for sale; I put an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Stamford Mercury</hi>—I have not got a copy of it—on 3rd January I received this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), in consequence of which I wrote to 38, Hart Street, Covent Garden; on 11th January I received this communication; I wrote again, and on 13th received this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); after that I sent 1 ton 7 cwt. of hay to Gregory Wilson &amp; Co., 38, Hart Street, a sample truck—I also sent a communication respecting it—on the 19th I received this cheque.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier and clerk at the Birkbeck Bank—I cannot recognize the prisoner—there is no one here from the bank who can—I can recognize her handwriting by the cheques; I cannot swear to her being the person who opened an account with us, but from my memory I should say she was—the account was opened on 2nd January, 1871, with a sum of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the handwriting in this book which I produce, which shows the opening of the account, is precisely the same as that on this cheque; they are written by the same hand—at the time she opened the account I gave her a cheque book of fifty cheques; this is one of those cheques—the account was never more than 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we have had from fifteen to twenty cheques presented from time to time in the same handwriting, eleven of them have been dishonoured, and about five or six paid; the dishonoured</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187105010043"></xptr>
               <p>cheques amounted to about 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., all in the same handwriting—the largest amount of the paid cheques was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—a person of the name of Harris opened an account with us—I believe that was not the prisoner—we should not have allowed her to open accounts in two different names, if we knew it—the prisoner gave her address as 38, Hart Street, Covent Garden, and described herself as a potato saleswoman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> It was not me that opened the account—my husband sent me—I was ashamed to go in with so little money, and I got a young person who went with me to go in and do it; neither did I put my name to the cheque; it is not my writing at all. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I should not like to swear that the prisoner is the person—I did not see her again till I saw her at Bow Street, last month—she was then in the dock—I did not pick her out from others.</p>

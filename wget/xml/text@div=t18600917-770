I am a baker, living at Enfield Town—on the night of 13th August last I was passing from Enfield, through the fields leading to Edmonton, and saw the prisoner at a gate on the left hand side, leading to a foot-path, lighting his pipe—I spoke to him, but he did not make me any answer—this was about a quarter to 6 o'clock—I returned again about a quarter to 7, along the same foot-path, and he was then coming out of the field at the opposite gate to where I had seen him first—I saw him coming from the stack—I know Mr. Winterburn's field—that was the field where the hay-stack was, which was afterwards found to be on fire.</p>

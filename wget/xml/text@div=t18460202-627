                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in New-row, Deptford—on the morning of the 6th of Jan. I left my coat, waistcoat, and trowsers hang<lb></lb>ing on a nail in my bed-room—I came back at four or half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, and they were gone—they have not been found—only this handkerchief and pad—this pad is mine, and to the best of my opinion this handkerchief is mine—they were in the pocket of the coat I lost.</p>

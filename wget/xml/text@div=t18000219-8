             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. On Monday morning, the 27th, between nine and ten o'clock, I was sent for by Mr. Rhodes; I went to his yard, in the Hampstead-road, and found Mr. Rhodes and the prisoner standing together; Mr. Rhodes said, here is a man with a bag at his back, with fowls, which I have a strong suspicion he has stole; I then took him into custody, with the fowls.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Brawn.) How far is Mr. Rhodes's yard from your mother's? - A. Between two and three miles; my mother lives at Kilburn, in the parish of Hampstead.</p>
               <p>Upchurch. The prisoner told me he bought them at Highgate, of a man that came from Barnet; I asked him if he knew the man; he said, no; I asked him if he had a cart; he said, not that he knew of; I asked him if he had a horse; he said, he did not know.

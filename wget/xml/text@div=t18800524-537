I live at 13, Betterton Street—I was going down Castle Street from Drury Lane with some grocery, and saw three men running very hard from Endell Street towards me; the prisoner is one of them—I have not the slightest doubt of him—Miss Davey and an elderly lady were running after him crying "Stop thief!"—I did not go to the station, my hands were too full.</p>

On 4th May I took the prisoner in bed in a common lodging-house in Seven Dials—I told him the charge; he made no reply—I placed him with thirteen others, and Miss Davey picked him out—he asked me at the police-court at what time the larceny took place—I said "Some time before 12 o'clock"—he said "I am very glad of that; I can prove where I was; I was in Berwick Street at the time, and from there I went to my mother's, and did not return to the lodging-house till Sunday night."</p>

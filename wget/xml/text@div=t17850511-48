               <p>Mr. Wybourne, Council for the Prisoner. How long did the prisoner live with you? - Between four and five years.</p>
               <p>In what capacity? - As a porter.</p>
               <p>During that time in course he had several articles of value under his care? - Certainly he had; he used to take bills and receipts, he has taken a great deal of money.</p>
               <p>Did you dismiss him from your service? - I did, before I went into the country.</p>
               <p>How long is it since you missed these things? - In the course of last year, four or five months ago.</p>
               <p>Did you ever tax the prisoner with them? - No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner has left you five weeks? - Yes, thereabouts.</p>
               <p>When was he apprehended? - About three weeks ago.</p>

Had you intrusted the prisoner to carry these things home to the several persons to whom they might be sent to be japanned by you? - I never intrusted him to carry them home, because they were never booked down to anybody, and what went with them I cannot tell.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a headborough, I went to the lodgings of the prisoner on the 25th of April, as near as I can guess, with a warrant from Mr. Girdler, in search of the prisoner; I did not at first find him at his lodgings; I sat down with his wife, and had some little discourse, while Mr. Lock availed himself of the opportunity of looking round the apartment, there I found a tea-pot, a tea-canister, a flour-box, and a waiter.</p>
               <p>Court. These things were not in the lodging concealed? - No, they were hung up as their own furniture.</p>
               <p>(These things deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The waiter and mug were japanned at my house; if I had seen the waiter at the West Indies I could have known it; I had given no directions for any other man to carry them out of my shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Had not you sold the prisoner that waiter? - No, nor never intrusted him to carry it out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wybourne. Do you recollect ever japanning any article for the prisoner himself? - No never, I think not.</p>
               <p>What particular mark is there on that waiter? - None, I know it by the work.</p>
               <p>You will presume to swear that is the waiter belonging to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any thing particular in the painting that waiter not to be found in other shops? - This is a rose and a bird, and rose-buds and strawberries.</p>
               <p>Are not these the common ornaments on things of that sort? - They are often done, but we know it by the work.</p>
               <p>Does the man that you employ to paint for you paint for any other japanners besides yourself? - Not that I know of, he works for me constantly.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner, he is a servant of mine till he was taken into custody about these things.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner at any time purchase any articles of you belonging to your trade? - He bought this tea-pot, and a quarter of a pound canister; this is the canister, I know nothing of the waiter.</p>
               <p>Look at it again, is there any thing uncommon or particular about it in the make or the japanning? - It is what we call an old fashioned one, that is all that is particular in it, it seems as if it had been twice japanned; the prisoner behaved himself as an upright man, for anything that I knew or ever heard he was a diligent honest man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. James. You being a japanner as well as the prisoner, is it your opinion that a person of the trade can sufficiently judge of articles of this kind to speak to them again? - Not unless there is a mark made on them before; I before made a remark on this, not understanding the consequences but by their being in my possession, so long, I knew the marks on them, this jug I have had in my shop a long time, and the handle is not in the right place now.</p>
               <p>Now as to the other articles, is there any particular mark upon them? - It is rather uncommon for tea-pots to be made like this; they are all made of common tin; I never had any thing of the kind came under my care finished in this manner.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any letter or mark of the price on the tea-pot? - No, I know it by the workmanship, but the jug has a mark of 2 s. 9 d. put on by myself.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110069"></xptr>Mr. James. I will give every thing up except the waiter.</p>

               <p>I knew the prisoner several years, he has an exceeding good character from the people in the trade as far as I know, and I know most of them; I saw the prosecutor about the latter end of April.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner then live with him? - Not the last time I saw him, he was then servant to Mr. Davison.</p>
               <p>Relate the conversation that passed between the prosecutor and you at that time? - I had been intimate with Mr. Davison sometime, and since he has been in the japanning business, I have employed him; I had employed Mr. Lock for these eight years, I now employ Mr. Davison being a neighbour, doing the work as well and cheaper, and being so handy; Lock came to me and asked me if he had lost my favours, I told him I believed he had; says he, I find he has got my man Wilmot, I said, yes, he has; says he, he is a very bad fellow, he made him out a thief.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Lock appear to you to be in a passion when he spoke of the prisoner? - Yes, and a great one, and said he would punish him to the utmost.</p>
               <p>Mr. James. Where was this? - He had then searched the lodging of the prisoner, it cannot be more than a fortnight ago, it was either the latter end of April, or the beginning of May.</p>

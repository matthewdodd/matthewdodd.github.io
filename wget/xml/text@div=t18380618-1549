                  </hi>. I live in London-passage, Golden-lane, St. Luke's. On the 9th of June, between seven and eight o'clock at night, I was passing along Golden-lane, and my wife was on the other side of the way—I was drunk—I had the money stated in my right-hand pocket, and my chisel in my left—when I got up Golden-lane, against the burying-ground, I fell down—I was then lifted up by gome one, and taken into the middle of the road—some person came and knocked me down on my face—when I was taken up I had lost every thing out of my pocket—I do not know who took it—this is my chisel—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I was walking on the other side of the street. I saw the prisoner, and two more girls, come to ray husband when he fell down, and take something from him, and likewise this chisel—I took it out of her hand.</p>

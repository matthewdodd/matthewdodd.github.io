I went to Dept-ford and Greenwich, went into a shop for some cough-drops, and tendered this shilling. I did not know it was bad till the woman said so. I gave her another. I put it into my pocket, intending to destroy it I then went to get some tobacco, and was given in charge. This man is an entire stranger to me, and all that he has been saying about me is false.</p>

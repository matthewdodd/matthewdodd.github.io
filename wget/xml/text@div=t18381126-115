                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Thomas Cubitt, at Eaton-square. He is a builder, and employs from 500 to 1000 men—the prisoner was his carter—on the 1st of November his horses stood at his stable, at Grosvenor Basin—he was drawing articles, from time to time, about that part—I have some pieces of wood that have been found—this one piece is Mr. Cubitt's—I know the plank from whence it has been sawed—it was pur<lb></lb>chased in November, 1829, and left in Mr. Cubitt's timber-yard, in Eaton-place-none of the men have any permission to take away wood—I can identify these three pieces—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Milsom-street, Westminster. About half-past twelve o'clock, on the 6th of November, I received information, and went to No. 3, Walker's-buildings, where the prisoner lodges—I found in an out-house this one piece of wood—I found three other pieces up stairs, and other pieces below—I was present when Mr. Dines spoke to the prisoner-what he has stated is true—it was in an empty room up stairs that I found these pieces.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Union-street, Pimlico. On the 1st of November the prisoner called at Mr. Lee's wharf, where I was working—it was breakfast or dinner time, I will not be certain which—he had got Mr. Cubitt's horse and cart with him—that wharf is on the Grosvenor Basin—he came after a load of lime, and asked me if he could leave a bit of board till he called for it—he took it out of the cart, and I put it inside a door in a cement-shop—this is the piece—on the following Saturday his son came to me for the board—I delivered it to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Walker's-buildings, and am a widow. The prisoner lodges there—his son is eleven years old, old enough to be examined—on the 3rd of November, I overheard the prisoner say to his son, "George, you go over to the Lime-wharf, and tell Charles to give you the piece of board which I told him to put by," the boy went, and fetched it in—I gave notice of that to Mr. Cubitt.</p>

Q.</hi> How many days was that afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the Saturday he told the boy, and on Tuesday morning I told of it—I never told any one that I gave information the next morning—I went to Walker's place on the 1st of September—it is a large house—I occupy the bottom floor—the prisoner had one room, and I had the other—we were all together—we had three beds—the prisoner and this boy were living with me—he paid me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for the keep of them both, and they lived with me in common—we did not sleep together—I can swear that—I will not swear that I never slept with the prisoner at all, nor that we were not living as man and wife—we were living together from the 1st of Septem<lb></lb>ber till he was taken into custody—the prisoner's things were all in my care—his</p>

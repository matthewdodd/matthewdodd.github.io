            Did you know the prisoner? - A. Yes, I know him by dealing in the lane; he used to deal in clothes, or any thing that is offered to be sold.</p>

                  <persName id="t18011202-27-person280">Q. </persName>
            Look at that box, do you know it? - A. I think I have seen this box before; I am positive I have; it was about the middle of last January; when I was sitting in the Blue Boar, in Rosemary-lane, a stranger came into the room with this box; first he came up to me, and looked at several articles I had got to sell, but nothing would suit him; he went from me to the next box, where the prisoner set with his clothes; he looked at several articles, and at last had a waistcoat, which Wolfe valued at five shillings and six-pence, and he paid him down six shillings and six-pence besides; they valued the box at twelve shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You never had seen the person who brought the box in? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a man was he? - A. A man about half a head taller than I, or thereabouts; I cannot justly recollect, it is so long ago; he might be five feet four or five inches.</p>

            Was he an old or young man? - A. A middle-aged man, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dress? - A. I declare I cannot recollect; there are so many people coming backwards and forwards, it is impossible to recollect every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect the colour of his clothes? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether he had a great coat or a common coat? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. This man went to the other box? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be attending to the other box? - A. As he left me I had nobody standing with me; I did not follow him, I only looked round to see whether they dealt or no.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of the day was it? - A. About half past two o'clock, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were there beside you and those two? - A. I suppose there might be a dozen people, and strangers; I don't know any body in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know one of them by name? - A. I don't recollect just now any one. (The Court had ordered the other witnesses out of Court.) I have seen the man out of Court, but have no acquaintance with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he was there? - A. Yes, I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me just now you did not know any one? - A. No particular person; I did not know any one by name.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know his name? - A. No.</p>

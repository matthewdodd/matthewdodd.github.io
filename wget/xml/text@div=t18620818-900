                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 9, Hanover-street, Bermondsey—on 10th July last, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming over London-bridge—I had a purse in my pocket, containing 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I last felt it safe about three minutes before—I felt the prisoner's hand in my pocket, and I caught hold of his arm—he twisted from me and went to the other side of the bridge—I examined my pocket the moment he left, and the purse was gone—the prisoner had a coat on his arm—my sister was with me—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

I am the wife of Charles Barnard, of 9, Hanover-street, Bermondsey—I was accompanying my sister over London-bridge on the 10th, and saw her take hold of a man's arm, and saw him run across the road—it was the prisoner—I called out for police—the prisoner ran, and the police ran after him—I saw his face—he is the man the police ran after, the same man who had his hand in my sister's pocket.</p>

I was on duty on London-bridge, about 5 o'clock in the evening of 10th July—I saw the prosecutrix, and she told me to stop the prisoner, as he had robbed her of her purse—he was then running—he had one coat on and another on his arm—I followed him—he ran down the Borough, down St. Thomas'-street on the left, and then took the first turning on the right to Guy's Hospital, and then he turned to the left again, when I lost sight of him—I then saw one of our officers, Sergeant Funnell, who beckoned to me, and in consequence of something, I went into the parlour of the Wheat Sheaf public-house, and found the prisoner there—he had put on the coat which he had had on his arm—he had two coats on—I took him back to London-bridge—I searched him in the middle of the road, and found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a halfpenny on him—I did not find the purse—I brought him back to the prosecutrix at the foot of the bridge—as soon as I got back she and the witness identified him—he refused his address at the station.</p>

Q.</hi> How far was the prisoner from you when the pro<lb></lb>secutrix spoke to you about her purse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About seven or eight yards, and in flight as fast as he could go—I was in the middle of the road regulating the traffic—I lost sight of him when he turned to the right and then to the left—he was alone in the parlour—there was no drink before him—I only opened the parlour door once—I did not ask him how long he had been there—I don't remember whether he said he had been there twenty minutes or half an hour—the prosecutrix identified him the moment she saw him—she said, "He had one coat on, but he has two now"—I said, "Yes; I am aware he has"—she said he had a coat on his arm—I don't remember whether she then said, "He is the man."</p>

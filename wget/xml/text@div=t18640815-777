                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES HANNA</hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 94). On 15th July, at a little after 10 o'clock, I was with Legg in New Bridge-street, Blackfriars, and saw the prisoner and another man and a woman go into a public-house in Bride-lane—they stayed there three-quarters of an hour, came out, and went to Shoe<lb></lb>maker-row, into a public-house at the corner of Cobb's-court—the prisoner end the female left there and went into Church Entry, the other man re<lb></lb>mained in the public-house—they returned to the same public-house, and stopped till 12 o'clock, when the house was closed, when they all three left and went down Church Entry and up Finnis-court to the rear of Mr. Brankston's premises—I spoke to Legg and followed them—I saw the prisoner standing about halfway up the court, and the female in front of him extending her dress with her hands—another female then went up the court, and the prisoner and the first female walked down to where Legg and I were standing followed by the other man—I was in plain clothes—I took the prisoner by the collar and said, "What have you been up the court for?"—he said, "I have not"—I said, "I am a police-officer, and shall take you in custody for being there for an unlawful purpose"—he was very violent and struggled very much—he put his hand to his coat pocket and I heard something drop almost close to my feet on the pavement—I said, "You have dropped something"—he said, "I have not"—he took this gimblet from his pocket and struck at me three or four times with it, but did not strike me—Legg came and assisted me, and the prisoner struck him with it—after going to the station I went back and found this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, bent as it is now, it answers the purpose both of a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> and a screw-driver—I have since been to Brankston's premises and seen an iron door about two feet square, in the wall, fastened on two binges; the top hinge had been wrenched off, and thrown up; you could lift it down and get into the premises—it could have been opened by this instrument; there was an exact impression of it on the brick-work—he refused his address.</p>

I was with Hann, and have heard his evidence; it is correct—the man who got away knocked me down, and the prisoner stabbed me in two places with the gimblet on my hand; he aimed at my eye—I took him to the station and found on him a clasp-knife, the handle of a keyhole saw, and some quiet matches—he was close against the iron-door, when I saw him; a man and a woman were with him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The young man who is not in custody asked me to have some drink. I do not know his name; we went into the public-house. He said that he was going to the Blue Last as his wife was to be there. I waited till 11 o'clock, but could not see him—I went down Water-lane and saw the man not in custody, and I believe these two policemen were talking to him at the corner of Shoemaker-row. He came to me and I asked him who they were; he said, "Two friends of mine." We went to the Blue Last and stopped till it closed, and then the two detectives turned and laid hold of me; the other man just gave the officer a slight push, and he went backwards against the wall, and never called "Stop thief!" or "Run after him." I never struck him at all; what they say is an untruth. In the morning this man said, "I know you have been transported; you may as well tell us; it will put 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi> or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my way, and we will have a pint of beer." I said, "If you think I have been transported you must find that out."</p>

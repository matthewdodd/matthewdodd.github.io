            . I am the parish-constable. On the 25th of February, in the morning, I saw Woodward coming past Shadwell Church with five cheeses and a ham - I asked him where he got them - he said he bought them at a shop, pointing towards Mr. Sayre's - I took him to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182604060067"></xptr>shop, where I found Reynolds; I asked him if he had sold them to Woodward - he said No, he had not; I then took them from him, and took him to the office - as we were going along he told me Reynolds had given him the cheeses and the ham; I said "For God's sake don't bring an innocent man into trouble, as it is my duty to tell our Magistrate what you say;" he said 'What I tell you is true," and he said the same in the lock-up house; I then went back and told Mr. Sayre what he had said - Reynolds then fell on his knees, and begged Mr. Sayre and God to forgive him - he did not say how he came to take them; I found this handkerchief in his box - he then put a handkerchief round his neck, tied it very tight, and extended his arms - I believe, had it not been for his fellow-servants, he would have destroyed himself.</p>
               <p>WOODWARD'S Defence. I had bought them of the prisoner - I went into the shop, and he said he had them to dispose of, and, situated as I was, I felt bound to do the best I could to get a shilling.</p>
               <p>Thirteen Witnesses gave Reynolds an excellent character.</p>

On Saturday night the 12th of October, about ten o'clock, I was going home to my father, three girls came up to me, one laid hold of my coat.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not done by any force I suppose. - A. No. I was going to push on when I saw a paper in Thetford's hand wrapped up with something in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of light had you. - A. It was not very light.</p>
               <p>Q. Any lamps near. - A. No. I do not think there were any, I put my hand to my waistcoat pocket, I missed my money.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not perceived any body take it had you. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss. - A. Two one pound notes and a halfpenny or a penny, I do not know which.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you put your hand to your waistcoat pocket did you see any thing done with that paper in Thetford's hands. - A. Yes, she passed it into one of the other women's hands. I had received them notes in the accompting-house in Giltspur Street, and put them in my waistcoat pocket. Upon my missing them two bank notes, I said you have robbed me, give me my money or I am ruined. I then laid hold of all three, hey all began beating me, and two of them broke from me, I kept Thetford, she tried to get away, an officer came up and she was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to speak to the person of the other. - A. No. I can only speak to Thetford. I know nothing of Thompson. I have never seen my notes since.</p>

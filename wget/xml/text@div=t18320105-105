            . I live at No. 5, Little Cheapside, Payne's-buildings, Whitecress-street; I am single. On Saturday night, the 3rd of December, about twenty minutes to ten o'clock, I went to the privy in <placeName id="t18320105-105-crimeloc605">Hartshorn-court</placeName>

            ; I gave him the candle - I did not follow him to the privy directly, but went there in, I suppose, two or three minutes after, and he was there with the light; I did not go into the privy - I looked in, and saw the child in the corner, laying on its back; Newton held the light, he was in the privy - one of the child's legs was stretched out a little; the knee was bent; its clothes were a little way up above the knees - it appeared to be dead; Newton had got into the privy when I got there, and had the same candle in as I had given him - I saw nobody come out, I went and gave information to my next door neighbour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You did not know this child before? A. No; Newton lives in the opposite house to me - the privy is common to the house I live in, but not to the one Newton lives in; he does not live the length of this court from the privy - I went into the privy, when I trod on the child's leg; I had no light then - I had one, but it blew out as I turned the corner, before I got to the privy; I went back to light it, and met the boy Newton as I returned with it - I gave it him, and stood there, being so frightened; I was a good deal alarmed - Newton was there three or four minutes before I followed him; there are seven or eight houses occupied by different lodgers - Broad Arrow-court is about a quarter of an hour's walk from where I live.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is there a passage to the privy? A. There is a passage to go into it, but not before you come to it - it belongs to more than four houses, and stands in a little corner; nobody who did not know it would take it to be a privy - it is kept shut, and nobody can open it unless they know how; you lift up the latch, shove a knee against the door, and it opens inwards - doors generally open so; it used to lock, but the lock is broken - I take the handle of the latch in my hand, and then give it a shove in; it is harder to open than most doors - I know the prisoner; she once lived next door to me, in one of the houses the privy belonged to, right facing the privy - when I gave Newton the light, I had turned the corner, and was in Little Cheapside; I saw nobody come out of the privy as I stood; while he was gone with the light nobody could come out to pass me without my seeing them; there is another way which they could go.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What sort of a night was this? A. It was not very dark; there are two gas-lights, one by the privy, just at the corner - a person could come from Golden-lane into Hartshorn-court, and into the privy that way.</p>

            . I am twelve years old next October - I go to the Red-coat charity school, Baldwin-court, Golden-lane, and live at No. 37, Payne's-buildings; I go from there to Little Cheapside, and then to Hartsborn-court. On the night of the 3rd of December Cane told me what she had seen in the privy, and gave me a candle - I was coming out of my mother's house to go on an errand; to the best of my recollection it was between eight and nine o'clock - it might be later; I had not heard a clock strike - it might be between nine and ten, for what I know; I went to the privy, pushed the door with my foot, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050055"></xptr>could not get it quite back - a man came out, and blew the candle out; he pushed me against another door facing, and then a woman came out - it was a lusty big man; he had a long black coat on, which came down to his knees.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you see the colour of his coat? A. There is a gas-light - he had a black hat on, and a bit of crape round it; the woman had a light shawl on, with a high cap on - it might be a bonnet; it was white - I think she had a dark gown on, with light flowers; she was a littleisk woman - I could not see her face; the man went out at the end of the court, towards Payne's-buildings, nearest Cane's lodging, through Little Cheapside, and the woman went the other way, through Hartshorn-court, towards Golden-lane - Sookers came up, and Mr. Nolan was there before him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Nolan bring a light? A. He might, but I do not know, I was in such a fright - the man and woman had got away then; I hallooed, and Nolan came up - when Sookers came, Nolan told him to go in and pick the child up, as it might he in a fit; I staid in the court, and did not go into the privy at all - Sookers took it up, and brought it out on his arm; I told a good many people at that time that I had seen a man and woman come out- I think Nolan had the light when Sookers took the child up.</p>

            . I am a calico-glazer, and live at No. 4, Little Cheapside, three doors from Hartshorn-court. On Saturday night, the 3rd of December, I heard Cane seream out; she ran to my door - the privy is three doors from ours, and about twenty yards - she said,"Mr. Nolan, there is either a child or a bundle in the privy;" I ran to the privy directly, and picked the child up - I did not take a candle with me; Newton had one in his hand when I went into the privy - it was lighted; several women were standing round the door when I came up, and Newton was just inside the step of the privy - I got there within a minute or a minute and a half after Cane screamed out; I went immediately to the privy - Newton had the candle inside the privy - it was never in my hand; I went directly, and took the child up in my arms - it laid on its back, towards the left hand side of the privy; Sookers took the child away - I had hold of her hands, and felt her feet, and said, "The child is dead;" the hands were quite cold - my mother also went out, but I reached the privy before her; I saw nobody but Newton inside the privy - three or four women were outside; they were fearful of going in - I suppose the child's clothes were turned up above its knees; I saw nobody running - nobody could have run past our door without my hearing them: I heard nobody - Newton said nothing to me about a man or woman that night, nor that any body had struck him; I did not wait to speak to any body, but went off to Mr. Smith's with the child - he mentioned it to me on the Tuesday morning, but I am certain he did not mention it in my presence that night; the privy is very long - the child lay on the left-hand side; the feet were about a foot from the door; there is a good deal of space between the door and the seat on the left hand - I suppose it is six or seven feet long; the door opens to the left - nobody can open the door unless they are used to it; you lift the latch up and shove it; it would open with a key, and without one by a person used to it - it is a latch lock; the handle is only to pull by - it does not communicate with the latch; I have known the prisoner three years - she lived right opposite the privy, on the first floor: she lodged with Mrs. Burn - that was within three months; the privy is used by the people of the house she lived in - I examined the privy door afterwards; is did not appear to have had any violence used to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You knew Sookers? A. Yes, he lives in Hartshorn-court, not so near the privy as me; when I got up there were several women about the door - I did not notice their faces; I ran into the privy directly - I was there before Sookers; I found the door quite wide open when I got there, and ran in directly -Mrs. Cane came after I was in; she came into the privy as I came out with the child in my arms - I gave it to Sookers in the privy, and we went off to Smith's with it; I took it up as Sookers told me - he said, "Are you frightened?" I said, "I am," and he took it out of my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was on the spot as soon as you were? A. I was in the privy before him; he was coming up Hartshorn-court as I came up Cheapside - I have known the prisoner three years; she was formerly of the Catholic faith, I believe, but I never spoke to her - I have heard her father has turned Protestant, but never heard that she had; I am a Catholic.</p>

On the 3rd of December, about twenty minutes to ten o'clock, I was going through Hartshorn-court, towards Whitecross-street, and heard Cane scream; I know the time, because I looked at the clock when I was up stairs - I shut the door, and came down directly; it wanted twenty minutes to ten by the clock in my house: heaving Cane scream I made towards her as quick as possible - I saw her, Nolan, and Newton, all in the privy with a candle; Newton held the candle, which was burning - I looked in and saw the child laying on its back; I took it up, and took it to one Daltons, and then to Dr. Smith's - it was dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Mrs. Cane did not come in after Nolan had taken the child up in her arms? A. No; she was there before - I took it from the ground, and kept it in my arms till I took it to the station - I had said to Nolan, "Take the child up," and he put his hand towards it, but he could not lift it, and then I took it up- he did not ask me; Newton was going towards the privy when I got up; when I heard the scream Cane was towards the privy door.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know it was a quarter to ten o'clock? A. I went into a public-house about twenty-five minutes to ten, and had not been there four minutes when my daughter came, and told me the child was dead at the station-house; I ran there directly - I saw the clock in the public-house, which is in Type-street, Chiswell-street, and it was twenty minutes to ten when I came out; it is about the same distance from Red Lion-court as Hartshorn-court - I ran as hard as I could; I had gone home that evening about seven minutes after five o'clock, and did not go out till after six.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you state it to the Coroner to be twenty minutes to ten o'clock - you are made to say in your deposition that it was about ten? A. Twenty minutes or a quarter - it must have been a quarter to ten, as near as I can say; I cannot read writing.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? Six or seven years, I believe; she lived next door to me about a fortnihg: I never heard the child complain of any injury - I never observed any bruise on her arm: she wore short sleeves - she had neither stockings nor shoes on when she went but with the prisoner; she had taken her little boots off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner was in the habit of nursing your child, and appeared very foad of her? A. Yes - she appeared very fond of children.</p>

             was there; I said Yes - she pointed her finger, and beckoned her out - she then took her down stairs, and kept her about three minutes in the passage; I never saw her after that: I afterwards saw the prisoner coming up Broad Arrow-court from towards Milton-street, without the child - I am not certain what time it was; I usually go to bed about eight o'clock, but went that night about half-past ten - it was about an hour and a half before that that I saw her; I saw Mrs. Duffey go and speak to her.</p>

            . I am married, and live in Prospect-place, Pump-alley, about five minutes' walk from Broad Arrow-court - it leads out of Whitecross-street. I never saw the prisoner before the night in question, that I know of - she is the person who passed me that night at half-past five or a quarter to six o'clock; she wore a light gown, a light shawl and dark bonnet - it looked to me to be black: it was dark.</p>
               <p>Q. How are you able to swear to her? A. I saw her go from Bunhill-row station-house in a coach, and said she was the woman, and swear to her features - the lamps were lighted, but they were some distance from me; I saw enough of the features to swear to her - I did not speak to her; she had a child in her hands, walking by her side - it had neither shoes, stockings, nor bonnet on, and seemed to me to be crying; she said, "Do not cry, we shall soon be at home;" she was going towards Coleman-street, towards Whitecross-street - she went up by Payne's-buildings, which would lead towards Hartshorn-court: the child had a dark frock on, and its hair seemed to me to be dark - she was going in a contrary way to Broad Arrow-court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You merely saw her passing? A. Yes, as I was at the gate; I saw her get into the coach on the Monday, and named this then, and again next day.</p>

            . I am a watch-finisher, and live at No. 5, Hartshorn-court. On the 3rd of December, at a quarter-past seven o'clock, I passed Payne's-buildings; I went to take some work home for my father, and it struck seven when I was at the warehouse in Bunhill-row - it might be a quarter-past, as near as possible; I saw the prisoner at the end of Payne's-buildings, in Whitecross-street, with a child in her arms - I knew her before; she stood with her face towards a public-house door, in Whitecross-street - I did not notice the child; it had on a kind of dark frock - one of its arms were round her shoulder, and the other in the attitude of eating something; it appeared about six years old - I have since seen a body, but it was in too decomposed a state to recognise.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is that public-house from Broad Arrow-court? A. I cannot say, it is the Black Boy, at the corner of Payne's-buildings; I did not speak to the woman.</p>

On the evening of the 3rd of December, about a quarter to seven o'clock, I saw her in Little Cheapside; I know the time, because I was not far from my own door, and went in directly - she had a female child with her, walking without shoes or stockings; I heard her say to the child, "What ails you?" I did not hear the child cry: they were going towards Cowheel-alley, they were not near Broad Arrow court, and going in a direction from the privy - I did not speak to the prisoner; she had on a light shawl, a light gown, and a bonnet, which I think was silk, but a lightish colour, not dark - the child had nothing on its head; I cannot describe its dress - when I first knew the prisoner she lived in Hartshorn-court, near the privy.</p>

            . I live in Turk's Head-court, Goldenlane, and am a skin-dresser. I was in Hartshorn-court on the 3rd of December; I was coming through the thoroughfare where the privy is - it was about eight o'clock, as near as I can say; I heard Cripplegate clock strike the three-quarters when in Golden-lane - I walked quick - it could not be eight o'clock; as I came up towards the privy, I saw the prisoner come away from the privy-door, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050057"></xptr>go at a quick walk towards Little Cheapside - I saw her come from the privy door: she was alone; I was not many yards from her - I cannot tell how many yards I was from the privy; I was coming by the lamp, and not quite so far from the privy door as I am from your Lordship - she had a bonnet on, but I cannot describe her dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come towards you? A. No, she went the other way, and walked quick towards Little Cheapside; there is a gas-light at the corner - I have known her some months; I have seen her a good many times, and know her well - the privy is about half a mile from Broad Arrow-court, I think, to go the regular way.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you first give this account? A. On Sunday evening, when I heard she was taken up. I have talked with

               <p>Q. Did you tell her you had seen nobody come from the privy? A. I was saying I heard a man and woman were taken up for it; I had heard nothing about it till then - I did not tell her I had seen anybody come out of the privy, nor that I knew nothing about it; I said I heard the child was found dead; I did not know what privy it had been found dead in; I worked for Mr. Reid, of Brick-lane for the last twelve months; I have not worked for him since last harvest, but have worked for other people; a man that I lodged with knew I could mend shoes, and had given me money to get nails and leather to mend them - I was idle for a week or a fortnight before that; I worked for a gentleman in Charingcross last November, and for others since; I was never charged with any theft, and was never sent to prison - I never was taken up as a thief.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the privy you speak of in the passage between Hartshorn-court and Little Cheapside? A. It is at the end of a few houses; I was coming in a direction from Golden-lane - the privy is on my left-hand side; I did not notice whether the door was shut - I saw her face; she turned away, and then I saw her back - I did not speak to her - I never spoke to her that I know of; when I knew her she lived opposite the privy.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the night of the 3rd of December Mrs. Duffey applied to me, and I took the prisoner into custody about ten minutes to nine o'clock that night; I had not then heard of the child being found - I took her in Broad Arrow-court, standing close by the door where she lodged; I asked where she had left the child - she said she had not seen the child since she had given it a penny at her (the child's) father's door; I took her to the station in Bunhill-row, and as I went along I asked where she had been from the time she gave the child a penny; she said she had been to a place where she had been used to wash and clean the house down; she mentioned no name nor place; I asked her the same question at the station, and she said she had been to Mrs. Lee's in Rotten-row - I took her to Rotten-row - she pointed out No. 13, and took me to the front room, second floor, where I saw a man in bed; she said to him, "What time was I here to day Mr. Lee?" he said "I have not seen you to-day:" a woman then came into the room, whom she called Mrs. Lee - she asked her the same question; Mrs. Lee said, "I have not seen you since last Tuesday;" I then took her to the station-house - she then said she had not been to see Mrs. Lee, but Mrs. Warren, in the same house in Rotten-row. I went back myself, saw Mrs. Warren, and detained the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she take you to this place without any inducement on your part? A. She did not volunteer to go - I did not ask her, but took her there; I did not tell her her answer would be given in evidence against her, nor did I say she must tell me where she had been.</p>

            . I am superintendent of the Police division G.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have on this memorandum,"The prisoner, Robert Tye, lives at Greenwich" - was he in custody? A. That relates to something else; a man she had cohabited with was apprehended - it was stated to me that a man had been seen to come out of the privy; I endeavoured to find who he was, and asked if she knew Tye - in consequence of her answer I went to Greenwich, and apprehended Tye; he accounted satisfactorily for his time, and was discharged; I recollect her saying she had been to see a friend in Rotten-row, though it is not in my memorandum; I put down what I thought necessary to refresh my memory - I put down O'Brien's name to go to the hospital, to see her, but the people from Rotten-row had been to the watch-house.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner on the evening of the 3rd of December; as near as I can recollect, it wanted ten minutes or a quarter to nine o'clock; I came in from work at half-past eight, and had not been in very long before she came home - I saw her standing on the step of her door; I was at our door - I did not see her come home: I asked her where she had left my sister - she said she took her into Hartshorn-court, in Whitecross-street; I asked why she did not bring her back - she said she wanted to go into Old-street, and took her into Old-street; I said if she took her there she must have made away with her - she made use of a very bad word, and called me a bl-y liar; I said when my mother came back she would give her in charge - (she had gone to look for my sister;) she said she did not care about going to the station-house, for she had got a sovereign in her pocket, to keep her till she came out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see your sister before she went out? A. Yes; she had a dark coloured stuff frock on - I think she had her shoes on; she wore no stockings nor bonnet; I saw her shoes on at five minutes to two o'clock, when I went to work.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you at home from two to five o'clock? A. No, I went to work; I usually return at half-past eight o'clock; the officer took the prisoner about a quarter of an hour after I had the conversation with her - I do not know how long it was: she remained at her door till then - there are a great many little turnings about Hartshorn-court.</p>

            . I live at No. 7, Broad Arrow-court. I remember the night the child was missing - I saw the prisoner that night about a quarter to nine o'clock- I came out of the court when I heard the child's mother crying; the prisoner was standing at her door - I heard Mary Duffey ask the prisoner where she had left the child- she said in Hartshorn-court; before that I told her it was a shame for her not to tell where the child was, that the parents might go and look for her; she then said she had not taken her out of the house; I heard her tell Mary Duffey she had left her in Hartshorn-court; ill words had passed between them before that - I did not hear her mention Old-street; I heard all that passed between them - I went with the mother and Mr. and Mrs. Jennings to the station-house, and returned; I afterwards saw the child dead at the station-house.</p>

            . I am an apothecary, and live in Banner-street, directly opposite Payne's-buildings. On Saturday, the 3rd of December, a dead child was brought to my shop by Sookers; as far as I can remember, it was between nine and ten o'clock - I should think between half-past nine and ten; I examined it in a very cursory way - the shop was surrounded by a mob; the man said he had found a dead child in a privy - I felt it, and said it must have been dead for some little time, and we could do nothing to recover it, he had better take it to the station, till the parents were found; I should think it had been dead an hour or an hour and a half, but that opinion can only be formed by circumstances - its legs and arms were uncovered, and, of course, cold; I form my opinion from the degree of coldness of the body - it was comparatively uncovered, except the frock; it was not quite cold - it struck me it had been dead about that time; it depends on the temperature of the air, as to the time it would take to cool- being in a cold exposed place would make a difference of perhaps an hour, and if she had been walking all the evening in the cold air, she would cool sooner,</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form any decided opinion that the child had been dead more than half an hour? A. I could not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If a person died a natural death in bed, would it not take longer to cool than if exposed? A. Certainly; I have stated the time I saw it, as far as I can judge, from circumstances, and cannot tell nearer than that.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was it half-past nine o'clock at least? A. To the best of my recollection, but I do not swear that.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, in Chiswell-street. I was called to the station-house, in Bunhill-row, and saw the body, about ten o'clock that night; the extremities<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050059"></xptr>were cold, and the body warm - I should suppose about eighty degrees there was a considerable degree of warmth; I formed a supposition that it had been dead about an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you be mistaken a full hour in your calculation? A. I might be very easily mistaken; I examined the back part of the neck; I found stains - discolorations as if some violence had been applied - marks of violence, and the jaws were very firmly clenched; I saw it again between twelve and one o'clock the same night, and made a further inspection, but found no alteration - I then examined the whole body; I did not strip it before - the parents objected to a post mortem examination at the time; I am not quite certain whether it had shoes or stockings on - I think it had shoes on without stockings; that is more conjecture - I should think the heat of the body was 70° at the second examination: I saw it again on the Tuesday morning, before the Coroner sat - it was then stripped: I and other surgeous examined it - it was opened; the vessels of the brain appeared exceedingley turgid, from excess of blood deposited there - on the spinal chord I observed nothing more than ordinary: the stomach appeared to have carried on its healthy action up to the time of death - there was a small quantity of vegetable food, which resembled potatoes, in the stomach, which had been received into it recently before death; the mouth opened easily then, the tongue pretruded, and was indented by the upper and lower teeth - I discovered a bruise on the inner side on the fore-arm, a discoloration, that must have occurred during life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the marks you had before noticed on the neck? A. I did; I could not distinguish how many there were - there appeared to be more on the left side of the neck than the right; there was a mark on the right and more on the left - these marks might be produced by the fingers and thumb strongly pressed on that part, and from the appearance of the neck, the teeth being clenched, and the mark on the side of the arm, the state of the stomach, and the blood on the brain, I conclude the child died by unnatural means, that is from suffocation.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time elapses between the death of a person and the coldness of the body? A. That depends on the circumstances; it would be a much longer time cooling than in a case of natural death - it might take four, five, or six hours; it depends on circumstances, and the situation where the person died - if exposed to cold when alive, and then remaining in the privy, it might be five or six hours becoming cold; it might take an hour or two longer if the person was under shelter - I guesed the degree of heat by applying my hand, and may be mistaken; blood heat is 98° - a body would be about two hours losing 18°; when I saw it at midnight it might have become stiffer, but I did not direct my attention to that - the marks were most apparent at the back and side of the neck; I suppose violence had been applied by pressure at the back of the neck, and not blows, by the hand grasping the back of the neck, not in front; one hand might be placed at the back of the neck, and the other on the mouth, without there being any marks on the throat or front of the neck; if there had been any blows we should have found traces underneath - I did not myself operate on the body; Mr. Rance and Mr. Brookes did.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You have spoken of pressure behind the neck, and a hand on the mouth, were the appearances consistent with that supposition? A. They were - if the hand had been applied to the threat there would have been marks in front.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What length of time would it take to destroy the life of such a child by pressing the back of the neck and holding its month? A. If the passage of air was intercepted death might occur in four or five minutes; the general appearances of the child were healthy - I noticed a patch on the stomach, but as the gastric juice acts on the stomach after death, I thought nothing of that, as there was time for it to have been caused.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FRANCIS RANCE. I am a surgeon, and live in the City-road. On the 6th of December I went with Mr. Brookes to examine the body - the weather at that time was extremely hot, and the air very humaid, so that decomposition was very rapidly taking place; these was discoloration over nearly the whole surface of the body; on examining it internally, there was a small mark, as if arising from pressure on the left fore-arm, but owing to the great discoloration, and the decomposition, I would not take on myself to say: there was no other violent appearance on the surface of the body - the tongue prosuded through the teeth, which were firmly closed upon it, and indented it, making marks on the tongue; the muscles of the body were rigid and firm, except those of the neck, which were in a very flaccid state; I assisted Mr. Brookes, who opened the body, and observed in the abdomen the viscera contents in a state of perfect health, commencing at the lower part of the abdomen: we found the bladder was empty; the intestines contained scarcely any solid matter, but gas - the stomach was in a healthy state, and it appeared digestion was going on at the time of death; the stomach contained a small portion of food, with two or three pieces of potatoes; the thorax or chest were examined - the lungs were collapsed, which proves the last act of respiration must have been an expiration; the heart appeared healthy, but nearly void of blood - on opening the right auricle a small quantity of blood was in it, and on dividing the pulmonary veins a small quantity of blood issued from them - we next examined the vessels of the neck; the cellular membrane contained a little serous fluid - on dividing the jugular veins a considerable quantity of fluid blood escaped; we then examined the head - we found no external marks of violence on the scalp, and no fracture, but on removing the bones the blood vessels of the brain were very much distended, and in a state of turgescence; there was no appearance of a rupture of any vessel, nor any deposition of fluid in the ventrical of the brain.</p>
               <p>Q. In dividing the vessels of the neck some fluid blood escaped, and the integuments were in a flaceid state? A. Yes - my opinion is, there must have been considerable pressure on the neck; I should state, that on removing the bandage tied round the head, a considerable quantity of serous fluid, slightly tinged with blood, escaped from the nostrils; the further examination of the neck was conducted by Mr. Whittell - there was no appearance of fracture; the impression on my mind is, that death was occasioned most probably by external pressure - the internal part of the windpipe was examined, and nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050060"></xptr>had been put in to choke; I found no foreign substance which could have caused death - I should think the pressure had been applied on the left side of the neck, from the quantity of serous fluid there; pressure on both sides would prevent the return of blood to the heart - there might have been pressure on both sides, but I am certain there had been on the left; I should think death was caused most probably by the stoppage of respiration.</p>
               <p>Q. Suffocation by pressure? A. Yes - I should think five minutes would be nearly the extent of time required to destroy the child's life by pressure, but it has been said it has been done in half a minute.</p>

            . I am surgeon of St. Luke's. I have heard the evidence of Mr. Rance, and was with him at the post-mortem examination; he has clearly stated the facts which occurred; I agree with him in the conclusion he has drawn; but I certainly think no reasonable man could entertain a doubt that the child came by its death by unnatural means; I have had very extensive opportunities of opening bodies, and never opened one more generally healthy in my life; the tongue was very deeply indented, as if considerable violence had been used; the marks on the back of the neck certainly indicated that some force had been applied; I should say death was caused by suffocation - by pressure on the vessels, which were not able to return the blood to the heart; four or five minutes would destroy a child's life in that way.</p>

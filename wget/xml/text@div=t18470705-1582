                  </hi> I am single, and live at 8, Devonshire-buildings, Shoreditch—on Monday, the 22nd of June, at a quarter-post two o'clock, I met the prisoner—he asked me where I was going—I said, "Home"—he said he would go with me—I said, "Very well"—we turned down Essex-street in Kingsland-road—he said he had no money—I said, "Then you can't go home with me"—he directly said he would, or he would have his will of me, and he knocked me down directly, took my shawl, and ran away with it—as soon as I could get up I saw the prisoner running and a policeman—the policeman had the shawl under his arm—this now produced is it—I am quite sure of it.</p>

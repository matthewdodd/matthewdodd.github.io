                  </hi>. I keep the "White Bear" public-house, in St. George's-in-the-East—on the night of 29th March, about 11.30, the prisoner came into my music room, which forms part of the public-house—he did not appear to be intoxicated—he stood a little while then—he then went over to some customers, spoke to one of them, and upset and broke a grog glass; that</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabman, of 38, Bedford Row, Stepney—on the night of the 29th, a little after 12 o'clock, I was in the bar, and all at once I saw the prisoner jump up on the side of the bar, and make a rush at Mr. Bunkin—he endeavoured to get through the hatchway, and in protecting himself he put his hand up—the prisoner got his thumb in his mouth, and eventually Mr. Bunkin held his hand up with a piece bitten entirely off, and bleeding—the prisoner had been drinking, but was certainly very far from being drunk—he was not sober, but he was perfectly able to understand what he was about.</p>

I was called, and took the prisoner in custody for biting the publican's thumb off—all he said was "You b—sucker, I will tear your b—guts out"—I got the assistance of another constable, and took him in Ship Alley—he threw himself down, and said "I won't go; I will have the b—guts out of the b—sucker about. twelve foreigners came up, and we had to take him through the alley into Wellclose Square, backwards, till we got safe—he is a foreigner—he has been stopping at a Sailor's Home—he had been drinking a little, but knew what he was about.</p>

Stop"—that was the signal which had been agreed upon, the signal to fire—they were to fire immediately at the word "Stop," and not before—they fired together, immediately on the signal—after they had fired, I observed the ball had passed through the crown of Mr. Mirfin's hat—I saw something fly up in the air—I saw a por<lb></lb>tion of the crown just raised at the moment-as soon as they had fired, the seconds interfered—I and the seconds were all standing together at the time—the seconds moved towards the principals—the principals remained in their places—I saw nothing of the prisoners, and cannot say whether they moved—the seconds moved a few paces towards the principals, and spoke to them—I do not know what they said to them—I did not go up—I stood still, about the same place-some conversation took Place between the seconds and principals, and between the seconds them<lb></lb>selves—it only lasted a few minutes—I did not hear what was said—after that had taken place, Mr. Mirfin insisted on a second shot—I heard him insist that there should be a second shot—he spoke loud enough for all parties to hear—I was within seven or eight paces of him—I could hear every word he said—I did not hear the other conversation, because I was intent, looking at Mr. Mirfin's hat—I saw the ball had passed through it—the conversation was with a view to reconcile the parties—I could hear that, but Mr. Mirfin would not hear of any reconciliation—I believe Mr. Eliot would have made a verbal apology—I believe he would—I heard</p>

               <p>sufficient for that—that was communicated to Mr. Mirfin, but he said he would receive nothing but a written apology, and insisted on another shot—this was after the first shot had been fired—there was nothing said before the first shot—after Mr. Mirfin made this statement, another pistol was de<lb></lb>livered to each—the had parties never left their ground—I had told Mr. Mirfin he was shot through the hat, and he took his hat off, and looked at it—I am not aware whether he was conscious of it—he said nothing, but took it off, looked at it, and placed it on his head again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that before or after the conversation between the seconds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not exactly recollect, whether it was before or after—it was all about the same time—it was after he said he would have another shot—I think it was when the seconds had gone to fetch the other pistols, which laid some distance off—I walked two or three paces towards him, and told him of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>the body after I got it home, and discovered a small wound not quite the size of an egg—I thought it was between the fourth and fifth rib, but it appeared, on examination, between the fifth and sixth—I have no doubt whatever his death was occasioned by the pistol ball.</p>

                  </hi>. I knew Mr. Eliot in August last. About the 22nd of August I acted as his groom—I am sixteen years old next October—Mr. Eliot was then staying at Fuliard's hotel, under the Opera Colonnade-about one o'clock that morning I saw Mr. Young there—I went out with my master and him in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—we called at Newman's in Regent-street—Mr. Eliot got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> there, and Mr. Young remained in it—I returned to Fuliard's hotel about four o'clock—there was a carriage there then—I saw my master there, and Mr. Webber, Mr. Young, and a stranger—they went with my master into his bed-room, and staid about a quarter of an hour—they then came down and got into the carriage, and a carpet-bag was put in by the ostler—I did not see who gave it to him—I do not know whose it was—I had only been in Mr. Eliot's service a fortnight—Mr. Eliot, Mr. Webber, and the strange gentleman got into the carriage, and I believe Mr. Young went to his <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—it was not standing there—I got into the dickey of the carriage, and we drove to Wimbledon-common—when we got there, I saw Mr. Young in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and a strange gentleman with him-not the same gentleman that was in the carriage, but another—the carriage was stopped on the common by two gentlemen in a gig—Mr. Webber got out of the carriage, and spoke to a gentleman in the gig—I did not notice a gentleman get out of the gig—the carriage and gig were then driven near a windmill—I saw Mr. Young when we got there—I think he was there before us—I saw my master, Mr. Webber, and the strange gen<lb></lb>tleman get out of the carriage and go down the hill—Mr. Young and the other gentleman got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and I got into it, and I believe they walked away from the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> towards the hill—there was a gig and street <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> there also—on e gentleman out of the gig went down the hill, and one</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Wimbledon. I was on the common the 22nd of August, about seven o'clock, and near the mill there I saw car<lb></lb>riage, a cabriolet, a gig, and a <hi rend="italic">hack-cab</hi>, that induced me to look into the hollow, and I saw five gentlemen standing below in conversation, and two younger gentlemen sitting on the brow of the hill, about half way down—I should say they were about one hundred yards from the place where the five were conversing—I was not near enough to see the features of the younger gentlemen, so as to know them again—I staid there a few minutes, and saw what took place—I did not see the ground stepped—I saw two of the gentlemen placed so as to be in a position to fire at each other—I can<lb></lb>not say that I heard any word of command given, not to understand it—they then fired at each other.</p>

               <p>some pistols taken out of a bag, and after that saw two gentlemen stepping side by side-two of the parties were placed opposite each other—they fired twice—after they fired the last time some of them came near me—I do not think either of these gentlemen were near me—I afterwards found some pistols, which I gave to the Inspector at the Coroner's Inquest—I had conversation with the gentleman who fired-just before that I saw one gentleman separate from him—the other gentlemen were engaged in loading the pistols at that time.</p>

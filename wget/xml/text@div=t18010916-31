               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the man who was then in custody upon a charge of robbing Mr. Baker? - A. Yes; I was not present at his trial.</p>

               <p>Q.Were you in Court when he received the order of transportation? - A. Yes, I was; he left Newgate on the 13th of June, 1792, but I did not go with him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him after May, 1792? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe the witnesses upon that occasion were ordered out of Court, and examined separately? - A. I believe they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, you were not in Court during the whole of the trial? - A. I believe there might have been one, two, or three called, before I came in.</p>

             CAPPER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am one of the clerks in the Secretary of State's office.</p>
               <p>Q. Has there been any further extension of his Majesty's mercy towards this man, beyond saving his life, on condition of transportation for life? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe you were not in the office at the time this man is said to have received his respite? - A. I was in the office, but not in that department.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe as to any thing that takes place with respect to prisoners after they are tried here and convicted, it is always entered in books kept for that purpose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore all the information you derive respecting this man, has been from those books? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I told Governor Hunter that I had received his Majesty's pardon on condition of being transported for life; but Mr. Bleckstock, of the House of Lords, sent me a letter, informing me, he had got me a mitigation; Governor Hunter looked into the books there, and saw I was entered for seven years only, and thinking my time was out, I asked Governor Hunter to permit me to come over with him, and he brought me over.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>- HUNTER, Esq. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Before you came into the office of Governor, I believe you know mistakes have often happened in the terms for which persons have been ordered to be transported, for seven or fourteen years, or for life? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. You were Governor of New South Wales?- A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have but just returned? - A. I returned in January.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner being sent over from this country as a transport? - A.Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect how long he had been there? - A. He lived a considerable time in the house with me as a servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, during that time, conduct himself to your satisfaction? - A. Perfectly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember an application from him to come home with you in your ship? - A. He applied to me some time before I quitted the country, in consequence of his time being expired, upon which I desired him to bring me a note from the Secretary of State's office.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your secretary's name, at Botany Bay, Foulkes? - A. He is one of the clerks in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as take that into your hand, and tell me if that is the hand-writing of Mr. Foulkes?- A. Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner, in consequence of your desire, bring that to you? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of his bringing that to you, what was your conduct? - A. I ordered the books to be brought to me, not chusing to give credit to any note, and when these books were produced to me, he appeared to stand on these books for seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. In that part in which he appeared to be sent to Botany Bay for seven years, did there appear to be any erasure, or attempt at erasure? - A. Not that I observed; it was the original list that was sent from England that I examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know from whence that list comes?- A.From the Secretary of State's office.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there other books in which this entry would find its way, besides the list you looked at?- A. The list that comes from England is what we always look at.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon the faith of what you saw in that list, what did you do? - A. I gave him permission to go where he pleased.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you were not content with that general permission, but being satisfied with his conduct as a servant, did you not permit him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160026"></xptr>come home with you in your ship? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you place him, in consequence of his conduct, in a situation of confidence in the course of his passage home? - A. He had the care of the live stock.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not the lists kept with you, as the records of Botany Bay? - A. Yes, they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find, upon examining this with the original list which is kept as as a matter of record, that this was a correct copy? - A. Yes.(It was read as follows) - "

               <p>Q. And in the original, I think you said you did not observe any erasure or interlineation, or any thing of the kind? - A. In most of the lists there are a great many erasures, there are very few but what come with some.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the same sort of list that would have application to all the persons sent on board that vessel? - A. The same list.</p>

               <p>Court. I will tell you fairly how I feel this case; it is certainly a very strong case for consideration elsewhere, but here I do not see how we can proceed as to the term for which he was ordered to be transported, but what appears upon the record: at the same time the account we have now heard is very fit for consideration heareafter.</p>

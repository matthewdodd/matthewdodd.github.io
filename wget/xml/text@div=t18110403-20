On the 5th of March, about half past eleven in the morning, I met the prisoner in Holborn with another young woman, whom she said was her sister. She informed me that she and her sister were natives of Ireland, that they had no friends, and were destitute, and in consequence of kindness that I had received in Ireland, when in the navy, I was induced to return my gratitude to the country that were deserving of it. I took them into a wine vaults and gave them something to drink, and took them into another public-house and got them something to eat, and remained in their company some time that afternoon. They behaved very discreet; they saw my change was right at the public-house; the prisoner was particular in observing that I was not 
overcharged.</p>


               <p>Q. Did you drink any considerable quantity together - A. We were not perfectly sober. They had so many places to call at; I found myself at Portman-square at eight o'clock at night; I was tired, I took a coach, we stopped at the <placeName id="t18110403-20-crimeloc112">Dolphin, Oxford-road</placeName>

I endeavoured to persuade her to return my pocket-book; she then said that I belonged to the Vere-street gang. The people in the tap-room said I ought to give charge of her; I did. I was astonished at her conduct; she behaved so different all the day.</p>
               <p>Q. You think she was drunk by your giving her liquor - A. Yes, and had not she been in liquor I am positive that she would not have done what she did.</p>

I and my sister met this gentleman between ten and eleven in the day, he walked alongside of us, he asked us if we were not Irish; we told him we were; he talked about different parts that we knew in Ireland; he said he was once there, and was used very well; he asked us to have something to drink; we took something. We had a few little commissions, we called at several places; he treated the people; he acted very civil and good-natured,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030011"></xptr>he behaved indeed foolish, he doubly paid them for every thing that we had to eat. We stopped in his company, I got a little intoxicated. I know nothing about his money.</p>

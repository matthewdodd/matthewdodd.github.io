               <p>Was you asleep when he came into the room? - No; he came and stooped down: I heard his feet: and took up my breeches, by the light of the fire, and took out the money, and chucked them down again; I heard the jingle of the money: I did not see him go; I wondered how he could do that: he went away out of the room: Mrs. Scott came up; I thought I would get some men up and take him: I had a great mind to let him stay till the morning; this took up some time; it might be after eleven; but the constable and I had something to drink; I took him into custody, and said to him, Fox, how much money have you got in your pocket? he told me, about five and twenty shillings; I asked him to let me search; he says, here is my coat, my waistcoat, and my breeches; and there was about four guineas; however, the constable made a memorandum.</p>

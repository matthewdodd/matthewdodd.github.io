                  </hi>. I am in the service of William Blakie and others, No. 201, Tottenham-court-road—they lend money on notes of the borrowers, having one or two sureties—we get the address of the sureties and make inquiries where the persons live—on the 14th April I received this proposal from a clerk—it is in the name of Vale, No. 11, South-street—the surety is George Waid, 14, Albert-street, opposite Albert-terrace, St. George's-road, Southwark—I went to No. 14, Albert-street; I saw the prisoner Vale standing at the door, I asked for the name of Ward—he said, "No, it is Waid"—I said, "Is Mr. Waid at home?"—he said, "No, here are his daughters"—and he went away—I made the necessary inquiries inside—I went to No. 11, South-street, and the house was shut up—on 18th April I received a letter signed William Vale; and in consequence of that I went to No. 11, South-street; I saw Vale there—I told him I had called respecting the application for a loan—I asked what he was; he said he was a tailor, and worked for Jones, in Regent-street, and he said he had lived there ten months—I asked for his receipts, and he produced three receipts for the three quarters rent of the house, No. 11, South-street, West-square, they were signed in the name of John Lee; I think the amount was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a quarter—I told him to come with his surety to the office, and bring his three receipts—both the prisoners came together—I asked them to sign their names, and they both, in my presence, wrote their names and addresses, and signed this promissory note—"Two months after date we jointly pro<lb></lb>mise to pay to William Blakie, or order, five pounds; for value received, William Vale, and Anthony Gatenby, 21st April, 1859."—Gatenby also gave this receipt—" Received of William Waid, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for one quarter's rent of house situated, No. 132, Princess-road, Kensington, Robert Cockford."—I told them they were attempting to defraud the company, for they well knew they had neither of them been in their houses more than a month—they said it was their first offence, they did not intend to defraud.</p>

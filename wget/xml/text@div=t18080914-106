            , about six o'clock in the evening; he was standing at the corner of St. Catherine's lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a person was he - A. He was a young lad about thirteen or fourteen years of age, I never saw him before. The prisoner passed me on the curb; the lad stood at the end of the lane close against the wall; she up with her hand and stabbed him in the cheek; she went away down the lane and went into No. 2. the lad's face bled like a pig; I am sure the prisoner is the woman, and there was plenty of room for her to pass; I was about two or three yards off them; he stood on the right hand side, she came on the left hand side; she crossed over the curb and passed him on the opposite wall; the lane is about four foot and a half wide; her face was towards me, and the lad's side was towards me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he might have touched the woman without your seeing of him, on her passing him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any language by any of them before the blow was given him - A. No, it was done in the instant of her passing him; as I passed by she lifted up her hand and stabbed him in the cheek with a knife; I pursued her to No. 2, and and never left her till the officer came; the knife was found by the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. What dispute this young man and the woman had you do know not - A. No.</p>

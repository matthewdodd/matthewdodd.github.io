               <p>Q. Did you lose your watch on the 15th of August last - A. I did, between two and three in the morning, I was coming home from Crown-court, Princess-street, Soho.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking - A. I was forward in liquor. I was under the piazza's when I lost my watch; I did not see it taken; it rained very fast, I stopped there for shelter; a girl came up to me, followed by the prisoner and another man, and accused me of striking the girl as I passed; I told the girl that I never saw her, and told her to go about her business; upon which, the prisoner and the other man came up to me, and made use of very abusive language; I was then surrounded by nine or ten. When I saw that I made off to the other end of the piazza's, just by the theatre door, I was not there many minutes, before I heard a great noise at the place which I came from, upon which I returned back; there was a gentleman there, accused the prisoner of attempting to pick his pocket. I told him, these are the fellows that insulted me. The prisoner came up and pushed me, asked me who I called fellows; he knocked me down; I got up again; he gave me two or three blows then ran away; I followed him into Wild-street; the watchman caught him. I lost my watch in the scuffle; I did not perceive it go. When I left the house I looked what time it was, I had not felt it since. The watch has never been found.</p>

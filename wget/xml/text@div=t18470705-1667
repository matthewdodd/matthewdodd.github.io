                  </hi> I live at 7, Little Turnstile, Holborn. The prisoner lodged at my house from the 18th of June until he was taken into custody—he occupied an attic—I had no other lodger—on Thursday afternoon, the 24th of June, I counted my money, there was nine sovereigns—I put it into a purse, placed it into a work-box, locked it, placed it in the back room on a chest of drawers, and placed the key in a separate chest of drawers in the same room—I went out in the morning, and left the bed-room door unlocked—the prisoner would have to pass my bed-room door to go to and from his own room—on Monday afternoon, the 28th of June, I went to my work-box and found it unlocked, the key was not in it, the purse and money were both gone—I found the key where I had left it on Thursday—it did not appear to have been moved—on Saturday the 26th of June, the prisoner had paid me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for his week's lodging—he then owed me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for board—3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he had to pay altogether—he said the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. must stand over a little longer—he was not at work at the time—I know that because he did not go out to work the work he did at home was very trifling—no one but the prisoner and I lived in the house, except a little girl and a baby eight months old—it is my husband, John Jenkinson's, dwelling-house—he occupies it and lives in it—it is in the parish of St. Giles'.</p>

                  </hi> I am servant to Mrs. Jenkinson, and have been with her twelve months—I recollect Monday afternoon, the 28th of June, when the money was missed—on that same morning, about seven o'clock, the prisoner asked me if my mistress was gone to the market—I said "Yes," and that she had been gone about half-an-hour—he went out, was out about half-an-hour, came back before my mistress, and went up to his bed-room—I staid below—nobody was in the house then but me and the baby.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman in the employ of the Sooth Eastern Railway, at the Bricklayers' Arms Station—on 15th September, about 7 in the evening, I was loading a van in Miles-lane with butter and bacon, and I saw one of the firkins of butter roll into the place of another which was being pulled off—it was just inside the van—I looked over the rail of the van, and saw the prisoner with a firkin on his head, holding it with both hands—I asked him what he wanted, and jumped out at the tail of the van, and caught hold of him, and then he put the firkin back again, and said, "All right, mate; I was only moving a guide-chain"—there was no guide-chain there—when he put the firkin back, the one I saw move went back into its place again—I told the prisoner I should lock him up, and he slipped his coat off, and got into Thames-street—I ran and got hold of him again, and whilst we were struggling, two men came up and struck me on the side of the head—I held the prisoner till a policeman came, and then gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How was the butter and bacon first put into the van? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Rolled up—the butter came from below, and the bacon from above, in slings—it is lowered down from the door—it was dark at this time—the butter was arranged along the rail in front of the van—I can't exactly say the weight of a firkin—I should think not far off half a hundred-weight—the men at the warehouse put them in the van, and I loaded them—I stood in the van, and they were handed to me—the inspector asked me at the station whether I could swear he had it clear off the van,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186510230076"></xptr>
               <p>and I said not, it was dark—I said the same when questioned before the Lord Mayor—the prisoner had got about twenty yards when I took hold of him the second time—a man from the warehouse came across the road to assist me when the other two men were on to me—Mr. Ruck's foreman came down—I did not hear him threaten the prisoner—no one struck him that I saw—I did not hear any one say, "Give him a good hiding" before he slipped his coat and ran away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> to-day you tell us that he had the firkin on his head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had it on his head alongside the van—I could not swear whether it was clear off the rails—his head was under it, and his arms up; whether it rested a little on the rail or not I cannot say—it was dark—there was no lamp alight that night—some of the firkins were on the floor of the van, and some on the rail.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">considered there was not sufficient evidence of stealing, but that the Jury could find the prisoner guilty of the attempt to steal.</hi>

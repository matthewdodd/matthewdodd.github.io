                  </hi>, M.D. I was formerly resident physician of Sussex House Lunatic Asylum—I live at 31, Harley Street, Cavendish Square—on 5th April I had an interview with the defendant of about three-quarters of an hour—I tested his memory, I thought it was defective; I examined him as to the number of children he had—it was upon that and other questions that I founded my opinion about his memory—I asked him as a sort of crucial test of his capacity for business, if he would sign a cheque for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Dr. Spurgin, and I sketched out a rough form, which he signed without looking at it, his wife was in the room—I unhesitatingly affirm that he is a man of decidedly weak intellect and defective memory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was informed that he had been committed to take his trial for perjury—I had not seen him before, that was my first and last interview.</p>

I am a plumber, and live at 14, James Street, Blackfriars—on the night of the 8th July I went to see my mother at 46, Queen Street, Blackfriars Road—she made a communication to me, and afterwards, in consequence of seeing the prisoner coming up the street with his wife I said to him "Why did you insult my mother?"—he said "Oh! there's a b——gang of them, is there; hold on Bill, I'll fetch some of our b——palls"—he pushed me; I struck him on the fore-head—he stooped down and said "Give me time"—I took off my coat in the meanwhile and as soon as he straightened himself again we closed together—while I was punching him he stabbed me nine times—I did not count the stabs at the time, but afterwards—I thought his blows were very sharp, but I did not know they were stabs at the time—I had never been stabbed before and I did not know the feeling of a stab—I did not fall, the prisoner fell—I said "Get up you coward, and fight me like a man!'—my cousin said "Bill you are bleeding"—I said "Am I?"—my cousin is not here—I then walked two or three steps towards the lamp and looked at my arm and found blood on it—on taking a long breath I felt a pain in my side—I went by help to the police-station—the prisoner was on the ground when I left him—I cannot say whether he was drunk—I do not believe he hit me with his fist—I was taken to the hospital next morning—I remained there for three weeks—I never had any previous quarrel with the prisoner; I do not believe I had half a dozen words with him before in my life.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital—about 8.30 on the 9th July the prosecutor was brought to the hospital—I found that he was suffering from several punctured wounds about the body—one wound on the face was more of a scratch, and one on the arm—the chief wound was one in the lower left part of the abdomen, just above the hip; that wound penetrated the cavity and from it was protruding a small portion of the contents of the abdomen about the size of the top of one's finger; it was an absolute proof that the cavity of the abdomen had been entered; it was a very dangerous wound—he had two wounds near the middle line of the back, in the muscular structure of the back, not very deep; one wound in the interspace between the tenth and eleventh rib, that I also judged not to be penetrating; another one higher up on the left side of the back, and a small cut in front of the abdomen; that hardly did more than draw blood, it was quite superficial, and one penetrating wound of the left fore-arm—the majority of the wounds were over the region of vital parts; they would be caused by a small sharp-pointed knife, such as the blade of a largish sized penknife—I was shown the prosecutor's trowsers at the police-court, and found a cut which would correspond to the wound on the abdomen—to produce the wounds through the trowsers it would take considerable force.</p>

I gave it him, and he then gave me a half-crown—I saw it was bad, and I said to him, "You are the man who gave me a bad crown on Tuesday"—the half-crown was taken up by a person who was there, and bit in two—I gave the prisoner in charge, and gave the crown and the half-crown to the officer.</p>

I was at the prosecutor's on the Friday, when the prisoner came and called for a pint of beer: he threw down a half-crown piece, and Mr. Goodwin asked me whether it was a good one—I said, "Give it to me and I will try it," and I bit a piece out of it—Mr. Goodwin said, "You are the man who came last Tuesday? I remember you;" and he called to Mrs. Goodwin and said, "What time was it when you went out?" she said "About four o'clock"—I believe she had taken the crown piece with her, not knowing it was bad.</p>

Mr. Woodward brought me the key of my husband's cash box—I opened it and took out a crown piece, wrapped in a piece of paper, and gave it to Woodward—I am sure I did not part it with any one else—on the Tuesday, the day this money was received, I went to Bland-street, in the Borough, to give an order for some goods—it was just twilight, and I rode over to Dover-street—I then wanted a little bit of print, and I went into a respectable house, and purchased a bit of the value of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on taking my money out I gave a five-shilling piece and a sixpence, and the man took it to the cashier—he came back and said he was very sorry to say it was a bad five-shilling piece—I ha taken that crown from a little back part of our till previous to my going out—I stood at the counter in the shop while the man took the crown piece to the cashier, who was in the centre of the shop—I was not observing him particularly.</p>

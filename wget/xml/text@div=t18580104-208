                  </hi>. I live in Regent Street, Deptford, and am a porter in the service of the South-Eastern Railway Company. On Sunday, 29th Nov., I was on duty at the Deptford station at the time of the arrival of the train which left London at 10.12—I had charge of the semaphore and the tele<lb></lb>graph—onthe arrival of that train I left my room for the purpose of altering the semaphore, and the regulator then, for the down line, was "Block"—whenwe mark ours to "Block," the one on the Eastern Junction would do the same; the same action would move them both—I might have been out of my room about a minute; when I returned, I found the prisoner just coming out of the room—my attention was first called to the instrument by a sound on the gong, which indicated that it was an answer from the man at the Junction, that I had telegraphed "All clear down"—I looked at my instrument, and found it had been changed from "Block" to "Clear"—in order to effect that, it would be necessary for a person to move the second of these pumps—those things we move are called "Pumps"—it would be necessary to push in this second pump—I found also that the needle which referred to the Greenwich up train had been altered; that had been altered from "Clear" to "Block"—in order to do that, a person would have to move the third of these pumps—when I found the prisoner coining out of the room, I asked him what he had been doing to my instrument; he said, "Nothing," and he passed round by the side of me, to go to the next door to give his ticket—I put my hand on his shoulder, and said to the ticket collector, "This man has been at my instrument"—the policeman was sent for, and the prisoner was detained in custody—this instrument was fixed in my room, exactly five feet from the ground—when I left my room, I had pulled the door close to—the door which persons go out at, is three or four yards further than my room—a great many persons that were in the train had gone out at that door—when the policeman was sent for, the ticket collector told the prisoner to come into the room; and he said to him, "See what you have done to this instrument"—the prisoner said, "I have done nothing"—he said to him, "What business had you in this room?"—the prisoner said he had not been in at first, and afterwards he said he thought it was the way out—the ticket collector asked him where he lived; he said, "At Greenwich"—he said, "It is very strange, if you live at Greenwich, that you should get out here;" the prisoner said, "That is my business"—hethen said he came to see a friend—the ticket collector said, "Where do you live at Greenwich?"—he said, "I live at Mr. Gordon's, the grocer; I am assistant to him"—the prisoner afterwards said he might have fallen against the instrument—he appeared sober; he might have had a little to drink, but he knew what he was doing—the change made there in the</p>

                  </hi>. I am the ticket collector, at the Deptford station. I was on duty on the night this occurred—I think between thirty and forty per<lb></lb>sons were the passengers who got out of that train—I took the tickets of them as they went out at the ordinary gate, which gate is between me and the train—I saw the prisoner that night, he was in the act of giving me his ticket; he was followed by the last witness—all the passengers were gone with the exception of two, a man and a woman—the prisoner was behind them, he was the last person going out—the porter put his hand on his shoulder and said, "This man has been at my instrument, he has altered the needles"—I said to the prisoner, "What have you been doing?"—he said, "Nothing"—Itook him back to the room where the instruments were, I said to him, "You have been in here;" he said, "I have not"—I said, "That is wrong, for the porter saw you coming out;" he said, "If I have been in, I came in thinking it was the way out"—I said, "That is impossible for you to think, for the passengers all went out at the other door, and you ought to have followed them;" and I said, "Even admitting that you came in thinking it was the way out, you had no business to touch that instrument; you have done that which will endanger the lives of the passengers, and rendered yourself liable to transportation"—he said, "If I have touched it, I must have fallen against it;" I said, "It is impossible for you to have done that, for there is nothing to fall against"—I asked him where he lived, he said at Greenwich; I think he said at Mr. Barber's—I said, "It is strange if you live at Greenwich that you should get out at Deptford, and alter that instrument"—he said he had got to see a friend; I said, "It is a strange time of night to go visiting friends;" he said, "That is my business"—I was not satisfied with the address he gave, and I sent for a policeman—the prisoner said, "Do you intend locking me up?" I said, "I do indeed"—he put up both his hands and gave me a violent shove, and said, "I am off home;" I caught him by the handkerchief and said, "Indeed you are not"—a violent struggle ensued, the policeman came and locked him up—after he was in custody he said, "You can do the best you can now, and I will serve you out for it afterwards"—thereis no question that he had been drinking, but he knew perfectly well what he was about—I should say the room was 20 feet by 14, it is a very large room—it used to be the second class waiting room—the door is in the centre of the room, and on the left hand side this instrument was placed—you must go into the room and turn yourself quite round to see the face of the instrument.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 279). At a little before 11 o'clock on that Sunday night, I was called to the station at Deptford—the prisoner was given into my custody, for altering the Telegraph signal—he said what he had done was by accident—I said I thought it was impossible for a man to alter it by accident—he said, before I took him out of the station, that he had fallen against some wires, or something—I went, and saw that there were no wires there—the next morning, when I was taking him into court, I said to him, "How long have you left the Great Western Railway?"—he said, "How do you know that I have been there?"—I said, "I know you have"—he said he had left it about four years back—I said, "You were on there some time, were you not?"—he said, "No, about six months"—I asked him if he had learned to work the telegraph there—he said no, he had not—he was not drunk—he had been drinking—he answered all my questions in the way that I have stated—he knew what he was about—he walked down to the Deptford station, which is nearly half a mile.</p>

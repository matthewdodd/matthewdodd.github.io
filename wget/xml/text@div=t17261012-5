             thus depos'd. About 10 at Night I and 2 or 3 more Butchers were going along Long-lane, and two Fellows came out of Charter-house-street and followed us. I presently felt my Apron-strings cut and mist my Steel; I turned about, and a Boy said to me, Yonder goes the Man that cut your Apron-string, he took your Steel, and gave it to another.</p>

             (a Boy) thus depos'd. I saw the Butchers going along, and the Prisoner come behind and cut the Prosecutor's Apron-string, take away his Steel, and give it to a Man in a great Coat. The Prosecutor turned about, and said he had lost his Steel. I shew'd 'em which was the Man that took it. The Prisoner ran into Barbican, and there was taken.

             thus depos'd. As I stood up to piss in Long-lane, I saw the Prisoner cut my Brother Butcher's Apron-string, but I thought he had been an Acquaintance of his, and was only playing the Rogue in Jest, I did not presently offer to stop him. The Prisoner was an old Offender, he had been an Evidence against Blewit and his Gang, and had not been a Week out of Goal when he was taken for this Fact.

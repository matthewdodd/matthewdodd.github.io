                  </hi>. I have been an inspector of police, and am now employed by the Mint under the sanction of Sir Richard Mayne—I went to 4, Gilbert's-buildings, Islington, with Inspector Fife and Sergeants Leather and Elliott—I placed myself at the front-parlour window, while Fife and Elliott forced open the parlour door—I looked in at the window and saw the male prisoner in his shirt sleeves stooping over a bright fire, and the female prisoner was stooping; I could not see what she was doing, but she seemed employed—they must have touched one another—Isaac had something white in his hand, wrapped up in this pad (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it is an article used by coiners as the mould becomes hot when the metal is poured in—he threw down something white on the floor which appeared like plaster of Paris; the mould separated, and I saw something white drop from it—he stamped on the plaster, and I then raised up the window—Sergeant Leather got in by the window, and Fife broke the parlour door in—I collected the dust from the floor; it was plaster of Paris—I saw the female take something off the fire, which I believe to be this iron spoon, bent in the form of a ladle; she ran from the fire and put her back against the door which Fife was forcing open with a sledge hammer, the force of which pushed her nearly to the middle of the floor—I saw Isaac take something bright from the corner of the table, and throw it on the fire—I took a bucket of water and threw it on the fire, which put it out—I then searched the cinders and found three sixpences, quite hot and unfinished; also this <hi rend="italic">get</hi>, which was so hot that I could not hold it—I also found some white metal such as is usually used in coining, and this piece of antimony, which is used to increase the weight and give it a clear ring—I found some wash, and all the necessary implements for coining—I found this sixpence on the mantel-shelf with plaster of Paris in it, and in the fragments of what he threw down I found some metal quite hot—we also found some plaster of Paris in powder and pieces of glass on which moulds are made—I found some white sand in</p>

This is a mould for sixpences, which has not been used—here are three unfinished sixpences of 1846, all from one mould—this good sixpence is the pattern which made the mould; it has been much in circulation—these three sixpences found on the floor are bad, and from the same mould—the three found in the jar are bad, but from a separate mould—these shillings are also bad—I have no doubt that these unfinished sixpences were made in the mould which was broken—the get is the aperture of the mould which holds the surplus metal—antimony is used in coining, and acid also—(<hi rend="italic">Eleanor Boniface produced her marriage certificate dated November</hi> 12<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1864, <hi rend="italic">to which the name of Robert Charlton appeared as a witness, and the case was postponed for an hour at prisoner's request, and Charlton sent for</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of John Brown, and another; they are leather-sellers, in Whitecross-street. The prisoner buys pieces of leather of my master—I had been directed to watch him—he came on the 1st of May, and went to the box of pieces—he picked out some pieces, and put them into his bag, he then took this other piece of leather from a locker, and put it into his bag—he filled his bag with the pieces, and took it as is usual, out of the shop to another place to weigh it—I followed—the bag weighed seventy-pounds—he then brought it into the shop, and gave my master some money, but I can not tell what—I saw this piece of leather found in the bag.</p>

                  </hi>. I have one partner. The pieces of leather are put in a particular part of the shop—people come and take them into a bag or something, and pay for the weight of them—I had reason to suspect the prisoner, and set Ames to watch him—the prisoner went and weighed the bag—he came and paid me for seventy pounds, allowing three pounds for the bag—he paid me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was at the low rate that we charge for pieces, a penny a pound—this is the piece which was found in his bag; it would not have been sold at that rate—I could not afford to sell this for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was at the station-house when it was taken out, he said he was not aware, or did not know that it was there.</p>

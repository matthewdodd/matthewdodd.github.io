I saw the prisoner at Bear-key with a frail of raisins on his back, between four and five o'clock in the morning. I stopped him, and asked him where he was going; he gave me no positive answer; with the assistance of the merchant's watch I secured him; then he said he took the raisins off the deck of a ship which he had in charge.</p>
               <p>Did he say what ship? - No; there was but one ship lying at the keys. I sent for Mr. Burr, the surveyor of the night, he ordered the prisoner to be sent to the Compter.</p>
               <p>From the prisoner. Whether you did not see two men whom I took the raisins from? - I did not see them, Charles Knox told me that he had seen them.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner then say he had the raisins from those two men? - No; he said he had it from the ship's deck.</p>

               <p>I am a wharfinger's watchman. While I was taking my walk round, I met Mr. Covell and Mr. Knox; Knox left us, and pursued two men he saw up Bear-key passage. I did not see the men, but I went after Knox. The two men got away. When I came back I saw Mr. Covell with the prisoner; the prisoner then said he had the raisins off the deck; afterwards he said he had them off the keys, and was going to carry them after the others.</p>

As I came back down Bear-key passage, I met Covell and Thomas, with the prisoner, who had a frail of raisins on his back. The prisoner said he came up on the deck to do his necessary occasions, and fell over the frail of fruit; that he saw two men go away with two other frails; that he went after them, and took this frail up, in order to deliver it to the first watchman he could meet with.</p>
               <p>Did he say he belonged to the ship? - Yes; he said he took it up to follow them to detect them with the others, and that he was in pursuit of them when he was stopped.</p>

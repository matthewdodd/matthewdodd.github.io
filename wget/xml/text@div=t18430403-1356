I am a widow, and live in Canonbury-terrace, Is<lb></lb>lington—the prisoner came into my service on Wednesday, the 29th of March,—on the Sunday afternoon she was to go to church—I sent my son to say it was too soon to go then, it was only half-past two o'clock—she then came in, and asked to speak to me—she said, "I have got a pain in my side; will you let me go to the chemist's?"—I said, "Martha, you are not ill; and if you quit my house now, you will not return again"—she went, and I did not see her again till Tuesday evening, about eight o'clock, when she came with a man—I let her in, but not the man—she said, "I have come for my box"—I said, "Your manner has been so strange, and your conduct to mys<lb></lb>terious, that I beg to open that box before you take it away "—she said, "O yes," and opened it with a key, which she took from her side—she com<lb></lb>menced taking the things out—my youngest son held the candle—both my sons were present—she appeared to wish to conceal a small parcel in a worsted handkerchief—she held it in her hand, and took a gown out and threw it over it—she was going to take something else out—I said, "What is that you have underneath the gown"—(I saw there was something shining out)—she said, "Oh, a pair of boots; a pair of shoes that Mrs. French gave me, (who was a mistress she had formerly lived with) and you may come with me to see"—she opened the handkerchief, and I saw these shoes—I knew them to be mine; but they have been defaced in the binding—I had never given them to her, or authorized her to take them—I said, "Oh, you wicked girl; you quite distress my feelings, as a mother, to see you do such a thing"—she threw the shoes on the floor—I took them up, and my son said they were mine—she said, "As a mother, you will forgive me"—I sent my son for a policeman, and while he was gone she said, "They are your's"—they are worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

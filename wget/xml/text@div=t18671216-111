                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Henry Side, a grocer of 1, Bedford Street, Walworth—I knew the prisoner, I was present at his marriage on the 1st April, 1844, to Emmeline Weavill, at St. Peter's Church, Walworth—I was bridesmaid—they lived together after the mar<lb></lb>riage one year, when the first child was born; I lived with them some weeks.</p>

Q.</hi> Were you intimate with Miss Weavill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I knew her from childhood; her father kept a tobacconist's shop, near the Elephant and Castle, at the time she was married; they formerly kept an hotel in the City—I knew the prisoner a few weeks before the marriage; I understood him to be twenty-two years of age, twelve months younger than his wife; he was a medical student; we called him "the Doctor"—shortly after his marriage, I understood he was assisting a surgeon, in the Broadway, Westminster—the child was born at her father's house, where she was married from—I have not been living in the same parish since 1844—I was travelling with my brother before I married—I have been married eighteen years, and for the last seventeen years have been living where I am now—I have seen very little of the prisoner's wife lately, up to two years since, when I was engaged to go to Scotland in a divorce case against the pri<lb></lb>soner.</p>

I have not seen the prisoner since I left him at Glasgow two years ago—his wife was then a witness in Court against him in a case of bigamy—he had a wife in Scotland, and had one year's imprisonment for it—he must have been aware at that time that she was alive; they were in the same Court together—it was at the Judges' Court at Glasgow—a much better Court than this, rather larger and better fitted up, more handsome in every respect—I was a witness—the prisoner's wife was in Court facing her husband—she was not called upon to speak, but merely to show herself—she was put into the witness-box to show herself, and I said she was the person to whom I was brides-maid—I knew the prisoner's name was George Pearce before his marriage—I know that the name of George Wortham Pearce was introduced into the register, and his wife knew it—I supposed that to be his name—I never heard him called anything but Mr. Pearce until his marriage—I did not know his Christian name till then—I did not know that Wortham was a fictitious name.</p>

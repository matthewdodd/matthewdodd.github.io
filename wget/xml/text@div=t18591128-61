                  </hi> I am a printer living at 12 New-street, City-road—on 6th November, when I left off my work, I went to a public-house as usual—I then came from there and went with two of my shopmates down towards Barbican, and we then went into another public-house; when I came out of that house I met two women; they came up to me and I told them to go—I then had my arms pinioned behind my back, and felt myself smothered—I had my senses, but could not help myself—I distinctly saw the prisoner's hand go over my pockets where my money was—I lost my hat—I had some half-crowns in my pocket—it was near a gas-lamp; I struggled and caught the prisoner in the face—I got his face against the wall, and I could not mistake him—I am quite sure that he is the man—I had had a little to drink, but knew what I was doing, I was not intoxicated—I had seen my money not half a minute before—the money was 2 half-crowns, and shillings—I then went to the station-house and gave information, and the policeman took me to a house in Brackley-street, up a court—I had a glass of drink there—I was taken to a room that was full of people; the police<lb></lb>man asked me to pick out my man, and as soon as I saw the prisoner I picked him out—he was then taken to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was this on Saturday night, 6th November? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was about 1 on Sunday morning—my wages are paid to me on Saturday evenings; they were paid to me on this Saturday evening between 6 and 7 o'clock—I received a sovereign and a half-sovereign in gold—I put them in my trousers pocket—I drank with my shopmates that even<lb></lb>ing</p>

               <p>—we stopped in the public-house from between 6 and 7 till 12 o'clock—I don't know exactly how much money I spent that night; I had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. before I was paid my wages; I owed 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. about me when I was robbed, and all the rest I spent—I had 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my trouser's pocket, and above 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my waistcoat pocket—I can't say how much I had to drink—I first had half-a-quartern of rum; then, perhaps, a pot of porter—I had been smoking that evening; I don't know how many pipes I smoked—I will swear I was not drunk; I knew what I was about—I know Brackley-street—my companions did not come out with me when I left the public-house; I was left behind; I came out of my own accord; that is about half-a-mile from Brackley-street, I should think—I went there after I left the public-house; I did not go by myself, two companions went with me; they were not females, I swear that; they were two workmen—In Brackley-street I had a glass of gin and a drink of porter; I was there about 10 minutes; I did not sit down at all, my companions went out of there before me—I don't know how many persons were in the public-house where we were at first from 6 till 12—I don't remember a female sitting by my side at the first house—I did not go with two females to Brackley-street after I left the first public-house—my hat was taken from me and 2 half-crowns, and 2 shillings in silver—the two females came up to me by themselves; I saw the prisoner afterwards—not more than 2 or 3 seconds elapsed between the time I saw the females come up and the prisoner coming up—I was walking when I told them to go—I was laid hold of by a person behind me, the females were at my side; it was on the pavement—the prisoner, twisted himself round when we were struggling, and I got his face towards the lamp—I saw the prisoner put his hands in my pocket—as near as I can tell you an hour and a-half had elapsed from the time I saw the prisoner in the street until the time I saw him in the house in Brackley-street—it is not a public-house—I had been drinking there when I left the house where I had been from 6 to 12; my two companions came out with me—I was in two public-houses altogether—I had never seen the prisoner before—I did not come out with my companions from the second public-house—the house in Brackley-street may be 10 or 15 yards from the place where I was robbed—I saw prisoner searched at the police-station; there was found on him 3 half-crowns, a two-shilling piece, a sixpence, and 3 farthings, I think.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you sober enough to know the exact amount of money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I went to the police-office, and went about to find the person—I had a very little beer at the second house—we receive our wages on Saturday night—it is a common thing for all printers to go into a public-house and settle all their accounts for the week on Saturday night—that takes some time—there were other persons in the public-house; no other printers—I shared my beer with other persons who were there—I did not run after the women.</p>

On 6th November, about 2 in the morning, the last witness came to me in Barbican—I went with him to a house in Brackley street and found the prisoner there and about twenty others—it is a gin shop; it is not a licensed house—the prosecutor pointed out the prisoner at once; and said, "That is the man that robbed me"—the prosecutor had been drinking, but he was perfectly conscious as to what he was doing, I am quite sure of that—I took the prisoner to the station and told him he was charged with stealing 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said, "Good God, I never saw the man"—I searched him and found two half-crowns, a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, and 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, E</hi> 94). On Saturday evening, 10th June, about half-past eight, I was on duty in High-street, St. Giles's—there was a disturbance among some women—I was endeavouring to take one of them to the station, and while doing do I received a tremendous blow on the right eye which lifted me off my feet—I immediately turned round and caught hold of the prisoner—I saw that he had this life-preserver in his hand; I caught hold of it, but could not get it away from him—I tried to get my staff out, but was prevented doing so—the prisoner kicked me and tried to throw me down—I succeeded in getting up—I drew my staff and struck the prisoner on the bead—the staff was taken from me and thrown over into the churchyard—Honora Collins pulled me by the back of my hair and I had to lift my foot to get her away—the prisoner then struck me on the head with this life-preserver, the scar remains now—I then became insensible, and do not know what occurred afterwards—I bled a great deal and am very weak now—I am still under the doctor's care—I had never spoken to the prisoner or given him any provocation.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 12, High-street—I remember this disturb<lb></lb>ance—on the night of 10th June I was standing outside my shop door, and saw the prisoner draw something out of his breast pocket similar to this, and give the constable a violent blow on the head; it pretty well stunned him the blow was so severe—they then scuffled and fell—I ran for assistance—two constables came up and he was apprehended—the prisoner is quite a stranger to me.</p>

I am surgeon of the E division of police—I saw the con<lb></lb>stable the following morning—his wounds had been previously dressed by my assistant—there was a contused wound on the crown of the head, another severe lacerated wound on the outer angle of the right eye—the face and eye were very much swollen—there had been a third blow on the right cheek, a scratch, and the muscles and skin were very much swollen—he complained of soreness and pain over his body as well—the wound on the top of the head was not severe, it was a starred wound, proceeding in three different directions from a centre—the wound on the eye was down to the bone and very severe—they were such wounds as might be caused by such an instru<lb></lb>ment as this—he is very weak and ill, and not fit for duty.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13, Great St. Helen's, and am an oil merchant—the prisoner is a war finger, carrying on business at Albany Wharf, as Finden &amp; Co., Limited, but I believe there is no limit—on 10th June I bought ten casks of paraffin oil of Messrs Mordaunt Brothers, which were lying at the defendant's wharf—I got the delivery order on the 24th, this is a copy of it—the prisoner has had notice to produce the original—I lodged it myself in the letter box at his wharf—about three days after, on 1st July, he called at my office—he said, "I am very sorry I was not at the wharf when you called to see the oil and receive your sample. I sent you a sample"—I produced it—he gave me this gauge note, two or three days afterwards—he said it was the gauge note of my oil—I afterwards sold that oil to Mr. Davis, about 12th September—on 6th October, I saw the prisoner again—I said "Mr. Finden, this is a very serious matter about my oil, the casks being emptied and taken away"—he said, "We have used part of the oil to fill up three other merchant's casks. I shall receive the money for it in a few days, and will pay you"—he said "The quantity used was about sixty gallons"—I said, "That is nonsense, when your foreman in<lb></lb>formed Mr. Davis that the casks were nearly emptied for that purpose"—he said, "The more money therefore I shall have to receive for it from Messrs. Mordaunt's, Browning's, and another firm—the last two firms I did not hear distinctly—I thought one was Browning's—I said "Well, as a</p>

               <p>wharfinger, you had no more right to use my oil than I have to pick a man's pocket, and I intend to apply to the Magistrate at 11 o'clock next morning for redress"—he said, "In that case you may do your best or your worst"—a week before I had written to him to explain what had become of the oil, and he had taken no notice—I went to the wharf three separate times, and was denied admittance by a man who opened the door with a chain up—on 29th September I obtained admittance by a back entrance—I found two men rolling out empty casks, and I noticed between forty and fifty casks there—I examined them all and could not find one cask of my mark amongst them; the premises were quite empty in other respects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From your experience as an oil merchant, will paraffin oil, or not, keep for several months at a wharf without injury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At all other wharfs I have never had a case of leakage—there is no difficulty in keeping it to order, we might lose about a gallon a cask, in hot weather, in two or three months—when the prisoner called upon me, on 2nd July, he told me that the casks were perfectly sound and in good order, and capable of standing the weather, and if I desired to leave them any time there, he would have the greatest care taken of them for me—the vendor is not here—the prisoner told me they were part of 200 casks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been in the oil business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About two years and a half; on my own account, not more than three months—I was with an oil broker—paraffin is more volatile than any other oil, it percolates through the wood to a slight extent; the longer time it remains in the cask, of course, the more it percolates through—it is generally put in casks that have been used before, not in new casks, they are not so good as the American petroleum casks—it is generally put in those casks—I know that there were about 25, 000 casks of oil at Plaistow Wharf last summer—I believe they are kept in sheds, or vaults, chiefly under ground, to preserve them from the sun—they never put them in the sun—it is not taken out of the casks and kept in tanks at the wharfs; that is done in retail shops, to avoid the loss in tapping—there was no one present when I had the conversation with the prisoner—I met him on the causeway—I had previously been to the wharf and seen between forty and fifty petroleum casks, apparently empty—I hare never seen the prisoner's foreman, Mr. Harris, in reference to this matter; I could never find him—the prisoner said that in hot weather the casks would leak a good deal, and I said, "It is your duty to keep your cooperage, you are paid for it"—I understood that the 200 casks had been there about three weeks before I bought mine—I have had oil at Mellish's wharf, but never knew a cask to leak out; I have known it to lose a gallon or two—I am not aware that they put it in tanks there.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEIGH</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Although paraffin is more volatile than some heavier oils, is there any difficulty in keeping it at a wharf? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None whatever; it is not nearly so volatile as spirits at high proof—it does not so much lose by evaporation, but it is so insidious, that it <hi rend="italic">goes</hi> through the pores of the wood, but it would take two or three years for a cask to empty itself from the pores, unless it had an accident.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, Wren Road, Camberwell Green, and am an oil merchant—in September last I received this delivery order (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced by the prisoner</hi>) for eleven casks of oil that I purchased of Mr. Begbie—I lodged it at Finden &amp; Co.'s office, in Crosby Hall Chambers, on 15th September, with the clerk, and they promised I should have it gauged</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186812140022"></xptr>
               <p>—I afterwards gave certain instructions to my carman, but I got no oil—I sent him three times—I have never received any part of it—I afterwards went to the wharf; the foreman let me in, I believe his name is Harris—I saw some empty barrels there; I am quite sure they were empty, because I turned them over—three of them were certainly marked "J M S," which was the mark on the barrels I bought—I paid Mr. Begbie 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—it is always customary in the oil trade to pay on account in the first transaction, when you receive the delivery order—there is no difficulty whatever in keeping paraffin oil at a wharf—I had some lying at Plaistow Wharf longer—heat will make it sweat, but not to the extent of bursting a cask—I have known it kept for two years at Plaistow Wharf, without injury—I speak from my experience as a merchant—I have been in business since 1864, and I think I understand the business thoroughly—no doubt exposure to the sun would increase the leakage, but it is the duty of the wharfinger to see that the barrels are in good condition, and that they are kept so—they are mostly put into sheds—I should say the barrels I saw were good barrels; there was nothing in their appearance to lead me to suppose they were leaky; they were as good as the ordinary run of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say it might be kept two years; I suppose that would depend upon the sort of barrels they are in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would in some measure—there are plenty at Plaistow Wharf, that have been there two years—I don't think that keeping them in vaults would make a great difference—I don't think there is any necessity for that; they put them in covered sheds—I don't think they have any vaults at Plaistow Wharf, and I have been there fifty times.</p>

                  </hi>. I was foreman at Albany Wharf—the defendant opened! that wharf in August, 1867—from that time up to September this year, I should think 5000 or 6000 barrels of paraffin oil have been delivered there—this is the first complaint that I have ever heard—I have been foreman there all the time—in May last 200 barrels were removed from the <hi rend="italic">Avon Carron</hi> steamer, marked "J. M. S."—they were originally consigned to Butterworth &amp; Son—they were removed from the steamer in a lighter, to the wharf—I was at the wharf when they were removed—the whole of them were in a very bad condition—I pumped out two barrels and a half of oil from the lighter, which had leaked out of the casks—they were old barrels, and had been used twenty or thirty times previously—they buy them for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, and send them over to Scotland—sometimes the oak heads of the casks are destroyed, and fir heads put in instead—the oil gets through the fir more easily than through the oak—some of those 200 barrels had fir heads and some had not—they were a mixture, I expect—they were consigned by Butterworth &amp; Son to different parties—they were all delivered but ten barrels, taken by different parties—I can't exactly tell when they were delivered—it was somewhere about the end of August, and early in Sep<lb></lb>tember the prisoner went to Margate, and was there three weeks, I think, on and off—I managed the business at the wharf in his absence, and Mr. Blenkinson at the office in Bishopsgate—the ten barrels were on the premises during that time—they were in a bad state—I had to pump out four of them into different barrels, to preserve the oil, or else we should not have had any of it—I put it into empty barrels—the other six are there—there are ten there, four that I pumped out, and the remaining six—they are all still on the wharf—I should think there is hardly 100 gallons in them now—it has been leaking out ever since, on and off—I did not tell Mr. Davis, or Mr. Begbie, that they were there still—I did not see Mr. Begbie—I saw Mr. Davis—I did not satisfy him that the casks were there still—he had not brought any order, and the brokers were in at the time—I did not write to satisfy him—I did not know him—he had no order, and I had no order concerning him—there was no delivery order lodged with me in his name—I had never seen it—that was my reason for my not telling him anything about it—Mr. Finden was away at Margate at this time, I think—I am not positive he told me he was going there—he came up sometimes—I can't say whether he was out of London or in it at the time—I can only tell you as he told me, that he was going to Margate—I did not see him at the wharf—the brokers were in at the time I removed the oil—I removed it to save it—paraffin oil generally leaks out very much—if a hoop falls off it will empty itself in four hours—there was a hoop off one of those ten—the brokers left the wharf on the Saturday morning—I had orders to clear everything out by 12 o'clock on Monday—Mr. Finden came up and told us to take the oil out anywhere until he could make arrangements—the ten barrels marked "J. M. S." are now on Kent's Tar Wharf, in Upper North Street, adjoining the Albany Wharf—we are frequently obliged to cooper casks anew, to prevent their leaking—these 200 barrels were always being coopered.</p>

M. S."—I asked him for his order, he had not got it—I told him there were some empty casks over the way, which had been made up, and those empties were Mr. Browning's, who had 100 of them—Mr. Browning's orders were that we were to make his up out of his own oil—the remainder that he had—I did not satisfy Mr. Davis whether those were his—I did not tell him his casks were empty—I told him there were some empties, and he went and up-headed them—I did not point them out—I should say there were 100 empties, fifty for Hawkins and nearly 100 for Browning—they had been delivered and the empties returned—I was with the prisoner when he opened the wharf, and have been with him ever since—I have not heard of any complaints—perhaps a merchant will come and ask how it is there has been some extra leakage—we have had some complaints, but not what you would term complaints—I have not heard of any—I know the firm of Billing &amp; Sons, they dealt with us—they were oil merchants—I know they made a complaint—they asked how it was there were so many ullages—they gave Mr. Finden in custody on the charge of stealing their oil—when I said there were no complaints, I thought you meant any com<lb></lb>plaints about those 200—I know Messrs. Billing gave him in charge, but they could not uphold it—I don't know of any complaint from Mordaunt Brothers—I never heard of any—I heard Butterworth's have made a com<lb></lb>plaint, all of them will halloa out about a gallon of oil—we have had the weather extremely hot, and of course that has acted upon the oil.</p>

I am a lighterman, in the employ of Mr. Bromley—on 19th May last I moved 200 barrels of paraffin oil from the Carron Steam Co.'s vessel <hi rend="italic">Avon</hi> to Albany Wharf—some of them were leaking at the time, and when I arrived at the wharf there was, I should say, from two to three barrels pumped out of the lighter; they took it ashore—I have had a good deal of experience in paraffin oil; it leaks very much in hot weather—these were not full when I received them—of course, it leaks more or less accord<lb></lb>ing to the quality of the cask—they are old casks re-coopered.</p>

                  </hi>. I was under foreman to the defendant—I remember these 200 barrels being delivered in May last—they were in a very bad state, indeed—I helped to pump out the oil from the bottom of the barge, which</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186812140025"></xptr>
               <p>had leaked from the barrels; there was about two and a-half barrels of it—I observed these 200 barrels afterwards; they were leaking—I helped to cooper them many times; we could not stop them, anyhow—I watered them twice a day to keep them cool—10 of those barrels remain; 190 were delivered to various parties—I don't know to how many, but, I dare say, to five or six different parties—the ten barrels remained there three or four months after the last were delivered; the ten barrels are there now—it is not customary to fill up barrels that are leaking from others—we don't do that unless a customer orders it; it is done sometimes to preserve the oil—complaints are always being made about short measure, the casks leak so much—I never knew barrels arrive full—I have used many a pound of soap to stop the leakage of these barrels; I used more to these 200 than we ever did to any others—it was green wood, not fit to hold water—I remember the brokers being there; the defendant was not at the wharf at that time; he went away somewhere—I can't give the exact date of the brokers coming in—it was on a Monday; I can't say the month—they were in eight days—Mr. Davis came there while they were in—we could not allow him to remove anything then; they told us we should not be allowed to deliver anything—I told that to Mr. Davis, at least, I believe the foreman did—he spoke to him; I did not—the ten barrels of oil are now on the wharf adjoining—they were never moved from Albany Wharf till they were removed to the next wharf; it was by direction of the landlord that the wharf was to be cleared—no oil was removed from four of the casks—I don't recollect any oil being pumped out of any of the casks—the ten casks are there now—I should think there is 100 gallons in them now; they are leaking still—we durst not go to cooper them now; of course, we have not since they have been removed—they don't require it, now the weather is different.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You don't mean that the ten casks you speak of as being now in existence are the identical ten casks that Mr. Begbie bought? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I do—when casks are landed, we usually drive them up to tighten them—all casks are liable to leak more or less after a voyage.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are any of those ten barrels empty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; not one of them—I am certain of that—I could not swear for the quantity they con<lb></lb>tain; they hold thirty-five or thirty-six gallons, when full—I should think they contain now 100 gallons or more—I do not say for certain they all run equal—I believe I helped to haul them over.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been engaged at the Colonial Wharf a great many years—I have had great experience in paraffin oil—it leaks, no matter what precaution you take—we do not treat it at all at our wharf unless we have orders to do so; we allow it to leak on unless we get orders to cooper, because the merchants will not pay unless they give us orders—we tell them on landing, and we generally get orders to cooper—it will leak out, whether we cooper or not—fir wood will not hold it at all; neither will anything else; nothing will hold it—the floors where we keep it are satu<lb></lb>rated with oil—we have stored it, but gave it up because we get other stuff to pay us better—the merchants always complain of the leakage, but we simply said we did not care much for it and they might send it somewhere else—we don't take it at all now—I have never been given into custody for taking the oil that leaked.</p>

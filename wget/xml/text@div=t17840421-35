             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a Pawnbroker in Berwick-street Soho, I have five table spoons; on the 8th of April the prisoner at the bar brought two silver spoons, he told me he wanted the same money on these as he had on three before, and on enquiring I found that there had been three table spoons taken of him, I asked him what he was, he said he was a gentleman's servant, he said he lived in Oxford-street at the Crown alehouse, I went there and asked the landlord if the prisoner did lodge there, and the prisoner said to the man you know I do lodge here, I said to the man tell me whether he does or not, the man said he comes here, but he does not lodge here; then not being satisfied with him I took him down to the Magistrates in order to find out the owner of the spoons, and he was remanded till the evening, he gave an account of several gentleman's families that he had lived in, and he was discharged on some persons undertaking to produce him when he should be called for.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Napier deposed to the spoons, and said he was perfectly satisfied as far as it was possible to identify any thing of that kind.</p>

            's I went up Holborn, and a man asked me to buy a bargain, I thought as I was a servant out of place if I could get a shilling or two it would be a very good thing, I went in with him he had some nice muslin.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was this? - It was at a publick house.</p>
               <p>Court. What publick house? - I should know the sign if I was to see it again, it went down two steps, he asked me five guineas for them, says I that is too much I will give you three pounds; the man said he would not take it, he stopped me as I was going out, and I told him I would give him three pounds and sixpence for them, and he said I should have them, I meant to make them a present to my brother who is in business at Bath; but money running short I was forced to pledge the spoons, and I told the pawnbroker I bought them.</p>
               <p>How came you to tell the pawnbroker you lived at that publick house? - That was where I lived when I was out of place, and there I could be met with at any time.</p>
               <p>Court. Now call your wit nesses? - My witnesses are not come, I have sent for them, they told me they would come as quick as possible.</p>
               <p>Court. You have amused us now for two days with that story.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, the difficulty with respect to the marks of the spoons might have been material in the prisoner's favour, if he had given any account of the manner how he came by them; as to the story of buying them of a Jew, you know the manner how he came by them; but, a Jew does not part with silver for less than the value; it will be a question whether the whole of the capital part of the indictment is proved, the value of all these five spoons taken together might possibly amount to more than 40 s. but there is reason to suppose that they were stolen at different times, indeed it appears with certainty from the pawnbroker's account that they were not all taken at one time, and it would not be a reasonable thing to add up these three felonies together, in order to increase the prisoner's charges.</p>

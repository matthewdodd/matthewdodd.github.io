                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Gordon an engineer, in Broomfield-street, Deptford. I was returning from Greenwich on the 27th of June, about ten minutes after twelve o'clock at night, and near the Broadway I met the prisoner—she followed me into High-street—I talked to her there, and missed my handkerchief about two minutes afterwards, and gave information to Marshall—I was not five minutes talking to her—I went with the policeman to a house in Mill-lane, and found her—as soon she saw the policeman she dropped the handkerchief, and the light was extinguished—I did not feel her hand in my pocket while she was talking to me—she was the only one I saw in the street.; <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He asked me to go with him, said he had no more; and gave me the handkerchief—he used me with so much brutality that I swung myself from his hands, and ran home. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not propose to go with her—she proposed and I refused—I did not say I had no money, nor give her the handkerchief—I took no liberties with her—I had money about me—if she had asked me for money I might have said I had none—this is my handkerchief—I know it by the pattern and size—there I Do mark on it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 187.) I met the prosecutor in High-street, Deptford, on the 27th of June, and in consequence of what he said, I went after the prisoner—I found her at the door of her lodging—I searched her—the landlady requested me to bring her to the light, and while searching her I saw the handkerchief drop from her, person, and the light was knocked out instantly—the landlady, at the same, time, tried to get the handkerchief from me—the prisoner said she knew no<lb></lb>thing about the handkerchief, and that the prosecutor gave her into cus<lb></lb>tody through malice, because she would not go with him—she said before the Magistrate that he had given it to her, but not to me at the house.</p>

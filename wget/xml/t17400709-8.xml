               <p>John Dukes. My Sister having lost a Watch out of her House, and suspecting the Prisoner, she came to me, and asked me if I knew her? I told her yes, and she desired me to go with her to get a Warrant for her. This was on the 23d of May; and on the 24th I took her at Bow, and brought her before Justice Fowkes, where she owned she took the Watch off the Nail by the Side of the Chimney, and had intended to take it, a good while before she actually did it, if she could have known how to have disposed of it. But one Mrs Jons telling her she could vend such a thing for her, she then took it. The Watch was produced before the Justice; and he asked her, if that was the same Watch she took from my Brother's House? She said it was the same, and owned she took it away.</p>

            . John Dukes came to me about this Affair, and we got a Warrant to apprehend the Prisoner, and carried her before a Justice: she owned to me before we carried herthither, that she had taken the Watch, and had pawned it, but would not tell us where it was pawned; because the Woman to whom she had given it to pawn for her, had lent her Money upon it herself.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174007090014"></xptr> This is the Watch, and she owned she took it.</p>

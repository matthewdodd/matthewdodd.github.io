                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 7, Willow-cottages, Canon<lb></lb>bury—it is my dwelling-house and is in the parish of St. Mary; Islington—I heard a noise in the house on the morning of 26th October, about a quarter or twenty minutes to 6; before I was up—as the sweeps were expected that morning I did not take much notice, but presently I heard a noise outside my bedroom door, at the wardrobe—I then got out of bed and sprang the rattle from the balcony—I remained there, and presently I saw the prisoner come up the area steps—he went across the garden and got over the iron railings—he had neither shoes, coat, nor hat on—he ran away and was pursued by a policeman—he was brought back to me—the prisoner is the person—I went to bed between 11 and 12 o'clock the night before—the places were all fastened up properly—I was the last up—after I saw the prisoner go away I went down stairs and looked about the house—I entered the parlour, and there I found that he had effected an entrance by cutting or breaking a pane of glass; the fastening was forced back, and the window opened—the shutters to those windows were not shut—when the window was open, anybody could easily get in through it—I proceeded to the kitchen, and found that he had been in the larder and regaled himself—I missed stout and provisions—after that he must have proceeded to the top room—the door of one room was open and unbolted—a black silk dress and a cloth cloak had been brought down from there to the parlour.</p>

               <p>of 26th October; off duty—I heard a rattle near Willow-cottages—I went there, and saw the prisoner coming over the area railings into the front garden—he got from the front garden over the railings into the road and ran away—I pursued him and never lost sight of him till I took him in custody—he had his trousers, shirt, and waistcoat on—he had no shoes, ooat, or cap—when I charged him, upon taking him into custody, he said, "You have made a mistake, I am not the person"—I afterwards took him back to No. 7—Mr. Greenly saw him—I searched him at the station—I found I nothing on him but a comb and a <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> of paper.</p>

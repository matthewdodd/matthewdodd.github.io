On Friday night, the 12th of Dec, I was on duty at Stratford, and saw the two prisoners—I had seen Fairchild before—I am sure Powell was one—they went to a marine store dealer's shop at Stratford—Fairchild took in some iron in his apron—Powell took two bars of iron off a truck, which was in the road, drawn by three horses, and gave them to Fairchild inside the shop—they had drove the truck up to Mrs. Raynor's shop-door, and there Powell took the bars from the truck and handed them to Fairchild—he then came away from the shop door—he noticed me, and drove his horses on as quickly as possible—I stopped Fairchild coming out of the shop with the two bars—I heard Mrs. Raynor say she would not buy them—I took Powell half an hour after<lb></lb>wards in the Bow-road—I told him I wanted him on suspicion of stealing some railway iron—he said he did not know anything about it—I said he was the man who went to Mrs. Raynor's with some iron—he then said, "I am sorry for what I have done."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Pleasant-row, Camden-town, and am a labouring man; I am not acquainted with the prisoner. On Monday, the 10th July, I was in High-street, Camden-town, about a quarter to one o'clock in the morning, with M'Grail and Hayes—we were coming from Marylebone—we went to the Black-cap to have half-a-pint of beer to take home—we directly went away with it up to our own place, and the prisoner and M'Grail were standing at the bottom of the court—I asked M'Grail if he was coming to have some of the beer—he said, "Yes, presently"—the prisoner says, "Are you not coming along with me?"—"Well, I don't mind," says he—"But, "says the prisoner," suppose I give you what I promised you"—I took no further notice, but walked on, and just as I turned round, to see if he was coming, M'Grail and the prisoner were fighting—I turned back, laid hold of M'Grail by the collar, and said, "Come on home"—the prisoner ran off, and M'Grail rushed out of my hands, because I <hi rend="italic">made rather stiffer</hi> on him, that he should come along—he got a stumble on the kerb-stone of the road—he got up, and gave the prisoner in charge—he was below where M'Grail fell—I picked up the prisoner's hat where M'Grail fell, and brought it over to the bottom of the court, and stood there—I thought the prisoner was gone away—in about two minutes he returned to where I was—I said he had better go, for M'Grail was gone to give him in charge—he then made towards me in a frightful manner—I thought he was going to hit me with his fist, so I got up and put my hand to guard my face, and he struck me with a knife—he then drew back from me, and the blood spouted out through my shirt and jacket on my sleeve—I said, "Oh, I am cut!"—the knife was in his hand pointed at me again—I then gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at Camden-town. I recollect seeing the prosecutor at our house, talking to the prisoner's brother—the prisoner lived at our house—the prosecutor said he felt for his knife, and afterwards said, "By Jesus, if I had got it"—he said that Finney and several more men were fighting—he went up to them, and when he saw who it was, he felt for his knife—he said, "I did not know who had done it till some time after"—he said it twice.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engine-driver on the North-Western-Railway, and have been so upwards of eleven years. The prisoner has been there ten years, and has been fireman under me upwards of three years—he was with me the day before he was taken, from five in the morning till after seven in the evening—we went to Birmingham by the quarter-past six train, and returned with a third-class train at half-past seven—that is reckoned such a heavy day's work, that we are allowed the next day as a rest—he had on a blue jacket with brass buttons, with an anchor on them; a blue waistcoat, rather greasy, with pearl buttons, and corduroy trowsers—he is a very sober steady man, and always to be depended on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engine-driver in the employ of the North-Western Railway Company. On the night on which the prisoner was taken into custody, I was in his company from nine o'clock until twenty minutes past twelve, at the Engineers' tavern, Gloucester-road, Camden-town—there were eight or nine more of our men there—we had a tidy sup of porter amongst us—twenty-two pots altogether, amongst ten of us—when he left he was pretty <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi>—he had on a blue waistcoat, with pearl buttons—he has always been a good steady man, and highly thought of.</p>

Q.</hi> Where did you last see him that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I left him about two hundred yards from the public-house, going towards Camden-town—one of our firemen was going to Australia, and we had a meeting that night to make a subscription for him.</p>

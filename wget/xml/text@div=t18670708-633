                  </hi> I am the wife of Thomas Hollings-worth, who keeps the Cock at Edmonton—on 11th June, about eleven o'clock at night, I served the prisoner with a pot of half-and-half—he laid down a half-crown—I <hi rend="italic">jinked</hi> it on the counter, thought it was good, and put it in my pocket; there was no other money there—I gave him change, two shillings and two pence—I gave the half-crown to my husband ten minutes afterwards, who gave it back to me, and I gave it to the policeman, as it was bad—the prisoner came in by himself, but two men came in after him and drank with him—he paid for their beer.</p>

                  </hi> I am the husband of the last witness—I saw him in the bar on 11th June, drinking a pot of half-and-half, and eating bread and cheese—he had a friend with him—my wife was in the bar parlour, and I took her place in the bar—the prisoner called for another pot, which came to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I served him—he gave me a half-crown—I bent it between my teeth, <hi rend="italic">chinked</hi> it on the counter, and said, "This is a <hi rend="italic">duffer</hi>"—he took it up, put it in his pocket, and gave me a good shilling—he took the beer outside and left it there—I fetched it in—he had drank very little of it—my mistress gave me a bad half-crown.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Fagg, at Bedfont. I missed a pair of boots from a small room, on the morning of the 29th of April—the prisoner had been in the service for a week as helper—he came that day for some things which he had left—I followed him towards Staines, and overtook him—he was sitting on the road-side with a bundle—I asked him if he had got a pair of my boots—he said, "No"—the policeman was coming up, and I gave him in charge—my boots were found in the bundle—these now produced are them.</p>

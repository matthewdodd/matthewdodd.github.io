                  </hi>. I am gate-keeper at the London Docks. I saw the prisoner coming out at half-past five o'clock in the evening, on the 11th of May—he appeared very bulky—I put my hand to his breast, and asked him what he had there—he made no reply—I found this piece of diaper between his shirt and his skin, and this other piece in his coat—he worked as stevadore—he said he had worked on board the <hi rend="italic">Turvill.</hi>

I was sent for, and went on board the <hi rend="italic">Turvill</hi>, of America, outward-bound; she is lying in the London Docks—I found a case marked "B," in a diamond, which had been broken open—I found two pieces of linen and diaper, which were just out, but there was still a deficiency just of a size which this pro<lb></lb>perty would have filled up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman to Cowley and Hewetson, of Blackwell-hall-court. The <hi rend="italic">Turvill</hi> is an American vessel—this property was on boad there, and belonged to Mr. Samuel Norman Cowley and his partner; they were consigned to New York for sale—the case marked "B," in a diamond, had gone from their house—I was sent for on Tuesday, and found the whole package, except those two pieces of diaper—it is my firm belief, that they came from there—the lid and the iron hoops which clasped it were broken.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went to sleep on board, and when I awoke, about five o'clock, a man was buttoning up my clothes—I felt these things inside—he said "It is all right, go and get some beer"—I was going, and the gate-keeper stopped me.</p>

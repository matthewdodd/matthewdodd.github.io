            . I live in Cottage-lane. On the 12th of November, about two o'clock in the day, the prisoners called on me, and asked if I was in the habit of buying potatoes; I said Yes, but it did not suit me then, as I only had sixpence; they said they had almost done, but they had a few left, and as I was a poor woman they would sell them worth my money; I said I thanked them, but I had none. One of them went to the waggon, and brought three or four in his hand, and said,</p>
               <p>"See, they are good ones;" I said they might be, but they did not suit me; they said they dare say I could raise money to buy what few they had left, they brought in about 1 1/2 cwt. in a bag. I said, what do you want for them; they said they wanted to empty the waggon, to take home some dung, and would I give 4 s. 6 d. I offered them 3 s. 6 d.; there were three men; one said</p>
               <p>"She is a poor woman, let her have them." I borrowed the money, and paid them. I believe the prisoners are two of the men. I saw them at the police-office three days after, and had no doubt of them. I really believe them to be the men.</p>

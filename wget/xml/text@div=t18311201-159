On the 1st of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoners came into my shop, and asked to see some black silk handkerchiefs for a gentleman: I showed them part of several pieces - they were about ten minutes in the shop, and left suddenly, without buying any thing, or saying a word; I immediately looked over my goods, and missed a piece, containing three handkerchiefs - I went out, and met them in Barbican; they had got thirty or forty yards, and were coming back - I desired them to come into my shop; they wanted to know what they had done - I took them into the shop and sent for an officer; before he came in, Collins took the handkerchiefs from his person, and threw them on the counter - they were some I had shown to them.</p>

My daughter, but nobody was there on this occasion; I am positive these very handkerchiefs were in my hand not four minutes before - I had no others of that description; it was Davis asked to see them - they were close together, and left together; I never left the counter - they both left together; Davis might have said they were too dear.</p>

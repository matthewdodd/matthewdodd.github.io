I am a chemist, of Wood Green—on 5th April, about 4 o'clock, I served Groves with a pennyworth of zinc ointment, and as I handed it to her she put a shilling into my hand—I put it in the till, and gave her change—there was no other shilling there—I found it was bad five minutes afterwards—I went out and saw her sixty or 100 yards off—M'Pherson joined her, and they walked together about a quarter of a mile, to Wood Green Station, and went towards Maize Road—M'Pherson ran away—I gave them in custody, with the shilling, which I marked.</p>

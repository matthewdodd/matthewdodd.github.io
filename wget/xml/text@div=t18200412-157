            . I am a chimney-sweeper; Richards was my apprentice, and Chandler worked for me - they all three lived in Mullen's-rents, Shoe-lane. I missed the veal, went there about a quarter-past seven o'clock, and found the three prisoners there - Richards was not with them. I asked them if they had seen Richards? they said they had not, and I returned home; Chambers then told me the meat had been stolen. I returned between ten and eleven o'clock with the officer to Mullen's-rents, and found part of the veal boiling in the pot. Richards told me that night that the remainder was baked, and sent to Giltspur-street Compter. We took Duke and Chandler at the house, and they denied having seen the meat, but said nothing when it was found - I also found the cloth in the room. Dart was taken next morning. I took a post chaise, and apprehended Richards that evening at Brentford.</p>

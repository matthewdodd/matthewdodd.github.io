               <p>night before the election; I cannot tell—I have understood that there was a ward meeting at the "Sun" tavern, but I do not actually remember the name of the house—there were several of these meetings at which I addressed the electors, but where they were on each night I cannot tell—the "Sun" tavern is in High Street—we had no committee rooms but one—I addressed meetings at different parts of the town at public-houses—they were ward meetings, not committee meetings—there were certainly not twelve committee rooms to my knowledge, I do not think there were six, nor four—I will not swear anything about it—I told you I believed we had but one—we have paid for the use of some rooms used for the ward meetings, and they are called in the bills committee rooms, but they were not committee rooms—I have since ascertained that Pudding Lane is the lane that Chambers's forge is in—the "Sun" is pretty nearly opposite the end of Pudding Lane, in High Street—Chambers's forge is at that end of Pudding Lane—I never canvassed alone in the town—I drove in my carriage before a meeting to the house of another Chambers, but he was not at home—that was the only occasion on which I went alone—I am quite sure I never canvassed any elector alone in the town—I do not recollect the name of John Richards, an elector, in the employ of the South-Eastern Railway (<hi rend="italic">George Richards was here brought into court</hi>)—I do not recollect him, or canvassing him—I will not say that I did not—I can positively say that the week before the election, and about the middle of the week, at two or three o'clock in the afternoon, I did not call at his place alone and canvas for his vote—I think I was asked to go to one of these people in Prospect Place, if that is in the West Borough, and I remember riding on horseback to a house there—I do not consider that to be in the town, but there was somebody with me, whether it was a servant or who I do not remember—it is <hi rend="italic">very</hi> possible that I asked one of the family who came to the door if Mr. Richards was at home, and that the man who has just been in court came out to speak to me, but I do not remember it, and it is extremely improbable that it occurred—I do not remember saying to that man, "You have already been canvassed, but I have not heard that you have promised anybody yet; you will vote for me"—I will not under-take to swear that I did not, or that he did not say, "Sir, I have made up my mind, and I cannot vote for you," but if anybody said that to me I always said, "Then keep your promise"—the ward meetings terminated about ten o'clock or soon after—I do not recollect where I was between ten and twelve o'clock on the Thursday night previous to the election—I was not examined before the Election Committee as to these particular days you are speaking of—I do not know Richard Coker, a voter, who is employed at the South-Eastern Railway station<lb></lb>master's room (<hi rend="italic">Coker was here brought in</hi>)—I know that person, but should not know him by name—I do not recognise him as a person who does duty on the South-Eastern Railway—it is very possible that in the week before the election, at the Maidstone Station, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I asked him if he would vote for me, but not when I was alone; we went there to several of the railway men—I said before the Election Committee that I never was alone, and that there was never so few as one person with me, and that I did not. recollect any occasion when only one person was present—it is very possible that I was walking into the station with Mr. Charles Arkoll, and that I addressed Coker and asked him for his vote—I recollect walking into the station with Mr. Arkoll when there was nobody with me—I had totally forgotten the circumstance at the examination—I do not recollect</p>

               <p>opposed to the petition from the first; I thought it ought not to be presented, but it was a matter of perfect indifference to me—I received a guinea for my services as inspector, the usual fee—the others were paid the same for the King Street ward—the ward is divided into four compartments, and each inspector has a book containing the names of the registered freemen and electors, and they have to see that no one comes up who is not registered—for that I received a guinea—I have no occupation—I was articled to the law fifteen years ago—I have no occupation at present—I live on my property—to the best of my belief, it was between eight and nine o'clock in the evening when I saw Mr. Lee and Mr. Whatman—I cannot be positive that it was as late as eight—I will swear it was as late as seven, because I did not go into the house till nearly eight—I think it must have been later than six—I am certain it was, and to the best of my belief it was much later—I will not swear that I saw Mr. Lee and Mr. Whatman later than six in Pudding Lane, it was the evening part—I had no communication with Mr. Goodwin before the petition came on—I may have spoken to him—I did speak to him, but only casually, not upon any evidence—I do not take upon myself to say the exact nature of the conversation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you take upon yourself to say that you only spoke to him casually? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, not upon the nature of the evidence, because I did not know the evidence, I only knew one case, and that was notorious through the town—I knew the evidence day by day—I cannot say positively that I did not take a witness to Mr. Goodwin during the petition—I cannot recollect having a conversation with Mr. Goodwin about the evidence that had been given, or taking him a witness to be examined—I cannot swear that that did not occur—I cannot recollect taking him a witness before the petition com<lb></lb>menced—I will not swear that I did not—I did not have a conversation with him as to the nature of the evidence, but it was perfectly notorious all through the town that one witness, Mr. Kirby, was to be examined—I cannot say that he took an active interest on the Conservative side—he did not come up with me—I did not come up in the same train as he did; but I saw him in London in the Committee room—he does not take a par<lb></lb>ticular interest on the Conservative side—I saw two or three gentlemen in the forge, to best of my belief; there were not six—I will not under<lb></lb>take to say that there were not five, or to say the exact number—it was ten o'clock in the evening—I do not understand this line of examination, it is not fair—I had not a view of the whole of the forge—there were a good many people, two distinct parties, about Maidstone canvassing—the borough is divided into two separate parts, as nearly every borough is, and the candidates and their friends go round in a canvassing party—the numbers vary; sometimes there are 20 and sometimes 25, and sometimes only four or five, or less—I never made a statement to the effect that I have now while the Parliamentary Committee was sitting, because I did not know that Mr. Chambers would give evidence—he was examined the second day, and I was there—I did not see the printed paper at night when I was in London—I got it on Wednesday, when the petitioner's case had closed—I made no statement while the petition was pending, to the effect of what I have said to-day, but it struck my mind that I could—I believe the prisoner was the first man who was examined on Wednesday, the 18th—I was not there in time to hear the whole of his evidence, and on the following morning you will find the petitioners' case closed—I first made a statement similar to what I have made now last week, but I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186608130011"></xptr>
               <p>stated it verbally prior—I first stated it when the petition was going on, not before the petition—(I did not understand the nature of Chambers's evidence; I did not know he was going to be called)—I did not state it to Mr. Goodwin, but I stated it publicly in Maidstone to a few friends—that might be the Friday or Saturday after Chambers was examined, I cannot now charge my memory; the election is now more than 12 months ago—the petition was in April this year—I mentioned to a few friends that I thought I saw, to the best of my belief, Messrs. Lee and Whatman coming out as I described—I said on the first occasion that I could not tell who the parties were—I say that, to the best of my belief, I saw them coming out—I was certain about them then in my own mind, and I swear now that, to the best of my belief, I saw them coming out—I have lived in Maidstone a great many years, and know them—I was a witness against Mr. Lee seven years ago, and I knew him and Mr. Whatman per<lb></lb>fectly well—I will swear that I spoke to them on the first occasion that I saw them, and yet I will not say more than to the best of my belief—it was some time before the election that I saw them in Pudding Lane—I made no memorandum of it—I mentioned it to several friends after the petition, as I thought it was important—I swore just now that it was not of sufficient importance for me to give evidence—I mentioned it in casual conversation to a few friends—the time when I believe I saw them was some short time prior to the election—I made no memorandum of the time—it was not a fortnight before the election—I cannot state positively, you are taxing me too fiercely—it was not the day before the election, it was ten days or a fortnight before—to the best of my belief, that was the first occasion.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were asked if you were examined on a former occasion on some petition; is there any pretence for suggesting that you uttered one word that is not true? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think not—on the first occasion, when I saw Messrs. Lee and Whatman at the forge, they were coming out of the forge—that was the evening I saw Mr. Brown—he said, "I have just come from the house, and Lee and Whatman are gone into Chambers's forge," on that I and Mr. Smith looked out at the window and saw them come out of the forge—I knew them by sight, and have no doubt that the two persons who came out of the forge were Messrs. Lee and Whatman, now sitting on the bench—Chambers was examined on Wednesday—I did not go down to Maidstone on Wednesday evening—I did not come up to town again—it was the next day (Thursday) that I read the account of what Chambers had said—I was not five minutes in the committee room during Chambers's examination—what I read in the papers was the first I heard of it—I did not mention it to any one in Maidstone on Thursday, not till I heard the evidence of Mr. Whatman and Mr. Lee—Mr. Whatman was examined one day and Mr. Lee the next—it was mentioned at Maidstone the same evening—I read their evidence partly on Thursday, but I read it on the Friday—it was either on Friday or Saturday that I said some<lb></lb>thing about the evidence of Mr. Lee and Mr. Whatman—Mr. Goodwin was solicitor to the petitioners—from the time I left home on the Wed<lb></lb>nesday evening I had no communication with him—I called at his office on professional business and saw Kirby there; that was before the petition was presented—I did not take Kirby there; I had nothing to do with him—he happened to be in Mr. Goodwin's office when I called.</p>

               <p>Lee and Whatman half-way up the lane—I followed them through the lane—they were coming from Earl Street towards the "Sun"—it was between eight and nine, nearly nine—they did not pass me—I followed them till they came opposite Mr. Chambers's shop, and they stopped and went in directly—I saw them go in—I knew them by sight perfectly well, and have no doubt whatever that they went in—I went into Smith's beershop, Pudding Lane, perhaps five or six yards from opposite Chambers's forge, on the other side of the street—I saw Hawkins there—I had passed the forge to go to the public-house—I saw them go in and saw them in there, but I did not see anything of the defendant at that time—I did not wait a minute—two or three days after that, at night, I saw Messrs. Lee and Whatman in Pudding Lane—Hawkins was going home with me, and I saw them in the forge talking to Chambers, who was standing close by the anvil, but he was not at work while they were talking—I did not stop scarcely half a minute—I can speak positively that Mr. Lee and Mr. Whatman are the two, and I saw Mr. Lee at Chambers's forge between four and five o'clock one afternoon—I did not notice Chambers—I saw Mr. Lee come out of the forge—my place of business is about 200 yards from Chambers's forge.</p>

Lee and Whatman Hawkins was with me; we were going home together, and at the end of the street he went one way and I the other—we were together when we saw them, and I called his attention to them, and said, "They are working that man's inside out"—we were on the pavement, which is a sort of threshold of the shop, and about the distance I am from you—I cannot say whether we stopped half a minute—it was night, and the light was not so bright as it is now; it was firelight—Hawkins knew them as well as I did, and he could see them as plainly as I could and a little better, because he had better sight perhaps—my sight is very good, but he is younger—this was, I think, five or six days before Tuesday, the nomination day, not more—I cannot tell you whether it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before—I had come home by train—I made no statement at the time the petition was going on—the first statement I made was to Mr. Goodwin not more than a week ago I think—I mentioned it to others—I cannot tell you whether I mentioned it two months ago—there was a general talk about it—I cannot tell you the person to whom I first mentioned it—there were no other persons in the forge on the second occasion that I saw, only Chambers, unless they were hidden behind the bellows—I had a view of the forge—I was about the same distance as I am from you, and the fire was burning—it is open to the street, so that anybody can see—I did not notice any persons about—I did not see Mr. Lee or Mr. Whatman about the lane with persons canvassing—it was not as early as eight o'clock the second time, it was between ten and eleven—it was not as early as ten—I will venture to swear I did not see them in Pudding Lane as early as six; it was later than eight, I call it between eight and nine—I have not agreed with Hawkins that it was between eight and nine—he did not know what I was going to say, and I did not know what he was going to say—we came up together about this business, but had no conversation about what we were</p>

               <p>going to say—my examination as to what I was going to say was taken down about a week afterwards at Mr. Goodwin's, it was about seven o'clock—Hawkins was there, he came out of Mr. Goodwin's room as I went in—I did not go there by appointment—no one asked me to go—I went to give an account, and that was a convenient time—I had no conversation with Hawkins—I have never had any conversation with him as to what he could say, except what was said the night when we were going home.</p>

Lee and Whatman coming in the direction of Earl Street, arm in arm in the middle of the road—Earl Street leads into Pudding Lane—when they got to the forge they made a stop, and Chambers came to the edge of the forge with his shirt sleeves tucked up; the two members walked into the forge out of my sight—I cannot say how long they were there, I had no watch, but it was a short time—when they came out they passed by my house into the High Street—I saw them canvassing during the election, and Mr. Lee came and canvassed my brother, who was not at home, and he said that Mr. Whatman was knocked up—I am sure that the Mr. Lee who went into the forge was the same Mr. Lee who came and asked for my brother's vote—I never spoke to Chambers in my life, but I know him.</p>

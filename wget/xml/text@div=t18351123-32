                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Charles Wilson, of Fore-street, Cripplegate. On the 9th of November, the prisoner and another came into the shop—they bought a quarter and a half of muslin, at one shilling a yard, and then went out—a person came in, and in consequence of what was said, I went after the prisoner, and overtook her in Milton-street—I asked her what she had in her basket—I looked under her right arm, and took from her these four yards and a half of Circadian cloth—It is the property of Wilson and Blakeridge—this and another were on the counter twenty minutes before the prisoner entered—It had been sold.</p>

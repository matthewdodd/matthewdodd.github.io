                  </hi>. I am an artist, and live at 12, Avenue Road, Lewisham—on the 6th July I took a cab from the Broadway—when I got to Deptford the coachman would not go any further—I took out my purse to pay the cabman, and while doing so some man snatched my purse from my hand, and ran down Church Street—the street was dark, but it was light enough to see the form of the man—I was quite sober—I ran after him for about a quarter of a mile—I nearly caught him—I said I would not proceed against him if he gave me back my purse—he turned round and came back holding the purse in his hand—he then struck me a blow on the chest, and snatched my watch and chain out of my pocket, and ran away again—I ran after him, but lost sight of him by the arches, which were dark—on coming back I saw a female and spoke to her—I said I should know her again, and should call her as a witness, as she must have seen it—I am almost certain the prisoner is the man who took my watch, chain, and purse—I did not lose sight of him before he came back and took my watch and chain—there was a sovereign and a few shillings in the purse—I next saw the prisoner after he was taken into custody—as I was passing by the cell he spoke to me, and said he was not the man that did it—I had not then said anything to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a single woman, and live at Mill Lane, Deptford—I get my living by knitting—I was in High Street, Deptford, about 1.15 on the 7th July—I saw the prosecutor come up in a cab—I saw him get out and pay the cabman—I then saw the prisoner run across from Mill Lane and snatch his purse from his hand—I knew the prisoner before for about twelve months—he ran down Church Street, the prosecutor ran after him and I followed—I was close to him when he took the purse—I heard the prosecutor say, "If you give me my purse back again I won't hurt you"—I had run some little distance before I heard that—the prisoner came back and appeared to give him his purse, but he snatched the watch and chain from his pocket—he then ran down towards the arches—I gave information to the police—I knew the prisoner well by sight for about twelve months.</p>

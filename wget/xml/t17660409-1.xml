On the 4th I saw a boy going by with a pair of iron hinges in his hand, I asked him where he had them; he told me he would shew me the person he bought them of; he shewed me the prisoner, and as other buildings were broke open that night in Houndsditch, we thought proper to secure him. We examined him about the hinges, he acknowledged he had taken them.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words he made use of?</p>
               <p>Woodbridge. He said he got in, and went up into the two pair of stairs room and took a chissel, and came down to the one pair of stairs room, and drawed the staple of a padlock and opened the door, and went in and took 10 pair of hinges from off a shelf, and his little brother and another boy were with him at the time. We asked him what he had done with them; he said he would produce some of them to me the next day, which he said he had sold to a person. We went with him to a baker in Gravel-lane; there the baker's brother produced to us three pair, which the prisoner acknowledged to be three of the same he took from the buildings. They have no particular marks on them, so as to know them from others, but they are of the same sort, and like them we missed; and though I do not chuse to swear to them, I believe them to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the hinges you missed taken from off a shelf?</p>

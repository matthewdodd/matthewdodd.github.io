                  </hi>. I am assistant manager to the Harburg and Vienna India-rubber Company—Binstead has been in their employ nine or ten years as messenger—he had no authority to sell goods, only to do whatever he was told—I never saw Tyler till he was at the police-court—these two dozen goloshes are our make and are worth 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I identify them by this eagle stamp—Binstead had no right to take them without my permission, and I did not give him permission.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GILL</hi>. I have been assistant manager a year and nine months—Binstead was there when I went—Mr. Hodges is the manager—Binstead was sometimes sent to collect money, and large amounts passed through his hands—only he and I were in the office on this Friday evening, and I left him to lock up at 5 o'clock—Mr. Hodges was away from home; he paid Binstead's wages if he was at home, if not I did—the first I heard was that Binstead was in custody on Saturday, the 7th—that was before he had an opportunity of speaking to me or to Mr. Hodges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Mr. Hodges had been away nearly a week travelling, and I occupied his place—if any customer wanted goods it would come to my knowledge; no goods would be supplied without my knowledge—Binstead ought to have left the office on 6th December as soon as he could get the postage stamps on the letters and get them ready for the post; he ought to have left five minutes after me—he had made no communication to me about goloshes when I left at 5 o'clock—I heard nothing about it till I saw the police next morning—Binstead has not bought any over-shoes of the firm during my time.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer M</hi>). On the night of 6th December at 7 p.m. I was in Park Street, Southwark, which is nearly half a mile from Gracechurch Street, and saw Tyler with a brown-paper parcel—I said, "Halloa! what have you got there?"—I did not know him—he said, "I have some slippers"—I said, "What kind of slippers ore they?"—he said, "Goloshes"—I said, "What are you going to do with them?"—he said, "I am going to take them to the shop"—I said, "What shop?"—he said, "To a shop in Union Street"—I said, "Have you an invoice with them?"—he said, "I have"—I asked him to produce it, which he failed to do, and said he had not got one—I said, "I shall have to take you in custody for the unlawful possession of them"—I asked him where he got them—he said from a man he knew as "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>" who resided in the neighbour<lb></lb>hood of Rockingham Street, and he did not know him by any other name, and did not know his address; but was going to pay him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. down fox them, and was going to receive 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took him in charge, and from the in<lb></lb>formation he gave us at the station I went with Wright to the William the Fourth in Rockingham Street, and saw Binstead there, but did not hear the conversation—I then went to his lodging, and his wife handed me this pair of goloshes from a chest of drawers—they are of the same kind.</p>

I was with Cox at the William the Fourth on December 6th at 9.30 p.m.—we saw Binstead there, and I said to him, "We are policeman; I want to see you respecting the goloshes that you let Tyler have"—he said, "I know nothing about Tyler or goloshes"—I said, "Tyler says you do"—he said, "I sent two dozen round to a man named "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>," or "William," in Park Street—I said, "What are you going to charge him for them?"—he said, "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pair"—I said, "Tyler says he is going to sell them for 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen, and get 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. profit; have you any authority to take these things?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Have you paid for them?"—he said, "No, but I shall pay for them to-morrow"—Tyler handed me this bill at the station, and said that he took the goloshes</p>

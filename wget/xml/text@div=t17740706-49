            . On Saturday the 21st of May I was at the prisoner Smith's house; she told me Jack was gone out upon the road to get her some money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand what she meant by that?</p>
               <p>Roach. Yes; She said she expected him home at ten o'clock; he did come home within about five minutes of ten, in a coach; they went up stairs into a room together, and he gave her five guineas, and this watch; I was there on the Monday night, and the prisoner Smith then had this watch by her side; Rann then was taken up; Sir

               <p>I know nothing in the world of this robbery; all is false; I have known this woman for a considerable time; I think this is out of malice; she has often applied to me to take her; I had refused; I have sometimes let her have things; I gave her some shoes.</p>
               <p>Roach. Somebody did give me shoes at Epsom; whether it was him or no I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Rann. It is all out of revenge because I would not keep her.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence.</p>
               <p>This is all false; I did receive the watch, but not from the prisoner; I received it from a person I met in the Strand; he took me to a tavern; he not having any money, took my direction, and promised to call for the watch, but he did not; she extorted it from my maid, with whom I left it in case the gentleman called for it.</p>

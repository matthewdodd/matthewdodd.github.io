Just after, a gentleman came and said he had lost a trunk; I told him a man had, gone by with a trunk; we pursued him and brought him back in about ten minutes. I ran along White Chapel, thinking I had missed the way the man took, I turned back, and a man asked me if I was running after a man with a trunk, I told him I was; he said he saw a man running with one, and directed me up Jewry-lane, and there I took the prisoner with the trunk. I am sure the prisoner is the man that ran past me.</p>

               <p>On the 18th of October, twenty minutes before nine, as another young man and I were standing at the corner of Jewry-street, we saw the prisoner run by with a trunk upon his back, he ran against the young man, and pushed against me; I suspected he had stole it; then I saw the last witness run past me towards White Chapel; I said, I believed they were in pursuit of the man with the trunk. I stood at the end of the Minories; the last witness turned back, I stopp'd him, and asked him if he was pursuing any body; he said, yes, a man with a trunk. I went with him to George-street, in the Minories, there we asked a woman if she had seen a man with a trunk, she said no; I then heard somebody say, oh! upon which, I turned, and saw the prisoner with the trunk; another young man immediately laid hold of him, and Acorn came up.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You lost sight of the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you never saw him before? - No. He had on a pair of boots, and a sort of a blue frock; he seemed to be in a great hurry, which gave me a suspicion he had stole it; I took it on his back.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 11th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner and two more loaded with property; they were carrying it across the shoulder just as if taken out of the shop. I saw them come out of Somerset-street, and from there they proceeded into Gulston-street; on the other side of the way I followed them; I had suspicion that the property was stolen. The prisoner dropped some of the property off his shoulder accidentally; one of the other men said, d - n it, do not stop to pick it up; which made my suspicion stronger, I laid hold of him; he told me to let him go; I told him I would not. The property was thrown upon the pavement; he and I had a scuffle together for a long time. I got part of the property picked up, as much as I could. A mob came round, part of the property was gone; I saved as much as I could. I got him and the property to the watchhouse. Mr. M'Carthy applied the next morning, said he had been robbed; he swore to the property before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other men - A.

            They walked away with their loads; my attention was taken to the prisoner and the property. The prisoner knew me. The property is here, I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are all mine; I lost a great many other things that are not come forward.</p>

I was coming up Somerset-street between five and six o'clock, I went into a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090020"></xptr>ruinous place to do my occasions; I kicked up something, I saw it was a pair of trowsers, I took the property up and put it under my arm, and was going with it to my father's house to know what I should do with it.</p>

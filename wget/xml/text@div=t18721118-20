I am a labourer, living at 3, Friendly Place, Whitehorse Lane, Stepney—on 30th August I was at the Comfort Arms—I went in there at 5.30, and remained till about 8.30—the prisoner and I went in together—we had some drink, and entered into an argument con<lb></lb>cerning military affairs—I told him that he knew nothing about it, and with that he lost his temper—he took up a pewter pint measure from the table and threw it at me, but fortunately it missed me and struck an old gentle<lb></lb>man in the chest, who was sitting at the back—I then pitched into the prisoner—we fought, and I struck him several times—it ended by my throwing the prisoner on to the floor—after that the landlord, Mr. Cowley, requested me to go out—I went to the threshold of the door and returned again, and Mr. Cowley said to me "My good fellow, don't make any further disturbance in my house; take my advice and go"—I was standing against the door, with my back to it—Mr. Cowley was in front of me—I did not see the prisoner coming towards me, but I felt a severe blow over my left eye—I went out of the house—my eye bled very profusely—I leaned against some palisading and I fell afterwards from loss of blood—I found myself at the hospital in the morning—I remained there about seven weeks—I had been drinking that night, and the prisoner with me, but we were not intoxicated.</p>

White, that is upon it, was his mark, that the letter had gone from his office that morning, which was the same day, Saturday; Mr. White called a person out of his shop, who is here, and asked him if he remembered any thing of this letter, the person said he did remember that he took it in on the preceding evening from an elderly woman that, he believed, went of errands for the prisoners in Newgate: I then went and enquired of Mr. Akerman if there was any woman attended the gaol that answered the description, he said there was; he sent one of his people to seek for her, but they were not able to find her that evening; Mr. Akerman told me if I would come the next morning he would certainly find the woman; I went the next morning to Mr. Akerman, and the woman was produced; she told me she went of errands for Girdwood, and that she did carry a letter directed to a gentleman, whose name she had forgot; but that it was directed to Davis-street, the corner of Mount-street, Berkeley-square, and that it was written in a secretary hand, as she called it: I went to Sir

               <p>When did you hear of this again? - Not till Sunday morning: I was sent for to Mr. Akerman's (looks at the letter) by the direction that is the same, I saw no more than the direction.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about its being the letter? - By the direction it is the same; I cannot say any farther, there is some writing at the back that was not upon it at that time.</p>

            , keeps a penny post office in Newgate-street: upon Friday, February the 9th, the last witness, a little after seven o'clock, brought a letter to our house; I believe this letter to be the same, I am pretty certain it is, I looked at the directions; I observed it was a comical sort of hand-writing, and I looked at the woman: I put it into the box.</p>
               <p>Did you know the woman? - Yes, by frequently coming with letters to the shop: upon Saturday evening Mr. Edridge called at our house, and desired to know of my master if he could tell who put this letter in, my master called me, and asked me if I could recollect who put that letter in; I said I recollected it was put in by the woman who comes with letters from Newgate: I am clear this is the letter; I don't recollect that ever I saw such a hand.</p>
               <p>Did you ask the woman any questions when she brought it? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Did you mark the letters yourself that night? - I believe I did not.</p>
               <p>Are they not marked before they go from your office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did that letter go from your office? - Upon Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Robinson. Can you read the directions of that letter? - I can make out some of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you read it now? - I cannot make out the name, nor I could not then; but I can make out Davis-street, the corner of Mount-street, Berkeley-square.</p>
               <p>Jury. Whether you received any letter from any body else, or put any letter into the post that night from any other person? - No, I am very sure I did not.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>At the time this letter was received, I was lying in Newgate for transportation for fourteen years, from my former sentence: I gave that woman three or four different letters to carry out for me.</p>
               <p>Court to Robinson. Had you seen this prisoner several times before? - I frequently went on errands for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did you read the direction by a candle at the turnkey's? - I did.</p>
               <p>There was no candle where you saw the prisoner? - No, only a lamp.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177602210008"></xptr>Court. You said nobody was actually with him I think, only a great many people about? - No; nobody with him.</p>
               <p>Can you be positive about receiving the letter from the prisoner himself? - I received it from his own hand.</p>

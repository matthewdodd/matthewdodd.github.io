               <p>Q. On the 30th of September last do you remember the prisoner coming to your house. - A. I do, he came about five or six o'clock in the evening; he asked for a bed, the bed room was showed him, No. 34, on the second floor in the front of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring his trunk exactly at that time. - A. He said he would send his trunks and they should be put in his bed room; accordingly he did.</p>
               <p>Q. He appeared dressed as a gentleman. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In course of that evening was a trunk and portmanteau brought and put in that room. - A. In the course of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he continue in the house. - A.About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not mean at that time; how long did he continue. - A. He kept the bed room only six nights; the whole of his bill only came to fourteen shillings for the whole of the time he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing him on the morning of the 5th. - A. I do; he breakfasted in the coffee room aabout a quarter before nine, I took him his breakfast myself. After breakfast he went up stairs into his bedroom; he remained up stairs twenty minutes or half an hour; he came down again with his trunk and portmanteau; he came along the passage into the kitchen, and paid for his breakfast and went away, calling the porter to take his things; he gave the porter his trunk; he carried the portmanteau out of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Soon after he was gone did you go up stairs. - A. I did not go up myself; the boy that is here went up and discovered the robbery. I went up in about an hour afterwards, in consequence of the boy telling me so.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up did you perceive that you yourself had lost any thing. - A. I lost every thing that I had, in fact, that was in the trunk, that was in a small bed room No. 39.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that on the same floor with the prisoner's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280028"></xptr>room. - A. The floor over it; I lost four pair of breeches, four waistcoats, five shirts, nine neckcloths, eleven handkerchiefs, four of them double and the others single, five pair of cotton stockings, two pair of silk stockings, two pocket handkerchiefs, and four one pound notes, in my left hand breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your trunk broke open. - A. It was not; I left it open, I never do lock it.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before had you seen these things safe. - A. An hour and a half from the time I came down stairs till I went up again; I got up about half past eight, and about nine o'clock he went up.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was full half an hour after you was up before the prisoner went up stairs. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with Trott the officer the next day to apprehend the prisoner. - A. I did; I found him in a public house, the Portman Arms, Upper Berkley-street. At the time I apprehended him he had a pair of black kerseymere breeches and a pair black silk stockings; they were part of my property that were taken out of my trunk at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with the officer to the prisoner's lodgings. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to ask him a question or two; I am confident that I am perfectly correct, although my life is forfeited - Is the witness certain that he lost four one pound notes. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am certain and positive that he never lost them by me; he says that I come and said my servant should bring some luggage to the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. No, he said you said the luggage should be brought.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I came in a hackney coach; the porter brought the luggage from the coach; I went away from the door in the same coach.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. He says he left his luggage there at the first time he called at the house, did the luggage come the first time he came. - A. I did not see it. I saw it in an hour afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see them found. - A. I saw them found. Mr. Holmes found them; I was in the room the moment afterwards.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, I will take the liberty of addressing you, if you please; I am a man now forty six years of age, my life was forfeited yesterday upon a trial of this description; I have been twenty two years a housekeeper of respectability, I have a large family, and if the earl of Bedford was alive he could tell you who I am. Misfortunes has induced me to commit crimes which I shudder at; my family is large, they depended upon me for bread. When I was last in Ireland with lord Cornwallis I fought for my king and country, I was afterwards fired at twice, where Mr. Hemmit was detected and afterwards brought to justice; I have been a good and loyal subject. I have been in his Majesty's army, I have had two commissions; one I had about six years ago when I went to America, in consequence of my ability in military affairs. I am now situated in such a disgraceful way that never belonged to me nor any one belonging to me; the stain that I have thrown on my children is more to me than life; I throw myself on your lordship's mercy. I emplore mercy not for myself; I ask nothing for myself, but for the sake of my family; I have as good a wife as ever existed. The property that the officer took she purchased articles in her way, she is a mantua maker and she makes up millinery, and serves families: and I have been in the habit of purchasing such things, and when we have got a purchase that we could get something from; we have been under the necessity of pledging; the consequence was a number of duplicates was found. This is the first time in my life that I have been guilty of crimes, every thing that I had in the world has been put under the same situation, and it has been taken from me, and I have been deprived of it; I am deprived of my life; it is forfeited. My lord, I look to you for mercy. I earnestly entreat and emplore that mercy may be extended to a subject who has been true and loyal, and an honest man, who has paid his way honest for twenty two years.</p>

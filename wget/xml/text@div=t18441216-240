                  </hi>. I am an errand-boy in the service of Mr. Ebenezer Howard, in Leadenhall-market—about nine o'clock in the morning, on the 16th of Dec., I saw the prisoner in the neighbourhood of my master's shop—he asked me for a bit of straw—I gave him some—he had half an armful—he put the straw down on two turkeys, which hid them from view—he then took them up, and walked into the public-house opposite our shop with them—I went after him and said, "You must come with me"—he seemed innocent of it at first, but I went to his basket, which stood on the form he sat upon, and there I found the two turkeys belong<lb></lb>ing to my master, and the same that the prisoner put the straw upon—I took him into my master's shop first, and then gave him into custody.</p>

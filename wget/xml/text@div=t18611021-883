                  </hi>. I am a detective officer of the City of London police—on Saturday, 28th September, I saw Goodall in Wenlock-street, Hoxton, where he lives—I had seen him on the Thursday evening previous, in company with Brandon, at a public-house at the end of King-street, Smith-field, the same that I saw them go into on the Saturday morning—I followed Goodall from Wenlock-street on the Saturday morning, about half-past 7 o'clock—he went from Wenlock-street up to West-street, Smithfield—he</p>

               <p>went down West-street into St. John's-court to Mr. Neighbour's stables—they are wine merchants, carrying on business in King-street, and the stables lie at the back of their premises—before he went into the stables I noticed that his pockets were very light, not at all bulky—he remained in the stables, I should think, about six or seven minutes; he and Brandon then came out of the stable together, and turned up Fox-and-Knot-court into King-street—there is an entrance from King-street through into West-street—they went up King-street towards the public-house where I had seen them together on the Thursday evening—before they went into the public-house I noticed that both Goodall's pockets were very bulky—they remained in the public-house about two or three minutes—they then came out and separated, after about two minutes conversation together; Goodall turning again down King-street, and Brandon going down West-street towards the stables—I followed Goodall into Farringdon Market, and from there to Newgate-street—when at the end of Queen's-head-passage, Newgate-street, I felt his pockets, and got in front of him, and asked him what he had got there, putting my hand at his sides—his coat was open, and the pockets were inside—I said I was an officer—there was a little commotion at the time—crowd began to collect—I took him by the arm and took him across into King Edward-street—I said, "I am detective-officer, and shall take you into custody for receiving these two bottles from Mr. Neighbour's servant "—he said, D----n it; you are not going to take me for a little drop of brandy"—I had bold of him—he begged of me not to take hold of him, for he would not run away—he then put his hands in his pockets and walked by my side—we proceeded a little farther on the way to the station, when he suddenly turned from me, put his hands into his pocket, held the two brandy bottles up and dashed them to the ground, saying, "There you b----, you shan't have the brandy"—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) are some of the pieces of the bottles—one was green and the other white—I picked up some of the pieces and the corks, and took them to the station—Pavitt took Brandon in custody, but I gave him the directions to do so—on the remand of Goodall at Guildhall, Brandon was at the station awaiting my arrival to charge him—I there told him everything that had occurred about Goodall, and foe said, "All right master; I have been led into this by Goodall and <hi rend="italic">Mahogany".—Makogany</hi>, is the nickname of a man named Simpkins, who was drinking with them on the Thursday evening when I first saw them together—I asked Brandon how long he had known Goodall, and he said he had known him three months.</p>

Neighbour's counting-house in another—I stood in Fox-and-knot-court—if Brandon had come round the street and entered the stables after Goodall I should have seen him, but he did not come round—I was not instructed to watch Brandon—I was watching his companion, <hi rend="italic">Mahogany</hi>, and through watching that man this case turned up—I suspected Brandon then of being mixed up with that</p>

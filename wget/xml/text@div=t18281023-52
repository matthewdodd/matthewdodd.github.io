On the 17th of September, between one and two o'clock, I was standing in my factory, seeing my work-people come in, several of them were rather late; about twenty minutes past two o'clock, I saw a little lad come down the street - I took him into my work-shop, and collared the prisoner; I took him into my parlour, then went into my work-shop, called the prisoner, and brought him into the parlour; I then sent for an officer, and asked the prisoner how he could be so ungrateful as to rob me, when he had lived with me so many years - he gave no answer; I then asked where he had got the silver from - he voluntarily said he was very sorry for what he had done, and that he had been to the same shop three times before to sell silver; I went up stairs and missed 1 oz. 7 1/2 dwts. of silver wire, (from a bobbin,) which cost 7s. 6d.</p>

On the 17th of September the prisoner came to the shop, and offered this 1 oz. 7 dwts. of silver wire for sale, and brought this note with it:" it says,"Please, Sir, I shall feel very much obliged if you will, take the silver wire of my son, - Charles Webb, No. 3, Berkley-street:" he had brought the same not once before - I enquired at No. 3, Berkley-street, and when he came again, I detained the note, and told him to fetch his father; but instead of that a little boy brought another note to me.</p>

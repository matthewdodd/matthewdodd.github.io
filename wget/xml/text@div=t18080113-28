               <p>Q. On the 5th of January had you your shop window broken by any body. - A. Yes, between seven and eight at night. I was in the parlour adjoining.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear it break. - A. I did not; my little boy, between nine and ten years of age, was looking through the glass door, he heard a noise; I immediately rose and went into the shop. I observed the window broken.</p>
               <p>Q. How near the time that you was alarmed had you observed that window before. - A. I had not observed it for some time; I think it was about an hour before. I think if it had been broken before my people would have told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed that window in the course of the afternoon, to see whether it was broke yourself or not - A. Not particularly, I had not; I do not know that I had taken notice of it in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your going into the shop and observing a window broke, what then. - A. I observed a piece of Irish linen and three handkerchiefs were taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they taken from. - A. They were taken from near that part where the window was broken; they were laying against the piece of glass that was taken out, and the three handkerchiefs were upon it; they were laying on the frame, which is a kind of thing made on purpose for putting these things on; they were not leaning against the window, but almost close to it.</p>
               <p>Q. How near the time of your alarm had you observed the handkerchiefs. - A. I cannot exactly tell; I had observed them there before.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130021"></xptr>Q. Having found that your window war broke, and some of your stock was gone, what did you do. - A. I went out immediately and went towards Hyde Park corner; not seeing any person that I suspected I was returning; in a few yards from Knightsbridge barracks I observed the prisoner Coates on my left side, with something under his great coat; upon that I seized him, and putting my hand within his coat I felt the cloth, I asked him where he got it from, he said he did not take it, but he got it from two boys; at that instant I observed two boys close to him; a person passing by I desired him that he would seize these boys, he seized Badger; the other prisoner and the other boy made his escape. We took them to Knightsbridge watchhouse; I asked Coates what he had done with the handkerchiefs he took out of the window; he took them out of his pocket and they were delivered to me. Badger denied any knowledge of the transaction. Coates said he received the goods from Badger, and a boy of the name of Lacey, that made his escape; Badger was by at the time; Coates was afterwards searched, and various other articles were found in his possession.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not yours. - A. No. In the first instance I observed blood upon the hand of Badger, it was cut down on the back part of it, and bled very fresh, as if it was fresh cut, and the blood was quite wet upon the back of his hand. I did not examine the window till the next morning; I found a piece of glass taken out, it appeared to be done with a sharp instrument; it was taken out nearly whole, and the piece laid by the side; I should suppose a knife had been put in between the putty, and there was some blood upon the window frame.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the handkerchiefs and the piece of Irish cloth. - A. I have not; I left them at the watchhouse; they were brought to Bow-street the next morning and delivered it into the care of Adkins the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that piece of cloth and the handkerchiefs that were delivered to Adkins at Bow-street office the same as were taken from your house. - A. Yes.</p>

            . Q. You are an officer of Bow-street. - A. Yes. I produce the linen and the handkerchiefs, that were brought by the constable or the watchhouse keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Doward, look at them again and see whether that linen and handkerchiefs are the same that were taken out of the shop window. - A. It is the same, I know it by the number upon it; it is the same piece of linen, and they are the handkerchiefs that I took from the boy.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the piece of cloth. - A. It cost me above five pounds; I valued it at four pounds, it cost me four shillings and two pence a yard; the handkerchiefs are of the same pattern, and of the same quality; I have no particular marks upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the materials of which they are made. - A. Two of them are muslin, and one of them silk.</p>
               <p>Q. Were two of the handkerchiefs that you lost made of muslin, and one of silk. - A. Yes; the boy gave them me out of his pocket, and they were of that pattern; the three cost me about half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. They are common handkerchiefs, they are common in town. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your mark to the linen, or the wholesale dealer's mark. - A. The wholesale dealer's.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you do not know, but what he sends out other linen of the same quality, with the same mark. - A. I do not know it.</p>

               <p>Q. It is not your own mark. - A. It is not my own mark.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you took no particular notice of this window during the day. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Though Coates made this confession, Badger he denied it. - A. He did before.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you mean by denying it before; when he was first taken to the watchhouse you said that Badger denied any knowledge of the transaction; Coates said he received them from Badger, and the boy that was not taken; you have introduced a confusion in the business, by using the expression, he denied before. - A. Coates said he received them from two boys; Badger denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. When he said he received them of Badger, and Lacey on a subsequent day, what did Badger say. - A. Nothing; he afterwards said so at the watchhouse.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Doward's parlour at the time the alarm was given; I heard a window break, I did not know it was in the shop; in the course of a minute afterwards the little boy saw somebody take the things out of the window; I run out directly.

               <p>Q. Did you observe it at that time. - A. I did; I ran after them, I did not take them; on our returning to the watchhouse, I found these things; they do not belong to Mr. Doward.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. Who was in the parlour with you. - A. There were Mrs. Doward, the three sons, and Mr. Doward.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be so much quicker of hearing than them - were they all deaf. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you hear them say. - A. I heard Coates say that he had got the property from Badger, and the other boy Badger said he did not know any thing about it; going along I felt his hand, and his hand was all wet with blood; then we took him to the watchhouse, and then Badger owned that he was a confederate with Coates; Badger said that he had been with him all the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Repeat the words that Badger said, as near as you can. - A. He said, they had been with him all that evening; Coates and Lacey that run away, had been with him all that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Badger to say that he had been with them all the evening. - A. Coates said he had the things from Badger and Lacey, Badger said he had nothing to do in it; after he was searched, he said he had been with them all the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Badger to say that. - A. Badger said he come down to see his aunt; I asked him where his aunt lived; he said, he could not tell me; I said that is a queer piece of business, you come to see your aunt, and do not know where she lives; then we were going on towards the watchhouse, then he owned he had been along with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if I understand you right, as you were going to the watchhouse, he said he was going to see his aunt, you asked where she lived, he said he could not tell where she lived. - A. Yes,</p>
               <p>Q. You said it was a queer piece of business, and he could not tell where she lived. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then afterwards he said he had been with them all the evening. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Coates's Defence. I was going up to Brompton; I was looking for work there; in returning home, I met two lads, they said they would give me two half crowns to carry these things; thinking no harm I carried them.</p>
               <p>Badger left his defence to his counsel, and called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>COURT. - GENTLEMEN - The circumstances against the two prisoners are first, that on Badger being apprehended, his hand was bleeding, and the widow frame having blood upon it; that when Coates was taken by the prosecutor with the goods in his possession, Badger and the other boy were seen near in company with Coates, and the assertion of Coates, uncontradicted by Badger, who acknowledged that they were in company all the evening together; there appears to me to be very strong circumstance against the two prisoners; however, it is for you to decide, how far in you opinion the prisoners are either or both of them innocent or guilty.</p>

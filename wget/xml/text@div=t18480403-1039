                  </hi> I am a tailor, at 34, Gray's Inn-lane. On 23rd March I left Astely's theatre about a quarter-past twelve o'clock—I went into a public-house in Westminster—I was there about twenty minutes—Cayton and Clare were in Front of the bar—Clare was dressed as he is now—I went outside with the gentleman who had been to Astley's with me, and wished him good night—Cayton called me back, and pulled me by the arm into the public-house—I treated him to some rum, put down 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and got the change—there were nine or ten men there—I said I knew a man named Dunn in that neighbourhood—Cayton said he knew him well, he lived in the same street with him—we were than at the corner of the street—he said, "Come with me, he lives within a door or two of me"—he took me to the left, towards the Abbey—I had to go to the right—he said he was taking me towards Mr. Dunn's—I think we passed the Abbey—Clare, who was with us, then said, "Good night," and left us—we went on to a curious sort of place; I thought no one connected with me lived there—A policeman stood at the corner, and I said to him, "I don't like this man, protect me"—I do not know whether Cayton said anything on that—I went on with him into the place, he caught hold of my arms, and folded them back quite tight, so that I had no power in them—a slight young man came out of a corner all at once, and stood in front of me—he was about Hall's size, but rather darker—it was quite dark—he pulled the chain out of my waistcoat-pocket—it was round my neck double—I thought I should be choked, and said, "Let me take my hat off"—they got my watch and chain—I put up my hands, to take my hat off, and Cayton said it was beat to be quiet—I had half-a-crown, and I think a shilling—I had two half-crowns, but changed one in the public-house—I had not taken out my watch in the public-house—the men walked away—I turned the reverse way, the way I had come—in about half-an-hour I met Cayton, coming in the same direction as a policeman, and I gave him in charge—between two and three next morning I saw Clare and Hall in custody—Cayton never left me till I lost my watch.</p>

On the morning of 23rd I was at the Nag's Head, Tothill-street, about half-past two o'clock—Hall came in with two other men—Hall put his hand into his right waistcoat pocket, and pulled out a small yellow watch—in about five minutes the other two prisoners came in—I had seen them before—Clare was dressed as he is now—Cayton went over to Hall, and there was some dispute between them; I cannot say what about—they afterwards all went out of the house together, and the landlord closed the house—Clare and Cayton were not in the house at the time Hall produced the watch—Clare was present when Cayton had the dispute with Hall—I did not see him speak to him—Hall had put the watch into his pocket again when Cayton came in—after they went out, I went out after them—they continued together for thirty or forty yards, till they came to the corner of a court—they there separated, and some went one way and some another—I met a policeman and made a com<lb></lb>munication to him—I met Cayton, in custody of another policeman, is Orchard-street—I had not then heard of the robbery—I was going with the policeman to try and find Hall, because I had seen him about the neighbour<lb></lb>hood in company with none but thieves.</p>

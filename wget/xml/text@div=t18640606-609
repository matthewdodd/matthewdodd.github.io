                  </hi>. I am a labourer—I knew the deceased man Eames—on the evening of 19th April, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was walking along Bell-street, Paddington—I came in front of the Brazen Head public-house—I looked in there, and saw two men named King and Donogan fighting—I saw the prisoner there—he was doing nothing, but sitting on a seat—he came out and went across the road—I saw Eames come out of the Brazen Head shortly after, almost directly—he said something—the prisoner was then on the opposite side of the road, I don't know whether he could bear it—Eames followed the prisoner right across the road, and they both apparently com<lb></lb>menced fighting—they had scarcely commenced fighting when the prisoner hallooed "Police"—I saw them both in a fighting attitude, and saw them strike at each other—Eames returned back to where I was standing, and said he was stabbed—the prisoner went right away as soon as Eames returned back—I believe he went into the beer-shop—Eames did not show me any<lb></lb>thing—I did not see any wound or any blood—he fetched a policeman, and took him into the beer-shop where the prisoner had gone.</p>

Q.</hi> Before you went to the Brazen Head had you been at the Black Man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Eames had been there also, and the prisoner—I did not hear Eames say to the prisoner, "If you come into the public-house I will knock your lights out, you <hi rend="italic">sod</hi>"—I don't know whether the prisoner went away—I did not follow him to the Brazen Head—I don't know whether Eames did—I dare say it was about twenty minutes after<lb></lb>wards when I got to the Brazen Head—Eames was then inside the house, and Murphy also—I did not notice whether he was smoking—I did not see any pipe or anything in his hand—I don't know whether he had anything in his hand or not—when Eames came out Murphy had got across the road—I can't say whether he ran across after him—he walked rather quick—he</p>

               <p>crossed the road towards him—I can't say whether he struck Murphy before he turned round to look at him—Murphy was going right towards the opposite side, right away like—he had his back to him, and was going on at the time—I did not see Eames strike him in that position before be turned round—I could not see which struck first—apparently the front part of Murphy's body was turned towards him, but it was late at night, and I could not see very well—I did not see them on the ground—I could not say one way or the other whether they both fell—I am sure it was Murphy that called out "Police." as far as I could discern his voice—I could not say whether the voice came from a man who was on the ground—it was imme<lb></lb>diately after I heard Murphy call out "Police" that Eames came away from him and returned to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker of 52, Lisson-street—that is right opposite the Brazen Head—on the night in question I was at home looking out of my window—I saw the prisoner come out of the Brazen Head—he stood for a moment on the kerb, on the same side as the public-house—I saw Eames come out of the Brazen Head, I should think hardly a minute afterwards—he rushed at the prisoner in a fighting attitude—the prisoner ran backwards into the road, calling the aid of the police—I saw Eames strike at the prisoner, but I can't say whether he struck him—they closed after that in the middle of the road, and after they separated I thought Eames was stabbed—I saw him put his hand to his side as soon as they separated, and walk away—I had seen the prisoner make an attempt to strike the deceased an under-handed blow—I was not near enough to see whether it touched him—it was in the front part of his body—I never saw either of them on the ground—if they had been I think I should have seen them.</p>

               <p>living at 27, William-street, Lisson-grove. I was at a public-house called the Brazen Head in Lisson-street; the prisoner Murphy was in the public-house, but not in my company. I knew him before, but never had a quarrel with him. When in the public-house I saw him sharpening a knife with a white handle and small blade on his shoe. I heard him say, 'I will run it in,' but I did not hear him mention any name. He left the house, and I followed him outside the door. I said, "Do you mean the knife for me?" he said, 'Yes, or anybody who comes near me,' and he struck at me with the hand in which the knife was; he struck me about the ribs, but did not then wound me; I think the knife closed on his hand. I saw him open the knife. He then stabbed me where I am wounded. I can't say whether he said anything; he ran away. I found I was stabbed, and ran after him. He ran into a beer-shop in Harrow-street I saw a policeman opposite the Brazen Head; I took him into the beer-shop, and pointed out the prisoner. I am quite sure the prisoner is the man who stabbed me. I am sure the knife produced is the one the prisoner stabbed me with." <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner:</hi> "When I followed out of the Brazen Head he was not picking his pipe with his knife. After he made the first blow at me, and before he stabbed me, I hit him a blow on the ear; it was a blow with my fist. It did not knock him down. I met the prisoner at the Rose and Crown on Monday. I took 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from another man, but I did not know it belonged to the prisoner. I did not follow him from the Black Man to the Brazen Head, though I was at the Black Man when he was. I did not say I would pay him.")</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Mary's Hospital—on the night of 19th April the deceased was brought there between 9 and 10—he was in a state of collapse—his clothes were stripped from him, and there was a wound, and a large portion of intestine exposed through the wall of the abdomen—it was a small incised wound about three-quarters of an inch in breadth—the larger blade of this knife would produce such a wound—the direction of the wound was from below upwards, and a little inwards towards the centre of the belly, as if done by an under-handed blow—he was in con<lb></lb>siderable danger, so much so that I sent for the Magistrate to take his deposition—I was present when it was taken—he was then quite sensible—he was under my care until his death, which took place on 7th May—the death was caused by the absorption of matter from the wound—I have no doubt the wound was the cause of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had he lost much blood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—when he came in he was in a weak state from the shock, and continued so—he was a strong muscular man, but he had tubercles on the lungs—he was consumptive—that had nothing to do with his death—his examination was taken about three<lb></lb>quarters of an hour or an hour after he came in—he was put under chloro<lb></lb>form while the bowel was returned, but he had recovered from that and from the collapse when his examination was taken—we could not have replaced the bowel unless we had put him under chloroform, because we had to enlarge the opening to get it into the abdomen again—he lost a slight amount of blood at that time—he was perhaps a quarter of an hour under the chloro<lb></lb>form—his examination was taken immediately afterwards—he had recovered from the effects about a quarter of an hour—I apprehended immediate danger—I don't recollect whether any stimulants were administered to him before he gave his evidence—it would not be the ordinary course—I can't say positively whether any were administered or not—I heard him give his</p>

He said, "You b—<hi rend="italic">sod.</hi> if I get you inside the public-house I will put your lights out." There were three or four of them together, Slater, Tom O'Donnell, and the deceased. I did not go into the Black Man; I went to the Brazen Head, and loft them at the Black Man, and they followed me from the Black Man to the Brazen Head. I came out of the Brazen Head, and had my pipe in my hand, and was taking the stopper out with my knife. Eames followed me across the road, and hit me on the ear, and knocked me down; with that I had my knife in my hand, and my pipe in the other hand. He fell right over me when he knocked me down, and I believe that was the time he received the knife; I made no attempt to stab him.</p>

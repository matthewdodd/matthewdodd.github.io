                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, P</hi> 187). On Monday afternoon, 22d Decem<lb></lb>ber, about half—past 5 o'clock, I was on duty in the Kennington-road, and saw the prisoner driving a cab from London towards the Horns Tavern, at the rate of about ten miles an hour, on his wrong side: the off side—he turned round the corner at the same rate—there is a paved crossing there for foot passengers—he crossed over that sharp against the kerb—the deceased lad was stepping off the kerb with a basket of grocery on his head,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186301050161"></xptr>
               <p>at the moment the horse struck him, knocked him down, and the cab passed over him, quite rolling him over—I did not see the wheel go over him, but the cab passed over him between the wheels, and from the lowness of the wheels it doubled him up—I cannot say whether the horse trod on him—the prisoner continued at the same speed, and I followed, overtook him, and asked him if he was aware he had run over a lad—he said, "D—and b—r the b—y lad; why did not he get out of the way"—I then observed that he was the worse for drink—I made him go back—the lad was lying on the crossing, bleeding from the face—I picked him up, and put him into, the prisoner's cab—I then got in myself and told the prisoner to drive on to St. Thomas's Hospital—he refused to do so though I asked him three times as I was sitting in the cab—I was obliged to put the lad into another cab, with the waterman, to go to the hospital, and I took the prisoner to the station—he appeared quite capable of driving, and could stand very well, but he had been drinking—he was very violent, and was arguing with the people who got round the spot—I went to the hospital the same night, and saw the lad—he gave me his name and address—his face was covered with blood, but I could not see where the wound was.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he also say that it was his fault that he was run over? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not hear him say that it was not the driver's fault—the cab was on its wrong side on the Kennington-road previous to coming to the Horns—the accident happened on the crossing, close to the kerb of the pavement of the Horns Tavern—the cab crossed over the crossing to go down the Westminster-road, on its wrong side—it took the corner too sharply—there is room for three cabs to pass between the cab rank and the kerb, and he was close to the kerb—there ought to have been sufficient space for another vehicle to pass—he was close to the kerb all the way I saw him—I did not notice the boy till the horse struck him—the cab was actually making the turning at the same time that the boy stepped off—the cab and the boy came to the corner at the same time, and just as he was stepping off the kerb it happened—I saw the cab forty or fifty yards before it came up, and it had run about the same distance before I stopped it—I can say that he was driving at greater speed than five miles an hour—I have timed the speed at which cabs travel, but I have not driven them—this was a four-wheeled cab, and a very good horse—I would not say that it was going at less than ten miles an hour—it was certainly more than six miles—I was on the opposite side, against the park palings when the boy was knocked down, and I then ran, with other people, forty or fifty yards down the Westminster-road—I believe the prisoner was as capable of driving as if he had been sober—he got off his cab when he came back to where the lad was—after he refused to drive, a person got on the cab to do so—the prisoner did not call out as soon as he saw an attempt on the part of the boy to step off the pavement—I do not think he saw the boy till the horse struck him—it was all in a moment.</p>

                  </hi>. I was walking home to Clapham on this evening, close to the deceased, on the same side—I saw a cab driving very fast from the corner; nearly ten miles an hour, I should think, and supposing some acci<lb></lb>dent had happened, I ran after the cab, and met Mr. Stebbing coming back it—it went round the corner very last, decidedly faster than it ought,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186301050162"></xptr>
               <p>and the off wheels went on the kerb on the off side of the cab, which made it rock—the wheels actually went on the footway after he turned the corner—I saw the lad put into the cab—the prisoner did not assist in any way—another man was getting up on the box, who said that if the prisoner would not drive he would, but the prisoner seized hold of the reins to prevent him driving—the boy was taken away in another cab—the prisoner was a little in drink, but perfectly able to stand.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> In what direction were you walking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the City towards Clapham on the Horns side—I did not see the boy knocked down—the cab had proceeded twenty or thirty yards from the foot crossing, before the wheels went on the pavement—the foot pavement is about fifteen feet wide there; about the width of the jury-box, or perhaps not so wide—I do not think the kerbstone in very low at that point—I think the foot pavement is all flags, I pass over it every day—I will swear that the kerb is more than three inches high from the gutter—the road was not under<lb></lb>going repair to my knowledge—I cannot Bay whether there were or were not any rough Macadamized stones twenty yards from the crossing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the house-surgeons of St. Thomas's Hospital—the deceased was brought there on 22d December, suffering con<lb></lb>siderably from a shock—there was no fracture to be detected outwardly—the skin of his right eye was just torn off, and there was blood about his fact, which appeared to have come from his nose—I attended him with another medical gentleman, until the evening of the next day, when he died—I made a post mortem examination on the 24th—the small intestines were ruptured, and there was also a small rupture of the liver—all the other organs were healthy—these injuries were quite sufficient to cause death—I have heard the evidence—in my opinion those injuries were likely to be inflicted by being knocked down in the way described.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read as follows</hi>: "What the policeman has said is false; the horse could not go above six or seven miles an hour. The boy was right in the road. I was going very steady, about six or seven miles an hour. I had not got to the crossing. I was nowhere near the crossing, and when the boy fell down I stopped and got off the cab. He was put into my cab, and I was going to take him to the hospital, when a man came and pushed me off the wheel as I was getting up, and said I was drunk and not fit to drive, and he would drive. I took the reins and said he should not, and while we were talking about it he was taken out of my cab and put into another cab. I hallooed two or three times to the boy. I did all I could to pull the horse off. I was very sorry, indeed, of course I did not run over the boy for the purpose. I went next day to the hospital and saw the boy. I said, "You must have heard me holloa." He said, "I did; it was not your fault." He said he had been up two nights at work at his shop. I was not drunk. I had just come from changing horses, it was a pure accident.</p>

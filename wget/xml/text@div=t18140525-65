            . I live at 22, Tottenham-place, Tottenham-court-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been occasionally employed in Mrs. Simmons's, the prosecutrix's house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You remember St. Patrick's day last - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On that evening your mistress was gone to the Theatre - A. Yes; she went about five o'clock, or five minutes past. There was an elderly woman left in the house, a Mrs. Blundell, with me, and nobody else. About seven o'clock, a ring came from the bell; I went into the area, and asked who it was; a woman replied, it was a friend of Betty. (That was a person who had lived there formerly, and had gone away.) I told her Betty had left; she was gone away. She said, she had come to tell her of a place. That woman went away; I then fastened the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Mr. Simmons live - A. No. 30, <placeName id="t18140525-65-crimeloc387">Upper Baker-street</placeName>

Shortly after that woman went away, a double knock came to the door; the old lady was going to answer the door; I run and opened the street door, the hall door; I had a candle in my hand, and the old lady came up with a candle in her hand. When I opened the door, a tall man came up to the door; he asked if Captain 
               <persName id="t18140525-65-person652">Prescott</persName>
             was at home: he was rather tall, with large features, and light eyes; he turned round, and beckoned with his finger; in came two more men directly. The man that first came up, pushed me forward into the parlour. I had shut the windows in the front of the house, but I had not the back. He went and pulled down the back parlour window blinds, so as to prevent me from seeing him. I had two candles in the parlour. I said, my good gentlemen, spare my life; he said, do not speak a word, I will blow your brains out; he pretended to take something from his side. He told me to go with him; I told him, I would do any thing if he would spare my life. He took hold of me, took me into the water-closet, and the old lady he pushed in afterwards. He beckoned with his finger for one of the men to go in with us; which he did. That man took care of us, while the other went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man that remained in the closet with you - A. That man, the prisoner at the bar. They took the candle with them, and left me in the dark. They went down into the pantry, and made a rustling with the plate. They came up stairs, and went out of the door. They went out for a short<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181405250038"></xptr>time, and returned, and came in again, and then they went up stairs. After a considerable time, they went out, and returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go into the garret - A. I do not recollect their going into the garret that time; I believe they went into the garret the next time. I could hear their raftling about the plate; the plate chest was just drawed out to the landing. I said to the an that stood over me, I could not sit any longer. I said, my good gentlemen, spare my life, for the sake of my children; he told me to keep still, and I should not he hurt. In about a quarter of an hour after that, I heard somebody go to the back door; it is a door that leads to the back of the house, into the store room. They went and locked that door, and took the key; it would prevent giving any alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the two men were at the time the back door was locked - A. No; one came and locked the door where we were in. It must be done by somebody in our place.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mistress had a footman who was turned away some time ago - A. Yes. When that was done, they went into the hall; they waited there a few minutes. The man that was along with me, opened the door, put out his head, and said, Jack, look sharp, be quick; I believe he heard the watch at that time go past eight o'clock. In a few minutes after that, the man in the hall said, come along. When I came into the parlour, the chairs were taken out of the parlour, and put into the hall, so as to make it difficult my getting to the hall door. I got out to the back of the house; I gave the alarm to the coachman; he alarmed the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, the candles were lighted when the men came in - A. Yes. It was quite dusk at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the man that stood over you when he put out his head, and said, Jack, look sharp - A. Yes; I took notice that he had a particular way of shewing his teeth when he spoke, and that he was of a fair complexion. I believe the prisoner to be the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. In which way can you swear I am the person -</p>
               <p>Witness. I noticed this man when he opened the door; I noticed he had a particular way of shewing his teeth when he spoke, and the height of the man. I staid by him a full hour.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Gentlemen of the jury, and my lord; I hope you will watch the evidence; there is three hundred pounds reward for the depredation I am charged with. She would swear my life away, and five or six more, for it.</p>
               <p>Witness. I saw him at Bow-street; he spoke very abruptly, he said, he could bring witnesses to prove I was a base woman. At Bow-street, I thought he was the man, and I think so now. The first time the prisoner saw me, he trembled; he could not hold one joint still about him.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know who went out with your husband that evening - A. I saw Lye in company with him about half past seven; my husband was sent for. He went out with Byrne in the evening, about half past five or six.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know with whom he went out with - A. No, I have never known. My husband went out in consequence of a message from a pot-boy. Byrne returned first; I believe he came in about eight o'clock. My husband came in next; he brought nothing in with him. Lye came after my husband; he brought a bundle in something of a tablecloth, or a sheet, I do not know which; it was a bundle containing plate, candlesticks, and several other articles, I do not know what. Wilson came in next. Lye left the room, and went away with my husband, and never opened the bundle. I saw the bundle opened the same evening; it was put into a box.</p>

            . On the 17th of March, I went to the play; on my return home I found I had been robbed; I lost all the articles stated in the indictment of the value of between three and four thousand pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that ear-ring; was that one of the articles that you lost - A. Yes, it was, and the brooch and the pocket; these were two of the articles that I lost. I have looked at the articles; the body linen, they are nine; these ear-rings are mine that Mr. Adkins got of Mrs. King. My house is in the parish of St. Mary-le-bone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am not guilty of the crime that is alleged against me. I have two witnesses to prove that I was at work at the time that burglary was committed. I was at work at eight o'clock in the evening where I had been at work the week before.</p>

               <p>Q. You do not know the number - A. No. He went home to his meals. He was repairing my house.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was the 17th - A. I cannot say. When he went away, I thought by his name he was an Irishman; I said to him and to my wife, I thought he was going to fuddle. He had been fixing a furnace to a copper for me.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not an Irishman - A. No. I thought Lye was an Irish name. On the next day he came and took hold of the copper.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear that he was taken a prisoner - A. About the 19th of the said month, on the 19th of March; I then went to Cold-bath-fields prison, and several places, and could not learn; at last they told me it was for breaking into a house in Baker-street. I saw him at Marlborough-street get out of a coach. I cannot say when that was; it might be a week after.</p>
               <p>COURT. On the 19th of March, you said he was apprehended - A. No, sir. I did not mean that; it was several days after; I cannot recollect how many. It was on the 17th of March, he was at work at my house, and he went away about a quarter before eight. I will stick to that.</p>

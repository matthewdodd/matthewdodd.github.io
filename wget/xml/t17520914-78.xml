            . I am sister to Ann Mc Lane. I was at my own door, which is about six or seven yards from her door, about seven o'clock in the evening, August the fifth. The prisoner came down the yard and asked if any sailors lived in that place. I being a sailor's wife, said, there was, and asked him who he wanted; he said, he could not tell; that there were three men that day at the Exchange, from that place, and he was come to ship them; then I directed him to my sister's house, as there were sailors lodged there. He went there, her door and window were open. I found he did not come back, then I looked out and saw my sister in her chamber over the lower room. I called to her, and said, did you see the man that wanted you? She said, no, What man? Then I saw him jump from towards her drawers, in the lower room, to the out side of the door.</p>

            . They are better than two yards from it. She came down and talked to him. I saw his pocket of some bulk, so I lifted up the pocket-slap and saw the shirt. He insisted upon going before a justice without any officer, and threatened me for robbing him of the shirt. We took him before a justice ; there he said, I was at work upon it, followed him and put it in his pocket, in order to swear a robbery against him.</p>

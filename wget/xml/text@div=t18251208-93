I was returning home about one o'clock, on the 14th of November, and met the prisoner about fifteen yards from my house with an umbrella, which I thought I knew to be mine; I ran home, and asked if one had been sold. I then pursued, and when I came up to him, I took him by the collar and said,"That is my umbrella." He said he had bought it. I said, he should go with me. He then took me by the collar, and we walked about ten yards, when he attempted to strike me, and got away. I pursued him - he was taken in my sight. I am certain he is the man, and this is my umbrella.</p>

            . On the 14th of November I was going through Little May's-buildings, and heard the cry of Stop thief! - I saw the prisoner walking very fast up Bedfordbury. I took him by the collar - he said, "It is not me, let me go." The prosecutor then came up, and said, "Don't let him go, 'till I get a constable." When the prosecutor was gone - he asked, if I was a constable. I said - No. He said I had no right to collar him, and attempted to strike me. Gill came up and took him.</p>

I purchased this umbrella opposite the Horse Guards for 2s., and I told the prosecutor where I bought it - he said, if I would give it up, he would not do any thing to me. He took me by the collar, and I said, I would not be collared by him, or any man but an officer.</p>

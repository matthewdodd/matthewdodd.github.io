                  </hi>. I live with my sister, Mrs. Sarah Thornhill, in the parish of West Ham, Essex. There is an orchard at the side of the house, between it and a row of houses, called the Printers'-buildings—the nearest house of that row is about a hundred yards off—they face West Ham-lane—there is a passage down the side, along the back, and up the middle of the houses, with a wall about eight feet high—on Saturday night, the 24th of June, I went to bed about half-past ten o'clock—the house was then safe—I was awoke by the policeman, about twenty minutes or half-past two—I found the back door open, and a hole bored into it, about the size of a quil—the door was not forced open—it was opened from the inside—some tiles were taken off the roof of the back kitchen, and a hole cut through the ceiling, by which a person could get through—the back kitchen communicates with the cellar, and we had lately had some bottles of Marsala, and spirits in stone jars placed in the cellar—when I came down in the morning I went with the policeman into the orchard—it was just getting light—we saw some tracks, and followed them—they led to a corner of the wall opposite the Printers', buildings, and by the side of that wall in the orchard I found about three dozen of wine in bottles, a loin of veal, some gooseberry-pies, and the princi<lb></lb>pal contents of the larder—on the wall were some bottles of wine in a basket of ours, which had been in the back kitchen—we lost the tracks at that place—I afterwards examined the cellar, and missed from it four gallons of brandy, and four gallons of gin, in four stone bottles, and about a dozen and a half of wine besides the quantity we recovered in the orchard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at No. 3, Printers'-buildings, with Mrs. Craske, my aunt. It is the last house but two before you get to the orchard surrounding Mr. Vooght's house—Mr. Craske was out on Saturday night, and did not come home till between one and two o'clock on the Sunday morning—about that time my aunt told me something—I went to the back window, and saw a person on the wall surrounding Mr. Vooght's house—he remained there a great while, it seemed to me—it was not half an hour, but I was so frightened at the time, I cannot recollect—he was sitting right on the wall, and I could see his arm keep going over the wall backwards and forwards, as if he was taking something over—I believe that man was Wilks—I had seen him once or twice before as he passed the door—I do not know where he lived—he got down in front of the wall—his face was then turned sideways to me—I have</p>

                  </hi>. I am police-sergeant at Plaistow-station. On the 29th of June, in consequence of information, I searched Barker's house—I found nothing—I afterwards went into the privy—we had the place opened, and emptied, and in the dirt found eleven bottles, all broken but three—I have the bottoms and tops—in the necks of three of these bottles I found corks, which I have here—there was some wire on the top of two of the bottles—I searched Brock well's house, which is next door but one to Barker's—(Barker's is 25, Brockwell's, 27,)—I searched the privy in the same manner as Barker's, and found the paunches of two lambs, three bottles, and the neck of a fourth—there were no corks in those—they were all broken—I took Barker and Brockwell into custody on the morning of the 6th of July, in a house in Keate's-court, Thrawl-street, Whitechapel—I had been searching for them be<lb></lb>fore, but could not see them till then—they were in bed together—I searched the bed, and found a stock, three centre-bits, and a small chisel, between the bed and the sacking—Barker and Brockwell used to work at Mr. Tucker's—I had been there and inquired, and could not find them there—in taking them to the station, handcuffed together, Barker said, "You would not have found us if you had not been told"—he also said, he supposed we had taken them for a robbery on account of their running away, and he said, Mr. May, my mate, seemed very merry at a poor fellow being transported—May was with me—these are the three bottles I found—I also produce a stone jar, which I got from Mardell—I also produce some pads which I saw May take out of a pair of stockings in Keate's-ceurt—they are used by housebreakers to walk lightly on the floor.</p>

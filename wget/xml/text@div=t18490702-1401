My father is now dead; his name was William Collard—my brother's name is Frederick Thomas—we lived at 82, Castle-street, in the parish of St. Marylebone—the prisoner was in our service from 17th March to 1st April—my father was ill when she came, but not confined to his bed—on 1st April, he was in a helpless state—the prisoner heard the physician say that day that he was irrecoverable—my brother's watch was in the kitchen; my father's watch was on the mantel-piece in his room—the prisoner was in the habit of going in and out of his room, occasionally—between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning—she said she would run to my aunt's with a pair of slippers that had been left—I desired her not to go with them, but she did go, though she was told not about five or six times—about an hour and a half afterwards the two watches were missed—on her return, in consequence of what passed in reference to something else, she was given into custody—about a fortnight ago Mr. Humberstone gave me information—I went to his lodgings, and he showed me the watch—in consequence of what Humberstone said, the prisoner was again taken into custody—no one had access to the property except our own family and the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer, and lodge at 4, Queen-street, Oxford-street.

             (Police-constable G 172). I was in Chiswell-street on the 10th of September; the prisoner was pointed out to me by the prosecutor - she denied the charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of the robbery, and had not been out of doors that evening - he stated that he had been with two females, one of whom is here; I had never seen him in my life before last Monday, when I was taken - he had others taken.</p>

            . On the 30th of June I was walking down the City-road with Sarah-Edwards; the prosecutor came up and spoke to us - he was very much in liquor, and asked us to take a glass of any thing to drink; we walked to the Castle public-house, and had a glass of wine each - he went with as to Edwards door and there said he would go home with me for the night - I would not let him; I went home, and about one o'clock I heard a knock at my door - I got up, and then saw the prosecutor and three Policemen; one of them put his light before my face, and the prosecutor said he was sure I was the girl; they came in and turned out my drawers - then he said it was not me, it was a fairer girl.</p>

               <p>HENRY FRASER. The Policeman went in search of the prisoner, and they would search the house, but I said Baker was not the girl.</p>

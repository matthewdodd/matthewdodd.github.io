                  </hi>. I was walking home from Pimlico, about one o'clock in the morning, on the 30th of July, through St. James's-park—the prisoner stopped me, and wanted me to go with her—I said I was tired, and I was going home—she got before me, and I found her hand in my trowsers pocket—I had a purse there, containing two half-crowns, ten shillings, and a half-sove<lb></lb>reign, and some other silver—I took her hand out, took my money away from that pocket, and put it into my coat pocket—I then went to button my coat up, and the money and purse were missing—my coat pocket was not buttoned—the pocket was in front—it was a Chesterfield coat—I felt for my money, and it was gone—the prisoner saw the constable coming up—she sat down, and the money was found under the seat where she was sitting—I was not sitting with her—in a minute or so, two or three other girls came up—the pri<lb></lb>soner could get her hand into my pocket without my seeing it—it was rather dark—this is my purse.</p>

I saw the prosecutor and pri<lb></lb>soner standing together for about a minute—the prosecutor then complained—I saw another female about twenty yards off, and, knowing her to be an associate of the prisoner, I went across to the prisoner, and she sat down on the seat—I said to the prosecutor, "You had better be very careful, the sooner you leave the better"—he felt his pocket, and said he had lost his purse—the prisoner was sitting on the seat—I made her get up—she said, "I have not got it"—I felt again under the seat, and found the purse—the prosecutor said, "If it is mine there is a little key attached to it, and there is money in each end"—I picked it up, and there was only money in one end, which was two half-crowns and three shillings—in her way to the station she made a pre<lb></lb>tence to throw money away, but I only found one sixpence—some of her companions came up.</p>

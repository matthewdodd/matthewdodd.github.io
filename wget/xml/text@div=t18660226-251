I live in the East India-road—on 9th February, about 5 o'clock, I was at the corner of Leadenhall-street, waiting for an omnibus—I felt a tug at my pocket—the officer said, "Have you lost any<lb></lb>thing?"—I said, "Yes; my purse"—he was holding the boy—I saw my purse drop from him—the officer picked it up, and showed it to me—there was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it, and a gold<lb></lb>ring, value thirty shillings—it was safe in my pocket just before.</p>

Q.</hi> Had you been into a shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, into a jeweller's shop, but I did not take my purse out there, as I did not buy anything—I went in to order a ring—I had my hand in my pocket, and my purse in it at the corner where I was waiting—I have the same pocket on now—it is very high up, I do no know how the boy could get at it, my hand went into my pocket glove and all—I do not think a double hand would go in—I will pledge my solemn oath that I saw my purse on the ground—I felt so nervous at having lost my purse that I could hardly say whether the con<lb></lb>stable came up from before or behind—I said nothing to the ladies with me before the policeman came up, about feeling anything at my pocket, because it was done in a moment, and they were standing a little way in on account of the rain.</p>

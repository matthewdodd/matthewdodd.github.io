On 19th December I took the prisoner at Willoughby Villa, Upper Norwood—I told her the charge, she said that Newton was married before he married her, that she had seen him three times since the marriage, but that it had never been consummated—I produce certified copies of two marriage certificates, one dated 25th May, 1857, and the other 20th May, 1871, on which date the prisoner is described as a widow.</p>

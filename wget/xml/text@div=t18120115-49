On the 14th he did not come to work again, for which I went to the office of the sitting magistrate at Guildhall, the first person that I recognised was the prisoner at the bar, he was in custody; he told me the officer had seized his trunk; I then went to an adjoing room, I there saw the trunk; I looked into the trunk, in it was cloves, ginger, nutmegs, bees-wax, Spanish juice, rbubarb, and two bags, one of them I believe had been in my warehouse; that bag had been invoiced under that mark into my house; I was convinced the articles belonged to me, and in examining the bottom of the box I found two pieces of rhubarb, they are split with an axe for the customer to see the quality; I have two pieces that match them in grain and quality. I value the rhubard at one shilling and sixpence and the bag at three shillings.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on Tuesday the 14th of this month at the house where he lodged in Charlotte-court in Redcross-street; I asked him whose trunk that was; the prisoner said it was his: he produced the key and opened it; there was no wearing apparel in it; it contained a bag with a quantity of ginger, bees-wax, juice, nutmegs, and two small parcels of mace; he told me that he bought them of a man, he gave three pounds sixteen shillings for them; he said the man was gone for a soldier, and that the man had brought them from Lambeth, and put them in the trunk himself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a footman in the service of Mr. Whitmore, M. P. for Bridgnorth, of 68, Eaton Place—I was a servant there on the 6th July—the prisoner called on that day about twenty or twenty-five minutes past one—the visitors' bell rang soon afterwards—I answered when the prisoner came—he asked me if Mr. Whitmore was at home, and I told him he was not—he asked mo if Mrs. Whitmore was at home, and I said, "Yes"—he said he wanted the address of Mr. Bluck, a friend of Mr. Whitmore's, if Mrs. Whitmore would see him—I asked his name, and he said Captain Marden—he came into the hall—I shut the door and went up to Mrs. Whitmore—she told me the address—she was in the drawing-room—I returned into the hall and gave the prisoner the address, 21, Upper Rane<lb></lb>lagh Street—when I gave him the address he said, "Thank you, good day, good day," got into a Hansom cab which was waiting at the door, and drove off—I had laid out the things in the dining-room that morning—I put some spoons and forks and a quantity of other silver on a side table, which is opposite the dining-room door, and which was open—any one in the hall could see the silver on the table quite plain—after the prisoner had gone the visitors' bell rang—I cannot exactly say how long after, it might be a quarter of an hour—I then found the street door open and a servant at the door—I went into the dining-room after a short time, and missed some ladles, forks, spoons, and several other things, which I had left in the dining-room—I gave the alarm to Mrs. Price, the lady's-maid—she went upstairs to the drawing-room—the next time I saw the prisoner was at Westminster Police Station—before I went to the station I had seen a photograph—I could not identify it—I said I could not swear to it—there were six or eight persons standing with the prisoner—I pointed him out at once—I have not the least doubt that he is the man who called on that morning.</p>

                  </hi> (Policeman 26 B). I went with Inspector Rhodes, on 18th July, between two and three o'clock, to Stead's, in Frith Street, in plain clothes, and waited there till the prisoner came—I told him I was an officer, and asked him to tell me where he got the diamond ear<lb></lb>rings from—he said, "I bought them of a Mr. Hunt, at Debenbam and Storr's auction rooms, last Monday"—I said, "I should like to know who Mr. Hunt is"—he said, "I do not know his exact address; if you will accompany me to Mr. Walton's, in Edward Street, I shall be there able to ascertain where Mr. Hunt now lives, as he has latterly changed his address"—I said, "I am an officer; you tell me where you got the ear<lb></lb>rings, as they are stolen property"—he said, "Where from?"—I said "From 68, Eaton Place"—I went with him to Walton's oilshop, Edward Street, Wardour Street—he walked in first, and went and stood by the front of the counter where customers stand—Mr. Walton was on the other side of the counter—the prisoner said, "Will you give me the address of Mr. Hunt, that I bought some things of before? You know Mr. Hunt the one I mean," placing his stick on the counter sharp, making a rattle as he laid it down, and leaving it lying there—Mr. Walton took a red book down and looked for Mr. Hunt's address, and just as he had got the book open</p>

               <p>the prisoner said, "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, I want to speak to you"—he had shifted his position then to the end of the counter—there was a young man standing there, who, I think, spoke to him—there were some oil casks there, and the prisoner turned round and went through a trap door, leading into the cellar—it was a hole in the floor, but there was no trap to it—I went after him as quick as possible down the hole, but it was all darkness—I could not see my hand before me, but I heard a door shut, as if somebody was going out above me—I groped about for some time and found I was kicking against bottles, and a dog was flying at my heels—I called for a light, which a was brought, and with the assistance of a sergeant I searched about, but could not find the prisoner—the cellar leads from under Mr. Walton's house to the next house, and there is a sort of passage which leads under the next shop, a tobacconist's, and into his shop—there is a regular thoroughfare out there to 95, Wardour Street—I found that the prisoner had gone—I went in the evening with Inspector Rhodes to Wellington Terrace, St. John's Wood—I was there in police clothes and dressed quite differently—I saw the prisoner talking to a man—I walked up to him with Rhodes, put my on his shoulder, and said, "Good morning, Mr. George"—Rhodes laid hold of him on the other side, and he turned round very indignantly and said, "My name is not Mr. George, it is Mr. Collins"—I said, "You are the same Mr. George as got away from me to-day at Mr. Walton's, but there is no trapdoor here"—he said, "I left you for the purpose of finding the man I bought the diamond rings of"—I took him in custody—he said that he felt very uncomfortable, as he could not find Mr. Hunt, and that was the reason he escaped from me—I told him I felt equally uncomfortable at his escape—he gave his name at the station George Johnson, a commission agent—Rhodes searched him, and found a quantity of keys and duplicates, and a photograph.</p>

I was with Brooker when the prisoner was taken to the station—he gave his name, "Johnson, 11, Wellington Terrace, St. John's Wood"—several articles were found on him, and I think twelve duplicates, one of which (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in the name of Martin, for a cigar case pledged for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at 196, Store Street; the others were for two rings pledged for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the name of Mrs. Mary Howard, Sep<lb></lb>tember, 1865; also three in the name of Johnson, and a pawnbroker's agreement for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the name of Johnson—I found the photograph on him which I showed to Cook and the other servants—I went to his house, and among other things found a card-plate with the name of Johnson, and some cards printed from it; also a pocket-book with the name of Martin written in it containing betting transactions—I also found this instrument for opening doors.</p>

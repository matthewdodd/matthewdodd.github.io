I have known Zimmermann about two years—I knew him on 4th April, 1861—he has been in an office at Bush-lane, under the name of Wilkinson and Co.—I knew his name was Zimmermann, because he told me how to do with this cheque—I don't recollect having signed a cheque at Walsingham-place, it is such a long time ago—I remember this cheque—I got it from Zimmermann—he gave it to me the same day before I received the goods—he was standing at the corner of the street, waiting for me, when I went to Messrs. Atkinson's, and when I went to hire the rooms at Walsingham-place he was walking up and down about a comer till I came back—he treated me with a glass of spirits, and told me how to write a cheque, as I did not know what the cheque was—it is signed in the name of Richard—I do not know how I came to sign that name—Zimmermann told me to write Richard—he went back with me at half-past 3 to Walsingham-place—I believe I wrote on a piece of paper something as a reference—I was obliged to do what Zimmermann told me—the cabman helped the goods into the cab at Walsingham-place—Zimmermann was there, but he stayed a little out of the way—he got into the cab about ten minutes afterwards, and we went over to a public-house at Walworth—a little man assisted to take the goods out of the cab for a couple of pence—Zimmermann was with me when the goods were being taken out—we afterwards went in another cab, which Zimmer-mann hired and I paid for it—there was a parcel of curtains put into the cab—we took it to Greek-street, Soho, after 4 o'clock, after the pawnbroker had refused to take them in—both of us went to Greek-street—I gave all the tickets to Zimmermann, and he took them to his office—he gave me some of the money—we got 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Greek-street.</p>

I took Traumann into custody, and afterwards took Zimmermann—I told him that I charged him, with a friend of his, whom I had in custody, for conspiring to obtain goods from several houses in the West-end—he first said he did not do it—I said, "You did do it j because Traumann told me that he got the cheque from you"—I asked him where the cheque-book was—he said, "I have not got it"—I said, "Where is it?"—he said, "My clerk absconded with it"—I then asked him if he had got the tickets of some things that were pledged two or three days ago—he said, "No,"—I said, "You had them"—he said, "I sold them "—I said "Two duplicates for things obtained from Messrs.

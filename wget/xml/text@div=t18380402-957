                  </hi>. I live in Wellington-street, St. John's Wood-road, Marylebone. The prisoner married my sister, Elizabeth Fortescue Taylor, in the 1st of September, 1834, at Marylebone church—I was present at the marriage—they lived together after that a short time—she is alive now—I saw her yesterday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the mother of the last witness. What he has said with respect to the marriage is quite correct—I went to know the reason why the prisoner was going to leave my daughter, but I did not wish to take her away—she did not wish to go herself, and her father, my brother-in-law, and I went, and the prisoner said so help him Jesus God he would not live with heir—he did not state why—I said he should provide a home for her—he said, she might go on the town, and be d—d, she liked.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Mrs. Harper's, Clerkenwell-green. I was married on the 6th of January, 1835, to the prisoner at Limehouse—he lived with me till four weeks on Monday last, and then called a broker, and sold all my things, and left me destitute with my child in the streets—I have one child by him.</p>

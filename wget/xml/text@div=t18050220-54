               <p>Q. Is there any private mark on them? - A. One has got my name on it, the other has not; I believe them both to be mine; they are both the same sort of boys hats that I lost that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in charge when you went to him? - A. Yes; the prisoner signified then that a woman gave them to him, and she was to give him something for pawning them.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the two hats? - A. Two shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming from my work with my tools on my shoulder; I met a woman that asked me to pawn these things, and she said she would give me a shilling, so I went into this pawnbroker's shop to pawn them, and he said he would not take any hats in to pawn.</p>

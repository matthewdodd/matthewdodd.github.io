            . I live in Bride-court, Bridge-street; it comes into Bride-lane. Pearson lives in my house now; I have known him for about twelve months - I do not know the prisoner. On Sunday, the 16th of December, about half-past five o'clock, Pearson called on me; he knocked at the door, and looked pretty nearly covered with blood, which came from his face and arm - I am sure blood came from a wound in his face; he was not intoxicated, but it appeared that he had been - I got him some water to wash himself; he had his arm in a handkerchief for a fortnight- the next day the prisoner came to me, and asked if the prosecutor was at my house; I told her he was not, but I expected him in every minute, and asked her how she came to use the man as she did, and cut him about; she said she wanted to murder him, and was very sorry she had not done so - the prosecutor had been living at my house once before, but not with her; she went away - she did not appear influenced by liquor.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you married? A. Yes; my husband lives with me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the prosecutor had compelled her to resort to prostitution for his support- that on the day in question he came home intoxicated; she endeavoured to leave the room, in order to avoid him, but he prevented her, and a scuffle ensued, during which she took up the knife and struck him with it, unconscious of what she was doing.</p>

            . I am a widow, and live in Aylesbury-place, Bream's-buildings-Chancery-lane. I have known the prisoner some time; I always thought she and the prosecutor were man and wife - she always conducted herself with that propriety that I always considered she was; the prosecutor called at my house on the Friday preceding the Sunday this happened; they had been separated for three weeks, and he said they had been together again for three weeks - he said he was going to send her down to her mother, who lives a little way out of town; and on the Sunday morning in question she called on me, and inquired if Pearson had been with me since last night- I said I had not seen him; she came to me on Monday, and said she had cut him; I understood they had quarrelled about his being out all night and all day on Sunday, and words ensued - I said to her, "Why not go out of the room?" she said she was going, and he laid hold of her by the throat, and he would not let her - I never saw her otherwise than mild and good tempered.</p>

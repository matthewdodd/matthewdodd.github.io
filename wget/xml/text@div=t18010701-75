             sworn. - I am a watchman, near the Thatched-house, Islington: On the 24th of May, about ten o'clock at night, I observed two men standing under a high garden fence, where there were a great many nettles; I stopped with my lanthorn, and one of them pretended to stoop down to ease himself, and the other stood by; I met my brother watchman, I told him to go round the other side of the row, and I would meet him, and see what they were doing; then they went away. About half past three o'clock in the morning, I saw two men; one of them took a copperpot from out of the nettles, and put it upon his shoulder; they went towards the Rosemary Branch; I desired a young man to watch them, and I would go round another way; I went to my partner, and we pulled our coats off, and went after them; we overtook them about thirty or forty yards from the

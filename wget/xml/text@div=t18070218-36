            . - Mr. Knapp. You are a patrole. - A. Yes. On the 3d of February last I was on duty in Kingsland road; about eight o'clock in the evening, as I was passing by the King's arms, I saw the prisoner with a sack hanging over his shoulder, part of the oats were behind in the sack and part before. I asked him what he had got there; his answer was, what was that to me, I asked him where he was going, he said to the Lamb. We took him into the King's arms, there he said he had them from where he was at work at Hornsey; I looked at the sack; I told Bacon, a brother officer all was right; Bacon said you work for Mr. Willan do not you; he then said yes; and these are Mr. Willan's oats, he said yes. I searched him, I found the key of Mr. Willan's stable door; I took him in custody, the sack was turned inside out, there is Mr. Willan's name upon it.</p>

            . - Mr. Knapp. I believe you are bailiff to Mr. Willan, look at that sack. - A. It is Mr. Willan's, and to the best of my judgment the oats are the same as Mr. Willan's; the prisoner worked for Mr. Willan.</p>
               <p>- BACON. I saw this man walking in the middle of the road, the other officer took hold of him; we took him into the King's arms. Avory had some knowledge of the man's face, he says you work for Mr. Willan, do not you. he says yes; I said these are Mr. Willan's oats, he said yes, first he said he had bought the oats at Hornsey.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told them that it was Mr. Willan's bag. I found the oats in the road.</p>

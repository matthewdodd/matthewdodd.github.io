                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, of Katharine-street, in the parish of St. Anne's, Limehouse—on Sunday morning 24th June, a little after twelve, I went to bed leaving my premises perfectly secure—about half-past two I heard a rattling in the shop; went there, and saw the prisoner and another man, whose back was towards me, in the back room, trying to escape out of my window—the other, one was getting out, and the prisoner seemed waiting to go after him; but only one could go at a time—they had to get on to a chest of drawers to get through the window—I went to the front door and gave an alarm—I followed the prisoner up Katharine-street into Rossiter-street—he stopped at the corner and threw some boots out of his pocket—I picked up one pair—it was a bright clear morning—he struggled, but I got assistance and gave him in custody—I found my par<lb></lb>lour window broken—it had been fastened by a latch with wire-work over it—there were sixty-one pairs of boots lying about the room which had been taken from the window; and the till was lying on the counter—I missed 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of coppers and this silver dagger (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had a candle in my hand and could see distinctly.</p>

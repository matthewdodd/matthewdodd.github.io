            . I live with Mr. Sinclair, who is a pastry-cook, and lives in Gracechurch-street. On the 23d of December, the prisoner came to the shop about five o'clock in the afternoon, threw down 1 s., and took up two 1 d. buns. I gave her change, and put the shilling with five or six others in the till. The one she paid me was quite new, the rest were all dirty. Stephens came in, and I gave him the same shilling.</p>

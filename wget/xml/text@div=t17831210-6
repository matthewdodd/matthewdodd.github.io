               <p>Did he do so? - Yes, he is here. We stopped on the Common about half and hour, then we went on three horses to the Red Lion, at the bottom of the hill; in about half an hour the postboy returned, and said the man was secured upon which I went back.</p>

               <p>Are you a London post-boys? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What inn did you came from? - The Swan-yard, in Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>What time in the evening might you set out with these gentlemen? - When we went by Oxford Chapel the clock struck four, we were stopped about a quarter of a mile on this side the eight mile stone; we got there in less than an hour.</p>
               <p>Court. What parish is that? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>In what manner was your chaise stopped? - He came up to the chaise, I heard somebody speak, I thought it was a gentleman that wanted to speak to Sir William, I saw a pistol in his hand, I heard him cry stop, I stopped directly.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough for you to see his countenance? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The gentlemen were robbed, were not they, as you believe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could you see the highwayman's face at the time he was the chaise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that the man? - That is the man.</p>
               <p>Then you must look back - I did.</p>
               <p>He took nothing from either of you post-boys? - No.</p>
               <p>Which way did he go? - To London as fast as he could gallop.</p>
               <p>Had he a good horse under him? - A very poor horse.</p>
               <p>I suppose you took the best of your horses to pursue him? - I took the horse I rode, and I pursued him; Sir William desired, me to pursue him.</p>
               <p>What coloured horse did the highwayman ride? - A grey mare.</p>
               <p>How soon might it be before you overtook him? - I overtook him in the space of a mile, at the Green Man, he walked up the hill, and I kept sight of him about 2 or 300 yards behind; I had no pistols.</p>
               <p>How soon did you venture to got up with him? - When he came to Highgate, I got as near, him as I could, then I hallooed stop thief, I was got up the hill opposite the Bull there were three men going through Highway on horseback they tried to stop him but did not, he kept going down the Holloway mad, and when he came about half way down the hill, I was obliged to run my horse up against a waggon, or else I must have gone by him; my horse went so fast I could not stop him: I then heard two reports of a pistol. I was then about fifty or sixty yards from him; after that I got close to him and met with a horse patrol, and he would not assist me; I called to him to assist me, and told him of it, and he would not; there happened to be two gentlemen on the road one going to London and the other to Whetstone, one Mr. Dalton and one Mr. Cooper and they insisted on the patrol coming to assist me; with that the patrol came up and said to the gentlemen, that it was a false report; then the highwaymen came forword, and he and the patrol and me were all side by side, I thought he was going to catch hold of us; the patrol had arms. Then the patrol went back again and would not assist me; the gentlemen went about their business I told him I would not want any assistance if he would lend me his hanger; the patrol<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100027"></xptr> would not; then the prisoner rode away from me for the space of eight or ten minutes; the patrol went and sent three men but he never came himself: then the prisoner was taken.</p>
               <p>Who took the prisoner? - I am not sure whether I caught hold of the reins first, or whether the patrol did.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner make any resistance? - No, my Lord, he begged the favour of them to let him ride on his horse; he was taken to the Half Moon at Holloway, we took him off the horse and he walked.</p>
               <p>Was he searched there? - Yes, we found two gold watches and a purse; we searched him after he got into the room.</p>
               <p>What were the two firings that you heard? - He fired first at the watchmen, and then the watchman fired at him.</p>
               <p>You swear the prisoner is the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. It seems to me a little extraordinary, that as he had fired at the watchman and the watchman had fired at him, that he did not make the best of his way to town? - He made the best of his way, but his horse would not go.</p>

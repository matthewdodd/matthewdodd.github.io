            . I am carter to Mr. Agnes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 24th of February you had a load of flour to Mr. Skirven - A. Yes, of Grub-street; I fell into Grub-street; I saw a baker's shop, I enquired; I saw a man at the door of the baker's shop, that was the prisoner, he read the note and said it was right, he took the flour in.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoner, are you sure that is the man - A. Yes, that is the man. I asked him for a note to take back; he said, there is no occasion for one. I went back to my master; I carried back the empty sacks, I had no doubt it was all right. The prisoner took the the note out of my hand, and said it was right, and took the flour in.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure the prisoner told you it was right are you - A. Yes; I am sure he read the note and said it was all right.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Agnes. What was the note that you sent - A. I wrote not to send the money by the carter, to stop till I came to town, I would come for it; it was directed to Mr. Skirven, 95, Grub-street; it was a sealed note.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there your place of abode on the note - A. Yes, on the inside. My name was not on the cart, it was on the sacks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There are several people that I dealt with had sacks of the same mark.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never employ a factor to sell my flour, and my place of abode was on the sack.</p>
               <p>COURT. Have you ever been paid for it - A. No. I came up about a month after the flour was delivered, and went to Mr. Skirven, and when I came there I was very much surprised that the flour was not delivered; Mr. Skirven said I should not wondor if it has gone to that swindler Brown's; I went down there, I saw the house was shut up, I rattled at the door, which caused a person to look out of the window; I went in the premises after that, and saw the sacks there.</p>

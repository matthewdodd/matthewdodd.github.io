                  </hi>. I live at 123, Wentworth Street, with my brother Michael Lewi, as poultry dealers—about 3.30 a.m. on Sunday, 6th Sep<lb></lb>tember, I heard a sound at the window; I looked and lay down again—I afterwards got up and saw the prisoner's head, and his hands were put to open the yard door leading into the shop—I halloaed out "There is a thief here"—I heard him run away—the window was broken by the prisoner.</p>

I saw the prisoner running out of the house and the last witness running after him in his shirt calling out "Stop thief"—I gave chase for 500 yards, overtook him, and brought him back to the house—I searched him—I found nothing on him—I found the window broken, and the parlour and outside doors open—I found a scrubbing brush wrapped up in a shirt, and pieces of glass on it—a passage runs by the side of the prosecutor's house—I there saw the prisoner running.</p>

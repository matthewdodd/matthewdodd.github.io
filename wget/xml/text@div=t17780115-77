I was in a chariot with Mr. Stanley. One was on a grey horse, and the other on a dark brown; the prisoner was on my side; one of them ordered the coachman to stop; one shot at the coachman first; the prisoner held a pistol to me, and the other held a pistol to Mr. Stanley; they demanded our money; I believe I gave the prisoner seven or eight shillings, or more; then he demanded my watch; I would not give it him, but jump'd out of the chariot, and struck at his horse, upon which he fired at me, and shot me in the arm.</p>
               <p>Was that man taken? - He was taken three or four days after.</p>
               <p>Could you swear to that man? - Yes, very safe. I am positive the prisoner is the man by his face and his size; he had a furtout coat on; I believe it was rather of a brown colour. I did not see him for four or five days, or a week, after he was taken; I was sick at home; when I saw him, I recollected his face immediately; I believe I had seen him before at Whetstone; he rode the grey horse; he had taken Mr. Stanley's watch, but I did not choose to give him mine.</p>
               <p>On Mr. Bishop's Cross Examination he said, it was light enough for him to discern the face of the prisoner from any other man; that he did not observe his dress, but believed he had a round flap'd hat, and that he (the witness) was perfectly sober.</p>

               <p>I was in company with Mr. Bishop on the 19th of December; we were stopped by two men; one came on one side of the carriage, the other on the other; they bid my coachman stop two or three times; before he did, they said, if he did not they would blow his brains out; we let the glasses down and one clap'd a pistol to me, the other clap'd a pistol to Mr. Bishop.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the man on Mr. Bishop's side? - No; I had enough to do to take care of the man on my own side.</p>

On the 1st of May, about seven o'clock in the evening, this boy stole a piece of print; I was taking the prints in from the door, it being late; I had taken about twenty pieces in, and came out for the remainder, and saw the prisoner at the bar, with a piece under his arm, about a yard from the pile; I asked him what he was doing; he said, he was only looking at the print; I told him it was a rum way of looking at it. I laid hold of him, and took him into the shop, and Mr. Jones sent for an officer. He put his hand into his pocket, and pulled something out, opened his hand, it was a pound note, which I kept. The officer searched him, and found nothing on him, except a few halfpence.</p>

               <p>The humble petition of Hugh Farrell. Your petitioner is a boy only ten years of age, and by unfortunate associations with bad characters, has been led into the paths of vice; desirous of reclaiming his lost character, he applied to the refuge for the destitute, but he was too young to be admitted; therefore was again obliged to have recourse to his former viciory companions</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time lose thirteen pounds weight of beef - A. I did, on the the 4th of February; I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150063"></xptr>outside of the shop at the time; my wife called to me and told me that a woman had stolen some meat; I stopped her in the act of carrying it away; it was near twelve o'clock on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed her about the shop that evening - A. Yes; when I caught her, I recollected her face; she had got her arm round it, and a cloak to cover it as well as she could; she is a <rs id="t18090215-131-deflabel760" type="occupation">single woman</rs>

               <p>Q. What did she say when you stopped her - A. She said she was not going to take it; she set herself down on the stones; I was determined, by knowing of her, that she should go to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>MRS. MUCKLOW. I was standing in the shop; I saw the prisoner come to the stall; she did not see me, my husband was near to her; she looked at him, his back was towards her, she immediately took the beef, put it under her right arm and turned away; I called out to my husband and told him to stop her. I sent for the constable.</p>

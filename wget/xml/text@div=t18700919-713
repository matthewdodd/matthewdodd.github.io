                  </hi>. On 2nd September I went with Miller, Holder, and other officers to the White Horse beer-shop, Wheeler Street, near the Eastern Counties Railway, about 7.15, and saw the prisoner standing at one end of the bar, with another man—Miller and Holder seized him by each arm, and Miller took four small packets from his coat pocket—they con<lb></lb>tained coins, with paper lapped between them in the usual way; two packets were taken from another coat pocket, sealed and fastened—I opened them; they contained ten florins—this bad half-crown (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) projected from his hand—two good florins, a sixpence, and a penny, all good, were taken from his trowsers pocket—I said "Huxley, my name is Brannan, I have received instructions from the Solicitor to the Treasury to look after you as a dealer in counterfeit coin; we come here with a search-warrant, signed by the Magistrate; you are entitled to have it read, if you like"—he said "All right, Mr. Brannan, it does not matter, it is a bad job"—at the station Miller made a further search, and found in his coat pocket another sealed packet, containing two packets, also sealed, each containing ten half-crowns—I said "You will have to account for the possession of this, it is counterfeit"—he said "You will have to prove that I knew it was counterfeit"—Miller also took out a piece of sealing wax, correspond<lb></lb>ing with the wax on the packets—he refused his address—while he was being searched this piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which appears as if coin had been wrapped in it, fell from him—the coins have all undergone the process of <hi rend="italic">slumming</hi> with lamp black and grease, to give them the appearance of having been in circulation.</p>

I went with Brannan and five others to the White Horse, and saw the prisoner there—I seized him, and Inspector Holden held his arms while I searched him, and found four parcels with ten bad shillings in each, and in his breast pocket a parcel containing ten bad shillings, and two other parcels containing three half-crowns in each—in his trowser pocket I found a good florin and four good shillings—I held him while Holden and the other officers searched the place—he pretended to faint, and sat down, and said "This is a bad job"—as we went to the station he called out, "Go and tell my wife they have got me <hi rend="italic">to rights</hi>"—at the station I found in his coat pocket two parcels, each containing ten half-crowns.</p>

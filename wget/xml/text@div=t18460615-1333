                  </hi>. I am a seaman, belonging to the ship <hi rend="italic">Northumberland</hi>, in the St. Catherine's Docks. I joined the ship at New York on the 11th of May—I took on board six gold pieces, of the value of eight dollars each, one four-dollar piece, and one two-dollar piece, all in gold, a silver dollar, an English sovereign, and fifteen cents, American money, in silver—that money does not all pass in America, only the cents—I kept them in a trunk in the forecastle, and the key in my pocket—about an hour after I left New York I found the trunk was broken open, and missed my money—we had not then left the American coast—we were two or three miles from the coast—we had left the New York river, the Hudson—we were not within cannon-shot of the coast—I reported my loss to the first officer—I saw nothing of the money on the voyage—when 1 arrived I gave the prisoner into custody, on suspicion.</p>

I am chief officer of the <hi rend="italic">Northumberland</hi>, About an hour after we left New York, Petersen came to me—in consequence of what he said I looked at his trunk—the catch of the lock had been broken—we were then, properly speaking, in the Hudson river, off Governor's Island—we could see the American coast on each side—I advised Petersen to say nothing about it, because we had a great many friends on board who bad come to see their friends off, and were going off by the steamer, and if I searched one I must search all, and I was confident it was one of his ship<lb></lb>mates—I suppose we were four miles from where we weighed anchor—we were in a place where large ships go—all large ships go on that track—the friends went ten miles further—they were on board two hours afterwards—the tide ebbs and flows there—the prisoner left a paper in my hands to take care of for him, soon after we got on board—it is signed by the clerk of the Sailor's Home.</p>

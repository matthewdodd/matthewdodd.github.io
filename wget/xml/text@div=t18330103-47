On the 27th of December, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner conceal a piece of silk, in a recess behind the counter; I secreted myself in the carpet-room, and in a few minutes I saw him take the silk from the recess, place it on the counter, and cut off some of it; I then came out, and sent him up stairs to his tea - I then told Mr. Graham, who sent for him, and desired him to produce the silk; he put his hand into his hind coat-pocket, and produced the silk - we sent for the officer, and gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Is it not customary to put silks there? A. Not where this was placed; there were some shawls upon it - they would have been removed at night; I believe Mr. Graham had a good character with the prisoner - he had been with him for some time; I never heard any thing against him before - Mr. Graham said, "Produce the property you have robbed me of instantly;" and he pulled this out of his coat-pocket.</p>

             (Police-constable D 117.) I took the prisoner; in going to the station I asked how he could be so foolish as to commit the robbery - he said he did it with the intention of sending it to his sister.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There were three bales of goods on the end of the counter; the witness could not see me from the carpet-room - he came to me, and asked me for a ladies address, which I gave him, and then he told me to go to tea as soon as I could - when I got up I heard a voice calling Scott; I came down and met Mr. Graham, who took me into the counting-house, and asked what was the last thing I had cut - I said fourteen yards of silk, which I intended to send to my sister, and to pay for, as is common in the trade; I believe Mr. Parkyn has done in the same way.</p>
               <p>MR. PARKYN. I never did; he brought this silk from the silk counter, and placed it on the side where silk is not sold - had it been on the silk side, I should not have thought of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

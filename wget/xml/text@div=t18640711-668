                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at 74, Sun Street—the prisoner came into my employ in January last, and staid till June—his duties were to dispense medicines and to visit patients in my absence, and when I sent him—on 14th June he was as usual in the shop in my employ—I have a consulting-room behind the shop—I left the shop on that afternoon a few minutes before 4—the prisoner was then there in charge—I left 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the till, in a little box concealed from everybody but the prisoner, and some small change in the till in the table-drawer in the consulting-room, which was locked—I left a cash-box containing 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—1<hi rend="italic">l</hi> of that was in sixpences—I returned about 9 o'clock on that day—the prisoner was absent—I found only Jane Crisp, the servant, there—I found the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. gone out of the till; the other money was left—I found the key, which ought to have been in a place only known to the prisoner and myself—I had left it there—I was very busy then, but next morning I found two papers in the shop which I was sure I had left in my cash-box, and I went im<lb></lb>mediately to the drawer, and found it had been forced open, and all the cash taken out—the prisoner did not return; he ought to have stayed till 11, if I was out—I instantly gave information to the police—the prisoner's salary was a guinea a-week, with board, except breakfast—I had a character with him, which I find since was a false one.</p>

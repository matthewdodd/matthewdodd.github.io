            . I had a search-warrant; on the 21st of February and went to Blackbrow's house, near Finchley; I found part of two fowls partly boiled, and a quantity of burnt bones, and some wood-ashes up stairs. I found about two bushels of green feathers, two paper bags, with green feathers in them, and a cloth marked with blood, and a jacket on Smith. I found a pick-axe in Blackbrow's bed-room - I know Mr. Valentine Kingston; I do not know whether he has any other name.</p>

            . I went with the prisoners on Saturday the 19th of February, to Mr. Kingston's; we went down the road, over the pales, and into the garden - we pulled the straw off the place, and got fourteen or fifteen fowls out, and three ducks; we then got through the garden, through the hedge, and down the road, into Blackhorse-lane; we went to Blackbrow's house, and stopped there all night; the fowls were there all that time, but I do not know what became of them afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is your name James Smith, otherwise Tooley? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been taken up before? A. Only once before; it was for plaguing an old man.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never taken up for poaching on Mr. Bacon's grounds? A. Yes, but I was not taken before a Justice. I know Mr. Mills, of Whetstone - I never had his bacon.</p>

                  </hi>. I know the prisoner—in June last, I entered into partnership with him—a deed of partnership was executed—I put into the concern and expended between 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid into the London and Westminster Bank, in Lothbury, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—no money was brought in by the prisoner—the name of the paper that was published was <hi rend="italic">Kirkaldy London Register</hi>—it Was carried on at the prisoner's premises, No. 42, St. Mary-at-Hill—he managed the printing part of the business—the publishing was in Paternoster-row—I attended to that—on 6th June, the prisoner came and asked me for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay for an Albion press which had been pur<lb></lb>chased—I gave him a cheque for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not the cheque with me—on 24th June, he asked for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said it was to pay for some Nonpareil type, which had been purchased of Messrs. Chambers and Co.—this is the cheque I gave him for that—I gave him another sum of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. after that, on 1st July, making altogether 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I drew the cheques at the time—I asked</p>

               <p>him afterwards to account for the expenditure of the 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he came to account to me when the 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been expended, either at the end of June or 1st July—he gave me this account, "Press, 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Chambers and Co., for type, 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" and at the same time he gave me this receipt, as a voucher for the 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. entered here as paid to Chambers and Co.—I received it as such—matters went on till the beginning of this year—he had, in the interim, borrowed money of me—in consequence of that, I consulted a solicitor, and the books were examined in January, and my attention was called to this receipt—I went to Messrs.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And he cashes your bill on condition that you insure? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I paid 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the insurance.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

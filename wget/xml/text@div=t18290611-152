            . I am a widow. On Thursday, the 24th of May, I left my money locked in a box in a lower room - the prisoner's room is up is up stairs; I missed it on the Sunday - I have never seen it since; the officer came, and then the prisoner owned she had taken it - she said if I would forgive her it should be made up the next day; the officer said I must not do it - he took 5s. from her person, and a necklace and ear-rings, which she said she bought with my money; she had the ear-rings in her ears on the Sunday.</p>

             SALT re-examined. Q. What are you? A. I go out washing and cleaning, and when at home I bind shoes - the prisoner took a furnished room, and said she was a dress-maker, and that she was married; she brought a person to give her a character.</p>

On Thursday, 15th March, about half-past four, I saw the prisoner in St. Paul's Churchyard—I saw him walk to the side of a lady—he first passed her and then dropped back on her right side—he walked beside her a little way and then put his hand through the hole of his coat into her pocket and took something from it—I went to her and said, "You have lost something"—the prisoner saw me speaking to her and ran away—I lost sight of him—I saw him again on 22d March at the corner of St. Paul's Churchyard and took him in custody—I found a knife on him—he gave his proper address.</p>

I am assistant to Heywood and Son, tailors, of St. Paul's Churchyard—I was in their shop and saw the prisoner outside the door—there were two or three ladies there—the prisoner was close on the right hand side of the prosecutor, with his left hand down—I have not the slightest doubt that he is the man, because I looked at him for some time, and took particular notice of him.</p>

I received this bill of exchange from him—he asked me to discount it—I did so—on 3rd Feb. he came to my private residence at Homerton, late in the evening, and said Messrs. Orr wished the bill held back for a few days, and not to be presented at the London Joint-stock Bank—he requested me to pay the bill the following morning, and handed me over 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to prevent its being presented—next morning, Feb., 4th, I went to the Union Bank with the money as I had promised him the previous evening, and found the bill had gone out—I left the money with the clerk who has possession of the bills, supposing the bill would not be paid—that is the usual course—it was payable at the London Joint-stock Bank—about three o'clock that afternoon the prisoner called and said he had better leave it as long as he could, in order that there might</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bookseller, and publisher, of Amen corner, Paternoster-row. I know the prisoner—I have employed him as an engineer—he put me up a steam engine and boiler, and did other things in a printing-office which I was establishing—part of the arrangement was, that he was to be paid with a bill at nine months—when the hydraulic press was put up he applied to me for a settlement, and stated that a nine months' bill was too long a date for him to use, and requested me to give him one at six months on his undertaking to extend the credit at the proper time when it became due—this bill became due in Nov., he applied to me for it some time in May—in Dec. I had occasion to see him on this business, and I said I did not want the whole of the bill used, and gave him a six months' bill, falling due about 29th or 30th Nov. or 1st Dec.—on 2nd Dec in the morning I received a draft from him for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. accepted—the amount of the first bill was 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and it was renewed to the amount of 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I accepted his draft for that sum on 2nd Dec., at two months date—it has been paid—it was dated the 1st, accepted on the 2nd, and fell due on 4th Feb,—this is not ray ac<lb></lb>ceptance (<hi rend="italic">looking at the bill</hi>)—but it is so close an imitation of my writing that I should not have known it myself unless the other had been paid previously—I did not authorise the prisoner to draw two bills at any time—I never gave him more than one bill for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and this is not it—this bill was not written by my authority.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The bill being read, was dated London, Dec. 1st, 1851, drawn by John Gilbert and Co., on J.V. S. Orr and Co., purporting to be accepted, payable at the London Joint Stock Bank, in the name of W. S. Orr and Co., for </hi>110<hi rend="italic">l., payable to order two months after date.</hi>) The prisoner received a good character.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>, <hi rend="italic">in addressing the Jury, urged upon them that they could not find the prisoner Guilty, unless they were satisfied that the forging or uttering of the bill in question was accompanied with an intent to defraud, which, he submitted, was negatived by the prisoner's conduct, in endeavouring to meet the bill, and so preventing injury to any party. The</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">RECORDER</hi>, <hi rend="italic">in sum<lb></lb>ming up, directed the Jury, that if they were of opinion that the prisoner had either forged the bill, or uttered it, knowing it to have been forged, representing it to be genuine, although he might have intended to meet it before it became due, still they were bound, according to decisions of the Judges, almost as a matter of law, and also as a matter of common sense, to conclude the existence of an intent to de<lb></lb>fraud. Mr. Baron Alderson (in Reg. v. Hill, Moody's Crown Cases, p. 30), had told the Jury, that if they were satisfied that the prisoner uttered the bill, knowing at the time that it was a forgery, and meaning that the party to whom he uttered it should believe it to be genuine, they were bound to infer that he intended to de<lb></lb>fraud. Mr. Justice Patteson (in Reg. v. Cooke, 8 Carrand Pagne, 582) had held, "If the prisoner at the time he uttered this bill knew that the acceptance was forged, and meant the bill to be taken as a bill with a genuine acceptance upon it, the inevitable conclusion is, that he intended to defraud: that was the opinion of the Judges in a late case reserved for their consideration: there was an earlier case, of Rex v. James, tried before me at Gloucester, in which I did not lay down this proposition strongly enough, but the law upon the point is as I have now stated."Mr. Baron Parke had also held" a person is guilty of forgery, not withstanding he may himself intend ultimately to take up the bill, and may suppose that the party whose name is forged will be no loser: if in the present case you are satisfied that the prisoner knew this acceptance to be forged, and uttered it as true, and believed that the bankers would advance money on it which they would not otherwise do, that is ample evidence of an intent to defraud, and evidence upon which a Jury ought to act: it appears tha this bill has been since paid by the prisoner; but that will make no difference, if the offence has been once completed at the time of uttering." The result of those opinions amounted to this, that if a man forged or uttered a bill, intending that it should pass as a genuine bill, without informing those to whom he passed it, that it was not genuine, then, in the very act of uttering it he would be guilty of uttering it knowing it to have been forged; and the law and common sense together would bind the Jury to come to the conclusion that he intended to defraud, although it was, of course, in their power to come to a different result.</hi>

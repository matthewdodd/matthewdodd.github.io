            . I am a police-constable. On Thursday, the 25th of November, about five o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in Lamb's Conduit-street - I saw the prosecutor opposite me, on the left-hand side: there were three persons with him; one in front, and the other two had hold of each of his arms: the prisoner was one, and he had hold of his left arm - I had seen the prosecutor two or three times, and knew where he lived; I saw him at Miss Hall's door, and the prisoner struggling with him: the prisoner then ran away, and two other persons, who I believe were the persons I had previously seen with him -I followed the prisoner into Theobald's-road, and Great James-street; I there saw him put out his hand to a person, whe looked back; he then escaped down Red Lion-street; the prisoner ran on, and I stopped him in Chapel-street - I had not lost sight of him from the time I saw him at Miss Hall's door; I had noticed the person who had hold of the prosecutor's arm had a black mark of courtplaister on his temple, and when I took the prisoner I saw he had it on his temple; when I took the prisoner he struck me on the breast, and told me to keep off - I seized another man shorter than him at the same time, but was obliged to let him go - I took the prisoner to Miss Hall's door, and as soon as the prosecutor saw him he said, "That is the man who robbed me of my watch;" the prisoner denied all knowledge of it; the gas-lamps were not lighted - there was a light from an oil-shop and a linen-draper's, about twenty yards off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then the prosecutor swore positively to him? A. Yes; he said."That is the man who robbed me:" he did not say then that his memory was quite gone - I seized two men, one with each hand; they had both run from the place: my attention was partly directed to the other man; I am a little short in my memory- I cannot say how the third man was dressed: I first saw the prisoner at the corner of Great Ormond-street - they were then opposite a light, and I saw the black patch on his face; it was not because I saw the prisoner had a black patch at the station-house that I swear to him - I saw it at first; they were then about twenty doors from Miss Hall's- I did not notice the other men; I noticed the prisoner attentively - I believe I should have known him without the black patch; I found on the prisoner 2l. 14s. 3 1/2d., a penknife, and a head of a pin with a stone set in silver; I believe it is a brooch: he told me he was returning from his work - I asked where he lived; he said in Pitt-street, but he did not tell me who his master was, nor where he lived - I found nothing belonging to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you notice the prisoner before he arrived at the door? A. Yes, by the light of the oilshop.</p>

            . I live in Duke-street. On the 25th of November I was going to Miss Hall's, and saw John at the door, and several men about him; he had hold of one man by the coat or sleeve - I do not know which; I was alarmed, and said "What is the matter?" he said,"I have been robbed by three men; I don't know whether this is the one who robbed me, but he is one of them;" the man got from him, and ran off - I ran and cried Stop thief! I did not see the man's face, but he was a tall man, and had a great coat on: he ran from the door, and two joined him - I cannot speak to either of their persons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was rather dark? A. Yes; but there were lights burning in Mr. Kinton's shop, a grucer's opposite, and in an oil-shop next door - the gas was not lighted; I did not notice any patch on the man's face.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning from No. 34, Mecklenburgh-square, where I had been to put up some curtains, but the laths and brackets not being there, I could not finish them - I saw two or three persons talking very jocularly, and when I got to Miss Hall's door there was a cry of Stop thief! and two persons ran away; I pursued one of them down to Chapel-street, where the Policeman took me back to the door, and the old gentleman certainly said, "That is one of the parties;" I stated where I had been at work, and the inspector gave the officer a note to go there, and he found it was correct; I was taken to the office, where I told where I had been, and what I had been doing - One man stated that he knew me to be a thief, and all my companions had been transported; but this I deny in toto.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PORTEOUS. I went to No. 44, Mecklenburgh-square, and the servant stated he had been at work there about two hours.</p>

             sworn. - On the 26th of March I fell in company with the prisoner; I had before that wrapped up my notes in a piece of paper and put them in my waistcoat pocket; I had two two-pound notes and a one pound that I had received from the agent, at Craig's-court; I went with the prisoner to her lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you drunk or sober? - A. I was sober, I was perfectly aware of what I was about; I went to bed with her, and when I awaked the next morning I missed the two-pound notes, and the one-pound note was lest; I told the prisoner I had lost them; and she said it must be her maid servant; she went to look after her servant; she came back, said it might be in my pocket; I went to Bow-street, and got an officer; the prisoner said she did not know any thing of my property, except the two-pound note; but upon being threatened to go to Bow-street, she said the mistress of the house had got it for the rent of the room; the mistress of the house produced it.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of some conversation with a person did you expect the prisoner to call upon you, about the purchase of a horse - A. According to Mr. Bott's directions. On the 16th of January, on Monday, about a quarter before three, as I stood at the gateway, the prisoner came and asked me if my name was Young, or if I knew such a person as Young; I told him my name was Young; he said he had come to me from a person of the name of Bott, concerning of buying a horse; I told him Mr. Bott had been waiting for him three quarters of an hour, he could wait no longer, he was obliged to go, but that he had looked out a horse which he wished Cooper to buy; he said he hoped that I should not take him in, for that he had bought a horse, a little time ago, of Mr. Marsden in Tottenham court road; he said he gave forty five pounds for him, he had but kept him a little while and he was not worth ten pounds; therefore his father would not suffer him to buy any other horse but what Mr. Bott approved of; then I shewed him the horse; he very much disputed the horse's age; I told him he was rising six years old; he said he thought he was older, but he was not a judge; he asked me the price; I told him forty five guineas; he said he thought it was too much; he said Mr. Young who will you leave to be the arbitrator of this horse; I told him I did not see that he wanted any body, any further than Mr. Bott, the farrier, and if he thought it too much money, as he was recommended by Mr. Bott, I would let him have him at forty five pounds, and if Mr. Bott said that was too much, he should have him for less, and if not, he was to give it; Mr. Bott was to set the price; then Mr. Cooper and I walked together to Mr. Bott; Cooper said he hoped I should not deceive him and take him in; his father was in want of a good gig horse, most likely he would be a good customer to me. Mr. Bott assured me that he knew the prisoner and his father very well, that he had done business for the father sixteen or seventeen years; and that his son went seven years to the school with the prisoner, that he knew it to be a worthy family. The prisoner asked Mr. Bott if he would pass his word to permit him to ride the horse to Hammersmith to his father; Mr. Bott said he had good parents, I need not be afraid; the prisoner said his father was so very ill, he was not able to get out; we parted on the Monday; on the Tuesday, about three o'clock, the prisoner came to me at my yard in Ormond street, and said that his father was very ill; he should be much obliged to me if I would let him ride the horse to Hammersmith, to shew his father; that he would call on the Wednesday, the day following, and tell me what his father said; which he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you let him have the horse on the Tuesday - A. I did; I let him him have the horse, saddle and bridle that he rode off with; he did not return the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again - A. On the Thursday, in Red lion street, Holborn; I saw him upon the horse; he said oh, Mr. Young, I was just coming to you.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was he going - A. Towards the Foundling; he was going down Lamb's Conduit street, towards my yard; he said he supposed I was rather surprized that he did not come yesterday; I told him I was; he said his father was so very ill that he was not able to get out; he said he should not have come then, but business called him, that he was obligated, and he was going to take a ride as far as Barnet; but the weather was so very bad, that he did not think he should; I said if it is not particular business turn back, you will get your death, and the horse's too; he said he would, the weather was very severe; he said he hoped that I would go to Hammersmith on Sunday morning, and to be with him time enough for breakfast, and to spend the day, and then his father could settle with me concerning the horse; I asked him if he liked the horse; he said very well; we parted; I then went to Mr. Bott; the younger Mr. Bott, and me went to Hammersmith on the Thursday; the prisoner directed me to a white house, behind Hammersmith church; we went there, we found the house, but no such person lived there; we were directed by a Mr. Price to Chelsea; when we came to Chelsea we met the prisoner's father in the street; he lived at No. 1, Cheney row.</p>

               <p>COURT. When did you see your horse again - A. On the Friday, at Mr. Dixon's repository, Barbican; I came to London and searched for the horse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This young man belongs to a very respectable family - A. He does.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not have parted with the horse unless it had been for the recommendation of Mr. Bott - A. I certainly should not; I certainly parted with the horse from the respectability of the prisoner's family, and the recommendation of Mr. Bott.</p>
               <p>Q. You said there was a price agreed upon between you, of forty five guineas - A. Yes; he never abated me a shilling; I asked him forty five guineas.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you sell it for forty five guineas - A. I never sold it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you met him on the Thursday - was there nothing said between you and him of meeting on the Sunday for the payment of the horse - A. No further than I was to meet him on Sunday at his father's, and his father would settle it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by the term of settling with you on the Sunday - A. Of course I thought if he was an honest man he would settle with me on Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood you were to be paid the price of the horse on the Sunday - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had brought you the money you would have been satisfied - A. If he had brought the money I should have been satisfied.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 145). On 17th Jan., about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I saw Kiff coming out of Mrs. Wilkinson's pre<lb></lb>mises with a truss of hay on his shoulders—I followed him with it to Hal<lb></lb>lums private residence—I lost sight of him for two or three seconds—the next time I saw him be came out of the gate of Hallum's residence, and wished me good night, and he went in a direction towards Mrs. Wilkinson's again—I went and took a sample of the hay from Hallum's yard, and put it into my pocket—I waited three or four minutes, and Kiff came back with another truss on his shoulders—I asked him where he was going with that hay—he told me be was going to the Victoria with it—I asked him where he got it from—be said, "From the King's Arms"—I said that was impossible, for he bad not been gone long enough to go there—he then said a boy met him and gave it him—I took Kiff and the hay into custody—I did not see Hallum for nearly an hour afterwards—my brother officer asked him if he had sent a truss of hay that night to the Victoria—he said, "Yes"—he said, "Be sure"—he then said, "I have not"—we then proceeded to Hallum's resi<lb></lb>dence, where I had seen the truss of hay deposited—I saw a truss of bay on the footpath, and Richards came to take it—previous to his coming to take it, I heard some one say, "All right."</p>

               <p>truss from Kiff, I left it with a respectable man named Page; he is not here, and I do not know, except from him, what was done with the truss while it was in his hands—I had to take the prisoner a mile, and be attempted to escape—I could not contend with Kiff and take the truss.</p>

I accompanied Gardener to Hallum's—I asked Hallum if he had given any hay to Kiff—he first said, "Yes"—I said, "Are you sure?"—he then said, "I have not"—this was in the yard of the King's Arms—I then went to Hallum's house, and when I came up to the gate there was a truss of hay outside the gate; Richards was going to take it up, and I detected him—there was a man in the yard of Hallum's house, and he said, "All right"—I think Richards was in the house at that time—I was on the other side of the road—Richards then came out, and took hold of the truss, and I took him into custody.</p>

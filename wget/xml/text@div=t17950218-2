             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer belonging to the public office, in Worship-street. On the 29th of December, I was standing by our office door, a person came up and said -</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any intimation, what did you do? - I see a waggon standing very high opposite to the office, within a few yards; I see Watkins take out a sack of coals out of the waggon with the assistance of Russell, and I see him take them into the house of Brockwell, the prisoner that stands at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the prisoner's house? - It is situated in Worship-street, Moorfields. I followed him in, and just as you get into Brockwell's house, just in his room, there is a closet that is behind the door, and he takes and whips the coals out of the sack into this here closet. I was close to him almost.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the room at that time? - Brockwell and his wife, and another woman. I laid hold of Watkins, I says to him, you are doing something that is not right; says he, I don't know nothing at all about that. I then asked Mr. Brockwell, the prisoner at the bar, what business them coals had being brought into his house? Brockwell said, there was a woman that lived in George-street that ordered them to be brought there; and at that time he had got half a crown between his thumb and finger, and said, here take the half crown, holding the half crown out to Watkins.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180005"></xptr>Q. Who did he say that to? - To Watkins. Watkins says I have nothing to do with it, Russell ordered me to bring them here, I have nothing to do with the money. I took the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Russell at the time? - Watkins took the sack of coals out of the waggon, with the assistance of Russell; I took the ticket that I had from Watkins, and I see by the ticket that I had from Watkins, where the coals were going to; the officers took Watkins and the empty sack home to the office, and as the waggon had got the four and thirty sacks in it, I thought it not proper to take Russell into custody, and I thought it proper to go with him where the coals were going to; when we arrived at Mr. Price's house, which is situated in Gloucester-street, Hoxton; I related the circumstance to him, and the sacks were counted there, there were four and thirty, and the ticket expressed five and thirty; after the waggon was emptied, I see the team safe home to Mr. Bee's house, at Southwark, and brought Russell back to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. What had become of Brockwell all this time? - Brockwell remained at his own house, Brockwell was not taken into custody that night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say you are an officer of the police office, Worship-street? -  Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Brockwell lives in the same street? - He does.</p>
               <p>Q. Near the office? - Within about thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. You can see the house of Brockwell from the office? - Yes, every moment.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - In the evening, high six.</p>
               <p>Q. But however it was not so dusk or dark but what at thirty yards distance you could observe what was going on? - No, I did not see it, I went from an information that I had received.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a public thoroughfare? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course there were a great number of persons passing and repassing that time of the evening? - No, I don't know that there were.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Bee is not here? - No, I don't know he is.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor Mr. Metcalse? - I have never seen Mr. Metcalse.</p>
               <p>Q. What coals were put into the waggon there you don't know of your own knowledge? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor that they belonged to Mr. Bee of your own knowledge? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time they were brought into Brockwell's house, there were other people in the house besides Brockwell? - There was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any secret in conveying these coals into the house? - There was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps he see you there? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps he knew you was an officer? - There is no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen Mr. Bee this morning? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Brockwell was not taken into custody then? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it afterwards before Brockwell was taken into custody? - Not till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. He was admitted to bail? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. He now surrenders to take histrial this morning? - Yes, there is no doubt about that.</p>
               <p>Q. And all this happened you seeing it take place in Mr. Brockwell's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was sitting in the room, and this man came rushing in, and he says, my boy, will you buy a sack of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180006"></xptr>coals for half a crown and a pot of beer? I looked up at him, and told him no, I did not want any; he said that he brought them for a woman in Shoreditch, and she was not at home, and that if I would take them it would save him the trouble of carrying them back again; he said they were very good coals; he repeated that with a loud voice, two or three times in the passage, and the door standing open; he then went out into the street, and repeated with a loud voice, the same words again; I told him I was afraid I should get myself in a hobble by buying of them; he said, there was no fear of that, they were waste boys perquisites; as for George-street it was not mentioned to me, and as for saying take the half crown, I did not; I cannot deny that I had the silver and halfpence in my hand, but I had not separated them; had I known what they had been at the time, I should not have had any thing to do with them.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a victualler, in St. John's street, Bethnal-green. I was in Worship-street one evening about six o'clock, I cannot say how long ago, some time before Christmas; I see a coal waggon stand about twenty yards before I came to the police office, Shoreditch,</p>
               <p>Q. At whose door was it? - I don't know; I see the carman belonging to the coal waggon; curiosity led me to mark what he was about; I see him go to a door, I crossed the way in order to hear what was going forward; I heard him say to the people within doors, you may as well take them, take them, have them; the reply that was made from within, I cannot tell; he came away and went back to the same door again a second time, and was urging them as I thought, more forcibly to have them than before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he succeed then? - No, I think he went four times before he prevailed on them to have them, and the third or fourth time, he said, you might as well have them before I go away, he even forced them on them, as I thought; when I see this I went to the police, and gave information myself, and one of the men came along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man, Ray? - I think he was; but before I went to acquaint Ray, I heard the carman say to the other man, go and undo the rope, and that made me go to the police office; when I came from the police with the officer, we walked by the waggon twice, before we see what they were doing, and there at last we see the man having the sack on his back, and going into the very same door he was speaking at before.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him shoot them down? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house was it in? - I don't know the people.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - I have seen him since, but I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the same house into which the coals were carried, where there had been three applications made before he would take them in? - It was so; there is one circumstance I rather forgot; he told him he had better have them, they belonged to some boy, I think he said they were boys coals.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Brockwell saying any thing, or seeing him there? - I do not recollect hearing him say any thing, I see him sit in a chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Brockwell before? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know him now? - I think I should know him if I was to see him, I am not certain.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two other witnesses, who said he was a fearlet dier, and gave him an excellant character.</p>
               <p>Jury to Price. Is there such things as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180007"></xptr>waste boys coals? - There are such things.</p>

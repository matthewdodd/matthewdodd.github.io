                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 336.) On Wednesday, the 21st of May, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, I was on duty at Dagen<lb></lb>ham, in Essex, and met the prisoner—he had a bag on his back, with something in it—I passed him, without challenging him—I afterwards turned round, looked at him, and followed him—directly he fonnd I was doing so, he ran off, and ran about 200 yards, or more—I caught him just as he had got one foot within his cottage—I went in after him, and asked what he had in the bag—it was still on his back—he said, a few potatoes that he had had given to him—I told him I must take him into custody—I took him to the station, searched him, and found sixteen potatoes round his body, in his coat pocket, and in his smock frock, which was tucked up—the sack contained sixteen pounds of potatoes—he afterwards said it was no use telling a lie about it, he found them on his road home—I afterwards showed them to Mr. Choat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, residing at Barking, in partnership with my brother Joseph. The prisoner was in our service three or four years—he is a single man, and had 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—in May I had some potato clamps on my farm, which was wholly under the prisoner's care and management—the policeman brought some potatoes to me on the Thursday morning—I am certain they were part of my property—they are a Shaw potato—they were grown in the marsh—the prisoner had no authority to carry any away for himself—the same day he was apprehended I found a quantity of the same sort of potatoes in a sack about the premises.</p>
               <p>

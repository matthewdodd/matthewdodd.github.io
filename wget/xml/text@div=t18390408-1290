                  </hi>. I was acquainted with the deceased, Mr. Joseph Alsop; we were fellow-pupils in the house of the Rev. Mr. Stunner, curate of Hayes—Mr. Dalison was also a pupil there. On Saturday morning, the 9th of March, Mr. Dalison was about leaving the establishment—he left about ten o'clock in the morning—I had not taken leave of him, as I did not expect the coach to go away—he intended to go to the Adam and Eve to order the coach to come, and I was going to see him off—I and Mr. Alsop had been with him in the hall that morning before he left—I do not recollect that the prisoner came down stairs while we were in the hall—I had seen him at breakfast that morning—Mr. Dalison was in the room at breakfast too—within two or three minutes after Dalison bad left, I was in the dining-room with Mr. Alsop and Mr. Sturmer—that is the room in which we usually studied—I was kneeling on the floor to get a book from the lower shelf of a book-case, when the prisoner entered the room, and said, "What do you think that blackguard who has gone away has done? he has broken the glass of my watch"—he addressed that observation to Mr. Sturmer—Mr. Sturmer immediately said, "I wonder you have not knocked him down before"—the prisoner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183904080101"></xptr>
               <p>answered that he should have done so, if he had not been afraid of soiling his hands—Alsop then said, "You are a liar"—I heard nothing more—I then looked round—Medhurst was then by the fire-place, and Alsop at the corner of the table, near me, near the book-case—the prisoner was in his dress<lb></lb>ing-gown, and had his stick in his hand, raised up when I looked round, and he immediately struck the deceased on the head—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a stick</hi>)—it was a stick very like this—I did not notice whether he had his witch in his hand—the blow was aimed at Alsop's head, but he raised his arm to ward off the blows, and they fell on his arms—he gave two or three blows—I saw that—there was then a scuffle between them, which lasted about half a minute—in the course of which Alsop wrested the stick from Medhurst—I believe Alsop struck him with the stick when he got it, and then they separated to about eight feet apart—Alsop then advanced about half-way towards Medhurst, about four feet, apparently going to strike him again with the stick—it was upraised—Medhurst drew a knife from his left-hand trowsers' pocket, with his left-hand, took it into his right-behind sprang the blade made a step forward, and stabbed Alsop—he struck him about here—(<hi rend="italic">in the abdomen</hi>)—this is the knife—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one, and opening it</hi>)—I heard the spring go when he opened it.</p>

               <p>

                  </hi>. I am curate of Hayes, in Middlesex, and have been so about four years. I have had for some time an establishment there for the reception of pupils—I have received pupils in that way about seven years—I have had pupils constantly since I have resided at Hayet—at the beginning of March last I had four pupils in my house; three besides the prisoner, who was not considered exactly, for the last six months, a pupil—he had been with me altogether about two years and two months—Mr. Bunney had been with me about twelve months—the deceased, Mr. Alsop, came to me on Ash-Wednesday, the 13th of February—the pupils sat for study in the dining-room—on Saturday morning, the 9th of March, Mr. Dalison left my establishment after breakfast—the family had breakfasted together, as usual.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there at this time any dissension or difference among any mem<lb></lb>bers of your family, the pupils? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was no dissension on the part of the prisoner, but the three pupils had not spoken to him; they were not on speaking terms with him—on his part there was not the slightest enmity—that state of things had existed about a week—it would be difficult for me to say what it arose from—the deceased had shown a little ill-feeling on out occasion before the 9th of March—I was in the dining-room that morning, with Mr. Bunney and Mr. Alsop, after breakfast—the prisoner came in—as far as I recollect, he had his dressing-gown on—he had a stick in his hand, similar to the one produced—he said to me, "See what a blackguard that is who has just left your house; see, he has broken the glass of my watch"—I saw the watch, and the glass was broken—I did not make any reply to that remark—not any—Mr. Alsop</p>

               <p>immediately answered, "You are a liar and a blackguard for saying so"—the prisoner was just advancing up to the fire-place, to place the watch on the mantelpiece, when those words were uttered—he immediately lifted up the stick, and struck the deceased on the shoulder, as far as I recollect—I cannot say which hand his watch was in—when he advanced into the room he showed it to me—the prisoner seemed to strike the deceased, but I was not looking exactly that way—I cannot say for certain whether the stick came on his shoulder, but it was in the direction of the shoulder of the deceased—there then took place a sort of scuffle—each had his hands on the other, as if trying who should get the stick—I did not inter<lb></lb>fere nor say any thing—I left the room immediately, leaving the prisoner and deceased struggling for the stick, and Bunney in the room—no one else—I afterwards returned to the room—I did not enter it, but was in the act of returning—it appeared to be about two minutes afar I had quitted it, or it might not be so long—I met the prisoner coming out—he did not exactly address me, but I heard an indistinct exclamation from him, "Oh, good God!"—it was a sort of exclamation of sorrow or horror—I think he had nothing in his hand then—I was going to enter the room further, when I met the deceased coming out, leaning on one side, saying he was stuck—no one was assisting him then—he had his hand to his person, holding himself, as if struck—I immediately ran and ordered my servant to send for Mr. Chadwick, the surgeon—I left the house, to fetch Mr. Bunney back, who had run out of the house; and on my return I found the deceased had gone up stairs to his bed-room, assisted, as I understood, by the prisoner—I did not see him assist him—I found him in his own bed-room, lying across the bed on his back, and the prisoner sitting by the bed-side, holding his hand on the deceased's belly, to stop the blood—I remained there a short time, and then left them—I went up again and then left them again—I think the prisoner remained with the deceased till Mr. Chadwick came—I was present when Mr. Chadwick first entered the room, but I left the room, and went in and out once or twice for bandages and some things which Mr. Chadwick asked for—I took means to inform Mr. Alsop's rela<lb></lb>tions what had occurred—he was an orphan, under the care and guardian-ship of his aunt—she had placed him under my care—the deceased expressed a great wish to see his aunt, but hearing it was so slight a wound, I said "No, you had better wait till to-morrow, at it if merely a flesh wound, or a scratch," as was expressed, but he expressed a great wish, and I said, "How shall I manage it?"—he said, "Never mind the expense," and the prisoner said, "I will pay any expense; if it is a post-chaise I will pay the expense; never mind any expense"—I sent an express off in consequence of that, and the deceased's aunt got to my house, be<lb></lb>tween seven and eight o'clock that evening—before that, on his asking me to send for his aunt—I said, "You had better wait till to-morrow; Mr. Chadwick says it is only a scratch, or flesh-wound; you may be well by to-morrow;"—he said, "I may not, (or) shall not live till to-morrow," I cannot recollect which—I heard him say, after that, while the prisoner's and his hands were in each other's, "We were both wrong, and I forgive you"—those were his exact words—Alsop had hold of Medhurst's hand, as far as I recollect—this was after Mr. Chadwick had been—on the following morning (Sunday) the assistance of Mr. Patten, of Uxbridge was obtained—he came at ten o'clock, and he and Mr. Chadwick acted together, in the management of the case—on Wednesday Mr. Patten got Mr. Frogley, of</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During breakfast, and until he went up stairs, was not he calm and tranquil as usual? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Just the same as usual—the dispute between him and the pupils on the Sunday before, was about a hassock at church—during the week he several times expressed a wish to me and Mrs. Sturmer to be reconciled to them—on this Saturday morning he wished come clamps to be brought from Uxbridge—he was going to make me a box to hold carpenter's tools—he had made a chair for himself—when he came down stairs he had the watch in his hand—I always understood it was one he valued exceedingly, on account of its having been his father's—I saw that the glass was broken—Dalison and he slept in the same bed-room—he certainly seemed angry when he came down with the watch in his hand—Alsop was at that time near the book-case, near the window—(a <hi rend="italic">plan of the room was here shown to the witness</hi>)—the room has a door in the corner—the fire-place is at the side—here is the book-case against which Alsop stood, and here is the window—the table stood in the middle of the, room—when Medhurst entered by the door, Alsop was standing near the book-case—I was between the side-board and the table, near the fire-place—Medhurst addressed me alone, when he came in—I distinctly heard Alsop say Medhurst was a liar and a blackguard—there can be no mistake—it was said so loud, no one could be off hearing it—it was spoken so distinct and emphatic—they had a sort of scuffle who should get the stick before I left the room—it hardly lasted a second be<lb></lb>fore I left—I left as soon as it began.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you returned, did it not appear to you that Mr. Medhurst felt the deepest regret at what had happened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could only judge from what I heard—he said, rather in an inward tone, "Oh, good God!"—his manner and tone of voice had so much of a feeling of horror about it, that I thought something had happened to him—I did not know whether he himself had not received an injury—I heard a groan in the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From that time, down to the death of the unfortunate gentleman, did not Mr. Medhurst display the greatest regret? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No one could dis<lb></lb>play more Christian or humane feeling—I was a witness to it myself—I</p>

               <p>did not see him assist the deceased up stairs—when I saw him in bed, Medhurst was hanging over him, trying to alleviate his sufferings—I once distinctly heard the deceased say they had both been in the wrong, and I think at other times when in the room with him—Medhurst delivered up the knife willingly to me on the Wednesday, he did not hesitate a moment—he was exceedingly anxious that Mr. Alsop's relations should be sent for. finding it was his wish—he voluntarily surrendered himself on the death of Mr. Alsop; immediately afterwards we went together to the Magistrate by his own wish; but the Magistrate said he could not interfere, as there would be an inquest, and he then surrendered himself to a policeman—I think I have seen the stick he had for two years at least—he generally carried that, or another similar to it, about with him—he had two or three—he was Defer without a stick—he scarcely ever walked in the garden after break-fast without a stick—it was an unusual thing to see him without one—he would frequently walk in the hall with a stick, even with his dressing gown on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, practising at Hayes, and am a member of the College of Surgeons. I was called in on Saturday, the 9th of March, about ten o'clock, to attend Mr. Alsop—I went instantly, and found him in a bed-room, and Mr. Medhurst with him, who on my going in said, "Good God, make haste, Mr. Chadwick"—I saw Mr. Med<lb></lb>hurst first, the curtains being down—I did not see the deceased till I got to the side of the bed—I asked the nature of the accident—the deceased answered, "We have been quarrelling, and I have received a wound"—I immediately proceeded to examine it—Mr. Medburst was leaning over the bed, with his hand underneath the bed clothes, apparently to me pressing the abdomen together—he had a napkin in his hand, pressing it very hard to the abdomen to stop the blood—I found the deceased's shirt stained with blood, and on lifting up the shirt I saw the wound in the left side of</p>

               <p>the body, about an Inch below the navel—the inner angle of the wound came about even with the navel, to the centre of the body—the wound was from an inch and a half to an inch and three quarters long—it was a cut wound with a clean cut edge—had I known such an instrument as this had been used, I should have been more careful in my search, but it was said he had used a knife, and, supposing it to have been a common knife, I con<lb></lb>sidered it had gone so far and no further, and I did not think it right to irritate the wound by probing it—I did not probe it to ascertain whether it had gone further, seeing as I thought, the bottom of the wound, and the peritoneum uncut, my opinion was that I saw the extent of the wound, and it being a transverse incision, it was necessary to draw the parts toge<lb></lb>ther—I thought it but a common incised wound—it gaped very much, as wide as the opening would allow the two lips to gape—I did not at that time consider it a dangerous wound—in cleansing the wound I did it up—I commanicated to the family and Mr. Medhurst the favourable view I took cf the wound—the prisoner was up stairs when I did up the wound—we three were alone, Mr. Medhurst, the deceased, and myself—I ex<lb></lb>pressed my hope that no further injury had taken place, thin what I saw—if they had shown me the instrument, of course I should have examined farther, and should decidedly have probed the wound to ascertain the extant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon did you observe any appearance in the countenance of the patient, or in any other way, which indicated that the wound was more serious than you at first thought? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On Sunday, twenty-four hours after the accident; but I saw the patient twice in the interval—the countenance was more anxious on the Sunday, compressed within itself, and the eye more fixed—that indicated a severe shock to the system—there had been no symptoms of vomiting up to Sunday morning—when we went on Sun<lb></lb>day evening, between nine and ten o'clock, vomiting had taken place once, and, on examining the contents, some cabbage was among it—I thought it wat indigestion—it was an unfavourable sign—Mr. Patten was called in on Sunday morning—I attended the deceased till he died—the last time I saw him with Mr. Patten was on Wednesday morning, in consultation—the last time I saw him alive was on Thursday morning—there was no hope of his surriving from the Wednesday morning—the case then appeared to me to be perfectly hopeless—I examined the body after death, by direction of the Co<lb></lb>roner, on the Saturday morning, as he died on the Thursday—on examining the body, I was enabled to trace the direction of the wound, and the mischief which had been done—I found that the peritoneum had been very extensively wounded on the right side, and the instrument had crossed over between the integuments anterior and posterior—that internal wound of the perito<lb></lb>neum was nearly opposite the external wound, but not directly horizontal; it was rather oblique, descending, so that the point of the instrument de<lb></lb>scended—the internal wound of the peritoneum was behind a different part of the outer skin, two inches and a half from it; so that looking at the wound externally, I could not see the wound of the peritoneum—if I had put my finger in I could not have reached it—when the instrument had penetrated through the peritoneum into the cavity of the abdomen, it would come in contact with a lining which floats in front of the bowels, called the omentum—that was extensively injured in the direction of the wound—I could not see whether any of the bowels themselves had been injured—I could not see any—the omentum, covering the bowels, pro<lb></lb>all</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183904080110"></xptr>
               <p>them—I found very little extravasated blood in the cavity of the abdomen, perhaps four or five ounces—the omentum had been decidedly lacerated—if I had known the extent of the wound when I was first called in, I should certainly not have given the opinion I did of it—having seen the extent of the wound by the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, I should decidedly say the wound was mortal, or highly dangerous—the wound, in my judgment, was the primary cause of death; it produced inflammation of the bowels, then mortification, of which he died—I did every thing which in my judgment was requisite to produce the most favourable re<lb></lb>sult—I am not aware of any thing which could be done that was not done to prevent the consequences—nothing that I am aware of could hare pre<lb></lb>vented the wound from producing death.</p>

               <p>fits, and told me of a severe injury of the temple from a blow, and stated that he had suffered from a constipation of the bowels for nearly a week, I think, except one day, for a week or more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would that state of his bowels and body render any injury he re<lb></lb>cared more dangerous? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I looked at it as more serious—I told him that required very serious consideration—I prescribed some aperient medicine, two pills, and a draught, which acted on him—I think he said he would not take the second—by the persuasion of myself and Mr. Med<lb></lb>hurst, he said he would, but he did not—Mr. Medhurst observed that he would see that he took it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and reside at Uxbridge. I was called in on Sunday morning to attend the deceased—I went to him at ten o'clock—I was informed of the nature of the injury he was suffering under, and that it was inflicted with a knife—I did not see the instrument for tome days afterwards—I found the wound with a twisted suture, which it a needle through the wound, and silk twisted round—from the discharge from the wound, it was evident there had been an adhesion from the first intention, as it is called, or the operation of nature—there was a good deal of swelling and tenderness around—the tenderness was at the edge and wound—I removed the suture—the wound did not gape—some more dis<lb></lb>charge issued from it, but the wound itself opened to a very slight extent—I had not then the least opportunity of ascertaining the extent of the injury, nor at any time during my attendance—I could not see the in<lb></lb>terior of the wound at all—I particularly noticed the countenance of the patient—I was struck with it immediately on entering the room, and the temperature of the skin was much colder than natural—there was an ex<lb></lb>pression of great anxiety in the countenance, and a sinking of the features generally, particularly the eyes—the pulse was exceedingly feeble and irre<lb></lb>gular—those symptoms, in my judgment, indicated that a severe shock had been received by the system and I thought the wound highly danger<lb></lb>ous—I continued to attend him constantly till his death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you any hope of his recovery from the first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly I had hope until Wednesday morning—I considered him decidedly in a dan<lb></lb>gerous state from the time I first saw him—I examined the body after death, by direction of the Coroner—I did not see it when it was first opened—there had been a previous examination, and the parts had been very much disturbed—I had a very imperfect opportunity of forming a judg<lb></lb>ment of the extent of the internal injury—it appeared to me that the course the wound had taken was from left to right, obliquely—there was a very large lacerated opening of the peritoneum, which I attributed to the exami<lb></lb>nation which had taken place—it was not corresponding to the external injury—the part immediately facing the open wound was not lacerated—it was not exposed—the omen turn had been completely torn through—that</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Assuming the peritoneum to have been wounded, what should you say of the character of such a wound as to danger? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are Very extensive wounds of the peritoneum that recover—there are very exten<lb></lb>sive surgical operations on the peritoneum—there-are operations in which I have cut into the peritoneum, and not prepared the patient for it—we have generally no time for preparation—I consider all wounds that have any thing to do with the cavity of the belly very dangerous, and you cannot introduce a knife into that cavity without wounding the peritoneum—I cannot form any judgment, from what I saw, whether the peritoneum had been wounded—I saw the body some hours after the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> exami<lb></lb>nation had been made—I do not know exactly the time.</p>

ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If I understand you right, from the symptoms and appearances you observed after death, there was difficulty in distinguishing what arose from the original puncture, and the effect, the subsequent inflammation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The parts were completely in a disturbed state—the whole intestines were scattered about and had never been put to rights after the examination—I was not present at the original <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, that bad taken place by Mr. Chad wick alone, before I came.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In wounds of this sort the result depends a good deal on the treat<lb></lb>ment they receive? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In a great measure of course, the result depends on the extent of the injury—we flatter ourselves treatment is of use, or we should very soon not be called upon—I should not have applied a suture in this case, or tight bandages—I am not aware that the bandages were tight—I should not use them—I think them highly improper—I should not have used a needle at all—I should have used adhesive plaster—I should have thought the wound itself was sufficient, there not being opening sufficient to allow the bowel to protrude, I should not have thought of adding another operation to the unfortunate one that had been made before—I have seen various instances lately of wounds in the belly by sharp in<lb></lb>struments, where I myselfhavehadthe treatment, and where the patients have recovered—I have no doubt in some of those cases the peritoneum was penetrated, but happily my patients recovered, and I did not make any examination—I should think the gentleman who would probe such a wound had been educated five hundred years ago—I had some conversation with the deceased shortly before he died—the second visit I paid him was I be<lb></lb>lieve as late as eight or nine o'clock on Wednesday evening—I found him so very much altered from the time I left him, I felt convinced he had but a few hours to live—I said to him from the character of the symptoms, I felt it my duty to communicate to him that I had no hopes of his recovery, and perhaps it might be a consolation to him previous to that distressing event, to communicate something to me respecting the <hi rend="italic">fracas</hi> which had taken place—I asked him if he had done any thing to induce the <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I believe that was the word I made use of—he said, "Yes, I called him a liar and a blackguard, (I am convinced he used the word blackguard) upon which he struck me"—I asked if he thought there was any thing preme<lb></lb>ditated on the part of Medhurst—he said, "Decidedly not"—he stated previously to my putting these questions, seeming to wish to avoid being disturbed by questions put to him, that he had forgiven Medhurst, and</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the principal surgeons of Gay's Hospital—I have beard the evidence given in this case—I see no objections to the use of the suture in the manner described by Mr. Chad wick—in a wound of this sort in the abdomen, it would be the duty of a surgeon to close the wound as far as he is able, and if not able to do it by plaster, it would be his duty to use a suture of some kind, either of silk or metal—some surgeons prefer a silk suture, and some a metallic one—I am more in the habit of using a metallic one as being less irritating—I should think the use of the suture as described in no way contributed to the fatal result—it failed to produce its effect, but I think it could do no harm—nei<lb></lb>ther the use or removal of it could do any harm in my opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would it be right in any case to probe a wound in the abdomen received by a sharp instru<lb></lb>ment, either with a metallic probe or with the finger? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think in no case could that be at all justified—I should hardly think a bandage was required in wounds of this sort; but, perhaps, in this case, as Mr. Alsop was removed from one room into the other, the bandage might have been of some service in* supporting the abdomen—but only for that purpose—I think it otherwise unnecessary—a tight bandage, of course, would not be proper—I should hardly think it would cause inflammation—it might irri<lb></lb>tate—it would not increase inflammation within—I should hardly think it would disturb the healing process, unless it were improperly tight—if it were so tight as to cause uneasiness and annoyance to the patient it would be doing harm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before you employed the suture at all, either with silk, thread, or any metallic substance, you would first try to dose the wound by some other means? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I should not—I should be able to judge, I think, without making the trial, from the appearances—where there had been constipation of the bowels for seven days, a wound on the abdomen would certainly be more dangerous—it would be highly unfavourable—I have known repeated instances of wounds on the abdomen even where the peritoneum had been penetrated, having a favourable result.</p>

               <p>It would; and I apprehend in this case it was the cause of the seeming tightness of the bandages.</p>

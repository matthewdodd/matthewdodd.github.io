                  </hi>. On 12th of Sept. I was at the Cock and Neptune, Wellclose-square—the prisoner and Wootton were there talking—the prisoner took out a knife and put it behind him—the waiter came, caught at it, and cut his hand—I seized the prisoner and tried to get the kuife—I could not without cutting my hand—I took my handkerchief out to seize it with, and the pri<lb></lb>soner said, "By Jesus I will give it you," and I received a wound on my right knee which cut to the bone—I was taken to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. On 12th Sept. my brother was a fiddler, and I went to help him—I played the prisoner a tune—he was very disorderly—I think he was a little in liquor; he would not let anybody dance but himself—he danced till the sweat ran down his face—I then asked him to pay; he would not—I stood before him waiting for his money-be said 1 might <hi rend="italic">pick</hi> it out of him—he put his hand behind him—I beard the click of a knife—the waiter said, "For God's sake take care; he has a knife!"—I stood back—Bagg seized him—they both fell—the prisoner was first going to strike me with the knife, but they hallooed out—I jumped back—the waiter made a snap at the knife and cut "his own fingers—it was my jumping back and the waiter seizing him that prevented him hurting me—he and Bagg fell—he said, "By Jesus you shall have it!"—the knife was coming towards his breast, but he drew up his knee and it cut it.</p>
               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">WOOTTON</hi>. I am the brother of George Wootton—I was playing at the Cock and Neptune—the prisoner danced and would not pay me—he said when I played him another tune he would—we did so, and then he said if I wanted it I might pick it out of him—he put his hand into his pocket, put both his hands behind him. and with his right hand he thrust towards my brother—the waiter turned him round and cut his knuckles—Bagg then seized him, and he was down—the prisoner said, "By Jesus you shall have it!" and thrust towards his breast, but Bagg put up his knee and caught it.</p>

Having missed halfpence out of my desk several times, on the 14th of June last I took five shillings in halfpence to a scalemaker's, to be mark'd. The same night I put them loose in the desk, and in the morning there were six pennyworth gone. I took the rest out, and at night I put t he 4 s. 6 d. in again, and on the Wednesday morning there was 6 d. more gone, and on the Thursday morning 7 d. I then charged a constable with him, and found upon him 25 halfpence all mark'd, which I can swear to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the desk always open?</p>
               <p>Rustate. It stands upon the counter, and is always<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175607140008"></xptr> unlock'd. I put money therein, to defray the expences of the week; there is no lock to it. I took him before the alderman, where he own'd he took them out, but intended to put them in again.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did you ever miss any thing besides these?</p>
               <p>Rustate. I missed half pence before, which was the reason I had them mark'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the prisoner liberty to go to that desk, and take out money?</p>
               <p>Rustate. No, he had not; he was not shopman, he was porter.</p>

            . I am constable. Mr. Rustate sent for me on the 17th of June. The prisoner turn'd out 6 s. and 6 d. and a quantity of half-pence, out of which Mr. Rustate took up 12 d. halfpenny. The prisoner own'd he took them in order to buy a frock, but intended to put them in again (the halfpence produced in court) they have been in my custody ever since.</p>

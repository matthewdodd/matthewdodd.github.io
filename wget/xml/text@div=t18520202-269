I was called into the Black Horse on 21st Jan.—there was a dispute about some money—I heard what was said—I saw on the counter two half crowns, four shillings, a sixpence, and some halfpence—the prisoner pointed out one of the half crowns to me as being counterfeit—he said the barman gave it him—I bit it, and made four marks on the head side with my teeth—the prisoner said he would summon the landlord, and he took his name down—I saw the half crown at the station afterwards in possession of Watson—I looked to see whether the marks were on it that I had made, and they were—in about three quarters of an hour after I left the Black Horse I saw the prisoner in custody of Watson—I asked him what be bad the prisoner in custody for—he said for trying to <hi rend="italic">ring the changes</hi>—I asked what the money was he had been trying to <hi rend="italic">ring</hi>—he said half a crown—I said if it was the same half crown I should know it, for he had been trying the same thing at another house, and I had marked the half crown—I went to the station, and described the half crown.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 1st of April, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was in Bishopsgate-street, with Herdsfield, and saw a man walking backwards and forwards - I watched, and in a few minutes, saw the prisoner going along with a truss on his back; I laid hold of him - two persons were very close behind him. I said,</p>
               <p>"Where did you get this," and it directly tell on the pavement; whether Herdsfield threw it off his shoulder, I cannot say, but I believe he threw it down himself. He said at the Mansion House, that a man gave it to him to carry; Herdsfield is not here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You will not swear that Herdsfield did not push it off his shoulder - A. I believe he did not.</p>

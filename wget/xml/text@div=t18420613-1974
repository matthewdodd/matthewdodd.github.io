On the 17th of May, be<lb></lb>tween eight and nine o'clock, I was on duty in Greenwich fair, and saw the prisoner attempt different persons' pockets—he went up to a gentle<lb></lb>man behind Richardson's show, put his left hand into the gentleman's pocket, lift it, put his right hand in, drew the handkerchief out, and put it under his waistcoat—I took hold of him, and took the handkerchief from under his waistcoat—I went, and asked the gentleman if he had lost his handkerchief—he put his hand into his pocket, and said be had—I told him to come to the station with me—he was coming, but there was a great rush, and I lost him—he did not come to the station.</p>

I, in company with another officer, went to the prisoner's house in Wilderness-row on the evening of 7th December—a gentleman named Willis was also present—it is a small shop, and the business of a refiner and gilder is carried on there—there are jewellery, chains, rings, and so on, in the window—he was not at home when I went—I afterwards found him in a public-house in St. John-street, Clerkenwell—I asked him if he had bought any jewellery that day—he said, "No"—I said, "Are you sure that you have not bought any gold rings to<lb></lb>day?"—he said, "No, I do not remember that I have"—I asked him if he had any books—he said, "Yes"—I asked him if they would tell—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Now, Mr. Collingridge, do you mean to tell me that you have not bought any unfinished rings to<lb></lb>day?"—I pointed to a cab that was standing at the corner of Wilderness-row, and said, "For I have a man in there of whom you bought some"—he said, "I have some faint recollection of buying two rings last night"—this was about half-past 10—I said, "Come along with me; I must have the property," and then we went up Wilderness-row towards his door—he then half-fainted, and fell against the door-post—he said, "Oh, I have a piece of paper that will clear me"—he gave me a letter and these fifteen rings—I observed him putting his hand up his sleeve—I said, leaning across the table, "What have you there, Colling-ridge?" taking hold of his hand—I opened it, and took from it these two rings—I said, "How do you account for the possession of these rings?"—he said, "I do not know, Oh! I bought them of a man over the counter to<lb></lb>day"—I said, "Who is the man?"—he said he was a stranger—I said, "Where are your books?"—he said, "In here," and he went into the front</p>

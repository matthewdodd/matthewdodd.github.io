                  </hi>. I am a watch-maker, and live in Finsbury-place. The prisoner had the interior of this watch to repair—he brought it back, and about two or three days afterwards, I missed it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's son. On the 9th of October, the prisoner came to the shop—he said, "I have seen your father, and he told me to tell you to give me the watch," pointing to it—I gave it to him—I was going to take the movement out of the case, and he said, "Do not trouble yourself, you will have it back this evening"—he called his apprentice in, and said, "You will have to bring the watch back this even<lb></lb>ing—mind you take care of it"—I did not see it again till he was taken.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 20th of April, about twenty minutes after eight o'clock, the prisoner knocked at the door; I am sure of his person; I opened it, he asked if my master was at home, I said Yes, but he had not come down stairs, and I would go and see if he was up; he said he came to know what quantity of Irish linen was to be brought to be looked at. I went up to the first floor, leaving him in the passage and the door open. I asked him to sit down in the hall, he declined, but afterwards sat down. I came down, shut the door, and told him my master was not come down, and told him to wait. I went down stairs, and in about five minutes heard the street-door shut; I supposed that my master had seen him, and he was gone. About half an hour after, my master asked me about a roll of broad cloth which I had taken in the night before. It was in the cutting-room at the end of the passage when he came: I looked and it was gone. I am certain he is the man. The cloth is worth 14 l.</p>

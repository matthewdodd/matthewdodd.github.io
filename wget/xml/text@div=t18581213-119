                  </hi>. I am an apprentice in Great Cambridge street, Shoreditch—the prisoner was also apprentice there—he has been there about eight months—I was there before—on the afternoon of 9th December, we were both at work in the shop—I looked at his work and told him it must be cut out again—he asked me to let him look at it—I did, and he said it wanted no cutting—I asked him to give it me again and he would not—I took it from him, and he said he would stab me—he had not a knife in his hand, but he looked about and found one—he tried to stab me in the stomach—I told him to put it down, and I took hold of his two hands and he dropped the knife—he took it again and stabbed me in the thigh—he said he wished it had been sharper, and he said, when he had done it, "Now, go and tell your master, like another baby"—this is the knife he did it with—it is my own knife.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I only meant to stick it in his hand to make him leave off—he said he would punch me in the mouth: I said, "Well, do it;" and he took up his fist, and punched me in the mouth.</p>

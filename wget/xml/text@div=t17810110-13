On Friday last about half after five in the afternoon, I was going to the door to fetch a barrel of herrings in. I missed the barrel. I enquired of a little lad just by, who said he saw two men take them from the door. I enquired of several people and was directed which way they went, rolling it along the ground. I overtook them both in Bow-street, near Broad St. Giles's. They were at the top of the street, about 500 yards from our shop; I laid hold of them both and asked them where they were going with the barrel? They asked what it was to me? I said they should soon know what business it was to me. I called to some of the neighbours, as I was known there. They did not resist; I took them back to the shop and left two people in care of the barrel. The prisoners were taken to the office in Bow-street, and committed that night.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was your barrel of fish? - I know the barrel very well though there was no particular mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Did they give any account how they came by it? - They said they found it in the horse-way in the street.</p>

               <p>Was you there on Friday last? - Yes, playing about the door; there was a cask lying on the iron rails of the cellar window; two soldiers took it and attempted to help it upon one of their backs; his hat fell off, and then they rolled it along the ground towards Holbourn, and went up Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Did you see any person stop them? - I saw Mr. Bishop's man stop them and collar them both; he took them home. I took care of the barrel, and then it was rolled home.</p>

               <p>My comrade and I were going home to our quarters on Friday last about a quarter after five; there was a man with a cask at the door. He said, soldiers, if you will take<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178101100014"></xptr> this cask to the top of Bow-street, I will give you sixpence. He said he was going to call at an house there, and would be with us presently. We rolled it across the street-way and coach-stand, we never saw the man any more.</p>

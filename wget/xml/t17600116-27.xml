               <p>Trigg. Within about fifty or sixty yards; it was set behind a window shutter, and the prisoner was near it: I made him take it and bring it back again to my master's shop.</p>

               <p>J. Boyce. No, I did not. I told Mr. Matthews's servant of it, went along with him, and shewed him where it was.</p>

               <p>I know nothing at all of it. Why did not that witness go and tell the master of it in the mean time? I know nothing in the world of it, was I to be hanged for it.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner to Mr. Matthews. Whether I did not use to carry goods for you?</p>
               <p>Matthews. The prisoner is a porter, he goes any where where he can; I have employed him. He ha received money for me, and always behaved well before this.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you employed him?</p>
               <p>Matthews. At time for these 2 years, or better. I always found him very honest.</p>

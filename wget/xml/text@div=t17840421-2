             sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. Relate what you know of your own knowledge against the prisoner? - On the 24th of May, I fastened my door at past twelve at night, there was a difference between my husband and me, and I believe the prisoner knew that I was alone; I live in <placeName id="t17840421-2-crimeloc8">Eyre-street</placeName>

               <p>Court. Where were your lodgers at night when you fastened up your door? - They were all in bed, they have a private door, the lodgers come in by the passage door; I am sure they were all gone to bed; and when I came out in the morning, my shop door next the street was open, the street door was fast, and the lock of the shop door was spoiled.</p>
               <p>When you alarmed your lodgers, what became of the man? - He made off when I slammed the door, he put his hand to his right breeches pocket, and felt his pocket, he took nothing out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>What did you lose? - There were twelve pounds of tallow candles, a pound of tea, and the other things in the indictment, the till was taken away; the till and the tea cannisters were found again.</p>
               <p>Were any of them ever found on the prisoner? - Never.</p>
               <p>What light had you when this man came in? - There was light enough to see what I had to do, and I was three minutes looking at him when he came; if I was a dying I think I must own him to be the man.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - I never saw him to my knowledge before.</p>
               <p>How came you to say, in the beginning of your evidence, that you believed he knew you was alone? - He had been frequently about the neighbourhood, as I have been informed, I might have seen him, but not to know him.</p>
               <p>How long was it after you first heard the noise of this breaking of the glass, before you saw this man come into your room? - It was a long time, it was totally dark at first.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270006"></xptr>Then it most be a long while? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What hour did you get up? - About three in the morning, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Do you undertake to swear quite positively, that the prisoner was the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you got any of your things again? - I have got none of my property, only the man seemed to hang about the neighbourhood, and I wish he was at liberty, but I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Jury. How was your shop door fastened that night? - Bolted and locked, the lock was picked, nothing was forced, the bolts got undone by being shook.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, Mr. Akerman's books will prove where I was on the 24th of May, I was in Newgate from some time in March till the July sessions, then I was discharged.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Newman. Was this man in your custody? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Townsend. Yes, my Lord, he was, he was left for the opinion of the twelve Judges.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am as innocent of that other affair as I am of this, only through that woman persuading the people, and I hope such a woman as this will be made an example of.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. Indeed, Mr. Randall, if I was a dying I think it was you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, if I had not been in such an unhappy place, my life would have been sworn away.</p>
               <p>Court to Townsend. Was that the man that lay in the p rison from March to July? - Yes, my Lord, I am very sure of that.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. You should certainly be more careful in swearing positively to the persons of men.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. My Lord, here is the Sessions-paper, and it appears that a man of the name of

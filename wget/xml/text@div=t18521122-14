                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 4, White Rose-court, Coleman-street. On Wednesday morning, 3rd Nov., I was going up that court—I saw two persons standing at the corner—when I had arrived some yards beyond Mr. Willard's premises, I heard some glass drop; I turned round sharply, and saw the figure of a man drop from the door—he went down the court into Coleman-street, and passed the constable; I did not see him go towards the other two men—they had left a second or two previous to that—they went towards Finsbury—he went out of the court the same way as the two men had gone—I saw the policeman not half a second after seeing the man drop from the window—I saw him pass the constable—the constable came to the corner as the man passed him—the constable made an observa<lb></lb>tion to me, and I told him something—I did not point out anybody—he saw some men walking down the street, and he pursued them—I stood at the corner—I could not tell you who the man was that dropped from the door; I could not recognize him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 150). On the morning in question I heard a smash of glass in White Rose-court, as I was coming up Coleman-street; I was within five yards of the court—when I got to the entry of the court I met two men coming out, and a third man just behind,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185211220020"></xptr>
               <p>with his hat off—that third man was the prisoner; he was coming out; he had an umbrella in his hand; it appeared to me that he had just picked it up from the ground—he had his hat in his hand—the two men walked down Coleman-street, and the prisoner followed them—they were all looking back when I came into the street—when they saw me they all three ran—the prisoner ran through the court separately, by himself—last witness made a communication to me, and I followed the three persons; there were no other persons in the street—it was half past 1 o'clock in the morning—I apprehended the prisoner after a long run—I never lost sight of him—he asked me what he had done—I told him there was no need of me telling him that, he knew as well as me—he said, "If I have done anything I will pay for it, rather than be locked up; it will ruin my character, and lose me my situation; it was only an accident through the umbrella"—I had not said anything to him about the window before that—I took him back, and told him I should charge him with breaking the window—he said it was an accident before I said anything about breaking the window—I told him directly that I should take him into custody about breaking the window—he replied that he would rather pay for it than be taken into custody; I was not then aware there had been an attempt at burglary—I did not examine the premises afterwards—I took the prisoner to the station—I afterwards saw Mr. Willard—he came to the station immediately afterwards—the prisoner said at the station that he lived at 25, Ratcliff-highway—he at first said 21, and then 25—I have been there, but no one knew anything of him—he also said there was a register ticket at the Sailors' Home, and he was steward on board a ship—I have made inquiries as to that, but no one there knew him—they examined their book—I found nothing on him—I found some treacle on his shirt, and on the sleeves of his coat—he had a wig on his head; he has it on now.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>). From information I received I went to Mr. Willard's house, at half past 1 o'clock on the morning of 3rd Nov., about ten minutes after the prisoner was given into custody—I found the fanlight of the side door to be smeared with treacle, and it was running down the door as well as round the frame, where the glass had been cut from—the fanlight was rather more than seven feet from the ground—the glass had been removed evidently by some sharp instrument; there was scarcely a bit of glass left in the frame, and you could see none by standing on the ground; but when we got up we could see a little piece at each corner of the bottom of the frame; it was cut as if by a diamond; some sharp instrument must have removed it down to the putty—after the door was opened I found a treacle plaister on the floor, about a foot and a half wide, with some of the glass adhering to it, which I have here now (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—there is glass on it now—just by the handle, against the door, there was a mark of dirt, as though it was road dirt; it appeared to me that a foot of some person had just touched there—that was about half the distance between the door and fanlight—it was just the place likely to receive a foot; it would be the first resting place—I examined the prisoner's dress—I found some treacle quite wet on the front of his shirt—the stain is now visible—the right sleeve of the coat was besmeared with treacle, just about the part where it would be resting on the frame—it is dry now, but it was then wet.</p>

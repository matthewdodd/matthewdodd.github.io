                  </hi>. I am a potman, and work at No. 255, Euston Road—I have known the prisoners for about eight or nine years—I have seen them together frequently—nearly three years ago I gave evidence on a trial against two girls named Murphy, whom I have seen in company of the three prisoners—since that Nolan has spoken to me on the subject, but only when he has been in liquor—he said he would give me a good hiding the first time he got a chance—he said that every time he was in liquor, not when he was sober—on Sunday night, the 12th August, I was at the corner of Tottenham Court Road, smoking my pipe—it was near on half-past twelve o'clock—I had not seen the prisoners on that day beforethen—I saw Nolan, Gairdelli, Cane, and two others coming from an ice shop about twenty yards from me—they came close against me, and Nolan began to bully me, and called me a b—policeman's <hi rend="italic">nark</hi>—that means a man who watches out for the police—I told him I was not a policeman's <hi rend="italic">nark</hi>, and why should he come up insulting me as he had done for the last three years, and he then repeated that I was a policeman's <hi rend="italic">nark</hi>—(the other prisoners were within hearing)—I told him I was not, when Gairdelli seized me by the collar with his left hand, put his hand to my stomach and stabbed me with a knife—I saw the knife in his hand when he was coming from the ice shop—he was spinning it in his hand, throwing it up and catching it—it was an open pocket-knife, with a spring back—I had seen him throwing up the knife before Nolan spoke to me, and when he caught me by the collar I saw the knife in his hand—he caught me in this way, saying, "Take that; I will rip your b—guts up"—I felt as if water was trickling from my stomach, and found there was blood from my hand when I drew it from my stomach—I showed it to them, and Gairdelli then said, "Take that, you b—that will do for you"—when he said that, the knife was in his hand—Nolan then said to Gairdelli, "Give me the knife and take your b——hook"—Gairdelli threw the knife to Nolan, who was close against him—it did not fall to the ground, it was caught by Nolan—it was open then—Nolan wiped the knife, closed it, and put it in his right-hand trousers pocket—Gairdelli stooped down among the gang of chaps that were there, and got away—there were three more besides the five I have mentioned—while this was occurring Cane was standing amongst them; the other three came up after I was stabbed—at the time I was stabbed there were only the three prisoners and the two girls—Cane was near enough to hear all that occurred—after Nolan put the knife in his pocket he went away—Cane stood at the corner, and as I was making my way to the hospital he followed me, and came behind and kicked me in Tottenham Court Road, as I clung to a cab, while staggering to the hospital—he did not say a word to me—I said, "All right, Ted; I shall know you"—I was taken into the hospital and properly attended to—Nolan was in liquor—Gairdelli and Cane were sober.</p>

                  </hi> (Policeman 117 E). On 17th August I went to Brook Street, Euston Road—I saw Nolan come out of there—I stopped him and told him he was wanted for being concerned, with a man named Gairdelli, in stabbing a man in Tottenham Court Road—he said, "I know nothing about it; I was not there; I do not know Gairdelli"—I told him that was very strange, as I knew Gairdelli lived with him at his mother's house, which I did know—he said, "I do not know him," and I took him to the station—afterwards, on the 22nd August, I took Cane into custody in Great Marlborough Street, close to the police-court—I told him he was wanted for assaulting William Paul, after being stabbed in the Tottenham Court Road, on the morning of the 13th August—he said, "I was not there"—he also said, "Why should I assault Paul, when I never owed him any revenge?"—I took him to the hospital to be identified, and then Paul made a statement, which the house surgeon took down—it was said loud</p>

               <p>Nolan received a good character.</p>

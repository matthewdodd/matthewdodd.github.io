                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, in the Broadway, West<lb></lb>minster, and also am a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-proprietor. I have employed the prisoner eight months as a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-builder—on the Friday before I went before the Magistrate, I observed a basket, at the end at the bench where the prisoner works, covered over with a jacket—I went again, after the prisoner had left work, turned the basket out, and found it contained a portion of the carriage of a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, cut in three pieces, and a piece of plain wood—I let the basket remain, and saw it on the Saturday and Sunday—I went to inform the police, and as I was going I met the prisoner—on the Monday morning, between 8 and 9 o'clock, a constable came and fetched me—I went to the station, and there found the prisoner, and the basket with the wood in it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had previously noticed this piece with a mark on it—the prisoner had no authority to take away any wood or chips—I had told him on the Tuesday previous to let no one take any away.</p>

I was watching Mr. Kennet's yard on the Monday morning, and saw the prisoner come out with this basket—I asked him what he had in the basket—he said, "Nothing but chips"—I took him into custody—he then said he had been working for Mr. Kennet five months, and be hoped be would not be locked up, he had nothing but chips, and Mr. Kennet owed him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Thos. Sampson, 252, Marylebone Road—I have known Willshire as being employed by Mr. Bretton, a solicitor—early in June he came to Mr. Sampson's office with a Mr. Carr (I had had a communication with Mr. Sampson as to an inter<lb></lb>pleader)—I said "What Mr. Carr is it?"—he said "The claimant," or "One of the claimants in the interpleader; I have brought him in order that he may know you; he will be at Westminster"—on Tuesday, 12th June, about 9.30, the defendant called at Mr. Sampson's office, and handed me these two documents and another one—he said "These are the affidavits to be used in the interpleader summons"—I said "This morning?"—he said "Yes"—I said "What about copies for the other side?"—he either said "I have sent them," or "They have had them"—either I or Mr. Sampson said "What about the fee for the attendance this morning?"—he said "I will meet you this morning at Westminster before the summons comes on"—I went to Westminster, and attended before the President of the Divorce Court—Mr. Herbert was there repre<lb></lb>senting the execution creditor; Mr. Maynard, the Sheriff, and myself the claimants—I showed these three documents to Mr. Herbert, and we all went before the President, and after reading the affidavits Mr. Herbert elected to take an issue—the papers were handed back to me—they were not then stamped—Willshire had said he would meet me to file the documents—I afterwards met him in the hall, and he handed me this affidavit of 12th June—I put the stamps on the four affidavits and handed them to the clerk to file.</p>

               <p>right and did not affect me in any way—he said they were to do with protecting his furniture—I signed the two papers—they had Mr. Samp<lb></lb>son's name outside—this is one of them—that is my signature—I was never sworn to it—before he went away he gave me this receipt for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for his furniture, as he put it—it is dated 19th September, 1876—it is not true that I paid him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for furniture, or that the furniture at Church Street was let by me to Mr. S. Carr, or that they were my sole property—he said he had a friend outside, would I be introduced to him—I said I had no objection—I went out and was introduced to Carr, but finding him anything but a gentleman I did not stop a moment—I don't think there was any heading or jurat to this affidavit when I signed it—I could not swear about the heading, but I am certain there was nothing at the bottom—on 12th June I went to Mr. Herbert's office, and had a conversa<lb></lb>tion with him, in consequence of which an affidavit was prepared for me—on the morning of the 13th I went to Somerset House and inspected the affidavit purporting to have been made by me—I am acquainted with the prisoner's handwriting—to the best of my belief this receipt is His writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been in business four or five years—I did not read the documents which the defendant asked me to sign—I did not know the nature of them—I knew partially what was in them, that it was to protect his furniture—I certainly did not know that I was signing an affidavit, I swear that—I asked the purport of it, and he said it was to protect his furniture—I won't pledge myself that I did not read it—I believed in the man implicitly—he had acted as my solicitor for two years—I don't believe I read either "of the papers—I did not know the nature of the other document, nor do I now, unless—it was a list of his furniture—I have seen it since at Somerset House, and at Bow Street, I think—it was an agreement—I can't say that I knew then what it was—I know it referred to his furniture, and I knew no more—I can't say whether it was an agreement for the hire of his furniture—I won't swear one way or the other—I could not tell you whether there was a date to it—I did not ask why it was dated 19th September, 1876—I saw on it, "Received of Mr. J. N. Abel 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for furniture"—I knew that the whole thing was fictitious—I did not say anything—in September, 1876, the defendant did not ask me to lend him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that I swear; unfortunately I gave him my acceptance for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was to buy some property for myself, not to lend him—it had nothing to do with this case—he did not ask me to lend him my acceptance for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his own benefit, nor did I do so—I did give him my acceptance for 50/. but not for his own use—I paid it in January or February—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I have accepted more than one bill for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I handed to the prisoner—Mr. Good discounted one bill and renewed it, and the renewal was paid—I see Good's name on the back of this bill—I presume that the proceeds of that bill went from Good to the prisoner—I was not called upon to pay this bill, because I gave another in its place—I don't know that that second bill was dis<lb></lb>counted by a man named Eyre—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>) I suppose I received this letter and sent it to the prisoner, calling his attention to it—I have no doubt, now I see that letter, that Eyre did discount the bill and applied to me for the money, but I did not remember the name—this is another matter, quite foreign to this case—there have been two or three bills, I can't remember which was which—this letter is dated 5th May, 1877—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Richardson, of 12, Upper George Street, Bryanstone Square—in August, 1876, I lent 25/. to the defendant upon some furniture, which I removed to my own warehouse—the defendant repaid me on the 11th October, 1876, by a cheque, and removed the goods, but I do not know where to—I should not know the cheque again—I do not think I could identify the name.</p>

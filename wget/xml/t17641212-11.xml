On the 21st, the prisoner took an opportunity of staying till all the rest of the men were gone to breakfast; and after he was gone, the plates were missing. I went to Guildhall, and took a search-warrant, and went to his lodgings in a little street near Break-neck stairs, at the house of one Harris; there we found seven plates, a mustard pot, and pepper caster; two of the plates we had missed a day or two before; five of the plates were marked; I saw my apprentice mark them: upon my shewing the prisoner the things, he begged pardon, and offered to go down on his knee. I took him before the Alderman; there he owned the fact.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176412120007"></xptr> (The five plater produced and deposed to). He worked for me at nine shillings per week; he turned a wheel, and portered for me.</p>

               <p>Had you any thing to do with this at all? - No, Sir, upon my oath I had not, I was not to have any part of the value, nothing but the pint of beer; I never saw the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>- SCAFE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a cooper at Mr. Calvert's house; this cellar is rented by Mr. Poole and Mr. Boulton; the butts and hoops that were there are Mess. Calvert's, and Co. I went into the cellar the Friday after we heard of it; I found there was missing to the amount of seventy-seven iron hoops off of different tubs; I counted them three or four times over, and in beer and water I was almost over my boots; there was run out between fifteen and twenty barrels of beer; there was not an iron hoop in the cellar, but what was left on the tubs; the prisoner had been a drayman, and worked with Mr. Hale in Red-cross-street.</p>
               <p>- ISAACS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am constable of Clerkenwell, I had information, and went with the lad, and he pointed him out, thirty yards off; I took him, and he threw me down, and he wrenched this stick out of my hand, and beat me with it; I have a bandage over my loins now.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I know nothing of it any more than a child unborn; I never was in any cellar; I never stole a hoop since I was born from my mother; I know the lad Oldfield; at the time he first swore to me, I was as black as a chimney-sweeper; I never saw him before he swore against me.</p>
               <p>Jury to Scafe. Was the door of that cellar locked? - Yes, it was, the lock was wrenched off.</p>
               <p>Did the hoops appear to have been fresh knocked off? - Some of them did; I never was in the cellar before.</p>
               <p>Jury to Oldfield. Are you sure of the man? - I am clear of him, I did not see him break the lock, I saw him take the flap up, he had a brewer's jacket on.</p>

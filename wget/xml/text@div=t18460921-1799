                  </hi>. I am not in any business—I live in Margaret-street, I Cavendish-square. About the middle of Feb. this year I was in the habit of transacting business with Fabian and Co., share agents, in the City—I did not usually go to their place of business—I met Fabian usually at the West India Coffee-house—I occasionally went to their counting-house, but more frequently to Garraway's—I was introduced to the prisoner at the counting-house, about six weeks after the first transaction with Fabian as likely to do business together, and they occupied this office—after that I raised money on certain scrip of the Buckinghamshire Railway—I acted for Mr. Fabian—I did not know Mr. Falkner—after I was introduced to Falkner I continued to raise money on these shares—I went to Worthing to Falkner on Good-Friday, and spent two days with him there, and we thought of going into some large business together, in the shipping way—that was my introduction to him—I did not have any communication with Falkner on the subject of the Buckingham shares—I paid the money I raised from time to time to Mr. Fabian, usually at the Hall of Commerce, at Garraway's, and at the Jamaica Coffee-house—I have left money at the counting-house, and have seen Mr. Fabian and Mr. Falkner in the office—I received the shares from, Fabian—he had offered me other shares, and I never would take them—I only took the Buckinghamshire shares—I did not receive any of those shares, I from Falkner, or in his presence, not for him to know anything about what we were doing—among other persons, I raised money frcm Mr. Killick on these shares—it must have been previous to May last, because it was one of my first transactions—there were three transactions with him—they were previous to the month of May—I cannot be certain whether those three transactions were before or after my meeting with Solomon; I can hardly say—about the 6th or 7th of May last, I think, this matter became the subject of inquiry—I think one of my transactions with Killick must have feen before that, before these parties were in custody—I do not know Mr. Beaton—I did not raise money of him by these shares—I know Mr. Solomon, the pro<lb></lb>secutor—he lives in Jermyn-street, St. James's—about the 6th of May I raised money from him on some of these Buckingham shares—it must been before the 6th of May—I acted for Mr. Fabian in raising that money from Mr. Solomons—I cannot positively say whether I was at Falkner and Fabian's office on the 6th of May—I was in the City that day, and saw Fabian—I cannot say whether I met him out of the office or in the office—I remember Mr. Fabian saying something about the urgent necessity of raising money before four o'clock—Mr. Fabian went with me westward—we took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> near the Bank—I do not think I saw Falkner that day before I took the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I dined with Falkner and Fabian after the transaction—I do not think I saw Mr. Falkner that day before the transaction—I cannot positively swear it, be<lb></lb>cause I spent the whole of that day nearly with Fabian—I cannot say I saw him that day, except at dinner—afterwards I went up with Fabian to Mr. Solomon's—I did not take any of the scrip with me—he had no scrip with him—we went to ask Mr. Solomon the question whether, if scrip was left, he would advance any more money that day—I do not think Falkner knew what Fabian was going to do, till we had ascertained whether money could he had that day or not—Mr. Solomon agreed to advance money if Mr. Fabian would get the shares—I waited there while Fabian went to procure the scrip—he re<lb></lb>turned with it—the transaction was completed by the advance of the money—I then left him till six o'clock, when I dined with them—Fabian then said some<lb></lb>thing about the money that had been obtained—I do not recollect what Faulkner said particularly—I have made a general statement of the whole tranaction</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184609210030"></xptr>
               <p>to my own solicitor—I did not see Falkner on the subject of the advance by Solomons that day, before I went up to him—I do not think that the ap<lb></lb>plication to Mr. Solomons on the 6th of May was known to Falkner—I do not know what occurred when Fabian went back to the City, not speaking from my own knowledge.</p>

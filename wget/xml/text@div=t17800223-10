             and a man who was with us, who said he was an excise-officer, desired me not.</p>
               <p>Who was with her? - The prisoner Thomas was then upon her upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Where was the other prisoner? - He was standing at the next door, the two doors are close together.</p>
               <p>You did not offer to assist her? - No.</p>
               <p>What did the deceased say? - She said, Ladies, ladies, have compassion upon a woman! I would have gone to her assistance but the custom-house-officer would not let us; he said we should be served the same.</p>
               <p>Was Thomas lying with her or beating her? - He was upon her.</p>
               <p>Lying with her? - I do not know that; he was lying upon her, on the pavement. We came down the Bank again for another dram, and then went up again, and then the other prisoner was lying upon her, and Thomas was kicking either him or the deceased.</p>
               <p>How many drams had you? - Four drams.</p>
               <p>In what time? - Between the hours of two and four in the morning.</p>
               <p>Had you been a-bed? - Yes, from nine o'clock. We got up to get some water, as it was Christmas time we had been drinking and were thirsty.</p>
               <p>Eyres you say was lying with her when you came back again? - Yes. We came down the Bank a little, then three men came out; I stopped at the watch-house door to look at them as they passed to see if I knew either of them; the prisoners were two of those men. I did not know the other three men, but the two prisoners are the men who lay with the woman. When they came by the watch-house door

             said to Eyres I did not think you had been such a man. I said, d - n your blood, if you had served me so I would have hanged you if you had all the necks in the world. Then as we were about to go home we met with the excise-officer again; we went up the Bank again with him; then we saw the deceased stuck up against a door; I said to her are not you ashamed, such an old woman as you, to lie with so many fellows? She replied, how could I help myself against so many?</p>


               <p>Did she come by the place where the five men went on? - She was farther on towards Rosemary-lane. She had no marks of violence upon her but only her eyes were swelled very much.</p>
               <p>You understood at that time that the men had lain with her, by her consent? - Yes. Those were the words she said to me;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230016"></xptr>that was the last time we came down the Bank. I saw no more of her after that.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see her before? - No.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How far was this from the watch-house door where you saw the men lying with her - It was about forty yards, was it not? - No.</p>
               <p>It was within call of the watch-house, was it not? - No; it was in another parish.</p>
               <p>Was it more than fifty yards? - I dare say it was above fifty or sixty yards.</p>
               <p>Where did you see that the deceased's eyes were swelled? - When she was at the next door to the King of Prussia's Head.</p>
               <p>There is no lamp I believe on Saltpetre-Bank? - There may be one at the top, and one at the bottom for what I know.</p>
               <p>If you saw it, it was by moon-light? - It was a very moon-light, sharp, frosty night.</p>
               <p>Saltpetre-Bank is a place pretty much frequented at all hours of the night, I believe? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You know Saltpetre Bank very well, and what sort of houses there are there? - I was born and bred in the parish, and therefore ought to know it.</p>

             said, was not she ashamed of herself to be concerned with so many men? she said, my dear woman, how could I help myself with so many men. She spoke very faint. We said we could not tell her where to get a lodging. We left her standing at the door. We went to the Black-Lion and had a pint of two-penny; coming down again from the Black-Lion I saw her stand, leaning against the watch-house gate, I took no notice then, but went home and went to bed.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>You are a surgeon? - I am.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the body of the deceased? - On Monday the 27th of December last I was desired by the churchwardens to examine the body of the deceased, to see whether it was necessary to have a coroner's inquest upon it. She was bruised in a violent manner in various parts of the body; her knees were bruised and discoloured exceedingly; her arms were excoriated from the elbow; her eyes were black, and swelled almost out of her head; there was a blow upon her temple, and a wound under her left jaw, which wound was triangular, and seemed to be made by a tuck out of a stick, or something of that fort. I told the churchwarden it would be highly necessary to have a coroner's inquest. On the Tuesday following I was desired to open the body, which I did, I then traced the wound to its exit; I found it about three quarters of an inch deep. I took off the scalp, and part of the skull, and examined the brain. I did not perceive any injury upon the brain.</p>
               <p>Were any of the bruises that you saw likely to occasion her death, or in your judgement did occasion it? - I could not take upon me to swear that any of the wounds or bruises were the immediate cause of the death. I look upon it that the treatment the woman received was the first cause, and the inclemency of the weather the second or finishing cause.</p>
               <p>But none of the wounds would have occasioned her death? - Not from their appearance they would not.</p>


               <p>Upon the whole you imputed her death to the inclemency of the weather, her being out all night as you heard she was? - I look upon that to be only the secondary cause. I believe the inclemency of the weather would not have destroyed her if she had not been so ill treated before; being struggling, and her spirits exhausted, she might be left in such a state that the inclemency of the weather might take greater effect.</p>
               <p>Was the weather remarkably severe then? - Exceedingly so.</p>
               <p>If a person was in a state of health before, might not the inclemency of the weather have occasioned death though these bruises or wounds had never happened? - Unless they were intoxicated and lay exposed motionless, but that did not seem to be her case.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Was it on the Monday or the Tuesday that you was called upon? - The Monday.</p>
               <p>Were you the first surgeon that examined the body? - I know nothing about that.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230018"></xptr>Do you know Mr. Slater and Mr. Hodgson? - I have seen the gentlemen once.</p>
               <p>And a Mr. Trower; do not you know a gentleman of the faculty of that name? - No. I never saw Mr. Slater in my life till he came to my house to examine me about the state of the woman's case.</p>
               <p>Are they men of character, and men of reputation in their profession? - I have nothing to say against the gentlemen's character. I know nothing of them; I never saw them in my life till they came to my house.</p>
               <p>Was there no surgeon before the coroner that examined the body besides you? - Not while I was in the room.</p>
               <p>Then it is mere conjecture whether any body examined the body besides you? - I was not present therefore I do not know what other people examined.</p>
               <p>You have heard of no examination? - The churchwarden told me afterwards it had been examined by other surgeons, but I was not present at that examination.</p>
               <p>You have informed the court that the weather may have been a secondary cause, because you suppose that her struggling, and spirits being exhausted, might have hastened her death; how can you possibly know whether she had struggled and her spirits were exhausted? - Her elbows being bruised, and the skin rubbed, I look upon to be a struggling to get clear of the men.</p>
               <p>And you conclude from thence that her spirits must be exhausted too? - I should suppose that a woman who is laid with against her will would struggle till she is much exhausted.</p>
               <p>You never heard of any person being frozen to death? - Certainly they have.</p>
               <p>But not unless the person is intoxicated? - Yes, if a person falls asleep.</p>
               <p>Why is not Mary Hill here? - She desired of myself and the churchwarden, that if it was possible to do without her, she might not to be called.</p>
               <p>- CHINNER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the overseers of the parish of St. John, Wapping. On Sunday the 26th of December, after the morning service, word was brought to the church that there was a woman brought into the work-house and died almost instantly as she was brought in. I never saw her till after she was dead. The churchwarden and myself after the service was over went up to the work-house; we saw the body, and there appeared to us, myself and the upper churchwarden Mr. William, some marks of violence; we called upon Mr. Hodgson desiring him to go up with us to see the body; he was not at home; we went up by ourselves and viewed the body; it was our opinion there were marks of violence; we thought we should not be justified in burying the body without having a coroner's inquest held upon it; we applied to Mr. Horsfall. I did not think proper to retain any counsel in this matter, for I think that simple truth, without any dress, will have more weight than any thing else.</p>
               <p>Court. You should have had Mary Hill here. - The women have been threatened if they give evidence. I submit it to your lordship if that is right?</p>
               <p>Court. Certainly not, those threats are very wrong.</p>
               <p>- Jewson. I belong to the workhouse; we were sent to fetch her away in the chair; we found her lying upon the foot pavement facing the Swan in East Smithfield, about nine in the morning; we found her much bruised and beat.</p>
               <p>Did she say any thing to you? - She never spoke a word, we carried her to the work-house; we delivered her to the nurse of the ward; she died in five or six minutes after we got her in.</p>
               <p>You were not acquainted with the woman before? - No, I never saw her before.</p>

               <p>You are a surgeon? - I am.</p>
               <p>When was it that you examined this body? - On Sunday the 26th of December last, about three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>You have heard the account given by Mr. Horsfall? - I have.</p>
               <p>You examined the body accurately; inform the court whether there was any appearance of injury upon the body. - The external part of the trunk I examined most minutely; there was a very small wound on the lower part of the left jaw; I had not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230019"></xptr>any probe in my pocket; I borrowed a knitting needle to probe the depth of that wound, it went in a diagonal form, rather inclining upwards, it pointed as if coming out of the skin again; it seemed to be a superficial wound; it did not penetrate more than three quarters of an inch; her eyes were black as if she had received a blow or two upon them, there likewise were some bruises on the elbows, and on the knees; I think a trifling blow upon one side of the cheek, which appeared to me to be done by falling down, as if the woman had fallen, and by that means bruised herself: seeing these bruises of so trifling a nature, I was desirous of examining the viscera of the body and the brain, but Mr. Hodgson who examined with me said it was so clear a case it was not worth while to enter into the minutiae further. It appeared to me the woman died from the inclemency of the weather, and not from those bruises she had received. Mr. Trower, a gentleman of the faculty, who is now at Margate, was likewise with me, it was then our opinion that the bruises the woman had received could not by any means in the world have occasioned her death.</p>
               <p>And that is your opinion now? - It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. HODGSON sworn.</p>
               <p>You are a surgeon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You examined the body of this woman at the same time that Mr. Slater did? - Yes; I did not see any marks of violence, or wound that could have occasioned death.</p>
               <p>There was a Mr. Trower, a surgeon, with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You all concurred in the opinion? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have heard Mr. Horsfall's opinion about a primary and secondary cause, which I do not understand; is that opinion well or ill founded, can you make any sense of that distinction? - It is a rule for me only to speak to the facts that are before me.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Slater. Can you make any sense of this primary and secondary cause? - I do not understand it.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM STANLEY sworn.</p>
               <p>What time on Sunday morning did you got up? - At four o'clock in the morning; this woman was standing at the watch-house door then.</p>
               <p>How did she appear to you then, to be sober or in liquor? - I found it was four o'clock; I went home to bed again; I went home about a quarter before seven; this woman was upon her knees beating her head against the flag stones.</p>
               <p>Did you know her before? - I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>- KENT sworn.</p>
               <p>I was house-man at the watch-house. There was a woman came to the door about four o'clock; she laid hold of the spikes at the door and begged to come in. The officers, seeing her in liquor, would not let her in. They told her she had better go home to her lodging; she said she had got none, but d - n her the would come in there. The officer said she should not. At a quarter after five I locked up the watch-house and went away, and saw no more of her. I remember these women were going by the watch-house at the same time she stood there; she had something wrapped round her head, so that I could not see whether she was bruised or not.</p>
               <p>How near is your watch-house to the place where the two men had been lying with her? - I cannot say what part of Saltpetre Bank it was, because I heard no complaint about it. When she came to the watch-house she never made any complaint about her being ill used or any thing of that kind.</p>
               <p>Did you know her before? - I did not indeed.</p>

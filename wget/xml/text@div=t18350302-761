                  </hi>. I am a pastry-cook, and live in Ossulston-street, So-mers'-town. On the 15th of February, about nine o'clock at night, the prisoner and another female came into the shop—the other woman asked me to change a shilling—the prisoner gave me the shilling—I suspected it, and said it was a very bad one—she said it was good—I said, "I will show you the difference between a good one and a bad one"—I produced a good one from my till, and shewed it to her—she then said the good one, which was in my left hand, was her shilling; but I had hers in my right hand—I saw something in her hand, which I suspected was bad money—I put her out of the shop—she said she would not go till I gave her a good shilling, as she had given me a good one—a policeman came up, and I gave her in charge, and gave him the shilling—I marked it—I saw the policeman take a shilling from her hand—there could be no mistake about the shilling she gave me.</p>

I was on duty—I saw a crowd at the prosecutor's door—he gave the prisoner into my charge—I found her hand clenched, and asked what was in it—the said, "What I have there is my own"—I was obliged to force her hand open, and found a bad shilling in it—Dixon gave me another shilling—I produce them both.</p>

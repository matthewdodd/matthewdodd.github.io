               <p>Mr. Woser's premises—I saw a van drive up to the yard—Clark, the driver, and Goodall went into the Dun Horse public-house—after they came out the van was removed on the other side of the gate into Mr. Moser's premises—shortly after Clark backed the van into the gateway—I did not see what was done then—when it came out I saw a quantity of iron in it—all of it was not there when the van went inside, there was a singe bar on the top of the van when it was backed in—how it came there I don't know—when it came out there was round iron in bars and angle iron and a bundle of rods, "T. Smith, paid," was painted on one of the bars—the carman and Clark went into the Dun Horse again, and drank, and when they came out again, Clark went to his work and 'the van drove off—I drove after it to York-road, Battersea—it stopped at the back premises of the prisoner Smith—he is a smith and wheelwright—I saw the van partly unloaded there—Smith came out in his shirt sleeves, with a paper in his hand, while it was being unloaded—I then left and went back to Mr. Moser to tell him what I had done—afterwards, about 4 the same day, I went with, the constable Bell to Smith's premises—I saw the iron as soon as I entered the gate—I believe Bell asked Smith whether he had received any iron that morning—he said he had—he asked from whom—he said, "From Moser"—I said, "It is here" and he said, "Yes it is here, but I have an invoice"—he produced this invoice, and gave it to Bell—he was asked where the other part of the iron was—he said he did not know, for he was not there when the iron was brought—of course I knew it was him, because I had followed him on the 7th with iron from the same premises, but I thought he was noticing me in the cab, and gave it up—I saw Smith go into the Dun Horse with Clark and Goodall on that occasion.</p>

I am a warehouseman in Mr. Moser's employment—on the morning of 18th July I saw a van drive into the yard about five minutes past 8—half of the men go to breakfast at 8, and the remainder when the others return—Clark backed the van into the yard—there were then two flat bars of iron in it, one long bar and one short—I saw Clark put in first a bundle of sheet iron, next a bundle of five-eighth rods, inch round and inch square iron, two inch flat bars, and some two and a half angle bars—I judged there was about half a ton when I saw it go away—I went and communicated with Ballard to watch it wherever it went—he afterwards came and made a communication to Mr. Moser—I was called in and went with Ballard and Bell to Smith's premises at Battersea—I there found the iron which I had seen taken away—I asked Smith where the bundle of sheet-iron was and the bundle of rods—I had seen the other first—he denied receiving any other—Mr. Moser and I went into his back premises, and I saw the bundle of sheet-iron and the five-eighth rods on the side of the forge—I said, "That is the iron that was taken away this morning"—Smith replied "By-the-bye, I think my carman did bring a bundle of sheet-iron and a bundle of rods"—while we were there Smith opened the bundle of plate iron and commenced marking out. to cut up the first sheet in the bundle—I told him not to do it—he said he would not keep his men standing still, he must use it—I went again next day—I found the iron there then, there was one bar of iron short and one sheet of the bundle of plate iron short.</p>

               <p>information I received, I went to Smith's premises, at Battersea, with Ballard, Neale, and Mr. Moser—I asked him if he had received any iron from a firm in the Borough that day—he said he had—I asked what firm—he said, from Moser's—Neale then said, pointing to the iron, which was close by, "That is the iron that was taken away from the firm this morning"—I then asked Smith if he had paid for it—he said he had—I asked if he had got a bill or invoice—he said Yes, he had—he then produced this invoice—I examined it and asked if that was all the iron he had received—he said, Yes, that was all—I said, "Have you not received some sheet-iron and some five-eighth rod iron"—he said, "No, I have not," but directly afterwards he said, "Yes, I have received some sheet-iron and rod-iron, but I was not present when my man brought it home"—I examined the bill and the amount, and said, "The five-eighth rods and the sheet-iron is not down here"—he said, "Is it not? probably my man has brought it by mistake"—I then told him that the whole of the iron had been stolen from Messrs. Moser's in the Borough, and that I should take possession of it—he said, "Well, I have paid for it, and it shall not leave my yard"—I spoke to Mr. Moser, and then said, "As you have paid for it, who did you pay"—he said, "My man paid Clark, I gave him two sovereigns, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get him<lb></lb>self some refreshment, and he brought me back 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change"—after a little conversation I left, and then went to the carman, with Smith, at 34, York-terrace, twenty or thirty houses from Smith's house—I saw Staines, the carman, and asked him if he had received any iron from a firm and brought it to his master—he said Yes, he had—I asked who he paid for it—he said, "Clark, I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and brought the iron away"—I asked if he knew anything about the sheet-iron and rod-iron being placed in the van—he said no, he did not know, he took the order from his master—he did not mention a written order at the time—I then went to Messrs. Moser's, and took Clark into custody—I showed him this invoice—I found on him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some pieces of paper—he wrote a paper and handed it to me—I produce it—I saw the iron weighed when it was brought back—it weighed between ten and eleven cwt.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the Prisoner</hi>). I have pleaded guilty to the present indict<lb></lb>ment. I have known Smith seven or eight months. A week previous to 18th July, he told me that he had bought some iron, and that he had paid Mr. Sample in the office for it. He asked me to go and have something to drink, and he then said to me, "I want some iron," naming some different sorts; "if you can get that for me, I will send up some money for yourself." He was to send the first thing in the morning. On the Tuesday, about 8 in the morning, Smith's carman came, and I loaded him with four bars of angle iron, five bars of inch-square, two bars of three-inch, three bars of five-inch round, a bundle of five-inch rod, and a bundle of sheet-iron—he sent an order by the carman. This is the paper he sent—the carman gave me two sovereigns; they were in my pocket when I was taken to the station—the policeman did not take this paper, he never saw it; he took everything but that. I made out the invoice, because Mr. Smith's carman asked me to give him a receipt for what money he gave me.</p>

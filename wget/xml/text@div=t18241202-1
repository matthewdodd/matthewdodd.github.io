            . The prisoner occupied a shop on the ground floor, a little room which joins that shop, and a kitchen under his shop, on the basement story. This model (examining it) is a correct plan of the premises. The premises occupied by him have no communication whatever with my dwelling-house, nor any other part of the premises. While they were building there was a communication from his kitchen to mine, but that was stopped up four years ago, before the building was complete: it was a doorway, and was stopped up on my side, by a brick wall as thick as the party wall, except the width of the door. The door between his shop and parlour has six or eight panes of glass in it. On the night of the <rs id="t18241202-1-cd3" type="crimeDate">31st of October</rs>
                  <join result="offenceCrimeDate" targOrder="Y" targets="t18241202-1-off1 t18241202-1-cd3"></join> I and my family were all in bed by ten o'clock. Between half-past one and two I perceived a slight smoke in my bed-room; my wife awoke me - she is unable to attend here, being near her confinement. I attributed the smell to our night lamp being badly trimmed, but it gradually increased: I opened my bed-room window, and got into bed again; I had then been awake half or three quarters of an hour. A few minutes after half-past two, finding the smoke increase, I opened my room door, proceeded to search the house, and found smoke in every part of it. I went into my drawing-room, which is over the prisoner's shop; there is no carpet down - I ran across the floor; I had no shoes on, and I think I made sufficient noise for any one to hear below. I spoke to my family as I went into the different rooms. As I ran over the house I heard the shutters of the prisoner's room forced into the street; they are outside shutters, and fell completely into the street. I called to my family to hasten down, for Haley's premises must be on fire; we all left the house, and proceeded about fifty yards, to Mr. Illman's house, in Argyle-street; he took the family in, and I returned in two minutes, and perceived smoke issuing from over Haley's shop door, which is at the corner of Argyle-place and King-street. I also saw smoke ascending from the area grating in Argyle-place. I told two men to break the door open, and I ran for water, and on my return I found the shop door open, and saw fire burning in one corner of Haley's shop, over the covered way of the kitchen stair case; there was very little fire but much smoke - it was soon put out; there was still a very heavy smoke, but I could not tell where it proceeded from. I took some firemen with me, and went to examine my drawing-room floor. The ceiling of his shop is not plaister, but the joists are covered with wood, and is plugged, and the drawing-room floor is wood. I returned to the shop in three or five minutes, and observed a heavy smoke coming from the kitchen, up from the stair-case door, and from a hole which somebody had cut in the floor. I called to know if any one was below, and was told that two men were - it was half an hour before I saw anything but smoke, and in that interval I had gone to Mr. Illman's, and was backwards and forwards repeatedly, during which time I saw nothing of the prisoner. When I was over at Mr. Illman's, a person ran to say the fire had broken out again; I went to the premises, and saw fire issuing through two distinct places in the shop floor, close to the stair head, but five or eight feet below the place where I saw the first fire, for that was over the stair head, not inside it; I saw none inside the stair head - it was about a yard from it: I ran to assist at the engine, and in three minutes saw fire burst out through the shop window in Argyle-place, in every direction; the fire did not issue through the floor till half an hour after the fire on the top of the stair head was put out. The shop window frames were burnt out. Supposing the floor to be an inch board, about half or three quarters of it was burnt on the upper surface; the flame having come through the two holes. I saw the wooden ceiling of the shop on fire - the shop walls are partly wainscoated; the other part was only whitewashed, with shelves against it. The wainscoat extended to the ceiling; it was burnt inside, but not through. The kitchen stair-case was burnt, and nearly all of it fell in.</p>
               <p>Q. In January last had you any dispute with the prisoner - A. In November preceding I had; he has been in the house three years; we both went into the premises together, and in November 1823, we took our lease, and a day or two after we had signed the lease, the prisoner knocked at my door about eight o'clock in the evening, and demanded to see me; I heard violent language, and went down, and in consequence of what the servant said, I went to Mr. Thompson, next door, and went with him to the prisoner, and told him that his conduct was improper<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020004"></xptr>- his wife pulled him in doors, and I saw no more of him. I saw him next morning, and told him his conduct was improper in making a disturbance at my door, and I hoped he was sensible of his error - he said he was not, and I made a complaint at Marlborough-street; a warrant was issued against him. I went to his shop with the officers two or three times, but could not find him; he afterwards confessed his error, and I declined proceeding. I have seen his wife dressed in a brown bombazeen gown, but never in silk; her dress was plain, and consistent. I think I could even define her dress, for she was so particular in wearing three gowns - I scarcely ever saw her in any others. I saw her daily, and must have observed if she had frequently worn silk. The prisoner <rs id="t18241202-1-deflabel4" type="occupation">dealt in wood, oysters, fruit, and green grocery</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18241202-1-defend84 t18241202-1-deflabel4"></join>, and was in a small way of business.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What is your business - A. A wine merchant. I ship to various parts. My stock on the premises is worth about 20,000 l. I do not call the prisoner a fruiterer - he is more of a green grocer; he served some very respectable families, and I have heard him mention a nobleman who dealt with him; I saw his wife when she was in her business, and have seen her on Sundays, but not when she went out. He paid 52 l. a year for his premises; I had not received his rent. I awoke my family before I walked over the drawing-room floor. The first fire I perceived was over the stair head; there is a press bed under the same stair head, and under the stair case is a closet; whether the fire which came through the floor came from that closet I cannot say. There were bundles of fire wood over the stair head - I saw smoke issue from there, and a little fire. After the second fire was out the prisoner came and stooped down by my side, as I was looking down into the kitchen.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. James's. On Sunday night, the 31st of October, I was at my station opposite to the prisoner's house; he came to me about ten o'clock, and said, "Watchman, it is a wet and cold evening, here is sixpence for you, go and get yourself a glass of stiff grog;" he had at times given me 3 d. for calling him, but never gave me money before for grog. I remained on my beat, and as I was calling two o'clock, in passing his shop and parlour window, I heard their child crying, in the parlour where they sleep, and on my return, between two and half-past, I heard somebody speaking very loud in the parlour. I went into my box at a quarter to three o'clock, and in two or three minutes heard their parlour shutters falling on the pavement - I went over, and saw the prisoner, his wife, and his daughter, Mary, standing inside the parlour window - his wife screamed, and said, "Watchman, for God's sake - there must be fire somewhere, for we are almost suffocated." I put my head towards the window, and saw a glimmering light, apparently by the bed side; Mrs. Haley said it was a rush light, and I believe it was so, but I could hardly perceive for the smoke. At that instant an infant in its night gown was put into my arms; I stepped into the middle of the street, and did not see Mr. and Mrs. Haley come out. Four or five watchman had collected on hearing the shutters fall. I went for the engine, and sprang my rattle; three engines came. The alarm ceased, and some of the neighbours went to their beds, and in half an hour there was another alarm. I saw the flames burst from the shop window - it was soon extinguished.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He had given you money several times before - A. Yes, 3 d. at a time, for calling him. Six penny worth of grog would not make me tipsy - I did not get it; if I had gone for it, it would not have kept me off my beat two minutes. The first alarm I heard was from the prisoner and his wife; I did not see either of them after they gave me the child; his wife was not dressed: he was in his shirt, and I think had drawers on.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. There were several watchmen there who could have got into the room - A. Yes, my Lord. No fire had broken out then: it was not discovered for full ten minutes after the shutters were forced down. I believe some firemen were there before the fire was discovered.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was at the corner of Marlborough-street and Argyle-place, about a quarter to three o'clock, with Fowles, another watchman, and perceived a smell of smoke or wood burning; we went to Argyle-place, and before we got to the house we heard the shutters fall, and on arriving opposite to the prisoner's window, in Argyle-place, I saw smoke coming through the shop door, and up the area grating; I gave an alarm, and perceived the prisoner getting out at the window, in his night cap and shirt; I saw his wife and child standing in the room, behind him. I ran for an engine, and on returning attempted to break open the shop door, but could not: I assisted the fireman in taking the shutters down; the door was opened from within by somebody, but the smoke being so strong the fireman could not go in; he went in once or twice: the smoke abated, and I followed him in again, and saw fire at the top of the frame work, over the stair-case - I assisted in putting it out, and found that it was fire wood, and apparently old fruit baskets had been burning. I still perceived smoke, which appeared to originate from below, and about half an hour after I saw fire coming from below - the engines came and extinguished it. I saw the prisoner there - he appeared distressed. I did not see him take any part in putting it out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him when the fire over the stair head was being put out - A. He was at the shop door; he had drawers and shoes on. The first fire was easily put out. Several people and firemen were present. The shutters could not be got down without the inside pins being unfastened. I saw the prisoner in the shop eight or ten minutes after I entered the shop, and I saw his family in Sharrow's box; they only had a few clothes just slipped on.</p>

            . I belong to the London Union Insurance Office. On this morning, about three o'clock, in consequence of an alarm I went to these premises; I saw smoke coming out of the crack of the door, and the shutters; I was going to break the door open, but the prisoner opened it - he had a lighted candle or rush light in his hand; I think it was a candle; he was in his shirt and night cap, and I believe had drawers on. I could not go into the shop for the smoke and heat of the fire. I went to the window in Argyle-place, and broke it open with my pole-axe, to clear the room from smoke; I got into the shop, and unfastened the shutters of that window, inside, let out the smoke, and perceived fire on the top of the stair<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020005"></xptr>head - I raked down the fire wood and orange boxes, which were on fire, and extinguished it; it appeared to me that all the fire in the house was put out - I left the house safe, as I thought, and went to acquaint our foreman, as is usual. I did not examine the top of the stair head, to see if it was burnt through or not. I had not seen any smoke come from below. I was not there at the second fire. There was a bedstead in the stair head, an old quilt and a bed were on it, but there were neither sheets nor blankets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How much water put the first fire out? A. There were a dozen or two pails thrown on it. The fire would more than fill a bushel basket. The firemen had links in their hands, which make a smoke - there was a smoke when I left, but I thought it was from the links.</p>

            . I am engineer of the County Fire Office. I was informed of the fire and took an engine; I got there about three o'clock, and assisted in putting out the fire over the stair head; it was nearly out when I got there - about half an hour after that it was quite out. I attempted to go down stairs upon seeing a smoke. I tied my handkerchief over my nose and mouth, and went down three times before I could get to the bottom, in consequence of the smoke; two holes were cut in the floor to let it out. I then went down backwards and threw a pail of water at the cupboard door under the stairs, as I felt that the heat proceeded from that direction - I went up stairs; Westwood and I then crawled down with a link, and when we got to the cupboard door it was buttoned - I could not unbutton it. Page lowered us down a pole-axe, which I wrenched it open with, and a great body of fire rushed out with a great noise; it forced me backward, and as soon as I recovered myself I escaped up stairs, and the blaze followed us; it burnt about twenty minutes before it was put out.</p>
               <p>Q. Now being acquainted with fires what is your judgment - were these two separate fires, or did one communicate with the other? A. The stairs were between the two fires - there was no fire on the stairs; in my judgment they were two distinct fires. The fire in the cupboard must have been burning some minutes. I do not conceive that there could be any place, by which the fire below could communicate with that on the stair head, or I should have seen it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The stair-head, as you call it, is a sort of closet, inclosing the stairs from the shop? A. Yes; the top of it forms a shelf; the fire was on that shelf, and rather more over the shop than the kitchen closet. I cannot say whether the closet was wainscoated or bare walls.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could you judge what there was in the cupboard below? A. No, my Lord; there is no doubt but the fire had been in the cupboard for a considerable time; I cannot say how long. If it had been combustible materials it would very soon have burnt out. I could not turn the button of the door because it was so hot I could not hold it; but I think there must have been another fastening.</p>

            . I am a fireman of the Royal Exchange Assurance. I got to the premises before Smart, and saw the fire over the stair-head - it burnt quite through the back part of the wainscoat. I looked at the press-bed place - there was nothing in it but the bed, and that was on fire; there were no blankets or sheets; it did not appear that any one had slept there - it seemed shook up. I continued on the premises, and went down stairs with Smart, about half an hour after the first fire was put out. I cut the holes in the floor to let the smoke out.</p>
               <p>Q. When the ticking was on fire, was the fire being raked from the stair-head? A. Yes; the fire might have fallen off the stair-head on to the ticking. As far as my judgment goes, I think the fire on the stair head, and in the cupboard, were distinct fires.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The wainscoat at the back part, was burnt through - could, therefore, a spark drop down between the wainscoat and wall, into the kitchen cupboard? A. I do not conceive that it could, for the wainscoat is close to the wall; there was not above three or four inches of the wainscoat burnt through.</p>

I am engineer to the Royal Exchange Insurance office, and was present when the first fire was put out, and about twenty minutes after some of the skirting-board was taken away, by the bedstead, and we found an effusion of smoke issuing from the wainscoat. It appeared to me to be two distinct fires - there was a counter in the shop and some fixtures.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. There must have been fire behind the wainscoat, as the fire came from there? A. I conceive that it came from below. I did not go below. If part of the wainscoat was burnt through, fire might drop below, and set fire to any thing there.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, and was employed by Mr. Thompson to assist in building these premises. I have examined them since the fire; there is no hole through the stair-head enclosure; the wainscoat above it is nailed close to the wall. It is not possible for any thing to drop between them. I am not certain whether the wainscoat goes down further than the bulk of the stair-head. It is impossible for fire to fall from the top of the stair-head, or from the wainscoat, into the cupboard under the kitchen stairs; it must fall on the stairs before it could fall to the cupboard. I cannot conceive any means by which the two fires could have communicated.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you undertake to swear that it is impossible? A. I conceive it quite so. I made this examination on the 1st of November, by desire of Mr. Thompson. The stairs above the cupboard were not burnt - part of the shop floor was burnt, but whether it was burnt through I cannot tell, I will not say that there was no space through which fire might not fall.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you not say that the wainscoat above the stair head, was nailed to the partition - A. Yes; to the wall, between the two houses - I could perceive no space between them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the wainscoat nailed to the wall all along? A. Yes; my Lord, there are two nails in the space of four or five inches; wood is placed between the bricks, to nail it to. I have not examined the place where the hole was burnt, to see if there was any space - if there was, anything would fall on the stairs; the cupboard is only plaistered, and the plaister is all sound. If water had been poured down the place it would not have gone into the cupboard; the wharping of the wainscoat by the fire might have drawn the nails out.</p>

            . I live in Argyle place. The premises in question belong to me. Elrington and Dundee hold a lease under me. I built them myself; and examined them after the fire: it is very improbable that fire could have fallen from the hole which was burnt behind the wainscoat, into the kitchen cupboard; but it would be difficult to say that it is impossible. The basement is a nine-inch solid brick wall, but higher up there is a set off of two inches on each side; the wainscoat only extends to the floor of the shop; the staircase is lined with boards, to keep the plaister from being broken. The bottom of the kitchen cupboard is fourteen feet from the top of the stair-head; the cupboard is plaistered up to the stairs. I was called down one evening about the prisoner making a noise before Mr. Dundee's door, and told him it was extremely improper: he called him a swindler, or something of the kind, and complained of his taking the shop over his head.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On what day was the prisoner apprehended? A. I believe on the Thursday. I suppose the parties had not made up their minds that there was sufficient suspicion to take him before. The solicitor for the prosecution was out of town at the time of the fire.</p>

               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Had you any conversation with him, in which he said any thing of Mr. Dundee? A. Repeatedly. I have endeavoured to prevail upon him to give up the premises without litigation; he said, on one occasion, that if all his family went to the workhouse, he would spend every sixpence he had in contesting the point, and that he considered Mr. Dundee his greatest enemy, or a very great enemy. The last interview I had with him was on the 27th of October, when he tendered the money.</p>

            . I am an auctioneer, and was employed by Mr. Crombie to levy a distress on the prisoner's goods in July; my clerk made an inventory of them; I compared it with his goods on the Wednesday after the fire, when I was directed by the Insurance Company to assess the damages. I saw the prisoner, and asked if he would give me an inventory, to the best of his knowledge, of the goods which were destroyed; he said I was in possession of the inventory taken under the distress. I shewed it to him, and asked if it was correct; he said it was; I asked if he claimed any thing besides; he said, No; nor so much; for he had sold some of his furniture to carry on the lawsuit - (the replevin.) I asked why he sold his furniture when he had 95 l. in the house; he said that was part of the produce of the goods he had sold. The value of the furniture in its perfect state, without fixtures, is 20 l. I asked him for an inventory of the wearing apparel; he said he must go to his wife and get one, which he afterwards brought me; he said the wearing apparel was in the kitchen closet under the stairs, in a hair trunk, and had been consumed. I examined the closet particularly, and could find no remains of the trunk, or any ashes of such articles; there were the remains of a quantity of old stockings and shirts; one of the firemen took them out - they were in a very bad state from wear.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long after the fire was this interview? A. On Wednesday; he had delivered an inventory at the Office before. I think he could replace the furniture in the same state as before for 20 l. I think if there had been six silk gowns burnt there would be some traces of them - there was no trace of the trunk or any thing.</p>
               <p>A list of the wearing apparel given in by the prisoner, was here read: it consisted of common articles, except one silk gown, two poplin ones, and two of bombazeen, lace caps, and a cloth and silk pelisse; and stated that his daughter had lost about the same articles.</p>

            . I am engineer to the Beacon Insurance Office. I examined the closet on Monday morning, and found some shirts and stockings burnt half through; the feet were all worn out, and the shirts much worn at the back; they were about the centre of the cupboard. I found no remains of a hair trunk, nor any silk or woollen; there were ashes of stockings. I stripped down part of the wainscoat, where it was burnt, and could see no space for any thing to go behind. I cannot say that it is impossible.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You mean that you do not think it likely? A. No. There had been a great deal of water thrown into the house, and a great many people had been in. I saw the prisoner after the engine had done playing, and asked where his property lay; he said, "All in this closet," and that he had lost his pocket book from the small room; I could not find it. I asked where his policy<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020007"></xptr>was; he said, down in the hair trunk in this closet - I went there, and found it, with the remains of two account books, but no trunk. The floor of the closet was burnt quite through. I found the policy in a drawer of the counter. The cupboard runs under the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose the trunk to be in front, the rush of air would have caused it to burn more than what was under the stairs? A. I think there must be some remains of it.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Dundee and Co. In November, 1823, I remember the prisoner calling one evening and abusing Mr. Dundee very much - he d - d him, and said he was a scoundrel and villain - that he had been kicked out of a dozen regiments, for bad conduct, and that he would knock or kick his brains out if he met him.</p>
               <p>The following witnesses appeared for the prisoner.</p>

            . I am husband of the witness Priscilla Redman, and have known the prisoner ten or eleven years - his children were in the habit of coming to our house, and staying for a day or a week together. I had not spoken to him for the last twelve or eighteen months, but the children still came. On Saturday evening two of his children, John and Mary, came to go with me to Streatham Wells on the Sunday, but it turned out wet, and Tom came on Sunday afternoon, with Mary, his eldest daughter, to fetch them home; but they did not wish to go, and we desired them to stop, as it was wet - Mary left the children, as my wife said she would take them home on Monday. When I used to see the prisoner's wife she used to dress creditably. I think I saw her in a silk gown two or three years ago.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had any of his children slept there for sixteen months before - A. Yes, John slept there a month before. The children were always welcome.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's daughter, and am sixteen years old - I keep my father's books, and make out his bills; the bills are generally made out on Sunday evenings, to deliver on Monday. I sleep in the shop, and sometimes in the kitchen; some of the children sleep in the shop, and some in the kitchen. On the night in question I slept in the bed in the shop; nobody slept in the kitchen, as the children were at Mr. Redman's - I had gone to fetch them home that afternoon; my brother Thomas went with me, but it being wet Mrs. Redman said they had better stop, and she would bring them home next day. I got home between five and six o'clock, and was making out the bills in the kitchen. My father and mother went to bed between nine and ten o'clock, and left me up, making out the bills, and about half-past ten I put the bills and books into the closet under the stairs; I put them on one of the shelves - it has no fastening, but a wooden button; there was a large hair trunk in the closet, which had part of our wearing apparel, and 95 l. in Bank notes in it - I saw the notes in the trunk on the Saturday - several customers had paid large bills just before, in July and August, and some in September.

            , and several other respectable persons deal with us - their bills are 2 l. 3 l. and sometimes 4 l. a week; Mr. Coke's bills are 4 l. or 5 l., and sometimes 7 l. a week - they have fruits and vegetables which are out of season. My mother had a silk and a poplin gown, two bombazeen ones, a black silk and a cloth pelisse - a large silk and two cotton shawls, and some sheeting in the trunk. My father had a suit of black and blue clothes, shirts and stockings, in good condition. I was about as well clothed as my mother. I was awoke by a suffocating smell, which made me almost insensible; I could not tell the time. I felt round the shop, and pushed open the door where my father and mother slept; I fell down two steps, and screamed out: my father went and opened the shutters - the two little children were in bed with him; one is three years old, and the other between fourteen and fifteen months; my father called the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020008"></xptr>watchman; my mother handed the child to him - my father went out with the little boy - the children were in their night clothes. I was naked all but my shift - my mother had her night gown on; the watchman helped us out. I had perceived no fire, only the suffocating smell; we went into the watch box opposite; my father came over with us, then returned, and when the shutters were down I saw him inside the shop, running about. Mr. Jupp sent his son with clothes for us, and took us into his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in the closet besides what you have mentioned - A. My mother put some old rags and linen in as a store, in case the children had burns - it was in a basket under the stairs at the back of the closet; part of my father and mother's wearing apparel hung on pegs in the closet. Wood and old orange boxes were kept on the staircase enclosure; there were some sieves and bottles over my bed.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. What is the size of the cupboard - A. It is large and high, and runs under the stairs, and has two shelves; the hair trunk was a large one - it had a lock and handles at the end; our apparel was not put in separately; the money was in a red pocket book at one corner, at the bottom of it. On Friday, the 19th of November, I was in the kitchen and saw a bit of the hair trunk - it was the part near the handle - I picked it off the floor - my mother saw it. - I might be five or ten minutes before I could find the door of my father's room. I never said it was half an hour; the piece of the trunk was left in the kitchen. I did not know that the officers had been searching for the remains of the trunk; my father burnt a rushlight or candle that night; when I forget to fetch a rush we burn a candle; the 95 l. consisted of 5 l. and 10 l. notes. I had not counted them, but my father said there was 95 l.; there is glass to the door of my father's room, but I was too much flurried to notice the light.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was your mother's silk gown new or old - A. New; the poplin gown was nearly new, and both the bombazeens, and the black silk pelisse was nearly new; she had bought the silk gown five or six months before, and the poplin twelve months, but did not wear them much; she bought the silk in Titchfield-street, and the silk shawl at Mr. Brown's, in Parliament-street. I had a silk gown, a poplin, and three bombazeen gowns; we had a chest of drawers, but they were sold six or seven months ago; we sold a mahogany bedstead and table and other things at the same time, as our bills did not come in fast enough, and my father wanted a great deal of ready money - we had two hair trunks, one was in the parlour.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Butler, chemist, Regent-street. I sleep opposite to the house occupied by the prisoner. On the night of the fire, I was awoke about half-past two o'clock by the shutters falling. I looked out of the window, and saw the watchman taking a child out of the prisoner's house - he sprang his rattle, and I sprang one twice; the family got out of the window before I was dressed. I came down, went over, and saw nothing coming out but smoke; the shop windows were unloosed from inside; I do not know by whom.</p>

            . I am a hatter, and live in Regent-street. I was present at the fire. I did not see the prisoner till he was in the watch-box; my son took the family some clothing, and brought them to my house; the prisoner came in a few minutes after, and staid there most of the time after the fire was put out, but I was so flurried, I do not know what he did - the family were nearly naked; he had his great coat on part of the evening, but whether at first I cannot say.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Did his wife dress consistent with her station - A. Yes; plain and neat. I have seen her in a brown gown, whether silk or stuff I cannot say. I never saw her on a Sunday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet maker, and live at Oliver Road, Leyton—on Friday, 30th July, between 1 and 2 o'clock, I was called up by the police—I found my house had been entered by the parlour window, by lifting up the sash—I missed certain articles, to the value of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which were all safe the night before—there were four table covers, two decanters, one containing rum, and the other port, an umbrella, some linen, and some silver—the constable has got them—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them—I saw that the constable, Armstrong, was bleeding at the side of the head.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman N R</hi> 75). On Friday morning, 30th July, about 1 o'clock, I was on duty in the Oliver Road, Leyton, and saw the three prisoners coming out of the prosecutor's parlour window—I was within about two yards and a half of them—there was a high iron fence between me and them, and the gate was locked—it was quite light enough for me to distinguish them; I had got my lamp, and the moon was shining—I swear positively to the prisoners—I had hold of Smith afterwards—I can't be mistaken about it—when they got to of the window, they threw a bundle over the side wall of the garden, and jumped over the wall after it—I went round into Wilmot Road, and met them—I saw them all three together, getting over the garden wall into the Wilmot Road—they ran away—I followed, and caught hold of Smith, who goes by the name of White—the other two then turned back, and assaulted me with either a brick or a stone, on the head—they made my head bleed—they rescued Smith out of my custody, and all got away—I afterwards apprehended Smith and Jones at Barnet in the Bell, beer-shop, on Sunday, 1st August—after they got away I went back to Mr. George's premises, and called him up, and found this bundle in the garden, where I had seen the prisoners throw it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Smith. Q.</hi> When you came into the beer-shop, at Barnet, why did you not take me at once? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went to the door to let the Barnet policeman know that you were there—J was not in and out three different times—I identified you at once, find Jones was thereat the same time—I told you the charge when I got you outside—Barnet is about fourteen miles from Leyton—you had on the same clothes you have now, to all appearances—you told me you were at Barnet on the Thursday night, at the Star coffee-house—I went there, and found it was false—I am sure you did not say Friday night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">James. Q.</hi> If you were sure I was one of the men, what made you fetch the master of the house, and ask which was the other man that came in with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not; there was a young man there who lived at Barnet, who I told not to leave, when he wanted to go out—that was not because I had any doubt about him—I told him afterwards that he could go—I did not ask you where you slept on Thursday night—you said you slept there on the Thursday night.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Edwards.

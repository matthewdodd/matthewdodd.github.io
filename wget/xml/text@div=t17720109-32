A neighbour informed me that they had purchased four pieces of brass, which they thought were mine. When I inspected them I thought they belonged to me. I took them home and examined them with the pattern, I had more reason then to believe that they belonged to me. I did not at that time know who sold them, but I desired them if the person should offer more goods of that sort to stop him. I was informed in December, that there were more goods offered by a woman, who represented herself to be this man's wife, upon which I took up the prisoner; he at first<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177201090021"></xptr> denied it; afterwards he owned before his master, that he had taken the four pieces of brass out of the warehouse that was even with a garret, where he had been mending a floor. There was a large quantity of these sort of pieces lay in this warehouse; they are sockets for warming pans. He said before my lord-mayor, that he found them under the floor in the garret, and looked upon them to be his perquisites.</p>

               <p>Q. A check linen apron? - One shilling.(Deposes to them)</p>
               <p>Prisoner Blake. Last Monday evening I went for the man that I work for, at Shadwell, to buy some leather, and I met this gentlewoman (Grub) at my return, and she called me in, and asked me if I would drink something? and I went in, and afterwards she took me to a night house; we staid there till the next morning, and so in the morning I had no money, and I went and laid down one of my cotton shirts (I am a sailor and shoe-maker by business) and we went and had some liquor, and she told me that her husband had bought her a deal of clothes and chairs, and she would not stay with him, that they were at Mrs. Black's, and she would pay me for taking them away; and she told me to bring them up to Mrs. Cann's house, where I left the box; and I opened the box immediately; and in the morning there was sixpence owing, and I left one of the spoons with this young woman's father, for sixpence till I returned; the watch I kept in my pocket, and two spoons, and then I went immediately near to this Mrs. Black's, not knowing they were her property, and they took me, and I immediately told where the bundle was, and immediately gave up the key.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Grub. I know nothing about his taking the box; he used to come there and ill use me; have formerly lived with him, and I left my husband; I told him that I would not live with him any longer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cann. This young man sent for me out of the public house, and de<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280073"></xptr>sired me to go of an errand for him to pawn two spoons, which I did, and he asked me for the key of the door; I gave it him accordingly, and he went up stairs and left a bundle of things, and I did not know any thing of it, till the officer came and searched my room.</p>
               <p>Court to Haynes. The publican's daughter has told us about a box that was taken from the house, was that so? - Yes, it was empty, and it has never been out of my custody since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the detective officers of the City police—on 9th August, about twenty minutes to two, I was in company with Legg, another officer, in plain clothes, in Bow Lane, and noticed the prisoner with this parcel on his shoulder—I stopped him and said, "Halloo, Ryan, I need not tell you who I am; what have you here?"—he said, "All right, Mr. Smith, I have some paper; you know I am in the paper-hanging trade"—I said, "Where did you get it from?"—he said, "From home"—I said, "Where is the receipt?"—he said, "I dare say you will</p>

               <p>find it on the file at home"—I said, "Where are going to take it to?"—he said, "I am going by the boat to Woolwich"—I said, "Don't have a laugh at me if I let you go this time," or words to that effect; "I will give you the benefit of the doubt"—we allowed him to pass, but watched him—he did not go in the direction of the pier from which the boats start, he went in the direction of Cheapside—we followed and stopped him a second time—I said, "This is not the way to Woolwich: where are you going to?"—he said, "To Woolwich"—I said, "What is the man's name?"—he said, "I don't know"—I said, "What is the name of the street?"—he said, "I don't know"—I said, "Then where are you going to?"—he said, "I am going home"—I said, "We shall take you to the station, as this is not satisfactory"—we took him to the station and charged him with the unlawful possession of the paper—Legg searched him in my presence, and found in his pocket this piece of paper, of the same pattern as the thirty pieces—we went to search the prisoner's house, it is a leaving shop in Golden Lane—articles of wearing apparel were hanging about, but no paper-hangings, or any receipts relating to any—we traced the paper-hangings to the prosecutor, and their managing man identified them—I know a man named Hooper, and have tried to apprehend him, but he has absconded.</p>

I am a jobbing porter, and live in Crown Court, Bell Alley, Goswell Street—I stand at the corner of Bow Lane, Cannon Street—I know the prisoner by sight—during the last two or three months I have seen him frequently in the neighbourhood; he has got a little girl that he was bringing up in the same line—I know pretty well all the persons employed at Messrs. Potter's, I know Hooper—I have frequently seen him and the prisoner drinking together during the last two or three months—I have seen the little girl at those times while the prisoner has been round the corner, and he has been at the warehouse making signs for Hooper to come out—on 9th August I saw the prisoner outside the Skinners' Arms at the corner of Bow Lane, and the girl with him—I went in to the Skinners' Arms at one o'clock to have my dinner, and was there till about twenty minutes to two—the prisoner and Hooper were in the other compartment drinking together—I did not see them leave, but when I came out I saw the officers and the prisoner going down the lane towards the station with the parcel—after the prisoner had gone to the station the little girl came down crying, she went into Mr. Potter's and fetched Hooper out; Hooper stood at the corner of Aldermary Churchyard, the child went towards the police-station—Hooper waited till the officers came out of the station, and then he and the child went away; they were gone about an hour—they came back about three o'clock—Hooper strolled about and at last went into the warehouse, and I saw no more of him.</p>

On the 31st of August, between the hours of seven and eight in the evening, I perceived a pane of glass broke in my window, and I see a boy's hand taking something out; it was whole just before: I immediately ran out, and the prisoner was going away from the window; I ran after him and took him the corner of Thames-street, and brought him back into a back room that I had at the back of my shop; in this room there was a fire place; he stood with his back to the fire place; I examined him and found nothing on him. I perceived that he put his hands behind him while I was searching him; I looked behind him, and on the side of the Bath stove that was there, there was the buckle that I perceived him take out of my window. This is the fellow to the same that I lost, that remained in the window; the fellow I missed out of the window.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160216"></xptr>Q. Are you sure that the pair was in the window just before? - I am sure of it. I should observe to your Worship, that the window was cracked in the course of the day, and I was afraid of losing some property out, and I watched it; there was no hole in it; the corner was cracked as if a pen knife was put in; I had the corner of the same window broke once before, and then I lost three or four pair.</p>

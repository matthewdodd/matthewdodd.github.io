                  </hi>. I was a clerk, but am now unemployed—I live at No. 3, Sergeant's Inn—on Tuesday evening, April 24th, I dined with a friend at the Carlton Club—I left about 10.30 the worse for liquor, and went to the Alhambra Palace, in the promenade; I felt much worse and became giddy and sick—whilst in this condition the prisoner came and spoke to me—I do not remember what he said—he took my arm to help me out and walked with me to Leicester Square; eventually I found myself in my chambers; I went to bed—I do not recollect anything further that night—I know I did not take anything at the Alhambra—in the morning, about 8 o'clock, I awoke and found the prisoner in bed with me—I expressed my surprise—he asked if I did not remember the state I was in the previous night when he brought me home—I said I did remember it, but had forgotten that he was with me still—he said as he was very tired and had come home with me he thought I would not mind his staying, and as he found it cold in the other room, he got into my bed; I expressed my wonder that he had not used another bed which was there, but do not recollect his reply—he said he suffered from rheumatism, and he was so tired the previous night he did not want to walk to Islington—I went into the next room and dressed—I returned and found the prisoner dressed—after my laundress had been and we had had breakfast, the prisoner said in the sitting—room he did not admire my old china, he liked modern china best—in the conversa<lb></lb>tion he told me he sold goods on commission in the City, and that he would have to go to business that day—I said I had an engagement and wished to leave and prepared to go—he stopped me and said he had a favour to ask of me; he was hard up, would I lend him some money—I said I was sorry I had no money, and was not in the habit of lending it—he said that was all nonsense, I must give him some, he intended to have some before he left the room—I said that what I told him was true, besides I did not see that he had a particular claim upon me—he then used violent language and said if I did not give him some money at once, he would smash me and the place up—I had valuable things about and knew he could do considerable damage, and I made some excuse to try to go out—I said I wanted to send a telegram—that was to bring a friend to nay assistance or to get the money for the prisoner—he said I should not leave the place until I had given him money—I then asked him to go—he said he would not unless he had money or the equivalent of it, and that I had better not <hi rend="italic">angry</hi> him—I was alarmed and went towards the window—he pushed me towards the chair and told me to sit down—he then proceeded to examine the drawers in the sitting-room, as he said, to see if he could find a letter or anything he could make use of—he then led me by my arm into the bed—room and examined ray boxes, compelling me to hand him my keys—finding nothing there he took me back to the sitting-room and asked for something to drink—he said his patience was exhausted—I gave him what liquor I had which made him more violent and he re<lb></lb>peatedly threatened me with violence, especially when I got up or made any motion towards going out—he took a watch from the mantelpiece and said it was not worth 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he told me he was a discharged soldier and that he was desperate, that he did not care as he had nothing to loose if he got seven years, and that he was determined to make a haul this time as he had bee a tricked before—he asked for something to eat—I had only sardines in</p>

               <p>the place, which he ate up in a minute—he said a gentleman had once given him a cheque and afterwards stopped payment at the bank; and on another occasion a gentleman had gone with him and given him the slip, but he did not mean to be tricked again—it was getting near to 3 o'clock in the afternoon when he said he would take my clothes if he could get nothing else, that it was a wretched place and there was nothing in it—then he led mo about and in and out of my bed—room and took what was useful to him—he tried on my Ulster coat and then said I was a miserable little wretch; and that if it was any size he would have worn it—he then took my great coat—I employed him not to do so, as the weather was so cold—he said he did not care, he was sure to redeem them—I said if he would give me the things back I would redeem them and asked him how much he wanted—he said he would take 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I remonstrated with him—he said if I said another word he would make it 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and that I ought to consider myself lucky to get off so cheaply—I said I was a poor man and he ought not to treat me in that way—he then selected a suit of light clothes, two overcoats, and other articles—passing from the bed—room to the sitting—room he saw a carriage clock and asked what it was worth—I said it was not mine and if he took it I should get into trouble—he then told me to write a letter—I refused—he seized me by my coat collar and made me sit in a chair and said that I should have to write—at his dictation I wrote this letter:" Dear Charles, I send you this clock which you may pawn, but please do not part with the ticket"—he then saw an opera glass, which he put into my great coat pocket—he searched about for letters, and when he was going out I tried to put on my boots but he again forced me into a chair—he would not let me go out—I asked him for his name and address so that I might send for my things—he said he would return the next morning and I was to be there to meet him—I begged him not to pawn my things, and he said he would not but would keep them as security for the money which I was to give him the next day—he then left—I afterwards consulted my friend Mr. Peile, a clergyman, and he came next day about 10.30—the prisoner came again about 11.45—I said "Why, you have come"—he said "Of course I have"—I asked where my things were—he told me he had left them at a house—I asked him if it was far from there—"he said about a quarter of an hour's walk—I then asked if he had pawned them—he said he had not—Mr. Peile then sent for a constable, who came and took the prisoner into custody, and I went before the Magistrate the same day and gave in substance the same evidence I have given to—day—the prisoner then asked me about the window, he did not accuse me of misconduct—the case was remanded till the next day for the attendance of the pawnbrokers, when my evidence was read over to me—the prisoner did not ask me anything, but he made a statement that I had made indecent overtures to him—that statement was false—it is false that 1 unbuttoned my trousers.</p>

You told me you were a discharged soldier when you said you were desperate—I do not know the hour—my chambers look out into a court—many people pass—I was in such a state of nervous prostration that I could not follow you out, and I thought it best to take advice—you began to take my things about 3 o'clock—the letter you compelled me to write referred only to the clock—I promised to give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. because you threatened me—I do not know why you did not take my things the night before when I was drunk—I expected you back next day—I said I should see a friend in the mean time—a relation of mine,</p>

Mr. Roberts was a gentleman of birth and education and enlisted in the Blues—Gardner was my personal friend and a gentleman of good social standing—my friends make me an allowance to live on, but I was hard up and so pawned my dress suit, and those are the tickets the prisoner found in my drawer.</p>

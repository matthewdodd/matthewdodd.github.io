                  </hi>. I am an oil and seed broker, and live at Mardon Villas, Ashley Road, Hornsey Rise—the prisoner was my housekeeper for eight months—she was under notice to leave on 11th September—between 9 and 10 that morning my wife asked her why she had not gone; she said she did not intend to go, and uttered some threat, that her doom was sealed if she was turned away, or something to that effect—I said to her "You must go, you ought not to speak to my wife in that way, I will give you five minutes to consider whether you will go peaceably or not"—this was in the garden—she went in doors, through the kitchen, and in less than ten minutes there was a ringing at the door bell and the servants next door said the house was on fire—I rushed into the house and up stairs to my bed<lb></lb>room—the window was open and smoke rushing out; there was so much smoke that I could not enter for a minute or two—the wardrobe in the bed<lb></lb>room was burning; there were clothes in it belonging to my wife and children—there was no fire in that room and had not been since we had been in the house—there were no persons in the house but my wife, my children, and the prisoner—I got some water, and with great difficulty suc<lb></lb>ceeded in putting out the fire—I then searched the house everywhere for the prisoner, and she was gone—about 7 o'clock in the evening she returned in a cab—she said she had come to see what mischief she had done, and to say good bye—I said "You old wretch, you ought to be ashamed of yourself, I will give you in charge at once," which I did—on examining the house there was a strong smell of gas, and I found the whole of the gas burners in the drawing-room turned fully on, and also in the bed-room, which was on fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He has often given me bottles of gin. It was through drink, from beginning to end—that was the cause of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. She was intoxicated the day before—I have occasionally given her a bottle of gin and a little port wine, as she complained of being dull</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186809210092"></xptr>
               <p>and lonely—I was very seldom at home—she was not intoxicated on this morning; but the previous day, when we came home we could not get in—I had to break in, and I found her in bed and under the influence of drink—when she came back in the cab she appeared in drink.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He gave me notice, and I said I would not go. Mrs. Rough has always been very kind. When she said I should go I felt vexed, and drank some more. I had no intention. I went up stairs to put up my clothes and it struck me at the moment to set fire to the wardrobe, and I did so, and then I went and got some laudanum to finish myself, but it did not take effect.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector Y</hi>). On the evening of 11th Sep<lb></lb>tember, the prisoner was brought to the Highgate Station, charged with setting fire to Mr. Rough's house—I read the charge to her—she said, "It is all right, I did it through mischief"—the female searcher, in her presence, gave me two bottles, which she said she had found upon her, and a small mug—I smelt them—they had contained laudanum—I asked the prisoner what they contained—she said, "What I have been drinking"—I said, "It is laudanum"—she made no answer—one of the bottles contained pure opium—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I afterwards went to the prosecutor's house—I examined the wardrobe, it was burnt, and the ceiling was scorched—in the pri<lb></lb>soner's bedroom I found a bottle that had evidently contained laudanum.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and live at No. 2, Prince of Wales Road, Kentish Town—I have known the prisoner about 14 years—when she is calm and kindly treated she is a most devoted and faithful person, thoroughly upright and honest, and strongly attached to those who are kind to her—I have heard her speak of Mr. and Mrs. Rough in most exalted terms; but when she is irritated she is so very much excited that she is scarcely responsible for what she does—she has made attempts upon her life when under excitement; her strength being overtaxed, either mentally or bodily, will produce that excitement, but drink especially—she hasn't been given to drinking—she has told me that at one time she had a strong temptation that way, but that she battled against it in spite of her weak head, and weakly health—she has been an orphan from her childhood, and has been through many difficulties and infirmities, both of mind and body, always maintained herself respectably—she underwent many hardships as a child, and much rough usage, which I think injured her head—she had to go to service very young, and fell into very rough hands—I saw the case in the paper, and wrote to Mr. Rough, and came here, being strangely interested for her, on account of her friendless situation.</p>

I did not know she was there; she came and looked over my shoulder; and said, Lord, what piece is that? I had some five guinea pieces; I shewed her one; and bid her go and make the bed in the next room. Presently somebody knocked at the door; I ran down to let them in. I left my money in the bag, on a locker in the window, there was 40 l. of it. I had just told it. I came up again in a minute; I am sure I was not above. The prisoner was making the bed in the next room; when I came up, I put my money in the locker.</p>
               <p>Q. Is yours a lock-up-house for prisoners?</p>
               <p>J. Milbourn. It is. The prisoner was about going away, she would not do for me; she only staid a day or two till I could get another. After she was gone, she came again dress'd in gauze and a black apron, and other things, with a new gown; then I thought about my money; I looked in my bag and mist two guineas; and I mist a silk and linen handkerchief out of my drawers. I took her up, and heard her say she took two guineas out of the bag as it lay in the window. he said, she lost one of the handkerchiefs, and left the other at the place were she was gone to live.</p>

            . I live in Orchard-street, Westminster, I was at Mrs. Milbourn's house when the prisoner was brought back. I asked her, how she came to take two guineas? she cryed, and said, she did not. I said, you know you have done it, Betty; don't deny it. Then she said, Madam, I will tell you the truth, I really did take it. I asked her what she had done with the handkerchiefs; she said, left one at her place, and had lost the other.</p>

               <p>Mistress called me up stairs, and pulled out a piece of money, and bid me look at it; and asked me if I know what piece it was; I said I did not; she bid me feel the weight of it; and called me a stupid girl, because I did not know what it was. I never took none of the money.</p>

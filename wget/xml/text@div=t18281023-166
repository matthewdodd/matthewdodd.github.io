               <p>Cross-examined by MR. RYLAND. Q. Then the first intimation you had of it was from some lady? A. Yes; I saw the prisoner cross the street before me, and two other persons - I laid hold of him; I do not know where the handkerchief came from - after it was in my pocket I did not see it again till I was at the watch-house.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I was behind the prosecutor and his wife - three young men came between us, and I rather suspected they wanted to take something from them - I was particular in looking to see if the prosecutor's handkerchief hung out of his pocket, but it did not; they then went close up to the prosecutor - the prisoner held his coat up to the prosecutor's pocket, and another put his hand very near to his pocket; they then crossed the road to Britannia-row - I went and asked the prosecutor if he had lost any thing; he said Yes; I said I thought one of those men had got it.</p>

            . The prosecutor gave the prisoner to me to take care of - I did not see his hand any where at that time, but I held him by the collar on the left-side; he said, "Why do you hold me so tight?" I said I would hold him tighter if he did not go to the watch-house - he sat down at a door, and I saw one hand under his coat; I pulled him up with my two hands, and this handkerchief fell from his coat behind.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean it was in his pocket? Q. No - it was behind him under his coat; I put it into my pocket, and gave it to the officer.</p>

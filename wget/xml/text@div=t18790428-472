                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and reside at Randal Street, Hoxton—on 27th March, about 11 p.m., I was with a woman going to a brothel in Penton Grove—three men attacked me, and the woman ran away—I was suddenly knocked down, and recollected no more till a constable in plain clothes caught the prisoner in the act of robbing me—they took, from me my umbrella and my ring from my right hand, and between 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from my coat pocket—it was so suddenly done I could not recognise any one, and my felt hat was knocked over my eyes.</p>

A little after 11 p.m I was in Penton Grove—a woman ran past me, and immediately afterwards I heard cries of "Police! help!" and "Don't knock me down"—I ran out and saw Fenn on the ground and the prisoner leaning over him, apparently holding his shoulder—two other men ran away—I caught the prisoner—he was standing up—he said "All right, sir, I came round to make water, and I don't know anything of the other two"—Fenn said "I charge that man.; I have lost my signet ring, my umbrella, and some money; I do not know whether I have lost my watch"—he felt in his pocket, and had not lost it—I took the prisoner to the station; he was searched, and nothing was found on him belonging to Fenn.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I am in the doctor's hands with spinal disease, and my back is too bad to allow me to do anything. I have not strength enough to lift a pail of water, much less to knock a man down twice my own size I went up to the gentleman, and asked him what was the matter. I could not stoop, my back being so bad. Three men ran away, and a woman with them. I could have robbed him, but I would not. I have never had a day's imprisonment in my life. I stood by the gentleman to see that he was not knocked about.</p>

Since my return, I have been looking over some of my memorandums to see for the acknowledgment for the money paid by Mr. Robinson, of Croydon, but as yet I have not found it, if ever I had it; but I feel quite satisfied in my own mind that I paid it to you; but, nevertheless, as I cannot find it I will pay it again upon the condition that you will return the amount to me if ever I find it, for which, and the I O U's you hold of me, deducting five per cent. commission upon Mr. Robinson's account—I have drawn a bill at four months, which I shall be fully prepared to meet, as I shall have some money to receive by then independent of my business—hoping that this arrangement will meet with your approval, at the same time taking into consideration the immense losses I have sustained by the non-execution of my orders. Enclosed is Ashton's bill.

               <p>"18th Nov., 1845. Mr. Green,—Dear Sir,—Upon my return home lost night I received a letter from Mr. Divers, of Yarmouth, in reply to mine of the 11th instant, wherein I requested him to forward me a copy of my lot settlement with him, as I had an impression on my mind that I had not placed to his credit the last money paid to me; his reply to me confirms the supposition, and, I therefore shall feel much obliged by your forwarding to me per return of post the amount he paid to me, as he omitted to do so in his reply to my letter.</p>

               </p>
               <p>"Nov. 19th, 1845. Mr. Green,—Sir,—I fully purposed seeing you this morning, and to endeavour to finally settle with you, but unfortunately I was disappointed of receiving some money a friend promised to advance for me, so as to have nothing left between you and me. I wrote you last night, but I was in such an agitated state of mind that I actually closed it without mentioning anything about Divers' account. I, in July last, purchased a horse of Hockley, of Hull, for the sum of 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of which I paid in cash, and the remaining 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be settled upon my next journey. Not going there again, I have thought it best to put it together with the other account, and if you will oblige me with Divers' account of what I received of him, and allow me without any trouble to amicably settle with you, you may depend upon receiving the whole of what I owe you on Saturday, by either appointing some one here to receive the amounts, whatever they are, or I will either send it to you or bring it myself, upon the promise from you that I shall not be molested; and if there should happen to be anything else which I am not aware of, that there possibly can, and you must know of all by this time, as you have written to them, pray let me know of it, as I would, nay more, I have parted with almost every thing that I am worth, which is but little, but enough to settle with you, as merely the idea of being accused of embezzlement is quite biifficicnt to harrow up my feelings; and if you should</p>

               <p>feel disposed to take a harsh view of the case, first of all, Sir, pray consider my poor wife, who is daily expecting to be confined, and what is to become of her if anything should happen to me, and then my poor children, owing to the misfortune of their wretched parent, doomed to poverty and beggary—but, Sir, I cannot think that you could find it in your heart to act thus to me, considering at the same time that if my orders had been executed I should have been in a position quite different to what I am now; instead of begging of you to be lenient, and to receive the money due to you, I should have had 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket, and have been comfortable in the good esteem of yourself; but, Sir, it is not to be so, and you deferred building too long, and the consequence is, I am ruined to all intents and purposes; but let it be, I entreat of you, without a blemish on my character, so that I can by assiduity and perseverance again rise to comfort and respect<lb></lb>ability. I do not ask of you to take anything off either by comraissioa or any other means, neither do I ask of you to take a bill, or to give me time, but I merely ask of you to let me pay you, and at once, all I owe you, and if you do so, unmixed prosperity and plenty, with happiness, must be your lot. I cannot say anything more to you upon the subject, my spirits have quite failed me, and I feel quite undone, although I can appeal with a clear con<lb></lb>science to a higher tribunal than any earthly one, that I never intended to defraud you of a single shilling, and again, there is plenty to pay you with. I hope, Sir, the manner of my settling with you, and now giving up all, will be sufficient to convince you that I had no idea of owing either of the amounts save Mr. Hackney's, which I proposed going over to refund to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Langley Marsh. On Wednesday, 9th Nov., I had a sow in my field—I saw it safe between half past 9 and 10 o'clock that morning—I missed it between 3 and 4 o'clock—I made a search for it with a blood hound, but could not find it anywhere—I saw it the next day at Uxbridge, which is four or five miles from my place—it was my sow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of Mr. Goldney's labourers. On 9th Nov. I saw the sow in the field as I was going to dinner, about a quarter past 1 o'clock in the afternoon—I met the prisoners about five minutes afterwards—they were driving beasts about three hundred yards from Mr. Goldney's meadow, where the sow was—I missed the sow between 3 and 4 o'clock—I saw it again the next day at Uxbridge—it was Mr. Goldney's.</p>

From what the last witness told me, I went after the two prisoners—I overtook them driving some beasts along—I asked Bristow about the sow; he told me he knew nothing at all about it—I then asked Howe: he denied it at first, but afterwards said he had left it with a butcher—I took Bristow down Uxbridge to the New Inn—he said the sow was in the New Inn yard—I looked for it, but did not find it there—I found it in the pen in the pig market, at the Chequers—Bristow said it was the same sow—I showed it to Mr. Goldney—Bristow told me the sow came from Slough. <hi rend="italic">Bristow.</hi> I did not tell you so; I never was at Slough in my life.</p>
